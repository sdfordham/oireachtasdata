REFIT3 also provides incentives for co-firing of biomass in peat powered generation plants.  <\/p><p>  The scheme operates by guaranteeing a minimum price for renewable electricity generated and sent to the grid over a 15 year period.  The REFIT schemes are funded through the Public Service Obligation (PSO) levy which is paid for by all electricity consumers.  Separate to the above, public funding has been allocated to the wave and tidal energy sector in recent years.  This sector is still at the research and development phase and is not yet commercially viable.  However, Ireland has some of the best ocean energy resources in Europe.  Much work has been done across Government to identify the potential of this sector.  The Strategy for Renewable Energy, the Research Prioritisation Report and &lsquo;Harnessing our Ocean Wealth&rsquo;, the Government&rsquo;s integrated Marine Plan for Ireland, all identify Ireland&rsquo;s potential to become an international leader in research, development and innovation for ocean energy.   <\/p><p>  A range of supports have been deployed since 2009 in support of wave and tidal development.  The cumulative amount of expenditure on Ocean Energy in the period 2009 &ndash; 2013, including the estimated 2013 allocation, is almost 21 million euro. <\/p><p>  The Ocean Energy Development Unit in the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) has been taking forward the development of the sector through administration of a Prototype Development Fund of grants for industry, aimed at supporting industry led development and deployment of ocean energy devices and systems.  SEAI is currently holding a call for expressions of interest and applications for this fund. <\/p><p>  SEAI has been allocated funding by my Department to progress development of the grid connected wave test site &ndash; known as the Atlantic Marine Energy Test Site or AMETS &ndash; off County Mayo.

There is evidence that industry is investing beyond the targets to which they committed in the Plan with investments of up to &euro;1bn underway.  Some of the key developments in the short and medium term are as follows:<\/p><p>\teircom launched its next generation broadband services on 16th   May last, with speeds of up to 70Mbps, immediately available to over 300,000 premises.  By the end of this year, eircom aims to reach more than 600,000 homes and businesses.

A study published by the EU Commission in June last, based on data gathered in March 2012, compares marketed headline broadband speeds to the speeds experienced by users over cable, fibre and fixed lines in the EU 28, Iceland and Norway, found that the average download speed accessed in Ireland was above the EU average of 19.47 Mbps or 74% of marketed speeds.

In order to meet our overall 16% requirement, Ireland is committed to meeting 40% of electricity demand from renewable sources.<\/p><p>  Though these targets are challenging, I am confident that they can be met.  My Department's Strategy for Renewable Energy 2012 to 2020 sets out the key strategic goals for the various renewable energy sectors in the context of Ireland's EU obligations. <\/p><p>  In addition, under the Directive, Ireland was required to set out in a National Renewable Energy Action Plan (NREAP), the trajectory towards meeting its legally binding targets.  The NREAP and the First Progress Report on the NREAP, which are available on my Department's website, show the sectorial and technology breakdown that we anticipate in the achievement of our target.<\/p><p>To date, wind energy has been the largest driver of growth in renewable electricity, contributing most towards the achievement of the 2020 target. In 2012 15.5% of Ireland's electricity demand was met by wind generation.  By the end of quarter one<i><\/i>  2013, 1,763 MW (megawatts) of wind generation capacity was connected to the grid.  At the end of May this year, the total amount of renewable generation capacity connected to the grid was just over 2,000 MW. <\/p><p>  It is estimated that between 3,500 and 4,000 MW of renewable generation capacity will be required to allow Ireland meet its 40% renewable electricity target. There are a number of policy measures in place designed to incentivise the development necessary to meet Ireland's renewable energy obligations.  These policy measures, which take into account the long term nature of energy investments, are underpinned by an appropriate regulatory regime. <\/p><p>  The primary support mechanisms for renewable electricity are the Renewable Energy Feed-in Tariff (REFIT) schemes.  These schemes are designed to provide certainty to renewable electricity generators by providing them with a minimum floor price for each unit of electricity exported to the grid over a defined period.  Using a fixed feed in tariff mechanism, the certainty afforded by a guaranteed minimum price allows developers to access finance for renewable developments. <\/p><p>  Under REFIT 2 a total of 4,000 MW can be supported.  In order to ensure the necessary incentives are in place to encourage the level of investment required to maintain the rate of build of onshore wind necessary to meet our national target for renewable electricity, earlier this year I decided to amend the terms of REFIT 2 to extend the closing date for applications to 31 December 2015, with projects required to be built by the end of December 2017.  Support under REFIT 2 cannot exceed 15 years and will not extend beyond the end of December 2032.<\/p><p>  Under the Gate 3 grid connection process, grid connection offers have now issued to just under 4,000 MW of renewable generation, the bulk of which is wind. Under Gate 3 rules, generators must accept an offer within 50 business days of its receipt.  I understand that Gate 3 acceptances are scheduled to complete in October this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071700072#WRC00900","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Media Mergers","counter":49,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071700072#WRC00950"},{"type":"question","counter":50,"qnumday":26,"qnumall":"[35065\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071700072#WRC01000","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if he will provide an update on the planned introduction of legislation to deal with the issue of media ownership; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1052","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":51,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, responsibility for the control of merger and acquisitions, including those relating to the media in the State, lies with my colleague the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.

Scotland, Northern Ireland and Ireland have recently completed two major projects of regional significance, which were both supported by the EU INTERREG programme.  The first project, the BioMara project, examined the potential for energy from marine algae.  Final reports in respect of that project are in the process of being completed.<\/p><p>  The second project, ISLES,(Irish Scottish Links on Energy Study) was a feasibility study into how to optimally interconnect the Scottish, Northern Ireland and Irish electricity grid systems so as to facilitate the development of offshore marine renewable energy.  This was a wide-ranging study with technical, economic, environmental and regulatory workstreams and its reports have value and application right across Europe.<\/p><p>  At the recent Strategic Energy Technologies (SET) Plan conference held in May during the Irish Presidency of the Council of the EU, I made an announcement confirming that the administrations of Ireland, Northern Ireland and Scotland had decided that the collaborative process on the ISLES project would enter a further phase.

While significant efforts are underway to improve energy efficiency and increase renewable energy, Ireland remains dependent to a large degree on imported oil.  Oil comprised 59% of total final energy consumption in Ireland in 2011 and it is clear that oil will continue to play a pivotal role in the medium to longer term.  Security of oil supply is therefore of central importance to the Irish economy and society and ensuring a robust oil infrastructure on the island is an essential part of our security of energy supply strategy.<\/p><p>  Oil is either imported in the form of petroleum products or as crude oil. The crude that is imported into Ireland is refined in the Whitegate refinery.  The refinery supplies about a quarter of the petroleum products on the domestic market.  Some 75% of the Irish oil supplies are imported in final product form from neighbouring markets.<\/p><p>  The Whitegate refinery was in state ownership for some years and was operated by Irish National Petroleum Corporation (INPC) who sold the refinery together with the Bantry Terminal in 2001 to a private company known as Tosco Corporation.  Tosco subsequently sold on the refinery to Conoco Phillips and the day to day operation of the refinery and terminal is a matter for the current owners, Phillips 66.  Under the terms of the sale from INPC to Tosco, the refinery and terminal must continue to be operated until 2016.  This obligation applies also to Phillips 66 and any subsequent owners.<\/p><p>  Phillips 66 recently confirmed that it commenced a process to market the Whitegate refinery, the storage terminal and the associated business.  Phillips 66 has confirmed that it intends to continue operating the assets as usual during the marketing process which is expected to last for several months. My Department is maintaining close liaison with Phillips 66 in the context of the proposed disposal of the refinery. I can confirm that I attach importance to the availability of refining capacity in the State from a security of supply perspective. <\/p><p>  More generally, discussions on the oil refining sector in Europe have been ongoing at EU and IEA level. In light of ongoing rationalisations in the EU refining sector and the expiry of Whitegate&rsquo;s refining obligation in 2016, earlier this year the Government considered the strategic case for oil refining requirements on the island of Ireland.  To inform its deliberations, the Government considered a report I commissioned on this topic, as well as evolving IEA and EU work on the refining sector. I intend to publish this report shortly.<\/p><p>  This report, in addition to findings on refining, also includes important analysis and findings on the security of oil supplies on the island of Ireland.  In particular, the report demonstrates that the improved motorway network and the robust capacity at Irish ports has enhanced the resilience of the oil supply infrastructure in recent years. <\/p><p>  In relation to the National Oil Reserves Agency (NORA), I am pleased to say that it has made excellent progress in rebalancing Ireland&rsquo;s strategic oil stockholding. In 2008, only 46% of NORA&rsquo;s stocks were held in Ireland, with the remainder held abroad or in the form of stock tickets (short term contracts for delivery of oil in the event of an oil supply disruption.)  Since then, NORA has worked diligently to increase its access to storage on the island of Ireland and has opened three new strategic oil storage facilities in Antrim, Dublin and Kerry.  As a result, by April this year, NORA held 74% of its strategic oil stocks as physical stocks on the island of Ireland and had eliminated its dependence on stock tickets.  This has considerably enhanced Irish oil security.<\/p><p>  Under the terms of the original sale of the refinery and terminal by INPC to Tosco in 2001, two 15 year contracts with NORA were included as part of the sale - one of the contracts relates to delivery by the refinery over a 5 week period of a certain portion of refined product in the event of an oil supply disruption and the other relates to NORA maintaining a significant portion of Ireland&rsquo;s strategic oil reserves at the Bantry storage terminal.  The sale of the refinery by Tosco to Conoco Phillips and the subsequent transfer of ownership to Phillips 66 has not impacted on the holding by NORA of strategic oil stocks at the Whitegate and Bantry facilities and I do not foresee any immediate impacts arising from the current process. <\/p><p>  I will continue to liaise with Phillips 66 on the proposed sale of the refinery, storage terminal and associated business.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071700073#WRD00300","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Postcode System Establishment","counter":72,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071700073#WRD00350"},{"type":"question","counter":73,"qnumday":34,"qnumall":"[35021\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071700073#WRD00400","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the up to date position in relation to the introduction of postcodes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1083","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":74,"content":"<p>The procurement process to select a postcode management licence holder to implement a National Postcode System is currently underway.

The key to attracting such mobile investment is a facilitative regulatory regime and the availability of exploration data.<\/p><p>  In respect of mineral resources, the State's regulatory regime facilitates exploration and development through the grant of exclusive prospecting licences to permit the search for new commercial mineral deposits.<\/p><p>  Availability of exploration data, free of charge and on-line, using geographical information systems, also assists in attracting mineral exploration investment. <\/p><p>  There are currently 600 prospecting licences in operation.  In addition there are three main operating mines and one mine in closure mode.  Ireland has been successful in the past in bringing deposits into production and in 2012 exploration and mining in Ireland supported over 1,300 full-time equivalent jobs distributed across the regions. <\/p><p>  My Department has been working on a new Minerals Development Bill, to update and consolidate legislation for the sector from the 1940s through to the 1990s in order to provide a new legislative regulatory framework fit for the 21st Century. Subject to other legislative priorities, I hope to be able to publish this Bill in the near future.  <\/p><p>  As regards oil and gas, it is important that the State provides the right environment to encourage private exploration investment.<\/p><p>  This is achieved through a number of mechanisms, including:<\/p><p>  -offering attractive and innovative licensing opportunities, such as the 2011 Atlantic Margin licensing round;<\/p><p>  -providing a fit-for-purpose, transparent and robust regulatory regime;<\/p><p>  -deepening knowledge of our offshore petroleum potential, in particular through data acquisition and supporting key research projects and; <\/p><p>  -actively promoting the opportunity to invest in exploration in the Irish offshore, in particular to companies not currently active here. <\/p><p>  The job creation potential of a successful commercial oil or gas find in the Irish offshore is evidenced by the Corrib Gas field find. For example, over 1,000 people were employed at the height of the construction phase of the Corrib gas terminal, and even today the project continues to provide both direct and indirect local employment opportunities in North Mayo. A more active exploration and production industry would also encourage the development of a range of support services, in particular around key port facilities, thus facilitating employment creation in these areas and in the wider economy.<\/p><p>  In addition, through the Geological Survey of Ireland, I have recently established Geoscience Ireland.

This includes the following five priority measures: a commitment to review the National Fuel Scheme in the context of examining the feasibility of aligning income supports with the energy efficiency and income of the home, the phased introduction of minimal thermal efficiency standards for rental accommodation, ensuring greater access to energy efficiency measures, the introduction of an area based approach and reforming the eligibility criteria for energy efficiency schemes.<\/p><p>  Work is being progressed by a range of Departments and Agencies on the implementation of the actions contained in the strategy.  The Better Energy Warmer Homes programme is a pivotal element to the implementation of the Affordable Energy Strategy.  Exchequer funding has enabled the delivery of energy efficiency measures in 99,471 homes since 2000.  Despite the current economic challenges, the Government is committed to continuing to deliver energy efficiency measures to vulnerable households.  The Better Energy Warmer Homes scheme has been allocated Exchequer funding of &euro;21 million for 2013, which is expected to result in upgrades in nearly 12,000 homes.<\/p><p>  Reform of the eligibility criteria for the Warmer Homes Scheme to address households in extreme energy poverty, defined as those who spend over 20% of their disposable income on energy services, was undertaken in 2012.  Prior to this, applicants were considered eligible for the Scheme if they met defined criteria such as eligibility for the National Fuel Scheme. International research demonstrates that the elderly and pre-school children are most at risk.  Taking this on board the criteria were revised to include; Fuel Allowance recipients; Job Seeker Allowance recipients (for over six months and with children under 7 years of age) and; recipients of Family Income Support.<\/p><p>  The Fuel Allowance is funded by the Department of Social Protection and is a matter in the first instance for the Minister for Social Protection.<\/p><p>  An area-based approach to the mitigation of energy poverty was introduced in 2012 and Exchequer funding of over &euro;4.1 million was disbursed via this new model.  The project uptake was so successful that it was extended into 2013. <\/p><p>  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) is currently undertaking a pilot programme of delivering energy efficiency upgrades to local authority owned homes, where the tenants are experiencing energy poverty.  This is an innovative pilot allowing local authority tenants participate in the Better Energy Warmer Homes Scheme, for the first time.  The expected number of homes to be addressed under the pilot is approximately 50 over the coming months, in the Longford and South Dublin County Council areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071700074#WRE00500","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Broadband Services Speeds","counter":100,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071700074#WRE00550"},{"type":"question","counter":101,"qnumday":44,"qnumall":"[35029\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071700074#WRE00600","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the way he will ensure that every home has access to 30Mbps broadband access; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1066","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":102,"content":"<p>The Government's National Broadband Plan, which I published in August last, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed services of 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses, in advance of the EU's target date of 2020, and that significantly higher speeds are available to as many homes and businesses as possible.<\/p><p>  The Plan aims to deliver high speed broadband to all parts of Ireland through two principal means:<\/p><p>- by providing a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment, and <\/p><p>- by providing a State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.<\/p><p>  Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services, particularly in urban and semi-urban areas.  ComReg has put in place a new regulatory regime for fixed line Next Generation Access and for service bundles, both of which are designed to incentivise the rollout of services by service providers.  ComReg's multiband spectrum auction, completed in 2012, is also enabling the rollout of advanced mobile broadband services.<\/p><p>There is evidence that industry is investing beyond the targets to which they committed in   the Plan with investments of up to &euro;1bn underway.  Some of the key developments in the short and medium term are as follows:<\/p><p>-   eircom launched its next generation broadband services on 16th May last, with speeds of up to 70Mbps, immediately available to over 300,000 premises.  By the end of this year, eircom aims to reach more than 600,000 homes and businesses. It has a target to pass 1.2m premises by June 2015. <\/p><p>- UPC is continuing with its investment in the cable network, which should see 750,000 homes able to access services at data speeds of up to 150 Mbps <\/p><p>  by 2015.<\/p><p>- Other fixed operators also continue to invest in Local Loop Unbundling (LLU). BT Ireland now supplies broadband access to both Vodafone and Sky Ireland, and along with other operators, is also investing in fixed infrastructure.<\/p><p>- Mobile wireless operators are making plans for the rollout of 4G services later this year.  The operators are obliged, under the terms of the licences, t<\/p><p>   cover 70% of the population. <\/p><p>- ESB is currently considering the prospect of utilising its distribution network to roll out fibre broadband services.<\/p><p>  In tandem with these commercial developments, intensive work is underway in my Department to progress a State-led investment to secure the countrywide introduction of next generation broadband access.  The National Broadband Plan commits the Government to investing with the private sector to deliver high speed services to areas that are not commercially viable and where such services will not be provided by the market alone.<\/p><p>  In order to progress the State-led investment, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained.  My officials have commenced a comprehensive mapping exercise of the current and anticipated investment by the commercial sector to identify where the market is expected to succeed and fail in the delivery of high speed broadband services over the coming years.<\/p><p>  The results of this mapping exercise will inform the level of Government intervention that may be required and the areas that need to be targeted in the State-led investment as envisaged in the National Broadband Plan.<\/p><p>  Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations including stakeholder engagement will be ongoing throughout 2013 with a view to the launch of a procurement process in 2014.  <\/p><p>  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, I am committed to increasing the availability of next generation speeds significantly, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in a digitally enabled society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071700074#WRE00700","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Bioenergy Strategy Publication","counter":103,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071700074#WRE00750"},{"type":"question","counter":104,"qnumday":45,"qnumall":"[27976\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071700074#WRE00800","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"in relation to the progress of the National Bioenergy Strategy, the way his Department is integrating its efforts in preparing this strategy with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade; if he will describe the level of consultations between the Departments and the issues being discussed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1005","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":105,"content":"<p>My Department, along with the a number of other Departments and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI), is currently finalising a Bioenergy Strategy, which will be published in the next few months.

For the purposes of LPT, values for properties under &euro;1 million are organised into valuation bands, with a range of &euro;50,000 in each band.

In this regard, I am advised that Revenue will issue detailed guidelines later in the year setting out the procedures to be followed by those who consider that they have either over or under valued their property for LPT purposes, or inadvertently paid on foot of the Revenue estimate without making their own assessment.

Upon examining this information, it became clear that a large number of these pension recipients had not reported their pension income to the Revenue Commissioners even though they were advised to do so by DSP in the awards letter that the Department issues to all first-time pension recipients.   The priority for the Commissioners, in the first instance, was to ensure that the tax record was correct for 2012 onwards and thereafter to examine in detail the highest risk cases.  In the follow up projects, it was necessary to distinguish between those taxpayers who pay their tax through the PAYE system and who, as a matter of course, do not, and are not required to submit an annual tax return and self assessed tax payers who complete an annual return of income where they are specifically invited to include payments from the DSP.<\/p><p>  In relation to PAYE taxpayer, Revenue wrote to three separate tranches of PAYE taxpayers who had not returned details of their DSP pensions, that is, those with annual non-DSP income exceeding &euro;50,000, those with non-DSP incomes of between &euro;40,000 and &euro;50,000 and those with non-DSP incomes of &euro;30,000 to &euro;40,000.  In their correspondence, I am informed, Revenue gave the taxpayers the opportunity to complete a disclosure statement and pay the outstanding tax due within thirty days of the final liability being calculated without incurring interest or penalties. I am further informed that the vast majority of pension recipients contacted have met the necessary conditions, have settled their affairs and avoided having to pay any interest or penalties.  This project is nearing conclusion.<\/p><p>  The Commissioners also advise that a separate project commenced earlier this year to examine those cases in the self assessment system who had not returned details of their DSP pension on their annual return. This category would include self-employed taxpayers, company directors, persons with reasonable amount of non-PAYE income etc. Revenue has pre-populated the tax returns of these taxpayers from tax year 2011 onwards with details of their DSP payments to ensure that they are tax compliant in relation to these payments in the future.  In addition, they have written to the highest risk cases, providing them with an opportunity to advise Revenue of outstanding taxes on these payments in relevant prior years.<\/p><p>  The charging of interest and penalties on tax settlements in relation to these taxpayers is governed by the &#8220;Code of Practice for Revenue Audit&#8221;, which can be viewed on the Revenue website at <i><font color=\"#0000FF\">www.revenue.ie<\/font><\/i>.  For this project, the Commissioners decided that the lowest category of penalty - i.e. for an unprompted voluntary disclosure - would be appropriate for those cases who responded in a timely manner.<\/p><p>  The Commissioners also advise that since early 2012 they receive a weekly file of data from the DSP with details of new, amended and ceased DSP pension payments which they update to the relevant pension recipient's tax record.  However, it is important to point out that the onus remains on any individual who receives a new source of income to report it to Revenue or to include it in their annual tax return, as appropriate.<\/p><p>  Lastly, the Commissioners advise that if the Deputy has a query in relation to a particular taxpayer, he can contact the Revenue Commissioners with any such details.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071700076#WRG01200","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Excise Duties Yield","counter":160,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071700076#WRG01250"},{"type":"question","counter":161,"qnumday":69,"qnumall":"[35654\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071700076#WRG01300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will provide a breakdown of excise returns by category and by month from January 2011 to June 2013, inclusive, in tabular form.

","asker":"1182","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":171,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Budget 2014 will be announced in October of this year, some two months earlier than in previous years.  While all taxes and potential taxation options are constantly reviewed, it is a long-standing practice of the Minister for Finance not to comment specifically, in advance of the Budget, on any tax matters that might be the subject of Budget decisions.    A number of considerations would need to be taken into account, as regards the potential for imposition of a wealth tax, in the sense of an annual recurring tax on wealth.  Firstly, to estimate the potential revenue from a wealth tax, one would need to identify the wealth held by individuals, which is not possible from the data available at present.  <\/p><p>  I am informed by the Central Statistics Office that the CSO institutional sector accounts do not give an indication of the number of households or persons classified by the categories of wealth they hold.  These statistics are based on aggregate information collected from financial institutions and do not contain the demographic details which would enable such a breakdown of the statistics.  So while the CSO&rsquo;s Institutional Sector Accounts show that households held c. &euro;126 billion on deposit in 2010, this is not broken down by income or wealth categories.<\/p><p>  However, I understand that, following discussions between the Department of Public Enterprise and Reform, the CSO and the Central Bank, the CSO has commenced a &ldquo;Household Finance and Consumption Survey&rdquo;, which will collect information on household wealth.  The first results of this survey will be available in 2014.  The data to be collected by the CSO as part of its Household Finance and Consumption Survey is not being collected for the purposes of calculating the potential yield from a wealth tax but to collect general information on the financial situation and behaviour of households.<\/p><p>  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they have no statistical basis for compiling estimates in relation to a potential wealth tax.  Although an individual&rsquo;s assets and liabilities are declared in a limited number of specific circumstances - for example, after a death - Revenue states it is not in a position to link an individual&rsquo;s income to her\/his financial assets.  <\/p><p>  Secondly, asset values increase and decrease over time and in the context of recent economic circumstances, they may have declined considerably in many cases. Thus, if the value of an asset or of an individual&rsquo;s wealth is measured at a particular time there is no guarantee that the asset value or the individual&rsquo;s wealth will remain at that level or increase from that point.  This would make it difficult to predict the potential yield from a wealth tax and would have to be borne in mind in terms of its consistency as a source of revenue.<\/p><p>  Finally, Capital Gains Tax (CGT) and Capital Acquisitions Tax (CAT) are, in effect, taxes on wealth, in that they are levied on an individual or company on the disposal of an asset (CGT) or the acquisition of an asset through gift or inheritance (CAT).  However, they are not annual taxes on an individual&rsquo;s wealth.  The rate of both these taxes is currently 33%, which I increased from 30% in Budget 2013.  I also reduced the CAT group tax-free threshold for gifts and inheritances by 10%, following a number of reductions in recent years.  The introduction of a wealth tax could have a negative impact on receipts from CGT and CAT.<\/p><p>  In the context of taxes on wealth I will also refer to the introduction in Budget 2010 of the Domicile Levy.  The levy is currently charged on an individual who is Irish-domiciled whose world-wide income exceeds &euro;1m, whose Irish-located property is worth more than &euro;5m, and whose liability to Irish income tax was less than &euro;200,000.  The levy applies for the tax year 2010 and subsequent years.  It is payable on a self-assessment basis on or before 31 October in the year following the valuation date, which is 31 December of each year.  A total of 11 taxpayers paid the levy in 2011 (for the 2010 tax year) with a total yield of &euro;1.67 m, and a total of 10 persons paid the  Levy in 2012 for tax year 2011 and these persons paid a total of &euro;1.64 m.  In Budget 2012 I expanded the application of the Domicile Levy by removing the citizenship condition.  This will affect returns for 2012, which are due to be made in October 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071700076#WRG02000","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Yield","counter":173,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071700077#WRH00150"},{"type":"question","counter":174,"qnumday":73,"qnumall":"[35689\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071700077#WRH00200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the revenue that would be raised for the Exchequer if any of the following new rates were applied to the income earned in excess of &euro;100,000: 42%, 43%, 44%, 45%, 46%, 47%.","asker":"959","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":175,"content":"<p>It is assumed that the Deputy is referring to the introduction of a third rate of income tax of either 42%, 43%, 44%, 45%, 46% or 47 % to be applied on the portion of taxable incomes in excess of &euro;100,000 per annum. In addition, it is assumed that the threshold for the proposed new income tax rates mentioned by the Deputy would not alter the existing standard rate band structure applying to single and widowed persons, to lone parents and married couples. On that basis, I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the estimated full year yield to the Exchequer, estimated by reference to 2013 incomes, of the introduction of the new rates would be of the order of &euro;52 million, &euro;104 million, &euro;156 million, &euro;208 million &euro;260 million and  &euro;312 million respectively.

The GLH are agreed between the relevant awarding body and its regulatory body.

A general statement by an awarding body on the nature of GLH does not constitute a satisfactory rationale or endorsement of the proposed tuition hours.<\/p><p>  Furthermore, each EDI programme leads to a discrete and separate award, which is included at a separate level on the Qualifications and Credit Framework (QCF) in the UK, and as such is assessed independently on its own merits for inclusion in the Internationalisation Register.

","asker":"1091","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":286,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 108 to 113, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>The policy in regard to admission fees to National Monument and Heritage sites in State care which are managed by the Office of Public Works (OPW) is reflective of a number of factors, including the need on an ongoing basis to defray some of the running costs, the Government's policy of supporting the wider tourism economy and, in some certain cases, the relative popularity of the site in visitor numbers terms.<\/p><p>Admission charges to State run Heritage sites, where they apply, are generally set quite low relative to other private sector comparators and in approx 40% of OPW's attended (Guided) sites, there are no charges at all.   This reflects the Government's wish to encourage interest in our heritage from both domestic and foreign visitors and to seek to minimise the costs to both the general user and the organised Tour Operator sector of experiencing some of the best heritage sites in the country.<\/p><p>This approach is also designed to support the wider tourism and hospitality industry by encouraging visitor footfall in parts of the country that might not otherwise be in a position to draw such visitors.   In a small number of particular cases, admission fees are slightly higher, reflecting a need to control the level of visitors somewhat for conservation reasons and to ensure that the overall number is managed so as to remain consistent with the ability of fragile sites to cope sustainably with significant demand.<\/p><p>Notwithstanding this general policy, which has applied for some time, it is clear that in light of economic pressures on the Exchequer currently, and in particular having regard to the costs involved in maintaining visitor facilities at many of these sites, circumstances may dictate a relatively greater emphasis on cost recovery in the future.  However, no decisions have been taken at this time in relation to increasing admission charges at sites, in the interest of continuing to keep costs low to the domestic visitor and the foreign tourist alike.<\/p><p>There are a total of almost 1,000 individual National Monuments in State care at 768 locations around the country. These are managed and maintained by the OPW and include both sites which are in full State ownership and others which are privately-owned but where Guardianship arrangements exist and where the OPW provides maintenance services.<\/p><p>As a general policy, OPW facilitates visitor access to as many National Monument sites as possible. However, access is not always feasible because of a range of issues including physical location, risks associated with dangerous structures and restrictions imposed in some cases by landowners who may wish to limit access, either temporarily or more longer term, by reason of accident risk, livestock etc. OPW would estimate that approx 10% of the National Monument sites in its care are not accessible at any given time for various reasons.<\/p><p>As part of its remit, the OPW also provides enhanced visitor access, together with Guide facilities in some cases, at 70 of the more prominent visitor locations nationally.  These include many of the most iconic heritage sites in the country such as Kilmainham Gaol, the Rock of Cashel, Newgrange etc as well as a number of smaller, less well known properties.  Year round access with full Guide services is provided at 24. The remainder (ie 46 no.) are open with Guide services on a seasonal basis on varying dates and for different lengths of seasons generally between March and October.  Admission fees are currently charged at 41 out of the 70 guided sites.<\/p><p>The OPW is responsible for the physical care and maintenance of all National Monument sites in State using a direct labour force headquartered at 6 separate Works Depots spread nationally.   Works undertaken at National Monument sites fall into 2 broad categories:<\/p><p>-  Ongoing light maintenance and small works undertaken by OPW's own direct labour force using materials and supplies taken from general  stock on hands:<\/p><p>-  Significant larger conservation projects undertaken over a period of years which have supplies of materials specifically provided.<\/p><p>Financial records of expenditures in relation to the management of the National Monuments in State care, including ongoing maintenance works and other overheads such as vehicle fleet costs, consumables, caretaking and other inputs, are kept globally only at a Depot level and are not broken down by site location.  The cost of maintenance of the portfolio in the years in question is therefore not available but is subsumed into the overall costs of the OPW National Monuments Service.<\/p><p>The cost of maintaining a Guide Service (ie wage costs for the permanent and seasonal Guide workforce at each of the Guided site locations) for the year 2012 this was &euro;9.4m.  The figures for 2011 and 2010 are not available within the time frame as they have to be collated from a number of sources, but will be provided directly to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p><p>The revenue generated from visitor entrance fees and the respective numbers of visitors in the reference period was as follows:<\/p><p><table><tr><th>-<\/th><th>2010<\/th><th>2011<\/th><th>2012<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Admissions Income<\/td><td>&euro;6.1m<\/td><td>&euro;6.4m<\/td><td>&euro;6.7m<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Visitor Numbers (Guided sites only)<\/td><td>3.3m<\/td><td>3.5m<\/td><td>3.8m<\/td><\/tr><\/table><<\/p><p>(For clarity, it should be noted that some or parts of certain sites are also freely accessible without entering the Visitor Centre facilities concerned (eg Glendalough Monastic Site, Mellifont Abbey) where an admission charge might apply and the actual footfall may therefore be considerably greater, while various events\/exhibitions occur on sites from time to time which may also affect visitor numbers, so the overall tallies, though well sourced, must be qualified to some degree.)<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071700080#WRL01800","answer":true,"speaker":"958"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Pensions Legislation","counter":288,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071700081#WRM00075"},{"type":"question","counter":289,"qnumday":114,"qnumall":"[35769\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071700081#WRM00100","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"his views on correspondence (details supplied) regarding pensions; if he can offer any positive news for the person concerned; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

In total, these sector specific measures and Agreements will yield savings of almost &euro;230m.<\/p><p>In addition to the various productivity measures, the Agreement provides for further long-term and sustainable workplace reforms in a number of areas.  The Agreement will ensure that performance management systems will be put in place in areas where no system currently exists.  In addition, in areas where performance management is currently in place, these systems will be strengthened and managers will be held accountable for the performance and development of their staff.  The Agreement provides for more effective arrangements to support redeployment on a cross-sectoral and geographical basis.  This will enhance management's flexibility for the deployment of staff to areas of most need to ensure continued service delivery.<\/p><p>The Public Service will continue to be to the fore in pioneering flexible working arrangements which can contribute to the efficient and effective business performance as well as enabling staff to balance work\/life requirements.  However, the multitude of work sharing patterns currently in place can impact on the capacity of organisations to deliver services.  The Agreement will allow for the streamlining of these patterns and will ensure a minimum attendance of 50% for all future approved arrangements.  Significant progress has been made in restructuring the Public Service in recent years, particularly under the Public Service Agreement.  The Agreement will allow for the streamlining of the Public Service to make it a leaner and more efficient organisation.  All sectors will be required to bring forward proposals on ways to reduce management numbers and to rationalise grades.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071700081#WRM01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"question","counter":301,"qnumday":116,"qnumall":"[35778\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071700081#WRM01100","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the yearly saving to the Exchequer over the course of the Haddington Road agreement from the pension reductions.

These include in particular the Wage Subsidy Scheme, the Workplace Adaptation Grant and the Employee Retentions Grants Scheme as well as the Job Interview Interpreter Grant and the Personal Reader Grant.<\/p><p>  The Wage Susbidy Scheme offers a financial subsidy to employers in the private sector to encourage them to employ people with disabilities.   At end June 2013, there were some 1,246 beneficiaries of the scheme. Expenditure on the scheme amounted to some &euro;10.065 m. in 2011 and &euro;10.566m. in 2012. <\/p><p>  The Workplace Adaptation Grant scheme is designed to encourage the retention of an employee with a disability by providing funding, up to a current limit of &euro;6,350, towards the additional costs of adapting workplace equipment or the provision of equipment arising from the individual&rsquo;s disability.  Applications in excess of this sum can be considered on an individual basis up to a maximum of &euro;9,523 if specialist training for assistive technology is required.<\/p><p>  The Employee Retention Grant Scheme provides financial assistance to private sector employers to encourage them to retain employees who acquire an illness, condition or impairment which impacts on their ability to carry out their job.  It does so by providing funding to either identify accommodation and\/or training to enable the staff member to remain in his\/her current position, or to re-train the staff member so that he\/she can take up a different position within the organisation.  Maximum grants of up to &euro;15,000 are available under this scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071700083#WRO01900","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Community Employment Schemes Eligibility","counter":348,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071700084#WRP00150"},{"type":"question","counter":349,"qnumday":139,"qnumall":"[35629\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071700084#WRP00200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the steps a person has to take to be included in a community employment scheme; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1076","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":350,"content":"<p>A person interested in participating on a Community Employment Scheme should contact their local DSP Employment Services\/Intreo Office which is the sole access and referral point for entry onto Community Employment.

The Deputy will of course also be aware that Public Service Reform Plan is not solely focussed on monetary savings but also on creating efficiencies and streamlining services and structures.  In this context, my Department developed a comprehensive and practical approach to the implementation of the various Government Decisions in this area, which was endorsed by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. <\/p><p>  As part of that process, the Government has decided that the boards of the National Museum and National Library will be discontinued and, as board fees totalling over &euro;80,000 were paid out to members of these boards in 2012, direct recurring annual savings of that order will be made as a result. In addition, the current provision by my Department of shared corporate support services to the National Archives will be extended to the National Museum and National library. This will lead to significant savings on administration, as it will facilitate greater sharing of staff and expertise, as well as freeing up staff of the institutions for frontline and core services. Savings of approximately &euro;200,000 are expected to be achieved in staff costs, with a further &euro;350,000 in savings to be achieved through additional shared services.<\/p><p>  In relation to the Deputy's query as to whether the administrative costs of the proposals in relation to the intended abolition of the independent boards of the National Museum and National Gallery have ever been weighted in any cost benefit analysis, I trust the Deputy is referring to the National Library in his question rather than the National Gallery and must advise the Deputy again that the decision taken by Government in relation to the National Library and National Museum is not solely focussed on monetary savings but also on creating efficiencies and streamlining services and structures.

Relocation is unlikely to be required, or is likely to be small-scale, for another 16 raised bog special areas of conservation due, for example, to the small number that had been cutting turf on these sites during the relevant five year period and would qualify for the relocation option available under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme.<\/p><p>  Relocation is a very complex process, in terms of investigating suitable sites for turf quality and quantity, the infrastructure\/drainage works required, establishing the number who can be accommodated on the site, the cost and feasibility of land purchase or lease, and possible planning and Environmental Impact Assessment requirements.

The first is a legal agreement for qualifying turf cutters who are signing up to the annual payment of &euro;1,500, index-linked, for 15 years. The second is a relocation interim legal agreement for qualifying turf cutters who have expressed an interest in relocation but no relocation site is currently available for them to relocate to. This relocation interim legal agreement provides for the payment of &euro;1,500, index-linked, or a supply of 15 tonnes of cut turf per annum while these applicants are awaiting relocation to non-designated bogs. The third is a relocation final legal agreement. This agreement has been issued to qualifying turf cutters where a site has been assessed as suitable for relocation and is ready or can be made ready for use for domestic turf cutting. <\/p><p>  Turf cutters who sign and return the applicable legal agreement to my Department will also receive a once-off incentive payment of &euro;500. <\/p><p>  The interim legal agreement is required in the case of relocation sites because, for the majority of raised bog special areas of conservation, the relocation site and the terms and conditions applicable to those sites will take time to finalise. Turf cutters are being asked to sign the interim agreement on the understanding that when a relocation site is sourced, assessed and agreed they will be asked to sign a final legal agreement at that time. If it is not possible to find a suitable relocation site, for example, for reasons of quality or quantity of turf, planning requirements, or issues in relation to the purchase or lease of a site, then the Department will consult with turf cutters as to the best option to take at that time.  <\/p><p>  For the avoidance of all doubt, it is the absolute aim of my Department to secure a relocation site for every person who has applied for one. That is what my officials are working to achieve, and progress is being made in that task. However, I feel it is important to be upfront with turf cutters and be clear that relocation is a complex process that does take some time to deliver. The agreements being issued reflect this reality. The interim agreement is designed to give all stakeholders the time to deliver relocation options that work for turf cutters. The clear directions that I have given my officials is to examine all relocation options with a view to securing alternative cutting locations for as many turf cutters within the shortest timeframe.<\/p><p>  In the region of 1,210 legal agreements have been issued and my Department is continuing to issue agreements to qualifying applicants.

A particular criterion is for a site to be considered to be of outstanding universal value, defined by UNESCO as meaning of &ldquo;cultural and or natural significance which is so exceptional as to transcend national boundaries and to be of common importance for present and future generations of all humanity.&rdquo;  <\/p><p>The nomination process is initiated by the relevant State authorities drawing up a Tentative List of what they consider to be the most important heritage sites within their national boundaries.  Following a public consultation process and consideration by an expert advisory group, a new Tentative List   for Ireland was approved and submitted to UNESCO in March 2010 containing the following sites: the Burren; C&eacute;ide Fields and North West Mayo Boglands; the Monastic City of Clonmacnoise and its Cultural Landscape; the Historic City of Dublin; rarly Medieval Monastic Sites (Clonmacnoise, Durrow, Glendalough, Inis Cealtra, Kells and Monasterboice); the Royal Sites of Ireland (Cashel, D&uacute;n Ailinne, Hill of Uisneach, Rathcroghan Complex, Tara Complex and potentially Navan Fort in Armagh); western Stone Forts (Aran Islands - 7 forts, Cahercommaun, The Burren, Caherconree, Staigue, Benagh and Dingle Peninsula.<\/p><p>  The nomination of a property to the World Heritage List is a significant undertaking that requires the development of comprehensive nomination documentation, including a management plan for the property.  Following submission of a nomination to UNESCO, it is evaluated by three advisory bodies: the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS); the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN); and the International Centre for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property(ICCROM).  Once the site has been evaluated, the intergovernmental World Heritage Committee makes the final decision regarding the site&rsquo;s inclusion on the World Heritage List.  <\/p><p>  I believe that there are significant economic and cultural benefits to be gained from having additional Irish sites added to UNESCO&rsquo;s World Heritage list. I also share UNESCO&rsquo;s view that the nomination process must be driven at a local level and enjoy strong support amongst the communities within the potential world heritage areas.  Against that background, in order to further progress the nomination process for the sites on the current Tentative List, I have arranged a seminar in the Autumn for local authorities and relevant local\/community groups from areas with sites on the Tentative List.  <\/p><p>  The objective of the seminar will be to guide and equip participants, in particular the local authorities, to produce the detailed material needed by my Department to support the preparation and submission of substantive applications to UNESCO for World Heritage inscription.  The seminar will assemble relevant experts, local authorities and other groups and provide a forum where all elements of applying for and retaining World Heritage status will be explored and explained.  My Department will provide all assistance possible to local authorities and communities wishing to progress a site from the Tentative List towards nomination.  I expect that, following the Autumn seminar, there will be a substantive basis for advancing one or more sites from the current Tentative List with a view to inscription on the World Heritage list.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071700086#WRR00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1046"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Rehiring","counter":411,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071700086#WRR00950"},{"type":"question","counter":412,"qnumday":162,"qnumall":"[35838\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071700086#WRR01000","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the number of retired civil or public servants that have been retained by his Department since January 2013 on a short term contract or on a consultancy basis where normal abatement rules do not apply.","asker":"1008","askee":"1046"},{"type":"speech","counter":413,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Deputy that no retired civil or public servants have been retained in my Department since January 2013 on either a short term contract or on a consultancy basis where abatement rules do not apply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071700086#WRR01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1046"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Haddington Road Agreement Savings","counter":414,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071700086#WRR01150"},{"type":"question","counter":415,"qnumday":163,"qnumall":"[35855\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071700086#WRR01200","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if he will provide a yearly detailed breakdown of the sectoral measures and accompanying savings for the duration of the Haddington Road Agreement applicable in his Department and\/or non-commercial State sponsored bodies under the aegis of his Department.","asker":"1008","askee":"1046"},{"type":"speech","counter":416,"content":"<p>The measures applying to my Department and agencies under the aegis of my Department are set out in the sectoral collective agreement under Haddington Road in respect of the Civil Service and Non-Commercial Semi-State Boards. <\/p><p>   As stated by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform the Haddington Road Agreement will facilitate a reduction of &euro;1 billion in the public service pay and pensions bill by 2016.

The International Council for Exploration of the Sea (ICES) indicated that the European Eel stock is at an all-time historic low and continues to decline.  The returning juvenile eels are at between 1-10% of the levels pre-1980.<\/p><p>  The eel has a long life cycle - 18 years on average - and the legacy of poor recruitment still has to work through the system and the generations with further declines likely in the medium term.  Consequently adequate stock recovery is a longer term goal. <\/p><p>The factors identified as being likely contributors to declining stocks include fisheries, turbine mortality, loss of habitat and also contaminants of eel and introduced parasites.  The parasite (Anguillicola  ) which infects the swim bladder was introduced into Europe in the late 1970s from Asia and was introduced into Ireland in the 1980s.  I am advised that it is highly probable that the parasite will hinder recovery.  Management measures will focus on reducing any further spread of the parasite and any stocking which may be considered should avoid as much as possible waters that contain the parasite.<\/p><p>  Factors in the ocean may also be influencing the number and quality of spawners reaching the Sargasso Sea to breed and the numbers of glass eel subsequently returning to the coast of Europe.<\/p><p>  The EC Regulation (Council Regulation 1100\/2007) for the recovery of the European eel stock required Member States to establish Eel Management Plans (EMPs) for implementation in 2009.  The objective of each EMP is to reduce anthropogenic mortalities so as to permit with high probability the escapement to the sea of at least 40 % of the silver eel biomass relative to the best estimate of escapement that would have existed if no anthropogenic influences had impacted the stock.  The EMPs are required to be prepared with the purpose of achieving this objective.<\/p><p>  Under the EC Regulation, Ireland is required to monitor the eel stock, evaluate current silver eel escapement and post-evaluate implemented management actions aimed at reducing eel mortality and increasing silver eel escapement.  The Irish EMP, submitted to the EU in January 2009 and accepted by the EU in June 2009, outlined the main management actions aimed at reducing eel mortality and increasing silver eel escapement to the sea.  The EMP included two cross-border agreements, with the Neagh Bann IRBD rivers flowing into Carlingford Lough from the Republic of Ireland and into Dundalk Bay being reported in a plan for the Eastern RBD (the Eastern Eel Management Unit) and one transboundary eel management plan in respect of the North Western IRBD and prepared by the then Northern Regional Fisheries Board, the Loughs Agency and Department of Culture Arts and Leisure (DCAL).<\/p><p>  The four main management actions in the Irish Eel Management Plan were as follows; cessation of the commercial eel fishery and closure of the market mitigation of the impact of hydropower, including a comprehensive trap and transport plan to be funded by the ESB ensure upstream migration of juvenile eel at barriers, and improvement of water quality.  The Irish EMP also outlined a national monitoring programme for sampling catch and surveys of local eel stocks.  Appropriate scientific assessment monitors the implementation of the plans. <\/p><p>  Given the implications of the scientific advice, the consideration of practical management implications and the conservation and recovery imperative (contingent upon commensurate actions across Europe), the precautionary approach was adopted in accordance with the recommendations of the National Eel Working Group and the eel fishery was ceased. <\/p><p>  In 2012, a review of the management of Eel in Ireland was undertaken as required by the EU regulation, including full scientific evaluation and a public consultation conducted by Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI).  As part of this consultation many issues were raised and considered, full details of the outputs of the public consultation are available via the IFI website.  The review of scientific and management advice and inputs from the public consultation resulted in a decision to continue with the cessation of the commercial eel fishery and closure of the market for the period from 2012 to 2015.  Ireland&rsquo;s eel management plan will be reviewed again in 2015.<\/p><p>  In relation to the EU Parliament, I understand that Swedish Green MEP Isabella Lovin proposed amendments to the EU regulation.  However, as there is a scheduled review of all Member States Management plans being undertaken by the EU Commission in collaboration with the ICES\/EIFAAC Eel Working Group, the Parliament concluded that any changes should be based on the results of this review.  This review will take into account the management actions proposed by Member States and the actions that were undertaking during the years 2009 to 2011.  It is expected that a response from the Eel Working Group and the EU Commission will be available in 2014.<\/p><p>  The UK Management plan contains a combination of stocking glass eels, reduced fishing seasons, reducing the effects of barriers by installing eel passes and the introduction of screenings at installations.  The review by the EU Commission will evaluate the UK management plans. Advice from the ICES Eel Working Group 2012 report recommends an EU-wide approach to assessing stocking and determining the net benefit to the stock.  Stocking is not included as a management action in Ireland&rsquo;s eel management plan and surplus elver recruits were not identified in the 2009-2011 period to facilitate a stocking programme and it is not envisaged to purchase foreign glass eel during the next three years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071700086#WRR02000","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Broadband Services Provision","counter":428,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071700087#WRS00350"},{"type":"question","counter":429,"qnumday":168,"qnumall":"[35548\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071700087#WRS00400","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the extent to which he has identified the existence of particular black spots throughout the country in relation to the availability of broadband services; when he expects such issues to be address in full with particular reference to meeting the needs of the business, domestic and commercial sectors; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"947"},{"type":"question","counter":430,"qnumday":169,"qnumall":"[35549\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071700087#WRS00500","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"when the full scale of anticipated modern high-speed broadband services are likely to become available in all regions throughout the country; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"947"},{"type":"question","counter":431,"qnumday":170,"qnumall":"[35550\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071700087#WRS00600","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the extent to which it is expected that the quality and extent of broadband services here is likely to achieve world class standards with particular reference to the availability of such services throughout the industrial, educational, domestic and medical services; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":432,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 168 to 170, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>  The Digital Agenda for Europe set out specific targets for the achievement of high speed broadband services across all Member States.  Ireland&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan which I published in August last, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed services of 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses in advance of the EU&rsquo;s target date of 2020, and that significantly higher speeds are available to as many homes and businesses as possible.<\/p><p>  The Plan aims to deliver high speed broadband to all parts of Ireland through two principal means:<\/p><p>  (a) by providing a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment, and <\/p><p>  (b) by providing a State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.<\/p><p>  The National Broadband Plan envisages that industry will be the key driver of investment with State intervention only where there is market failure.

To date, these media have not been subject to a formal regulatory regime akin to that used to &lsquo;regulate&rsquo; traditional radio and television broadcast media, either in Ireland or in other jurisdictions.  There is a range of reasons for this, not least the rapidly evolving nature of the technologies involved, the sensitivities around regulating media and the multi-jurisdictional nature of the Internet.<\/p><p>  It is important to acknowledge the economic and social benefits that the widespread use of social media have brought to people, communities and to business.

More recently the opportunity to pay the local property tax via An Post outlets was secured. An Post has also been selected as the preferred bidder, following a competitive tender process, for the cash element of welfare payments which augurs well for the future of the network. I understand An Post will pitch strongly for the social welfare ePayment business when it is put out to tender. Having invested in the computerisation of all post offices, An Post is well positioned to become the front office provider of choice for Government and financial services sector.<\/p><p>  In the context of the public sector transformation agenda I will continue to engage with my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in relation to consideration, as appropriate, of the post office network for transactional elements of the business of Government Departments and Agencies and have stressed to my Government colleagues that the network is ideally configured for over the counter transactions.  Overall, it is Government policy that An Post remains a strong and viable company, in a position to provide a high quality, nationwide postal service and maintain a nationwide customer focussed network of post offices. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071700087#WRS01800","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Greenhouse Gas Emissions","counter":449,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071700087#WRS01850"},{"type":"question","counter":450,"qnumday":176,"qnumall":"[35556\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071700087#WRS01900","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the extent to which he expects EU fossil fuel reduction targets to be met in the short and medium term having particular regard to experience over the past five years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":451,"content":"<p>There are no explicit EU fossil fuel reduction targets.  However, there are a number of obligations on Ireland that will lead to a reduction in our reliance on fossil fuels. Under the Renewable Energy Directive, Ireland is required to increase renewable energy to 16% in 2020, with a minimum target of 10% in the transport sector.  Energy is consumed across the transport, heating and electricity sectors.  At end 2011, we had reached 6.4% of overall energy consumption from renewable sources, a twofold increase from 3.1% in 2006.  Our intention is to reach our overall target through 40% renewable electricity, 10% renewable transport and 12% renewable heating, which together amount to 16% of all energy consumption. <\/p><p>  This increase in the use of renewables in Ireland will mean less fossil fuel used.  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland estimates in its &ldquo;Energy in Ireland&rdquo; report, published in November 2012, that there was approximately &euro;300 million in avoided national gas imports from the use of renewable energy in the generation of electricity in 2011.  In 2012, 128 million litres of biofuels were used in Ireland, almost five times as much as were used in 2007, and by 2020, it is expected that around 500 million litres of biofuel will replace imported fossil fuels.<\/p><p>Reducing our energy usage will also help to reduce the amount of fossil fuels we consume.  The National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (NEEAP) contains 97 actions, each of which will play a part in securing a more sustainable energy future for Ireland.  The Plan reaffirms Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to a 20% energy savings target in 2020 under our EU obligations. The actions outlined in the Plan are projected to realise 34,060 GWh of energy savings in 2020, which is equivalent to a 21.1% saving on the baseline period and, should all the measures in the Plan meet their potential by 2020, it is estimated that a reduction of &euro;2.36 billion in energy expenditure could be realised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071700087#WRS02000","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Wind Energy Generation","counter":452,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071700087#WRS02050"},{"type":"question","counter":453,"qnumday":177,"qnumall":"[35557\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071700087#WRS02100","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"his expectations in regard to the development of the wind energy sector; the extent to which national grid requirements are likely to be met through wind energy including potential back up in respect of both targets for the internal or export markets; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":454,"content":"<p>The 2009 EU Renewable Energy Directive set Ireland a binding target where at least 16% of our energy requirements should come from renewable sources by 2020.  In order to meet our overall 16% requirement, Ireland is committed to meeting 40% of electricity demand from renewable sources.  Though these targets are challenging, I am confident that they can be met. My Department's Strategy for Renewable Energy 2012 to 2020 sets out the key strategic goals for the various renewable energy sectors in the context of Ireland's EU obligations. <\/p><p>  In addition, under the Directive, Ireland was required to set out in a National Renewable Energy Action Plan (NREAP) the trajectory towards meeting its legally binding targets.  The NREAP and the First Progress Report on the NREAP, which are available on my Department's website, show the sectoral and technology breakdown that we anticipate in the achievement of our target.<\/p><p>To date, wind energy has been the largest driver of growth in renewable electricity, contributing most towards the achievement of the 2020 target. In 2012 15.5% of Ireland's electricity demand was met by wind generation.  By the end of quarter one<i><\/i>  2013 1,763 MW (megawatts) of wind generation capacity was connected to the grid.<\/p><p>  The primary support mechanisms for renewable electricity are the Renewable Energy Feed-in Tariff (REFIT) schemes. Under REFIT 2 a total of 4,000 MW can be supported.  In order to ensure the necessary incentives are in place to encourage the level of investment required to maintain the rate of build of onshore wind necessary to meet our national target for renewable electricity, earlier this year I decided to amend the terms of REFIT 2 to extend the closing date for applications to 31 December 2015, with projects required to be built by the end of December 2017. Support under REFIT 2 cannot exceed 15 years and will not extend beyond the end of December 2032.<\/p><p>  It is estimated that between 3,500 and 4,000 MW of renewable generation capacity will be required to allow Ireland meet its 40% renewable electricity target.  Currently, just over 2,000 MW of renewable generation is connected to the grid in Ireland. Under the Gate 3 grid connection process, grid connection offers have now issued to just under 4,000 MW of renewable generation, the bulk of which is wind.  Under Gate 3 rules, generators must accept an offer within 50 business days of its receipt.  I understand that Gate 3 acceptances are scheduled to complete in October this year.<\/p><p>  Expert advice suggests that Ireland has the capability to achieve our national targets for renewable electricity from onshore renewable generation alone. However, the opportunity for Ireland to harness our excellent and abundance renewable energy resources and realise their export potential for investment, job creation and economic growth has also been identified and is being pursued with the UK government.  It should be noted that electricity exported from Ireland would not require back up on the Irish grid, as only generation in excess of that required to meet national demand levels and security of supply standards would be exported. <\/p><p>With regard to the question of conventional generation required to support intermittent renewable energy such as wind, I refer the Deputy to the All Island Electricity Capacity Statement 2013 to 2022 published by EirGrid and the Northern Ireland Transmission System Operator, SONI, earlier this year.  The Capacity Statement examines the expected electricity demand, and level of generation capacity forecast to be available, over the following 10 year period to establish the outlook for generation adequacy in Ireland and Northern Ireland.  Based on analysis of factors such as increasing levels of renewables and changes in the conventional generation portfolio, the statement forecasts that Ireland's generation adequacy outlook is positive for each of the next 10 years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071700087#WRS02200","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Energy Prices","counter":456,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071700088#WRT00200"},{"type":"question","counter":457,"qnumday":178,"qnumall":"[35558\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071700088#WRT00300","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the extent to which electricity prices here in respect of both a domestic and industrial consumer compare favourably or otherwise with those applicable in other EU member states within and without the Eurozone; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

It should be noted that the Ombudsman Act, 1980 does not provide for the investigation by the Ombudsman of any action taken by or on behalf of a person in the administration of the law relating to, inter alia, asylum.  Notwithstanding that, I should add that the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department has administrative arrangements in place with the Office of the Ombudsman to assist and provide information and help resolve any matters brought to its attention.<\/p><p>  The Ombudsman is, of course, perfectly entitled to the personal opinions expressed in the article but I do not share many of them.  In particular, I do not accept the attempted correlation between the residents of direct provision accommodation centres and past residents of industrial schools or Magdalene laundries.  It is to be expected that asylum seekers, if given a choice in the jurisdiction or elsewhere, would prefer to have independent accommodation, a right to welfare and work and so on, instead of being restricted to the system of direct provision to meet their needs.  For the avoidance of any misunderstanding, it should be noted that all EU Member States operate systems for dealing with asylum seekers which in one form or another greatly restrict their access to welfare, work or independent housing.  In reality, the system in this State is at least on a par and often significantly better than that in operation in many other Member States.  In the circumstances, it is grossly misleading to characterise our treatment of asylum seekers as being akin to that meted out to subjects of abuse who had no protection of the law or relevant State bodies.<\/p><p>   I have recounted in responses to many D&aacute;il Questions how the rights of residents of accommodation centres are protected both within the Direct Provision system and, of course, by the laws of our country. The Ombudsman's article, rightly, places great emphasis on the rights of children in the Direct Provision system.  Again, I have explained before how children are protected in a number of ways - primarily through the Reception and Integration Agency's (RIA) Child Protection policy; its House Rules; its requirement that all centre staff are Garda vetted; and through the coordination role of a dedicated Child and Family Services unit in RIA.  Children in Direct Provision centres, of course, enjoy the same educational and health entitlements as Irish citizen children.<\/p><p>  Sight must not be lost of the fact that applicants for refugee status, who otherwise would have no permission to be in the State, have their protection claims dealt with in accordance with a prescribed legal framework and exclusively on their merits having regard to their subjective and objective elements.  They have full recourse to the judicial review process in the courts and to the general protection of the State.<\/p><p>  I accept that the direct provision system is not ideal and many residents spend too long there.  But it is a system which facilitates the State providing a roof over the heads of those seeking protection or the right to remain in the State on humanitarian grounds or other reasons.  It allows the State to do it in a manner that facilitates resources being used economically in circumstances where the State is in financial difficulty.  It is acknowledged that the Direct Provision system provides value for money.  A key finding in the 2010 Value for Money Report on the Direct Provision system was that if we were operating a system which facilitated asylum seekers in living independent lives in individual housing with social welfare support and payments, aside from the asylum 'pull factor' it would likely create, the cost to the exchequer would be double what is currently paid under the direct provision system.<\/p><p>  In her article, the Ombudsman does not say that the direct provision system is in breach of international conventions. Rather, she references a number of reports critical of the direct provision system which argue that it is.  She acknowledges that, ultimately, such judgements are matters for a court.  Over the years, the direct provision system has been open to scrutiny by many international bodies.  Centres have been visited by various UN bodies, including the UNHCR,  and by the Council of Europe Human Rights Commissioner.  I appeared before the UN Human Rights Committee in Geneva in connection with its scrutiny of Ireland under the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) Process In October, 2011. No recommendation was made in relation to the Direct Provision system in the Committee's subsequent UPR report on Ireland.<\/p><p>  There is no question but that the asylum system is slow, fragmented and is in need of reform and I am determined to see this reform through.  For me, the length of time spent in the Direct Provision system, rather than the quality of provision within the system itself, is the real issue and I am committed to remedying that.  Work on the details of the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2010 is ongoing at my Department pursuant to current Government policy which is committed, under the Programme for National Recovery, to \"introduce comprehensive reforms of the immigration, residency and asylum systems\", which will include a statutory appeals system and set out rights and obligations in a transparent way.<\/p><p>  As I have outlined previously to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence, several hundred amendments to the Bill are anticipated, the majority of a technical nature.  I also expressed the considered view that instead of engaging in an extremely cumbersome process of tabling hundreds of amendments to the 2010 Bill, it would be much more efficient to publish a new and enhanced text.  Such an approach can incorporate the many anticipated amendments while addressing key outstanding issues, several of which have been of concern to Members.  This proposition was broadly welcomed by the Joint Committee and work on the Bill continues, therefore, on that basis while also taking account of any intervening matters of relevance such as decisions by the Courts.<\/p><p>  It remains my objective under this new approach, and subject to having to deal with the competing legislative demands of our EU\/IMF\/ECB Programme commitments, to be in a position to bring a revised Bill to Government for approval and publication before the end of the year.<\/p><p>  Pending the enactment and commencement of the new legislation and with a view to improving processing in the area of international protection, I am proposing to introduce new arrangements for the processing of subsidiary protection applications in light of recent judgments in the Superior Courts.  My Department, in consultation with the Attorney General's Office, is developing a new legislative and administrative framework for the processing of current and future subsidiary protection applications.

However, personnel may be deployed for training, for humanitarian operations and for other such reasons under the authority of the Government in accordance with the provisions of the Defence (Amendment) Act, 2006, which formalised arrangements in this regard.  Ireland's policy in regard to the &#8220;triple lock&#8221; was most recently underpinned by the adoption by the people of the Lisbon Treaty in 2009. Ireland's act of ratification of the Lisbon Treaty was reinforced by the associated national declaration which states &#8220;that the participation of contingents of the Irish Defence Forces in overseas operations, including those carried out under the European common security and defence policy requires (a) the authorisation of the operation by the Security Council or the General Assembly of the United Nations, (b) the agreement of the Irish Government, and (c) the approval of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, in accordance with Irish law.&#8221;<\/p><p>  The White Paper on Defence, which was published in 2000, has provided the policy framework for Defence for the past thirteen years.  In the period since its publication there have been significant changes in the defence and security environment and the defence policy framework has continued to evolve.  In this context, the Government decided that there is a requirement to prepare a new White Paper on Defence.  This will provide the policy framework for Defence for the next decade.<\/p><p>  A Green Paper on Defence was published yesterday.  It will initiate a broad public consultative process, which will provide for members of the public and interest groups to input their views as part of the process of developing the new White Paper on Defence. In this context the Green Paper will engender discussion on all relevant matters including the triple lock.  The Green Paper states  &#8220;The approval procedures that govern the despatch of contingents of the Permanent Defence Force on overseas peace support operations, commonly known as the &#8220;triple lock&#8221;, comprise three requirements namely:<\/p><p>- the authorisation of the operation by the Security Council or General Assembly of the United Nations;<\/p><p>- a formal Government decision; and<\/p><p>- the approval of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann (There is no requirement for D&aacute;il approval where, the international United Nations Force is unarmed, where the size of the Permanent Defence Force contingent does and will not exceed twelve members, or if the contingent is intended to replace in whole or in part or reinforce a contingent of the PDF serving outside of the State already serving as part of an International United Nations Force).<\/p><p>  The legislative basis for the participation by the Permanent Defence Force in overseas peace support operations as part of an &#8220;International United Nations Force&#8221; was originally provided for by the Defence (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 1960.  The legal provisions were updated in 1993 to permit participation in Chapter VII of the UN Charter.  UN mandated operations mounted under this Chapter are commonly known as &#8220;peace enforcement&#8221; operations), missions and again in 2006 to take account of developments in peace support including the UN's increased reliance on regional organisations, such as the EU, NATO and the African Union (AU).  The requirements of the &#8220;triple lock&#8221; were formally set out in Ireland's national declaration associated with the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty.<\/p><p>  The requirement for a UN resolution as part of the &#8220;triple lock&#8221; reflects the central importance of the UN in granting legitimacy to peace support and crisis management missions.  At the same time, it also constitutes a self imposed, legal constraint on the State's sovereignty in making decisions about the use of its armed forces.  This could prevent the State from participating in a peace support operation.  In 2003, the EU led peace support mission EUFOR Concordia in Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, was welcomed in UN resolution 1371 in terms that did not conform to the requirements of the Defence Acts at that time.  Accordingly, Ireland could not participate in the mission.<\/p><p>  The benefits of a formal legislative requirement for UN authorisation must be weighed against the possibility that this constraint may lead to an inability to act on occasions where there is a pressing moral or security imperative and overwhelming international support to do so, but where UN sanction is not forthcoming, in circumstances where a veto is exercised by a permanent member of the Security Council acting in its own national interests.  It is acknowledged that there is substantial public support for the triple lock mechanism and that, in practical terms, due to the size of our Defence Forces, the State only has a limited capacity to contribute to UN Missions.  In real terms Ireland has, in the context of its size, punched above its weight and made a valuable, disproportionate contribution and, save for the example of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, has not been excluded from peace keeping engagements by the triple lock.  On balance, the advantages of retaining the mechanism can be seen as outweighing the disadvantages.  Having said that, it is an issue worthy of discussion in advance of the<b><\/b>  adoption of a new White Paper.&#8221;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071700093#WRY00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Green Paper on Defence","counter":598,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071700093#WRY00750"},{"type":"question","counter":599,"qnumday":226,"qnumall":"[31467\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071700093#WRY00800","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"his views on the Green paper on defence.

In this context there are a range of issues that must be considered including: future capacity requirements, if changes in the roles assigned to the Defence Forces are required and how we should prioritise scarce resources.  To assist in this regard, the Green Paper sets out a number of focused policy questions for consideration and to guide submissions.  The Green Paper also sets out how members of the public and other interested parties can submit their views and I am confident that this will better inform the development of the new White Paper on Defence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071700093#WRY00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Rehiring","counter":601,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071700093#WRY00950"},{"type":"question","counter":602,"qnumday":227,"qnumall":"[35841\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071700093#WRY01000","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"the number of retired civil or public servants that have been retained by his Department since January 2013 on a short term contract or on a consultancy basis where normal abatement rules do not apply.","asker":"1008","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":603,"content":"<p>No retired civil or public servants have been retained by my Department since January 2013 on a short term contract or on a consultancy basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071700093#WRY01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Haddington Road Agreement Savings","counter":604,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071700093#WRY01150"},{"type":"question","counter":605,"qnumday":228,"qnumall":"[35858\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071700093#WRY01200","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"if he will provide a yearly detailed breakdown of the sectoral measures and accompanying savings for the duration of the Haddington Road Agreement applicable in his Department and\/or non-commercial State sponsored bodies under the aegis of his Department.","asker":"1008","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":606,"content":"<p>The measures applying to the Defence Forces are as set out in the Defence Sector Collective Agreement, Appendix 2 of the Public Service Stability Agreement 2013 &ndash; 2016 - The Haddington Road Agreement.

The interim export target for 2015 is &euro;10 billion and the fact that the value of agrifood and drink exports exceeded &euro;9 billion for the first time ever in 2012 marks good progress so far.<\/p><p>Since March 2011 when I took office as Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine there has been significant progress in meeting the targets in each sector.  The details of the exports achieved since 2011 are set out in the following table:<\/p><p><b>Irish Meat and Dairy exports 2010-2012<\/b><\/p><p><table><tr><th>Value: &euro;m<\/th><th>-<\/th><th>-<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Category<\/td><td>2011<\/td><td>2012<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dairy<\/td><td>2,715<\/td><td>2,620<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Beef<\/td><td>1,860<\/td><td>1,900<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Pigmeat<\/td><td>421<\/td><td>507<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Sheepmeat<\/td><td>197<\/td><td>212<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Grand Total<\/td><td>5,194<\/td><td>5,239<\/td><\/tr><\/table><<\/p><p><i>Source: CSO<\/i><\/p><p>In 2012, the value of Irish beef exports showed an increase of &euro;40 million over the 2011 figure, reflecting improved returns from export markets. Over the same period the value of sheepmeat exports increased by approximately &euro;15 million, with modest growth recorded in exports to our main markets in France and the United Kingdom and higher growth was recorded on exports to emerging markets in Northern Europe (including Scandinavia).<\/p><p>Exports of Irish pigmeat are estimated to have increased by 12,000 tonnes (carcass weight equivalent) in 2012, as compared with 2011.  The value of Irish pigmeat exports increased by an estimated &euro;86 million.<\/p><p>Mixed trends were evident in key export destinations for dairy products during 2012.  Exports to the United Kingdom performed strongly and increased by more than 5% to &euro;960 million or 36% of total trade.  The strongest performing categories were cheese, infant food and spreads.  While demand from other EU markets weakened somewhat because of economic conditions, this was partially counterbalanced by an increase in the value of exports to international markets which are estimated to have reached more than &euro;1 billion for the first time in 2012.  These international markets provide dramatic growth potential into the future.<\/p><p>In so far as exports to third country markets have been concerned, I have been very active in developing relationships in new and expanding markets in order to raise the profile of Ireland and build the kind of confidence in Irish production and control systems that provide a platform for long-term trading relationships in the future. Since my appointment I have lead trade and political missions to China, the US and Algeria, and my Department continues to engage on market access issues with many other third countries.  Ireland already has access for dairy products to markets worldwide and exports such products to over eighty countries, but I am working to increase the profile of the sector in potential growth markets.<\/p><p>In addition, since my appointment, there have been a number of notable successes in reaching agreement with authorities in Singapore, Egypt, Iran and the GCC Countries which allow for the export of Irish beef, with Singapore, South Africa, UAE, Canada and the Russian Federation-Customs Union for the export of Irish sheepmeat and with Australia and Serbia for the export of Irish pork.  There is strong demand for meat globally and I remain focused on enabling Irish exporters to take advantage of the opportunities that arise.<\/p><p>Regarding employment, the function of Government is of course to create the economic conditions which will facilitate and encourage job creation.  In relation to the agri food sector, the work being done with industry and the various Government Departments and State agencies to implement actions necessary to deliver on the vision outlined in Food Harvest 2020, together with the Government macroeconomic policy, is helping to make Ireland a more competitive place to do business and create the conditions necessary for job creation.  The Forf&aacute;s Annual Employment Survey indicates that since 2009, a total of 3,339 net new direct jobs were created in the food manufacturing sector and of course this kind of development will create spin off opportunities in the sub-supply, transport, sales and other areas.<\/p><p>As regards the future, in 2012 food client investments, supported by Enterprise Ireland, committed to more than 1,500 new jobs being created within three years.  In 2013 to date Enterprise Ireland investments in food companies have resulted in new jobs commitments in excess of 500 and it is hoped that this level of new jobs commitments can be sustained over the coming years to contribute to the Government&rsquo;s overall job creation targets.  Of course investment in the agrifood sector has a larger economic multiplier than that in other manufacturing industry because many of the inputs are indigenous.<\/p><p>I am confident that Ireland is taking the steps necessary to avail of the opportunities presented by expanding global demand for food and am committed to ensuring that the contribution of the agrifood sector to the economy, exports and employment is maximised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071700094#WRZ00300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Common Agricultural Policy Reform","counter":620,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071700094#WRZ00350"},{"type":"question","counter":621,"qnumday":233,"qnumall":"[35632\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071700094#WRZ00400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"with reference to the recent changes to the Common Agricultural Policy, if horticulture as a sector of agriculture under the Act have admittance to the scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"976","askee":"991"},{"type":"question","counter":622,"qnumday":234,"qnumall":"[35633\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071700094#WRZ00500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will indicate when the horticultural industry can avail of the Common Agricultural Policy scheme; when applications will be open; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"976","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":623,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 233 and 234 together.  <\/p><p>  One of the main features of the CAP reform package, on which political agreement was reached last month, is the flexibility provided to Member States to take individual decisions in regard to implementation of the common policy.

Under partial convergence, farmers with payments below 90% of the national average payment per hectare will have their payments raised by at least one third of the difference between their current payment and 90% of the national average by 2019, with a minimum payment of 60% of the national average per hectare by 2019.  This is financed by reductions to payments above the national average payment per hectare.  Member States have flexibility as to how payment reductions are applied to those above the average, provided this is done on the basis of objective and non-discriminative criteria to be determined by Member States.  Member States may also apply an optional maximum 30% loss on convergence in 2019 when compared with the unit value established in 2015<\/p><p>Table 1 below shows the effects of partial convergence with a minimum payment of 60% of national average, resulting in a transfer of &euro;103m from convergence.  However, the following caveats should be noted in relation to this table:<\/p><p>a) This analysis is based on 2010 SPS payments, and looks at the effect of convergence alone, rather than taking account of other adjustments to payments.  It represents the position when the reform is fully implemented in 2019, without taking these other adjustments into account.  This approach has been adopted to isolate the impact of various convergence options so that they can be assessed without being conflated with other necessary adjustments which are explained below.<\/p><p>b) Total 2010 payments of &euro;1,250m, on which the table is based, have already been reduced to &euro;1,230m in 2012 (due to an increase in the rate of modulation).  Payments made in October 2013 will be further adjusted to respect the ceiling for 2014 agreed as part of the MFF negotiations (&euro;1,217m).  The ceiling for the following years is set as follows:<\/p><p><table><tr><th>Budget\/ Financial Year <\/th><th>2014<\/th><th>2015<\/th><th>2016<\/th><th>2017<\/th><th>2018<\/th><th>2019<\/th><th>2020<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Direct payments &euro;m<\/td><td>1,217<\/td><td>1,215<\/td><td>1,213<\/td><td>1,212<\/td><td>1,211<\/td><td>1,211<\/td><td>1,211<\/td><\/tr><\/table><<\/p><p>The ceiling cuts arising from the MFF will therefore be in place by the end of this year, in advance of the other changes arising from CAP reform.<\/p><p>c)The following adjustments will also need to be made to the total ceiling before convergence is calculated:<\/p><p>- Young farmer scheme &ndash; up to 2% of national ceiling<\/p><p>- National reserve &ndash; up to 3% of basic payment ceiling<\/p><p>- Crisis reserve &ndash; 1% of national ceiling (repaid if unused).<\/p><p>Note that funds for young farmers and the national reserve will directly benefit Irish farmers, specifically young farmers and new entrants.  The crisis reserve will apply to the EU as a whole, with Irish farmers as likely to benefit as those in other Member States.<\/p><p>d) If a Member State opts to implement additional schemes such as the Redistributive Payment or Voluntary Coupled support, these amounts would also be deducted from the national ceiling before the convergence calculation is applied, i.e. convergence is calculated on the basic payment scheme with consequential impact on the greening payment.<\/p><p>e) The convergence calculation will in practice be calculated using the revised ceilings, and taking account of the adjustments listed above.  Therefore the national average per hectare and the minimum payment of 60% of national average for the convergence calculation will be adjusted accordingly and will be different from those in Table 1.<\/p><p>f) <b>Table 1<\/b> is prepared on the assumption that convergence reductions are applied proportionately; in fact, as stated above, the June agreement gives Member States flexibility in how the convergence reduction is applied to farmers above the national average.<\/p><p><b>  Table 2<\/b> blow summarises the estimated effect of adding a maximum payment per hectare of &euro;400 or &euro;450 to the calculations in Table 1:<\/p><p>A maximum rate per hectare of &euro;400 in 2019 would have roughly the following effects:<\/p><p>- Around <b>7,600<\/b> farmers (those currently above &euro;500\/ha) would be affected.<\/p><p>- It would raise additional savings of <b>&euro;32 million<\/b> in addition to the proportional reductions already applied to these farmers; presumably these savings could be used to adjust the proportional reduction applied to the remaining farmers above the national average.<\/p><p>-  The percentage reductions applied to farmers in the highest payment categories would be increased considerably by adding a maximum payment per hectare.<\/p><p>A maximum rate per hectare of &euro;450 in 2019 would have roughly the following effects:<\/p><p>- Almost <b>5,000<\/b>   farmers (those currently above &euro;550\/ha) would be affected.<\/p><p>- It would raise additional savings of <b>&euro;17 million<\/b> in addition to the proportional reductions

","asker":"996","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":677,"content":"<p>Water fluoridation is the adjustment of a naturally occurring element found in water in order to prevent tooth decay.  The benefits of water fluoridation, one of the most widely studied public health policy initiatives in the world, are long established.  The Irish Expert Body on Fluorides and Health, established in 2004, monitors new and emerging issues on fluoride and its effects.  It advises that the balance of scientific evidence worldwide confirms that water fluoridation, at the optimal level, does not cause any ill effects and is the safest and most cost effective method of protecting the oral health of the population.  The opinion of the Expert Body is supported by the World Health Organisation and by major international scientifically validated reviews.  <\/p><p>  There have been a number of relevant WHO documents, notably \"Fluorides and Human Health\", Monograph Series 59 (1970), WHO Geneva; \"Fluorides and Oral Health\", Technical Report Series No. 846 (1994), WHO Geneva; and \"Environmental Health Criteria 227 FLUORIDES\", (2002), WHO Geneva.  More recently, the Department of Health contributed to the review by the EU Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks (SCHER, 2011) of any new evidence on the hazard profile, health effects, and human exposure to fluoride and the fluoridating agents of drinking water. <\/p><p>  National and regional oral health surveys show a substantial benefit of fluoridation in terms of a reduction in tooth decay.\u00a0 The only known side effect is dental fluorosis. This is a cosmetic or aesthetic condition which refers to the way teeth look; it is not considered to be an adverse health effect.  Following publication of the report of the Forum on Fluoridation in 2002 and on the advice of the Expert Body on the findings of the report, revised Regulations were introduced in 2007, reducing the level of fluoride in piped public water supplies from a range of 0.8 to 1.0 parts per million (ppm) to a range of 0.6 to 0.8 ppm.  At the levels at which fluoride is present in Ireland's water supplies any occurrence of dental fluorosis is very mild or mild and in most cases only detectable by a dentist as faint white flecks on the surface of teeth.   <\/p><p>  The National Cancer Registry of Ireland (NCRI) conducted a study into cross-border rates of osteosarcoma (Comber et al, 2011) as a result of concerns raised in the United States regarding the plausibility of a link between this condition and fluoride exposure.  This study did not show any difference in disease rates between fluoridated and non-fluoridated communities.  This study was undertaken as part of the NCRI's work in analysing information relating to the incidence and prevalence of cancer and related tumours in Ireland and was funded from its own resources.  Since the study was published, definitive results from two major studies in the United States has shown no association between fluoride exposure and osteosarcoma (Kim et al 2011, and Levy et al 2012). <\/p><p>  The effects of fluoridation on health and related matters are kept under constant review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071700096#WRBB01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Help Service Provision","counter":678,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071700096#WRBB01550"},{"type":"question","counter":679,"qnumday":253,"qnumall":"[35627\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071700096#WRBB01600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will arrange for extra home help hours and additional respite to be granted to a person (details supplied) in Dublin 6W due to the demands of care and to avoid full time institutional care; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Service providers and the HSE are working closely together to identify how the needs of those individuals who require day services or training places in 2013 can be responded to within available resources and I have asked the Health Service Executive (HSE) to keep me informed of progress in that regard on an ongoing basis.<\/p><p>Although the 2013 allocation for disability services has been reduced by 1.2%, the Health Service Executive (HSE) National Service Plan includes an additional &euro;4m to provide training places and day services for school-leavers and Rehabilitative \/ Lifeskills Training (RT) graduates in 2013.

Providing the level of services required within the additional funding provided will continue to be a challenge in all regions of the country. Work in this area is being progressed largely in line with the HSE guidance document developed in 2012, which led to the successful placement of 99% of RT graduates and 96% of school leavers last year. The HSE has informed me that the current position is that 81% of school leavers and 75% of RT graduates nationally have now been allocated a placement.

In the case of persons who have both the medical card and LTI, the HSE policy is that they should use their medical card to access medicines.

There is no automatic entitlement to a medical card for persons with a specific illness, such as cancer, nor has the criteria applied to medical card applications by cancer patients been amended or reviewed.<\/p><p>  However, under the legislation, there is provision for discretion by the HSE to grant a medical card where a person's income exceeds the income guidelines.  The HSE takes a person's social and medical issues into account in determining whether or not &quot;undue hardship&quot; exists for a person in providing a health service for themselves or his or her dependents.  The HSE has an effective system in place for the provision of emergency medical cards for patients who are terminally ill, or who are seriously ill and in urgent need of medical care that they cannot afford.  They are issued within twenty-four hours of receipt of the required patient details and the letter of confirmation of the condition from a doctor or a medical consultant.  With the exception of terminally ill patients, the HSE issues all emergency cards on the basis that the patient is eligible for a medical card on the basis of means or undue hardship, and that the applicant will follow up with a full application within a number of weeks of receiving the emergency card.  As a result, emergency medical cards are issued to a named individual, with a limited eligibility period of six months.<\/p><p>  For persons with a terminal illness, no means test applies.  Once the terminal illness is verified, patients are given an emergency medical card for six months.
