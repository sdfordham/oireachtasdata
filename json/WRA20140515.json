The Council agenda covered many key policy issues and important Conclusions were reached on a number of areas.  While the situation in the Ukraine and relations with Russia continue to dominate the European agenda and were again the focus of intense discussions at this FAC, in my response I propose to address in the first instance, some of the other important items that were discussed and agreed by the Council.<\/p><p>  In short opening remarks, High Representative (HR) Ashton provided Ministers with a brief update on the recent legislative elections in Iraq, as well as the forthcoming round of nuclear talks with Iran. HR Ashton also raised the appalling incidents of recent weeks in Nigeria &ndash; notably the abductions of over 200 schoolgirls by Boko Haram &ndash; and the Council later adopted robust Conclusions denouncing these events. Ireland strongly supports these Conclusions and condemns unreservedly violent activities against all Nigerians, and particularly against children.<\/p><p>  There was a short debate at the FAC on the status of the Middle East Peace Process (MEPP) and Conclusions were adopted. Ireland's position of support for a two-State solution is well known. While there still remains even a slim prospect of reviving the current talks process, then the EU needs to offer its full support and encouragement. However, we cannot lose sight of the continuing serious deterioration on the ground and I firmly believe that all sides need to reflect seriously on what their underlying objectives are, and how they can contribute to bringing about that negotiated two-State solution. I look forward to an early opportunity to engaging in a more substantive discussion on the MEPP at a forthcoming FAC meeting.<\/p><p>  Over lunch, Ministers were joined by Commissioner Fule for an orientation discussion on the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP). The interventions were wide-ranging and the discussions drew on many of the previous exchanges on related issues, including discussions at the informal meeting of EU Foreign Ministers in Athens at the beginning of April. It is evident that events in both Eastern and Southern Neighbourhoods of the European Union present new challenges, and we must reflect as to how ENP can be made more responsive to these developments, taking full account of the particular circumstances of individual countries in the neighbourhood.<\/p><p>  Two items were also adopted (without discussion) on issues of particular importance to Ireland; the EU Guidelines on Freedom of Expression Online and Offline, and the EU&rsquo;s Comprehensive Approach to External Conflicts.  The EU Guidelines on Freedom of Expression Online and Offline are most welcome as they will be an important resource for officials and staff of EU institutions and EU Member States in the work of the EU to protect and promote the right to freedom of expression.  Ireland is a consistent supporter of freedom of expression and we have prioritised this issue through our activities at the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, and in our engagement in the development of these Guidelines. <\/p><p>  The adoption of Council Conclusions on the EU&rsquo;s Comprehensive Approach to External Conflicts is to be equally welcomed. The Comprehensive Approach seeks to ensure that the EU and its Member States deal with international crises in a coherent and consistent manner drawing on all the policies and tools available to them and Ireland has been a strong supporter of this initiative.<\/p><p>  Finally then, I would like to turn to the discussion on Ukraine. As I will detail in my separate reply to the Deputy&rsquo;s specific question [22031\/14  ] on these discussions, there was an extensive exchange of views, and Conclusions were adopted.  These Conclusions reaffirm the European Union&rsquo;s support for Ukraine&rsquo;s unity, sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity and call upon the Russian Federation to do likewise. The Council expressed alarm at the continued efforts by pro-Russian separatists to destabilise Eastern and Southern Ukraine and was clear that the EU would not recognise the illegitimate and illegal &ldquo;referenda&rdquo; in Donetsk and Luhansk.<\/p><p>  The Council reiterated the EU&rsquo;s strong condemnation of the illegal annexation of Crimea and Sevastopol in March and regretted the presence of President Putin at the military parade in Sevastopol on 9 May. Ministers welcomed the Commission&rsquo;s evaluation of the legal consequences of the annexation of Crimea and looked forward to the swift implementation of its proposals.<\/p><p>  Ministers were briefed by the President of Switzerland, Didier Burkhalter, in his capacity as Chair-in-Office of the OSCE on the critically important activities of that organisation aimed at stabilising the situation on the ground. The Council welcomed the presentation of proposals by the OSCE Chairmanship for a de-escalation of the crisis.<\/p><p>  The Council conclusions express the EU&rsquo;s strong support for the holding of free and fair Ukrainian Presidential elections on 25 May, allowing the Ukrainian people to choose their own future. Ireland will be sending a team of election monitors under the auspices of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).<\/p><p>  The Council also tasked the European External Action Service to work on elements for a possible civilian CSDP Mission in the field of civilian security sector reform, including policing and rule of law.<\/p><p>  In light of the recent developments and in the absence of any steps towards de-escalation, the Council agreed to expand the criteria allowing individuals and entities to be subject to visa ban and asset freeze and moved to impose sanctions against a further thirteen named individuals as well as two energy companies in Crimea.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051500045#WRC01800","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foreign Conflicts","counter":116,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051500045#WRC01850"},{"type":"question","counter":117,"qnumday":51,"qnumall":"[22031\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051500045#WRC01900","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will detail the proposals he put forward at the EU Foreign Affairs Council Meeting of 12 May 2014 regarding the crisis in Ukraine; the actions the European Union will pursue; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":118,"content":"<p>The Government was represented at the Foreign Affairs Council (FAC) of 12 May 2014 by the Minister for European Affairs, Paschal Donohoe T.D.

The rights of persons belonging to national minorities need to be fully ensured in line with the relevant standards of the Council of Europe.<\/p><p>  The FAC reconfirmed the EU&rsquo;s full commitment to the Geneva Joint Statement of 17 April on initial concrete steps to de-escalate tensions and restore security for all. The Council welcomed the efforts taken so far by the Ukrainian authorities to this end, while calling on the Russian Federation to take effective steps to fulfil its commitments under the Geneva Joint Statement. The Council reiterated its demand to Russia to call back its troops from the Ukrainian border and to immediately withdraw the mandate of the Federation Council to use force on Ukrainian soil. It also condemned declarations and visits of high officials engaged in supporting illegal attempts at separatism which contribute to heightening tensions in Ukraine.<\/p><p>  In light of the recent developments and in the absence of any steps towards de-escalation, the Council agreed to expand the criteria allowing individuals and entities to be subject to visa ban and asset freeze and moved to impose sanctions against a further thirteen named individuals as well as two energy companies in Crimea.<\/p><p>  The Council noted that the preparatory work by the Commission and Member States is underway on possible targeted measures, as requested by the European Council in March, so that further steps can be taken should events require.

The issue was discussed extensively during the Taoiseach&rsquo;s St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day visit to Washington DC in March.<\/p><p>  In addition to substantive discussion of the issues with President Obama and Vice President Biden, the Taoiseach also discussed the prospects for progress with a range of other members of Congress including Speaker John Boehner; Congressman Bob Goodlatte, Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee which has responsibility for immigration legislation in the House; Congressman Paul Ryan; the Congressional Friends of Ireland; and Senator Patrick Leahy, the Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee that oversaw the passage of the Senate&rsquo;s comprehensive immigration reform bill last June.  The Taoiseach called in the strongest possible terms for Congress to show leadership and deal with the immigration issue now.  I have also continued to raise the issue in my meetings with US political contacts, including with Congressman John Lewis, whom I met last month.  In addition to direct engagement with political leaders, we continue to highlight Ireland&rsquo;s interests in this area to other partners in the United States who may be able to support our objectives.  For example, in Washington the Taoiseach highlighted the need for progress on immigration reform in his speeches to influential audiences including the US Chamber of Commerce and the American-Ireland Fund Gala, as well as to invited guests at the White House St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day reception, the Ambassador&rsquo;s St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day reception and most importantly at the Speaker&rsquo;s Lunch on Capitol Hill.<\/p><p>  While we have been encouraged by feedback from both Democrats and Republicans indicating that there is now a growing consensus in favour of reform, it remains difficult to assess exactly when and how this might occur, not least in view of the upcoming mid-term U.S. Congressional elections.

The list of approved bodies, which includes eligible charities, bodies approved for education in the arts and eligible primary, secondary and third level institutions, is available on the Revenue website ().  For donations made pre-2013, the precise arrangements for allowing tax relief on donations varied depending on whether the donor was a PAYE-only taxpayer, a chargeable person subject to self-assessment or a company.  For a PAYE-only donor, the relief was given on a &quot;grossed up&quot; basis to the eligible charity or approved body, rather than by way of a separate claim to tax relief by the donor.  The claim for refund was made by the eligible charity or approved body in respect of the PAYE-only donor.  In the case of a self-assessed donor, that individual claimed the relief and there was no grossing up arrangement.  In the case of a company, it would claim a deduction for the donation as if it were a trading expense.  For donations made after 1 January 2013, relief for PAYE-only and self-assessed taxpayers is payable to the charity at a blended rate of 31%.

The Government has protected frontline services in schools and there will be no reduction in teacher numbers in second level schools for the 2014\/15 school year as a result of budget 2014. The DEIS scheme for disadvantaged schools is also fully protected with no overall changes to staffing levels or funding as a result of the budget. When the moratorium on the filling of posts of responsibility was introduced the Government exempted Principal and Deputy Principal posts in all primary and post-primary schools and these posts continue to be replaced in the normal manner. I have also provided alleviation arrangements at AP level. These arrangements are set out in Circular 0004\/2014 which provide a floor by which schools acutely affected at AP level by the impact of the moratorium can fill their AP vacancies as they arise to the level of the thresholds set out in that circular.

For works contracts the threshold is &euro;5.186 million; for supplies and service contracts awarded by Government Departments the threshold is &euro;134,000 and for the remainder of public bodies the threshold is &euro;207,000. The threshold for supplies and service contracts of entities operating in utility sectors (water, energy, transport and postal) is &euro;414,000. <\/p><p>I understand that approximately two thirds of tenders which are above these EU thresholds have contract award notices published for them. The reason for this level of publication is that of the remaining tenders some may never be awarded or the tender competition may be cancelled. In such cases there is no need to publish a contract award notice. It is the responsibility of individual contracting authorities to publish award notices following the signing of a contract. This process is facilitated through the national eProcurement portal . The Office of Government Procurement (OGP) is responsible for producing annual statistical information in relation to above-EU threshold procurement activity by the Irish public sector and for providing these statistics to the European Commission. <\/p><p>In relation to contracts valued below the EU thresholds, the general requirement is that they be advertised on the national public procurement website or, depending on value, awarded on the basis of a competitive process of direct invitation to an adequate number of suitable suppliers. Contracting authorities are not obliged to publish the results of tender competitions, under these EU thresholds. However, guidelines recently issued by my Department (Circular 10\/14) will require public bodies to publish all contract award notices over &euro;25,000. This will come into effect later this year.<\/p><p>The Government is committed to maximising procurement opportunities which actively assist job growth and benefit the wider economy.\u00a0 The public sector has an immense purchasing power, spending in the region of &euro;8.5 billion per annum on goods and services. This level of expenditure by the public sector affords significant business opportunities for firms that can supply the products and services that are required by public bodies.<\/p><p>The Government is aware of the concerns raised by SMEs in relation to the reforms of the procurement function. Broadly speaking the two main objectives of the reforms are to professionalise how procurement is conducted in the State and to ensure services are delivered in a sustainable manner. In relation to the latter, it is vital that any savings arising from procurement are achieved without damaging competition. Therefore the Government are committed to ensuring that SMEs are fully engaged with public sector procurement and the opportunities presenting.<\/p><p>My Department has also recently published guidance Circular 10\/14 aimed at promoting SME participation in public procurement.\u00a0These new guidelines are aimed at reducing the administrative burden on businesses that want to tender for public contracts.

The Department is also in regular contact with lone parent and unemployed advocacy groups, all of whom have been informed of the scheme. <\/p><p>There are a number of possible reasons for the low take up of the scheme to date.  The scheme is still a pilot and is the first scheme of its type provided by the Department in conjunction with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs (DCYA).  It is being continuously reviewed based on feedback from the local offices, customers and childcare providers.  One of the original drivers for the introduction of the scheme was to assist lone parents, who were due to lose entitlement to one parent family payment  on foot of the age reduction reforms, to make the transition to a jobseeker&rsquo;s scheme and hopefully to employment.  In order to address the caring responsibilities of this group of customers the jobseeker&rsquo;s transition arrangement was introduced.  This in effect allows these customers to work part time while their children are in school and still receive a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment subject to them satisfying the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance means.  The introduction of this arrangement is likely to have significantly reduced the need for childcare from this cohort thereby reducing the demand for the ASCC childcare places.<\/p><p>Many parents may have a preference for other family members or for friends to provide childcare to their children rather than seeking to place their children into the care of a community or private cr&egrave;che.<\/p><p>Finally, the scheme is aimed at supporting customers into employment and so take-up is directly linked to the availability of suitable employment opportunities. <\/p><p>The scheme was funded from savings of &euro;14 million from the Department.

The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer. There are currently approximately 77,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;344 million for 2014.   The Department continues to monitor trends in the private rental market to determine the impact on rent supplement recipients.  Following the most recent review of the private rental market revised maximum rent limits were introduced from Monday 17 June 2013 until 31 December 2014. Despite the overall pressures on the social protection budget, there were increases in the rent limits in Dublin, Galway, North Kildare and Bray areas.  <\/p><p>  Any further changes to the rent limits would have to be considered in a budgetary context. A full rent limit review will be commenced shortly and will be completed in time to feed into the budgetary process.  <\/p><p>  All prospective tenants, including those seeking to access rent supplement, are now finding it increasingly difficult to secure appropriate accommodation due to the reduced availability of rental properties. The market shows no sign of stabilising and increasing the maximum rent limits for rent supplement will not resolve the current difficulties, due to the reduced level of supply, and would result in further increases in rental costs for all persons renting including those on reduced incomes and students.  <\/p><p>  The Community Welfare Service of the Department, including through its work in the Homeless Persons Unit and the Asylum Seekers &amp;amp; New Communities Unit, works closely with local authorities and other stakeholders to facilitate homeless persons to access private rented accommodation. This ensures that where possible, people are diverted away from homeless services and towards community-based supports.  Department officials have discretionary powers to award a supplement where it appears that the circumstances of the case so warrant and is of an exceptional nature.<\/p><p>  In addition and in view of the current supply difficulties, the Dublin local authorities are currently engaging with the Department in finalising a further interagency intervention system to identify vulnerable families who are in receipt of rent supplement and at risk of becoming homeless due to the imminent loss of their tenancy to ensure that the necessary supports can be put in place.  These cases will be assessed on an individual basis having regard to the individual circumstances and families requiring additional support will receive the necessary assistance, financial or otherwise. <\/p><p>  The Department&rsquo;s strategic policy direction is to return rent supplement to its original purpose of a short term income support. In July 2013 the Government approved the introduction of the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP). Under HAP, responsibility for recipients of rent supplement with a long-term housing need will transfer from the Department of Social Protection to local authorities. Officials in the Department are working closely with those in the lead Department of Environment, Community and Local Government, in piloting HAP in Limerick City and County Council with further roll out to a further six selected local authorities during the year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051500051#WRJ01500","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Allowance Appeals","counter":302,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051500051#WRJ01550"},{"type":"question","counter":303,"qnumday":114,"qnumall":"[21985\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051500051#WRJ01600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"when a person (details supplied) in County Mayo will be informed of the outcome of their disability allowance appeal in view of the fact that they attended an oral hearing on 4 April 2014.

","asker":"970","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":367,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 137 and 138 together. <\/p><p>The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August 2012, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses.  This will be achieved by providing:<\/p><p>- a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment, and <\/p><p>- a State-led intervention for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.<\/p><p>Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are under way and in some instances have been accelerated in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services.  Commercial operators combined have either invested, or committed to invest, over &euro;2 billion in their Irish networks, delivering high speed broadband to homes and businesses.  For example:<\/p><p>- Eircom is rolling out a &euro;400m investment in a Next Generation Access Fibre Network that offers speeds of up to 100Mbps.  Service is already available to over 800,000 addresses, with planned coverage to reach 1.4m addresses by 2016. <\/p><p>- UPC has invested over &euro;500m in upgrading its cable network.  Over 700,000 homes can already access minimum broadband speeds of 120Mbps and up to 200Mbps.  Businesses can access speeds of 500Mbps. <\/p><p>- ESB is engaged in a new project allowing a fibre network to be rolled-out on its existing electricity infrastructure.  It is understood that discussions between ESB and Vodafone to form a new Joint Venture Company are at an advanced stage.  The company has initial plans to construct a fibre network directly to 450,000 premises outside of Dublin and it is expected that details will be announced over the coming weeks. <\/p><p>- Mobile operators have launched 4G high speed mobile broadband services following ComReg&rsquo;s multiband spectrum auction.  There has also been continued investment by all operators in enhancing and broadening 3G services and network improvements. <\/p><p>- Fixed wireless operators are continuing to invest in high speed point-to-point wireless broadband. <\/p><p>- The broadcaster Sky has entered the broadband market, increasing choice for consumers.<\/p><p>This accelerated roll out of high speed services by the commercial sector means that the addressable area required by the State intervention has been reduced by 30% since the National Broadband Plan was launched.  While the commercial developments are welcome the acceleration of investment is largely contained to cities and towns.  The speeds that are available in these areas are demonstrably better than those that are available in more rural areas. <\/p><p>The State has previously intervened in the telecoms sector through the Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs) Programme, by constructing eight networks in Co. Cavan and Co. Monaghan.  MANs networks were built in Bailieborough, Cavan, Cootehill and Kingscourt, County Cavan and in Carrickmacross, Castleblayney, Clones and Monaghan, County Monaghan.  These networks are all currently in use by telecoms operators, who are making telecoms services available to businesses and citizens in Cavan and Monaghan.<\/p><p>On 25th April, I signalled the Government's commitment to a major telecommunications network build-out to rural Ireland, with fibre as a cornerstone of its investment under the National Broadband Plan.  This commitment is a clear expression of Government&rsquo;s determination to address the connectivity challenge in rural Ireland in a meaningful and sustainable way.<\/p><p>Central to the strategy will be a fibre build-out to locations in every county in the State identified as having no existing or planned enabling fibre network. It is intended that the fibre will be delivered directly to access points for homes and businesses, where service providers can utilise the fibre to provide high speed services to end users.  The fibre build-out will also ensure that fibre is deployed to strategic locations on each route such as schools, business hubs and health facilities.  The fibre build out will be part of an end-to-end strategy that will address all parts of Ireland that cannot access commercial high speed broadband services.<\/p><p>I have published a county-by-county list of towns and villages which have already been identified for a fibre build-out.  This is an indicative list and is subject to the completion of the comprehensive mapping process currently under way.  Further locations may be identified as this process continues. Similarly, it may be determined that some locations on the list will be addressed by the commercial sector and will therefore not require State intervention.  Currently I envisage that a total of 38 areas in County Cavan and 36 areas in County Monaghan will be included in the proposed fibre build-out.  The list is available on my Department's website <i>.<\/i><\/p><p>In tandem with the fibre build-out, the Strategy will include measures to respond to aggregated community demand for services, and the provision of access services in the most remote areas where fibre rollout may be insufficient to stimulate commercial investment or may be cost-prohibitive. <\/p><p>Intensive design work is ongoing in the Department with a view to publishing an end-to-end implementation strategy later this year, together with the outcome of the mapping exercise which will identify the areas that require intervention.  A full public consultation will take place once the strategy is published and EU State Aids clearance will be required for the intervention strategy once finalised. It is expected that the detailed procurement process will take place in 2015 with a view to commencing construction of the fibre network and provision of services as quickly as possible.<\/p><p>The EU Commission&rsquo;s guidelines on state aid for high speed broadband infrastructure preclude member states from intervening in regions in which private investors have demonstrated plans to roll out their own infrastructure within the following three years.  In this regard it is noted that at least one network operator has published a programme to roll out 20 fibre-based broadband networks in County Cavan and 17 such networks in County Monaghan by July 2016.<\/p><p>It is my intention to ensure that rural Ireland enjoys similar opportunities to urban areas by ensuring an end-to-end market intervention with fibre as a core component.  In committing to a fibre build-out at the heart of this strategy, the Government is acknowledging that broadband is the key infrastructure of the 21<sup>st<\/sup>century.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051500053#WRL01600","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Aids and Appliances Provision","counter":368,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051500053#WRL01750"},{"type":"question","counter":369,"qnumday":139,"qnumall":"[22375\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051500053#WRL01900","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the number of defibrillators that are located in Government offices and buildings under the remit of his Department and those under his aegis throughout the country; if these are available in emergency cases outside of office hours in the community in the locations where they are based; the number and cost of same; if he will consider putting some arrangement in place whereby these defibrillators can be located where the public can get access out of office hours times in the interest of health and safety; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1100","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":370,"content":"<p>My Department has deployed four defibrillators in the offices it occupies.

The document was the outcome of a collaborative review process, which included consultation with stakeholders, undertaken by the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management in my Department.  KCS sets out an overall systemic approach to the objective of reducing the number of fires and consequent annual loss, based on a risk management approach to fire safety.  This combines the important elements of fire prevention with fire protection in buildings as well as fire service response.  For the first time in Ireland, KCS establishes a set of national standards and norms against which local authority fire service provision can be benchmarked.  The standards adopted are in keeping with international good practice in this field and provide a basis for achieving consistency across fire services.<\/p><p>The implementation phase is focussing on the integration of these national norms and standards into individual fire service planning over the period 2014 &ndash; 2015.  One of the first steps has been the preparation of &lsquo;Area Risk Categorisation&rsquo; reports by each fire service.  Three years of actual fire data has been processed as part of the &lsquo;Risk-Based Approach Project&rsquo; by the National Directorate in my Department.  This analysis has enabled local authorities to assign a fire risk categorisation by station area.  The data also allows comparison of trends for different categories of fires at individual fire station level with national norms.  Specific targets for reduction of fires are being established by station area and will be actively pursued by fire services. <\/p><p>Individual fire services are now engaged in comparing their current local services with the national norms, established for the first time in KCS, and identifying any changes required which are to be implemented before December 2015.  Fire services are also preparing the next generation of &lsquo;Section 26&rsquo; &lsquo;Fire and Emergency Operations Plans&rsquo; to be put before their Councils for consideration and adoption.<\/p><p>The process of external validation of local authority implementation of KCS, as provided for in the policy document, has commenced.  This involves the National Directorate reviewing the position of each authority in relation to the steps set out in KCS and the extent to which national norms, standards and guidance are forming the basis for fire service provision.  The first Annual External Validation Report will be completed in December 2014.  KCS recommends, inter alia, the re-alignment of fire service structures, with the current 30 services being reduced to 21 service delivery units.  The integration of fire services in Limerick, Tipperary and Waterford has been successfully undertaken and this experience provides a basis for developing the recommended &lsquo;shared services&rsquo; arrangements among fire authorities.<\/p><p>KCS is being implemented at both local authority and national level within the current resource envelope.  There is a strong collaborative approach between the National Directorate and the fire authorities to ensure that necessary implementation support arrangements are in place.  A small number of expert staff have been made available by fire authorities to the National Directorate on secondment arrangements to progress specific projects.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051500054#WRM00300","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Water Charges Introduction","counter":378,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051500054#WRM00350"},{"type":"question","counter":379,"qnumday":142,"qnumall":"[21905\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051500054#WRM00400","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the person liable for water charges in the case of rented residential properties such as private rentals, approved housing body rentals, rental accommodation scheme rentals and local authority rentals; if the user pays principle will be applied; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

There will also be provision for a rebate, when a customer moves from an assessed charge to a metered charge and usage is deemed above a reasonable threshold by comparison to the subsequent metered usage.<\/p><p>Irish Water has recently commissioned a study on possible approaches to metering properties that are not part of the current metering programme, including apartments and properties with shared service connections.  This report was recently submitted to my Department and the recommendations of the report are being considered .

The Water Services Acts 2007 and 2012 (Domestic Waste Water Treatment Systems) Regulations 2012 provide that septic tanks and similar systems should be de-sludged at intervals appropriate to the tank capacity and the number of persons resident in the premises connected to it.  Servicing and de-sludging domestic waste water treatment system s are actions which owners should be carrying out as a matter of course to ensure that their systems are functioning properly and not causing a risk to human health or the environment.

In the plan, I prioritised a number of actions for implementation in 2012, with others to be considered over a longer period as they will require detailed consultation and possibly primary legislation. Details of the expected timeframes for the implementation of individual recommendations were set out in the implementation plan.<\/p><p>Implementation of the majority of recommendations is progressing in a satisfactory manner.  For example, in response to the recommendation that there should be increased emphasis on knowledge and experience of environmental protection in the appointment of members of the Advisory Committee, I introduced the Environmental Protection Agency (Advisory Committee) Regulations 2012, which made adjustments to the bodies included in the list of prescribed bodies, notably to reflect the increasingly important interface of the environment with health matters and the EPA&rsquo;s interactions with the academic sector.  In making appointments to the 6th Advisory Committee, I also considered the suitability of persons expressing an interest in membership, the need to establish an appropriate balance of expertise in the Advisory Committee&rsquo;s overall membership and the achievement of gender balance.  However, delays have arisen in the implementation of some issues particularly those requiring legal advice and\/or legislative change. My Department and the Agency have continued to liaise on implementation and I expect to publish a review of progress made in the near future.<\/p><p>In regard to whistleblower legislation, my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Brendan Howlin, T.D., published, in July 2013, the Protected Disclosure Bill 2013, which will establish a detailed and comprehensive legislative framework protecting whistleblowers in all sectors of the economy.

This is an on-going concern for residents, local authorities and my Department.  Until taken in charge, housing developments are the responsibility of the relevant developer and in some cases receivers acting on the instructions of funders acting in possession.<\/p><p>My Department does not hold specific information in relation to the list of developments where there may be difficulties with public lighting, this being a matter for the local authorities concerned and subject to constant change as the planning enforcement, taking in charge and unfinished housing development, (UHD) processes are implemented by local authorities.  However, my Department is preparing a circular letter to issue to local authorities outlining a uniform approach to be taken by authorities with regard to public lighting in unfinished housing developments.<\/p><p>I am chairing the National Co-ordination Committee on UHDs to oversee implementation of the Report of the Advisory Group on UHDs, together with the Government&rsquo;s response to the recommendations.  My Department launched the Public Safety Initiative (PSI) in March 2011, which provided funding to address immediate public safety issues.  The types of works that have been approved to date under the PSI include the fencing off of unsecured and hazardous areas, capping of pipes, installation of street lighting and other works to secure sites.  Under the PSI, my Department has made allocations totalling &euro;4.5m to local authorities from the funding made available.  To date, &euro;3.3m has been drawn down.  My Department issued a circular to Local Authorities on 14 May advising that the deadline for drawing down PSI funding is 30 November 2014.  The Public Safety Initiative provides funding only in instances where a developer has abandoned the development.  However, in circumstances where the developer is merely inactive the responsibility for the maintenance and resolution of issues surrounding the development are matters which need to be addressed between the developer and the relevant stakeholders, and my Department has no remit in this regard.<\/p><p>Budget 2014 contained a special provision, in the form of a targeted &euro;10m Special Resolution Fund (SRF), to assist further in addressing the legacy of unfinished housing developments.  The SRF is designed to encourage the resolution of the remaining tranche of unfinished developments identified in the National Housing Development Survey 2013 and, particularly, those developments not likely to be resolved in the normal way through solely developer\/owner\/funder action because of the presence of specific financial barriers.  It is envisaged that the SRF should be particularly targeted to address the remaining unfinished developments with residents living in them and, in particular, any developments that local authorities identified, for the purposes of the Local Property Tax waiver, as in a seriously problematic condition.<\/p><p>In December 2013, my Department wrote to local authorities seeking proposals for funding support under the SRF and the deadline for receipt of applications was 28 February 2014.  All submissions have now been evaluated by my Department in accordance with the criteria that have been circulated to the local authorities.  On 2 May 2014, I announced the allocations from the &euro;10m Special Resolution Fund to 86 housing developments across the country.  This public investment will leverage an additional &euro;12m from third parties (developers\/lenders\/bonds) which will be invested in these estates.  It is hoped that the SRF will enable very substantial progress to be made in resolving as many of the remaining unfinished developments as possible.<\/p><p>Regular meetings are held between my Department and local authorities under the auspices of the National Co-ordination Committee on Unfinished Housing Developments.  However, the management of issues relating to unfinished housing developments remains a matter for the individual local authority involved.  Each local authority has appointed an Unfinished Housing Development Co-ordinator; contact details can be found on the Housing Agency's website:<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051500054#WRM02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Projects Expenditure","counter":401,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051500055#WRN00075"},{"type":"question","counter":402,"qnumday":152,"qnumall":"[22023\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051500055#WRN00100","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will provide funding to complete the Dingle inner relief road; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The recommendations for development of the sector included the identification of &ldquo;target markets for which access for Irish beef, beef offals and breeding stock should be secured&rdquo;.<\/p><p>  My strategy for implementing this recommendation is to constantly develop relationships in existing and in new and expanding international markets, raising the profile of Ireland and increasing international confidence in Irish production and control systems. Since taking office I have led trade missions to China, the US, Algeria and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries in the Middle East. <\/p><p>  There is a strong demand for meat globally and my focus is aimed at enabling Irish exporters to take advantage of the opportunities that arise. My Department engages on a daily basis with many countries, in collaboration with Bord Bia and Irish embassies&rsquo; personnel on market access issues. These initiatives have led to a number of notable successes in securing market access from authorities in Japan, Singapore, Egypt and Iran.  This year to date we have agreed access terms with the Lebanon and Namibia.<\/p><p>  In November 2013, the US lifted its ban on the importation of beef from the European Union. This was one of my priorities the previous year when I visited the US, where I pushed the matter strongly with the US Department of Agriculture Secretary of State, Tom Vilsack and in meetings with Senators.  My Department is currently working with the meat industry to advance the various technical requirements to ensure commencement of the trade at the earliest possible date.<\/p><p>  In December 2013, a delegation from my Department visited China for discussions with authorities there on the lifting of the beef BSE ban which prohibits imports from any EU country.

A positive outcome to the visit could lead to export opportunities to this premium market in the near future. <\/p><p>  Irish beef is now listed with more than 75 high-end retail chains across EU markets. This wide portfolio of customers has contributed significantly to higher returns for Irish beef in recent years and reflects the success of Bord Bia&rsquo;s differentiation and premiumisation strategy which focuses on the key attributes of Irish beef: environmentally sustainable, grass-based production systems, full traceability, quality assurance at all stages and superior eating quality. Among Bord Bia&rsquo;s key initiatives this year is the continued development, global promotion and marketing of its Origin Green initiative, designed to establish Ireland as a world leader in sustainably produced food and drink. Over 200 companies are currently working with Bord Bia to develop, and commit to, sustainability plans setting out clear targets in emissions, energy, waste, water, biodiversity and corporate social responsibility activities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051500057#WRP00500","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sugar Industry","counter":468,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051500057#WRP00550"},{"type":"question","counter":469,"qnumday":176,"qnumall":"[21977\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051500057#WRP00600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the progress that is being made in the re-establishment of the sugar industry.

In 2011 I met with two separate groups which had conducted feasibility studies into the possibility of establishing a new sugar\/bioethanol facility in the country. I understand from figures published by the interested groups who are investigating the possibility of building a new facility, that the overall capital costs involved could range from &euro;250million to &euro;400million, depending on what type of facility will be constructed.<\/p><p>  I informed both groups at the time and many times since, that any venture to develop a combined sugar\/bioethanol production facility would have to be a viable commercial proposition, and supported by a business case which is sufficiently robust to attract the funding from investors for the very substantial capital investment required.  I also informed both groups that it was my job to look for agreement at EU level to allow for the growing of sugar beet for the manufacture of sugar, at the earliest possible date.<\/p><p>  In this connection, at the last meeting of the Council of Agriculture Ministers in June 2013, which I chaired under Ireland&rsquo;s EU Presidency, I secured agreement as part of the overall CAP reform package, to abolish all sugar quotas by 30 September 2017. This agreement removes, with effect from 1 October 2017, the current quota barrier for operators in Ireland or other Member States, wishing to re-establish a sugar industry. I am glad to note that this agreement has been welcomed by those parties who are interested in seeking to re-establish a sugar industry here. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051500057#WRP00700","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fish Farming","counter":471,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051500057#WRP00750"},{"type":"question","counter":472,"qnumday":177,"qnumall":"[22013\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051500057#WRP00800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will supply all the data requested by the EU regarding the EIS in respect of the Galway Bay licence application for commercial salmon farming, his views regarding whether it is appropriate that he is the arbiter in an application from his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1015","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":473,"content":"<p>An application by Bord Iascaigh Mhara (BIM) for an aquaculture licence for the cultivation of finfish near Inis Oirr in Galway Bay was received by my Department in 2012.

Secondly, in quoting a figure in respect of Judicial Reviews it is important to note that the figures only represents the number of persons who have an active JR at that particular point in time.  Thus a case which has been held up for a significant period of time (sometimes years), and only recently been decided \/ withdrawn \/ settled will not be reflected in figures quoted below.  However, such Judicial Reviews will be the primary reason why many cases are over 5 years in the system even though the applicant currently may not be subject to an active Judicial Review.  In addition, because families are invariably processed together a Judicial Review by a single member of a family will have the effect of holding up the processing of a significantly larger number of persons in the system.  Finally, where a person has more than one JR taken against various bodies such as the ORAC, RAT, INIS, etc. these are counted only once in the figures.<\/p><p>For the reasons outlined above it would be misleading to draw a direct correlation between the number of active Judicial Reviews and the number of applications of a particular age profile in the system.  However, it is clear, for the reasons outlined in the preceding paragraphs that Judicial Reviews have a major impact on processing times and the number of applicants impacted is significantly greater than the number of active Judicial Reviews in the system at any particular point in time.  While every applicant has, of course, the right to seek redress in the Courts, the reality is that such Reviews (sometimes taken at different stages of the process) will inevitably prolong the period the applicants remain in the system until a final determination can be made in their case.<\/p><p>I am advised by the INIS that there are around 900 Judicial Reviews currently ongoing in respect of the persons who made an application for asylum over 5 years ago.  There are over 350 Judicial Reviews challenging Deportation Orders, a very large proportion of which relate to failed protection applicants whose cases are more than five years old. The other JR&rsquo;s are challenging decisions of the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner ORAC), appeal decisions of the Office of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal (RAT) or subsidiary protection decisions.<\/p><p>With regards to the processing of applications for subsidiary protection, the Deputy will be aware that responsibility for the processing of subsidiary protection applications passed from the Minister for Justice and Equality to ORAC in November 2013 when I signed into law the European Union (Subsidiary Protection) Regulations 2013 (S.I. No. 426 of 2013).  Significant effort and additional resources (including engaging a panel of legally qualified persons to process cases) are being allocated to the establishment and operation of the new arrangements for the processing of these cases which include personal interviews for each applicant at the first instance and oral appeals by RAT of decisions of the ORAC.  The ORAC, in consultation with the UNHCR, have recently published on its website details of how it will prioritise the process of scheduling persons for interview taking into account, inter-alia, dealing with applicants who are longest in the system first.  The intention in any event is to process as many of these cases as possible to finality together with consideration of any leave to remain aspects arising by the end of this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051500058#WRQ00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Criminal Prosecutions","counter":509,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051500058#WRQ00950"},{"type":"question","counter":510,"qnumday":189,"qnumall":"[21942\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051500058#WRQ01000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if the report by the Garda Commissioner regarding a convicted sex abuser (details supplied) in County Donegal has been completed and made available to her; if she will consider releasing the report to the victims; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"959","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":511,"content":"<p>I am informed by the Garda authorities that, following an investigation by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, a report in relation to the case was forwarded to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP).

As the Deputy will be aware the Refugee Appeals Tribunal is a statutory independent body established under the Refugee Act, 1996 to decide appeals against negative recommendations in respect of applications for refugee status issued by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner (ORAC) and to make recommendations to the Minister for Justice and Equality in relation to whether or not refugee status should be granted.<\/p><p>In accordance with the Refugee Act 1996, Tribunal members are appointed by the Minister and shall hold office on a part time basis for a term of three years on terms and conditions determined by the Minister and agreed with members by way of signed contract. The contract stipulates that a member of the Tribunal may be removed from office by the Minister for stated reasons, including, but not limited to, failure to complete agreed business workloads within time frames agreed with the Chairperson; failure to furnish reports and decisions within a time frame set by the Chairperson or breach of any of the other terms and conditions of the contract.<\/p><p>The management of the Tribunal is the responsibility of the Chairperson who under the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) is required &ldquo;<i>to ensure that the business of the Tribunal is managed efficiently and that the business assigned to each division is disposed of as expeditiously as may be consistent with fairness and natural justice<\/i>&rdquo;.  The Chairperson is statutorily responsible for assigning the workload to individual members.<\/p><p>The Deputy may be aware that in August, 2013 a new Chairperson of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal was appointed following a selection process run in conjunction with the Public Appointments Service. Since taking up his position, I understand that the Chairperson has begun a major review of Tribunal practices, procedures and guidelines.  In September, 2013 the Assigning Policy of the Tribunal was published, which details how cases are assigned amongst the various members of the Tribunal. The new Chairperson has also established a Tribunal Users Group which comprises of the Chairperson and representatives nominated by the Law Society and the Bar Council. I am informed that the group will meet on a regular basis to discuss matters of interest and\/or concern to users of the Tribunal.  I am advised that the Group has considered draft procedural guidelines which will set out the practice and procedure relating to how appeals are dealt with by the Tribunal. Other guidelines are also in preparation, including a comprehensive guideline for dealing with child applicants.<\/p><p>Following on from the appointment of new Tribunal members and the expansion of the Tribunal's remit to the area of subsidiary protection under the European Union (Subsidiary Protection) Regulations 2013, which my predecessor signed into law in November 2013, a comprehensive training programme has been undertaken by the Tribunal, to ensure that the new members are fully equipped to discharge their duties to the highest professional standards.<\/p><p>I am informed that as part of this training programme, the Tribunal has been working closely with the UNHCR in developing a new decision template designed to enhance the robustness of the process and to assist Members in their difficult task. This process has been greatly enhanced by the participation, via the UNHCR, of an internationally recognised former Canadian refugee law judge who has been central to the training provided.<\/p><p>The Tribunal has further advised me that it is actively managing its judicial review caseload by early intervention and negotiating to keep costs to a minimum. The Tribunal continues to work closely with the CSSO to achieve the best possible outcomes to such legal challenges.<\/p><p>The Chairperson in his strategy statement for 2014-2017 commits the Tribunal &quot;to consider and decide refugee, subsidiary protection and Dublin Regulation appeals to the highest professional standards&quot;. He has also committed to an ambitious reform programme to achieve the Tribunal's strategic goals and to undertaking a review of Tribunal policy on public access to Tribunal documents, including the Tribunal's database of previous decisions.<\/p><p>I am confident that the developments which I have outlined will have a major impact on the performance and perception of the Tribunal as they are integrated into its ethos and practices in the coming year.<\/p><p>With regard to the Deputy's assertions in relation to the &quot;defiance by a second RAT member ...&quot;, I am advised by the Chairperson of the Tribunal, that when a case is remitted to the Tribunal for a re-hearing the member assigned the case is not made aware of the previous judicial review, as to do so could prejudice an applicant.  The legal advisors for the applicant may bring attention to any previous judgement if they wish to do so.  However, the hearing is a <i>de novo<\/i>hearing and the member concerned must be satisfied that the applicant satisfies the legal test for asylum.  The Chairman has further advised that in the case concerned, the written judgment of Harding Clarke J., referred to by the Deputy was not available to the second member who heard the case, as it was only issued in January 2014.<\/p><p>It must be remembered that members of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal are independent in the exercise of their functions, and it is a matter for the Tribunal to consider whether a person is a refugee or not.  The High Court, on a judicial review, considers the process by which the decision was reached and does not enter into the merits of the case.<\/p><p>Finally, the Deputy might wish to know that the applicant in question was granted refugee status this month on foot of his appeal to the Tribunal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051500058#WRQ01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":515,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051500058#WRQ01350"},{"type":"question","counter":516,"qnumday":191,"qnumall":"[21951\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051500058#WRQ01400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"to set out the amount her Department has spent on translation and interpreting services over the past ten years; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":517,"content":"<p>I will contact the Deputy directly on this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051500058#WRQ01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Management Companies","counter":518,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051500058#WRQ01550"},{"type":"question","counter":519,"qnumday":192,"qnumall":"[21955\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051500058#WRQ01600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"to explain the rights a homeowner who is paying management company fees annually has to ensure that the steps to the property are fully fixed by the management company (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":520,"content":"<p>While I am not in a position to interpret the law or to comment on individual cases in response to a Parliamentary Question, the general position is that an owners' management company (OMC) has obligations to maintain and, where necessary, repair common areas of a multi-unit development for which it has responsibility.

A Project Board, comprising senior representatives of the three Departments concerned along with the Chief Executive Officers of the three Agencies, is overseeing the merger.  The CEO Designate of the merged body, who acts as Project Manager for the merger, was appointed from 1 July 2013.  It is anticipated that Ministerial responsibility for the Valuation Office and Ordnance Survey Ireland will be transferred to the Minister for Justice and Equality in due course.  It is anticipated that the General Scheme of a Bill will be brought to Government for approval to draft by mid-year.<\/p><p>The merger of the Valuation Office, Ordnance Survey Ireland and the Property Registration Authority provides an opportunity for more efficient and cost-effective delivery of land, spatial data and property administration services.  Savings in the short to medium term are anticipated from the consolidation of common back office functions such as Human Resources, conventional ICT systems, Financial Management and a potential reduction in the cost of accommodation and software licensing.  In the longer term, more efficiencies\/synergies may be achievable in operational areas and through the exploitation, including where possible commercialisation, of combined data sets.<\/p><p><b>The Human Rights Commission and the Equality Authority.<\/b><\/p><p>On 8 September 2011, the Government decided to merge the Human Rights Commission and the Equality Authority to establish the new and enhanced Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC) to promote human rights and equality issues in a more efficient, effective and coherent way.<\/p><p>There are no savings anticipated given that since 2008, the Equality Authority and the Human Rights Commission had experienced budget cuts of 43% and 32% respectively.  Staffing numbers also decreased significantly and continued to reduce until this year.  In 2008 the combined staffing compliment was 74 staff.  In 2012 at the time of the Working Group Report on the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, the combined complement had been reduced to 46.<\/p><p>The 2014 allocation to the IHREC is &euro;6.299m, a figure which represents an increase of &euro;2m approximately on the 2013 allocation.  A staff allocation of 47 was agreed with a provision for a review of this figure in 12 to 18 months time in light of experience once the additional staff have been recruited and are in place.<\/p><p><b>The Prisons Authority Interim Board. <\/b><\/p><p>The Prisons Authority Interim Board was abolished on 26 July 2011.  The amount saved was in excess of &euro;100,000 per annum.<\/p><p><b>Legal Aid Board.<\/b><\/p><p>Responsibility for the administration of three ad-hoc Criminal Legal Aid Schemes was transferred to the Legal Aid Board.<\/p><p><i>Garda Station Legal Advice Scheme<\/i><\/p><p>The Scheme provides that where a person is detained in a Garda station for the purpose of the investigation of an offence and s\/he has a legal entitlement to consult with a solicitor and the person's means are insufficient to enable him\/her to pay for such consultation, such consultations with solicitors will be paid for by the State.  Responsibility for the administration of the Scheme was transferred to the Legal Aid Board on 1 October 2011.<\/p><p><i>Legal Aid Custody Issues Scheme<\/i><\/p><p>This Scheme provides payment for legal representation in the High Court and the Supreme Court for certain types of cases not covered by civil legal aid or the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme namely (i) Habeas Corpus Applications, (ii) Supreme Court Bail Motions, (iii) Judicial Reviews, (iv) Extradition Applications and European Arrest Warrants and (v) High Court Bail Motions.  Responsibility for the administration of the Scheme was transferred to the Legal Aid Board on 1 June 2012. <\/p><p><i>Criminal Assets Bureau Legal Aid Scheme<\/i><\/p><p>The Scheme is applicable to persons who are respondents and\/or defendants in any court proceedings brought by, or in the name of, the Criminal Assets Bureau including court proceedings under the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996, the Revenue Acts or the Social Welfare Acts and applications made by the Director of Public Prosecutions under Section 39 of the Criminal Justice Act 1994.  Responsibility for the administration of the Scheme was transferred to the Legal Aid Board on 1 January 2014.<\/p><p>It is proposed that the administration of the main Criminal Legal Aid Scheme will be transferred to the Legal Aid Board on foot of new legislation which is currently being drafted.  This move will be in keeping with the international model for the delivery of legal aid and advice services and will achieve a more dedicated focus to the management and delivery of Criminal Legal Aid.  It would be premature at present to commit to a date for the transfer of the scheme.<\/p><p>In addition, the Board took on responsibility for the Family Mediation Service (FMS) in November 2011 which had previously been under the auspices of the Family Support Agency.  A key reason for this transferring was to improve the synergies between the State funded family mediation services and the State funded civil legal aid services (most of the demand for legal services is in the area of family law).  Improving the synergies will be for the benefit of the customer and will help move away from a &lsquo;litigation first&rsquo; approach that may on occasion be too common.  Already there are very positive signs from a pilot initiative operating in Dolphin House (where the Dublin District Family Court sits) involving the co-location of the courts and a mediation service with a legal service.  Similar initiatives have now been introduced in Cork and Naas and are being evaluated.  The transfer of the FMS to the Legal Aid Board has also given rise to savings resulting from efficiencies in respect of operating costs.  These savings have allowed the Board to allocate additional funding to mediation services to the tune of over &euro;430,000 in 2013 compared to 2011.  Overall, this represents a saving of approximately 17% based on the expenditure of the FMS in 2011 before it transferred to the Board.<\/p><p><b>Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Complaints Board.<\/b><\/p><p>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 allowed for the establishment of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission to replace the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Complaints Board and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Complaints Appeal Board.<\/p><p>The Complaints Board is made up of a Chairperson and 8 members appointed in 2012 for a five year term as it was necessary to have a Board in existence until any outstanding cases had concluded.  The current status of the Board is that the final case against it was struck out by the Supreme Court on 29 November 2013.  The members do not receive any fees and their term of office will automatically cease when the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Complaints) Act 1986 is repealed.  The repeal of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Complaints) Act 1986 will automatically dissolve the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Complaints Board and the separate Appeal Board. <\/p><p>The Appeal Board is made up of a Chairperson, who must be a Judge of the Circuit Court, and two ordinary members.  Their term of office expired on 16 December 2013.  No membership fee is paid to the members of the Appeal Board.  The two ordinary members received a payment for each sitting of the Board.  As there are no longer any cases involving the Complaints Board, the appeal function is not required and no issue arises with the expiry of the term of office.<\/p><p>The Department is making arrangements to repeal the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Complaints) Act 1986 (as amended) which will automatically result in the winding up of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Complaints Boards.  The necessary Order to repeal the Act has been drafted and will be submitted in the coming weeks to the Minister for signing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051500060#WRS02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Health","counter":594,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051500060#WRS02200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Aids and Appliances Provision","counter":593,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051500060#WRS02150"},{"type":"question","counter":594,"qnumday":217,"qnumall":"[21886\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051500060#WRS02200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the approximate number of defibrillators in schools throughout the country; his views on the number of these that are locked inside schools and not available outside school hours; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1100","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":595,"qnumday":218,"qnumall":"[21889\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051500060#WRS02300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the approximate number of defibrillators in existence in local Government office throughout the country; his views on the number of these that are locked inside public buildings and not available outside office hours; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

There is currently no structured public access defibrillation programme in operation in Ireland that specifies the conditions for providing defibrillators in public places.<\/p><p>  The Public Health (Availability of Defibrillators) Bill 2013 that is currently on Committee Stage outlines a scheme that would require the owners of particular types of premises or venues to install and maintain defibrillators so that they would be available for public use.  The Bill sets out the requirement to provide defibrillators in a range of settings and for events which have a regular attendance in excess of 100 persons per day.  It was agreed that there are a number or questions that need to be considered when designing a public defibrillation programme for Ireland and Government approval was therefore granted for the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) to undertake a Health Technology Assessment (HTA) of a Public Access Defibrillator Programme for Ireland.  <\/p><p>  The first meeting of the Expert Advisory Group on Public Access Defibrillation took place on 13th March 2014 with a second meeting due to take place in June 2014 and the third meeting and Final Draft Report Stage being undertaken in August 2014.  In mid-September, 2014 it is envisaged that a Public Consultation will begin, ending on or about 17th October 2014.<\/p><p>  The health technology assessment of public access defibrillation currently being conducted by HIQA will examine the clinical and cost-effectiveness of different configurations of any potential public access defibrillation programme.  No information is available on the exact numbers of AEDs that are currently in use in Ireland.  Based on data from a number of suppliers, it is estimated that in excess of 17,000 units have been sold in this country since 1998.  However no information is currently available on the locations of these devices, what proportion are maintained and functional, and how many are available for use by the public.  Analysis of the existing availability of automatic external defibrillators will form part of the HIQA health technology assessment that is due to be completed in mid November 2014.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051500060#WRS02600","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Funding","counter":600,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051500061#WRT00150"},{"type":"question","counter":601,"qnumday":219,"qnumall":"[21929\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051500061#WRT00200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the State funding of an organisation (details supplied) receives from the Government; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"981","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":602,"content":"<p>My Department does not provide any funding to the organisation referred to in the Deputy's question.

Under the Act, the regulatory system comprises a registration board for each of the twelve designated professions, a Health and Social Care Professionals Council with overall responsibility for the boards, and a committee structure to deal with disciplinary matters.  The Council and registration boards are known collectively as CORU.  To date, five registration boards, including the Social Workers Registration Board,  are operational and it is planned that all twelve registration boards will be established by the end of 2015.<\/p><p>  The Social Workers Registration Board's two year transitional period, during which social workers practising in the State must apply for registration in order to continue to use their title, ended on 31 May 2013.

It would be an offence under the Act for any other person to use the title of social worker; any such alleged offence coming to CORU's attention would be immediately and thoroughly investigated and liable to prosecution.

The objective is to create an innovative and dynamic blueprint for the future development of Ireland&rsquo;s early years sector and a coherent approach to seeking to improve the lives of children from birth to 6 years.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs is committed to ensuring high standards in early years service provision, both in terms of care and curriculum. The role of quality provision is critical in contributing to childhood development and this key objective will be reflected fully in the Early Years Strategy.<\/p><p>  One of the specific issues of policy which has been identified for consideration in the preparation of the new Strategy is the future role and regulation of the childminding sector, which is already an important component of early childhood care and education.  At present preschool services are subject to the Child Care (Pre-School Services) (No.2) Regulations 2006, as provided for under Part VII of the Child Care Act 1991.<\/p><p>  Services providing care for children who have not yet commenced primary school are required to notify their service to the Early Years Inspectorate of the Child and Family Agency and are subject to inspection and report by the Inspectorate on a regular basis.  Services covered by the Regulations include full-time, part-time and sessional services as well as childminders taking care of more than three preschool children from different families in the childminder&rsquo;s home.<\/p><p>  Childminders who are not subject to the requirement to notify are, however, encouraged to voluntarily notify their service to their local City or County Childcare Committee which provides a range of supports to enable them to improve the standards of their child care service. These supports include the Childminders Tax Exemption scheme which provides for a tax exemption for those childminders who have satisfactorily participated in the Voluntary Notification process and whose annual income from childminding does not exceed &euro;15,000.<\/p><p>  Some &euro;10 million of funding, allied to these supports, was invested over a period of 10 years to encourage childminders to notify.  This was seen as a potential first step to bringing all non-family childminders under the Regulations. This stepped approach has worked in some countries, such as Scotland.  However, only 1250 childminders voluntarily notified here and a further 2,000 to 3,000 participate in training.  It is clear that there are barriers specific to Ireland in bringing childminders under the regulatory framework.    The Early Years Strategy will include consideration of how this complex issue might be addressed in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051500066#WRY01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Aids and Appliances Provision","counter":772,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051500066#WRY01550"},{"type":"question","counter":773,"qnumday":283,"qnumall":"[22374\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051500066#WRY01600","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the number of defibrillators located in Government offices and buildings under the remit of his Department and under his aegis throughout the country; if these are available in emergency cases outside of office hours in the community in the locations where they are based; the number and cost of same; if he will consider putting some arrangement in place whereby these defibrillators can be located where the public can get access to them outside of office hours in the interest of health and safety; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1100","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":774,"content":"<p>The Department of Children and Youth Affairs is located in Mespil Road, Dublin 4.
