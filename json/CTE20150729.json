I very much appreciate the opportunity of being here today.  Rather than repeating my witness statement verbatim, in the interest of time I plan to give a brief introduction to my responsibilities and time with EBS, explain why I believe EBS was more of a casualty rather than a cause of this crisis and briefly comment on a number of very select topics which I guess would be of particular interest to the committee.<\/p> <p>  I joined EBS in the summer of 2005 as finance director.  Prior to this I had been with PwC for a little over 17 years.<\/p><p>I was on the audit and advisory team of the firm and I was the partner responsible for leading the firm's banking, audit and advisory practice.  I was privileged to have practically all the Irish banks amongst my client base, including the Central Bank of Ireland and Bank of Ireland.  I was very happy in PwC.  Nevertheless, having been courted by EBS, I was eventually convinced to leave, attracted by the opportunity of testing myself in industry and by the wider challenge of ongoing professionalisation of the society and, of course, championing mutuality.<\/p><p> I ultimately ended up spending only a little over three and a half years with EBS and yet this very short period crossed both the tail-end of a long boom period that this country had enjoyed and the beginnings of what I would describe as two devastating crashes: the first being the global liquidity crisis which triggered the second, being our own catastrophic banking and property market crash.  During the short, three and a half year period, I served under and diligently worked alongside, in very challenging circumstances, three different chief executives.  I was given a wider role than might be considered the norm for a traditional finance director and, broadly speaking, this role might be best characterised as, in effect, being more like that of a COO, a chief operating officer.  For instance, finance, treasury, commercial lending, operations, IT, internal audit, investor relations and risk, amongst others, all came under my areas of responsibility.  I would emphasise that each of these important areas had their own head of finance, head of function - all well very well qualified and experienced in their subject matter fields and clearly responsible for the day-to-day runnings of their functions and\/or departments.  I had a very loyal, hard-working and talented team and strong support throughout this period from both our head office and the network, which I was, and continue to be, very grateful for.<\/p><p> As you may know, I stepped down - and reluctantly so - in early 2009.  This was voluntary, in that I agreed that, as a mutual, it was important to show accountability to our members and other stakeholders for what had transpired in EBS and, in addition to the chairman resigning, I was the obvious choice at executive level to accompany him at that time.  Similar to others, I would have preferred to have stayed and helped but we felt that, on balance, the right thing was that I should exit along with the chairman.<\/p><p> Let me emphasise that EBS was different.  I think it's a very, very important point to acknowledge.  It was a member-owned, non-profit organisation.  It was the last remaining true building society in Ireland.  It was established for teachers, was strongly supported amongst the public sector - guards and nurses, amongst others - and its people, whether at branch level or at head office, root and branch had a DNA and a culture of being community based and member focused.  It was not focused on profit.  It was about people, it was about trying to serve members better through superior service, real trust and competitive pricing compared to the banks, and to be relevant.  It was a very democratic organisation, with a diverse board and true member representation.  It was an alternative to the commercially-driven banks.  It had a good culture and spirit, but neither was it perfect.  The fact pattern, whether it was well understood or not, EBS was fighting for survival and relevance, not only in 2009 or 2010 but also back in 2005 and, indeed, before that.  Had it not competed in the market, EBS, as Ireland's last true building society, would have ended up gone like the 20 other building societies that this country once had.<\/p><p> Running down the balance sheet realistically was not an alternative, so EBS continued doing what the board collectively thought best to preserve mutuality.  This meant defending its natural mortgage market share and growing its non-member businesses to aid the member business.  This strategy of running both a member and a non-member business in parallel had been successfully deployed by others in the UK and various international studies have shown that having a mutual is good for the market as a whole.  However, as we all know now, regardless, the society was lost.<\/p><p> Let me comment on some specific matters that I think would be of particular interest to the committee.  Risk appetite: I want to bring some clarity on this topic and, in particular, commercial property and development lending by EBS.  Quite a number of commentators have questioned why a building society would be in those markets at all.<\/p><p>Firstly, just to emphasise that my understanding is that the building society legislation was explicitly changed to allow for this.  The Oireachtas must have felt it appropriate and justified and it was against this backdrop that EBS first entered commercial lending in 1991, and not, I might emphasise, 2005.  And I note that as part of its then approved board strategy, EBS embarked on development lending as a sub-strategy of commercial lending business in 2001 and, again, I would emphasise, not in 2005.  The commercial business was circa &euro;1.5 billion and the development lending book was circa &euro;100 million by the time I joined in July 2005.  From the information I've been able to glean in preparation for today, the development lending book, which was built up to circa &euro;500 million by the end of 2008, gave rise to about &euro;300 million of crystalised losses.  For clarity of understanding, I'd like to highlight that whilst undoubtedly the development finance losses were shocking and a very severe blow to EBS, they did not bring about its demise.  Rather, the facts clearly show that given the magnitude of the total capital ultimately needed for EBS, which was a multiple of this number, clearly a multitude of factors - which evolved over a very considerable length of time - lead to its business model failure and not just development and\/or commercial lending.  And I'll be happy to elaborate on this in questioning.<br\/><br\/>Whilst of little comfort, I would also note that risk management and best practices always evolve.  And whilst EBS made mistakes - and, for example, the controls we put in place such as the 3% cap on development finance, were inadequate - by late 2007 and early 2008 we were actually ahead of the curve and this is evident by firstly two clear facts: we were the first to exit these businesses; and, secondly, our loan-loss provisioning at the end of 2008 was more realistic than the banks'.  During my time with EBS,  capital funding and liquidity were always key agenda items for the EBS board and the risk committees.  There was good MIS and intelligence continuously available and there was definitely a sophistication and a depth in the society management team of these critical areas.  For a small financial institution, we had the benefit of both a head of treasury and a head of capital markets, both with deep treasury experience, who, alongside risk, finance and strategy personnel, also had a strong appreciation of these important pillars of banking.  Actions were taken continuously by the board of management to mitigate these risks, including widening and lengthening our funding programmes, improving our collateral position markedly over this period, investing in the infrastructure necessary to establish our covered bond bank - which, amongst other things, brought further emergency liquidity protection - and raising of PIBS, permanent interest-bearing shares, to improve capital ratios and lost absorption, etc.  However, in truth, these were remedies which created breathing space for the <i>status quo<\/i>to be maintained, rather than being sufficiently, materially corrective.  Consequently, when the crisis did arrive, EBS was, whilst relatively better placed than others, still poorly positioned to withstand the overwhelming stresses it brought.<br\/><br\/>In wrapping up, let me say a couple of things.  Many hard-working people and families all over Ireland, through no fault of their own, were just trying to get on with normal life and do the right thing.  They continue to suffer today from this global financial crisis.  In truth, for them, certainly in the wrong place at the wrong time.  This, in my view, arose in particular because of how, in Ireland, the property and banking market was allowed evolve here.  And hindsight clearly shows us that Ireland's comparably greater systemic vulnerability in this disaster evolved unchecked by those who ought to have been able to genuinely make a difference or at least provide some meaningful shelter.  EBS is not without fault but the hard truth, if you want my considered insight, is that successive Governments and the authorities, local and European, have much to answer for and more so than EBS.  EBS was different - it was very much more of a casualty of this one-in-100-year crash than a cause.  As the only real building society we had left, it fought a good fight.  Yes, it failed but not for the want of trying.  It was definitely not a root cause of this crisis locally, never mind internationally.  Of course it made mistakes and we had failings and these are regretted.  But EBS was essentially a small fish in a big pond in an even bigger world, where we were takers and not makers of how banking funding worked.<\/p><p>Within that system, EBS was trying to make a positive difference.  It didn't give up on mutuality.  Maybe that was a mistake; maybe it wasn't.  I hope this somewhat panoramic and very personal perspective is of help, Chairman, and I'm happy to take questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015072900002#E00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Alan Merriman","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1438124400,"counter":15,"content":"<p>Thank you very much, Mr. Merriman, for your opening comments this morning and if I can invite Senator Marc MacSharry, please, to begin questioning.

Times clearly changed.  You had the Irish banks coming into the mortgage market and competing very aggressively and it became a core part of their business.  And then, over and above that, you had the foreign banks came in ... encouraged to come into the market because at the time before their arrival there was a concern about oligopolies and cartels and pricing and competition.  So the foreign banks came in and they were incredibly aggressive at two levels.  You had certain banks like Danske Bank who targeted the refinance market, very low LTVs, but, effectively, practically no margin.  And you had the likes of Ulster Bank who very aggressively went after the first-time buyer market.

I mean it notes that commercial is an area that has more than tripled in scale to about &euro;1.6 billion of the loan book.  But the problem as it outlines in 2005 is that the lenders are lower risk, meaning good asset quality but low margins so the desire then is to go for higher-risk businesses.  Now when Fergus Murphy was before us, he said on page 61 that ... of the transcript, that \"the society entered into [the] marketplace [late and] at times [it] tended to do business  ... with secondary ... developers and ... investors\" in secondary locations and that the society wasn't \"getting the better business, maybe none of the business was good\".<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015072900002#O02600","speaker":"1034"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1438124400,"counter":205,"content":"<p>You know, look, I ... and I think Fergus said this himself that, you know, because we were exiting the commercial business shortly after he joined, he wouldn't have had what I might call as granular an understanding of the commercial business as perhaps Brian Healy would have had or, indeed, myself.  I mean I'll be very clear that ... and let me explain.  First of all, the low risk versus high risk.  The commercial business EBS had at that point in time wasn't generating a sufficiently attractive return for the risk that was there.  And what I mean by that is that if you have a limited amount of funding to allocate, if you are going to allocate it to a non-member business, so it's not going to your members - you are taking it away from your members to give it somewhere else - you have to ensure you are getting an adequate return.  So that was the motivation for looking to move the needle on the risk curve.  Fergus's comment, I would say to you very clearly: commercial was built up from 1991.  I would say that if you look at the analysis when it was done on the development of ... the development of finance book of &euro;500 million, 70% of that business was done to established developers and builders.  So I am clearly and again, just bear in mind the context here ... the total book is &euro;500 million.  So, the maximum loan we might have had, and, again, I am not going to remember the exact numbers, but broadly speaking, I think, it would have been &euro;50 million.  If you could lend at most &euro;50 million to a single relationship, EBS wasn't going to be in a position that it was going to be banking the Glass Bottle site or Ballsbridge.  So clearly, by definition, we were lending our money out in the areas that could accommodate that type of lending.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015072900002#O02700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Alan Merriman"},{"type":"speech","time":1438124400,"counter":206,"content":"<p>So was Fergus Murphy wrong then, in that they ... none of the business was good?

Yes, it was competing in a very, very tough market place.  Yes, it was having to establish and build relationships.  Therefore, you wouldn't ordinarily expect to have the business that would be the best business - for obvious reasons.  Developers themselves want to build relationships, they want to have the confidence that somebody is going to be able to bank them etc., etc.  However, having said all of that, so it was a tough environment for EBS to build up that business but it was mandated to do it.  It was a strategy to do it.  Now, best way of being objective in terms of answering your question, let's talk about the discounts that were applied to the books across all the banks that went into NAMA and the subsequent deleveraging that was done.  Fergus himself explained that the EBS discount was, I think, 57%.  Big picture, that's within the goalposts of the other banks.  So objectively, it wasn't any ... it wasn't much worse than others-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015072900002#O02900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Alan Merriman"},{"type":"speech","time":1438124400,"counter":208,"content":"<p>As worse-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015072900002#O03000","speaker":"1034"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1438124400,"counter":209,"content":"<p>Well, it wasn't 61% or 62% or 63%.  But, equally, in EBS's case, the other banks only transferred loans that were greater than &euro;5 million.  There was a special case for EBS.  The entire books were transferred.  So you are not comparing apples with apples.  And if you look at the &euro;2.5 billion that Fergus himself testified about; where he talked about that they had to deleverage &euro;2.5 billion and it ended up with a write-off of, I think he said, &euro;500 million.  The aggregate discount of those two taken together is less than 30%.  So I would say that objectively, the facts demonstrate that the EBS business wasn't any worse than what was being done in the market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015072900002#O03100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Alan Merriman"},{"type":"speech","time":1438124400,"counter":210,"content":"<p>Okay.

Papers had been circulated prior to the meeting.<\/blockquote>And then talks about the counterparty limits of the institutions that EBS now would engage with as part of this cross transactions:<blockquote>The Board resolved to<br \/><br \/>(a) increase the counterparty credit limits for AIB, Anglo, Bank of Ireland, IL&amp;amp;P and INBS to &euro;200m, with the quantum increase above credit limits exclusively available for issuance covered under the terms and period of the government guarantee scheme.<\/blockquote>I just want to refer to two institutions there.  We have it on record here that the NTMA had such concerns with regard to Irish Nationwide ... INBS, that they wouldn't put a brass farthing into them and wouldn't do so for years.

In terms of the specific question that you are asking me, my recollection is that Ethna moved on to the board advances committee, which is the committee of the board that approves loans beyond a certain size.  I am guessing that was perhaps in this time period December 2006 to April 2007 and that's the committee amongst the board members that gets individual loan documents to approve if the society wishes to do it.

If the market is not growing and people are trying to get 5%, 10%, 15% growth, there is going to be winners and losers.

And that was clearly done to the satisfaction of the regulator because there was no subsequent correspondence on the matter.  The third thing I'd say is - and I think it's an important point in terms of giving you some personal insights - when we talk about the regulator, and in this case we're talking about the Financial Regulator here, there's many different components of the regulator.  So there's the Pat Neary level, there's the head of the banking division level, there's teams that might do a thematic review of \"know your customer\", or there's an inspector who's doing a very detailed review, regardless of the wording, of the loan files.  So my broad insight to you would be ... look, I can completely understand that somebody reads this cold and they go \"Jesus, what's going on here?\"  Completely get that.  What I will say to you, candidly, is that unfortunately the practice amongst the regulator was they'd come in and they would do these reviews, they wouldn't engage properly in terms of getting clarity while on site and then they would then send very detailed questions to have clarification.  But, much more importantly, I'd be standing back and I'd be saying \"Okay, look, this level of inspection was going on but where were the dots being joined up so that, at a higher level, the regulator would be coming in saying \"Do you know what?  I get it, that there's a passport where the photograph isn't legible.  And that's not great.  But do you know what?  I don't need to talk about that.  What I want to talk about is your development finance.  And what I want to talk about is that you've got 33% of your book is funded only by retail deposits.\".''

We would have written to them.  They would have written back to us confirming their acceptance of the appropriateness at that time of my taking on that responsibility.  Now, I just want to be very clear because, you know, there's this observation by others that EBS didn't have a chief risk officer and it didn't have a chief risk officer on a stand-alone basis reporting to the board or the chief executive.  And in somehow or some way, that has contributed, in a meaningful way, to what transpired.  Now, again, let me deal with the facts.  Yes, it didn't have a stand-alone chief risk officer, but it had a head of risk, and you'll be meeting them later today.  And that head of risk reported to me but they also had visibility at board level and they had their arms completely around risk but in an EBS context.  So what I'm trying to say is that the question of there being a layer between the head of risk and the chief executive or a layer between the head of risk and the board, in my view, was unhelpful in terms of a post mortem, because, clearly, it would have been better to have a single individual at board level solely responsible for risk, but I actually don't think it made a meaningful difference.  And, again, just to give that some objective analysis, two things I'd say - look at all the other banks who did happen to have a stand-alone chief risk officer reporting to the board, and I don't think they ended up in a different position.  And, ultimately, I'd say - and I think again it's a corporate governance matter - ultimately, the chief risk officer of any organisation is not the head of risk, is not the head of finance; it's the chief executive and the board collectively.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015072900002#U00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Alan Merriman"},{"type":"speech","time":1438124400,"counter":459,"content":"<p>Can I just ask-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015072900002#U00600","speaker":"1034"},{"type":"speech","time":1438124400,"counter":460,"content":"<p>Final question, Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015072900002#U00700","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speech","time":1438124400,"counter":461,"content":"<p>-----what changed then in 2007?

To quality of the business model setting process, there was no such process as the business model had been set prior to my joining the board.  In 1985, when I wanted to buy a house, the rules of EBS were clear.  Ninety percent of the purchase price was the maximum you could borrow and two and a half times your salary.  If you had a spouse or overtime, half of what each of these brought in annually could be added.  Documentation had to be produced to verify applications.  All Irish banks had similar rules.  By the time I joined the board of the society 15 years later, in December 2000, those rules had been abandoned, not just by EBS but by most, if not all, lending institutions.  Mortgage applicants&rsquo; declared incomes were sometimes well in excess of reality and up to six times the applicant salary was approved.<\/p> <p>  This happened gradually as the price of houses went out of the financial reach of most people, had the old rules still applied.  I paid up to 14% per annum on the mortgage I held from 1985 to 1996 but, in the new euro scenario, interest rates had plunged which seemed to even out the risk.  The risk of jobs being lost was not factored in, largely due to the country&rsquo;s booming economy.<\/p><p>The induction to my new role as an EBS non-executive director was pleasant.  The staff were delightful and the managers who explained their processes to me, equally so.  However, I was uneasy when I was introduced to the idea of securitisation.  In simple terms this is a way of packaging up mortgages into an asset and selling them on to a new layer of investors, who agree to pay a percentage of the nominal value of the loans in return for an agreed interest so that their money can be lent on again for new mortgages.  It is ingenious in its way, as it is a system that seems to offer limitless working capital for a lending institution.  But there is nothing to stop the new investors selling on their asset at a profit, and so on <i>ad infinitum<\/i>.  Viewed that way, it has the look of a pyramid scheme and all depends on the original mortgages continuing to be serviced and becoming more expensive for the mortgagees.  I could not get the image out of my head of a shark eating its own entrails.  As time went by I became ever more doubtful of the fundamental banking concept of loans as assets and indeed of debts in any business as assets.  The only asset that reassures me is something I can control and I cannot control the repayment of debt owed to me.<br\/><br\/>To adequacy of board oversight over internal controls, managed and monitored: unfortunately, this proved inadequate, which became apparent when the board of EBS was finally advised that an employee in the treasury department had illicitly engaged in proprietary trading strictly against the rules of the society.  Strangely, this same employee had been previously present with his manager at a board meeting when non-executive directors had probed the possibility of just such an illicit trade being made.  The board was reassured at the time by the executive directors that such a thing could not happen because of so-called &ldquo;back-room controls&rdquo;.  These evidently failed and EBS sustained a significant loss.  Similar scenarios unfold in other banks all over the world from time to time.  But far more damaging was the decision by the board to sell the headquarters in Westmoreland Street owned by the society in order to transfer to a rented premises in Burlington Road.  Over time it became apparent that this was a catastrophe and the full board did not have oversight of the implications of the decision.<br\/><br\/>To appropriateness of property-related lending strategies and risk appetite: lending large sums to developers was new to the society.  The senior management in EBS, as in most of the lending institutions, were taken in by Ireland&rsquo;s so-called developers and also by their professional and other advisers.  So were the members of the board, including me.  The belief that there were substantial profits to be made for the society from these developments led us to emulate our peers, although we had been cautious about joining the bandwagon.  There was a sort of feeding frenzy as the banks clambered over one another to get a piece of the action, especially as new foreign banks had entered the market as competitors.<br\/><br\/>To appropriateness of credit policies, delegated authorities and exception management: and here there is an anomaly, Chairman, which I just want to clarify.  In your opening introduction, you correctly said that it was actually in mid-2005 that I was put on the credit committee.  My memory was faulty there and this affects what I have to say.  I was actually taken off the BAC in mid-2005 and put on to the credit committee instead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015072900002#X00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Ethna Tinney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1438124400,"counter":520,"content":"<p>Okay, I'll have that corrected.  Thank you very much Ms Tinney.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015072900002#Y00200","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1438124400,"counter":521,"content":"<p>In the period from mid-2005 to April 2007, I was inundated via e-mail by proposals from EBS senior management on behalf of developers for quantities of cash in the tens of millions which appeared to be asset-backed and also to contain personal guarantees.  Typically, as a member of the credit committee, your approval or lack of it had to be sent also by e-mail to EBS by close of business the same day or the next day.  The rationale was that if EBS did not facilitate the developer, another bank would and we would simply be losing out on the business.  All these proposals seemed fail-safe.  It did occur to me many times that the EBS credit committee should be meeting about each of these large proposals but my colleagues on the committee seemed happy to do the business this way, and as I had clashed with the majority of the board over several matters at this stage I had no appetite for further confrontation.<br\/><br\/>To adequacy of the incentive and remuneration arrangements to promote sound risk governance: the bonus system in banks is crazy.  You get a bonus for lending money out.  There is no incentive to get it back in.  Such a system encourages greed and recklessness.  It is no wonder that banks go bust from time to time.<br\/><br\/>To appropriateness of the bank guarantee decision: probably until the last syllable of recorded time, this will be argued by politicians, economists and journalists.  My personal view as a citizen of the Republic of Ireland, perhaps to some extent influenced by hindsight, is that it was indefensible for the Government in September 2008 to in effect yield the sovereignty of this country in order to shore up a banking system that is entirely of and for itself and will never change.  I do accept, however, that many grave problems would have arisen if one or more banks had failed and that the full extent of the bad debts were not known at the time.<br\/><br\/>To analysis and consideration of the response to contrarian views: I incorporate below in italics a letter I insisted on sending to the members of EBS in advance of the annual general meeting in 2007, 29 March that year:<blockquote><i>Dear Member,<\/i><br \/><br \/><i>Your EBS 2006 Summary Statement contains on the Notice of Annual General Meeting the following words:<\/i><br \/><br \/><i>&ldquo;Ethna Tinney retires in accordance with the Society&rsquo;s Rules and offers herself for re-election. <\/i><i>(Members should be aware that the Society&rsquo;s Board of Directors does not support Ms Tinney&rsquo;s re-election as a Director)&rdquo;<\/i><br \/><br \/><i>There are three reasons why the Board does not support my re-election.<\/i><br \/><br \/><i>In the years 2003 and 2004 the Board was intent on pursuing a deal with a foreign bank.  This deal was characterised by the executive as a bold transformational play.  I saw it as selling the family silver without giving the money to the family -  you, the members.  I opposed the deal from first to last.  Ultimately the deal collapsed, but not before millions of euro of your money had been spent pursuing it.<\/i><br \/><br \/><i>In 2005 the Society advertised for new non-executive directors.  I was a member of the Nominations Committee.  Ten candidates were shortlisted through an external recruitment process.  All ten were vetoed without any reference to me.  I objected in the strongest possible terms.  Last December I was removed from the Nominations Committee.<\/i><br \/><br \/><i>In 2006 the Board fractured over corporate governance.  Three members, including me, became unhappy about aspects of senior executive remuneration and the payment of a multi-million euro sum into the <\/i><i>Senior Manager&rsquo;s Pension Fund without reference to the Board.<\/i><br \/><br \/><i>Am I right or wrong to oppose matters which appear to me to be against the interests of you, the members?  If you believe that independent judgement exercised without fear or favour is a good thing on your Board then come to the AGM on April 16th or send your proxy to arrive not later than April 9th at EBS Building Burlington Road Dublin 4 and re-elect me.<\/i><\/blockquote>This letter does not mention that I had repeatedly raised concerns about the size of mortgages we were lending to people.  Nor does it detail my explosive response at a meeting in early 2007 to a proposal by the executive to get involved in sub-prime lending.  A non-executive director colleague told me in front of the board that my response was &ldquo;intemperate&rdquo;, although the sub-prime industry in the US was already beginning to implode.  Contrarian views were not tolerated on the board of the society.<br\/><br\/>To appropriateness of the relationships between Government, the Oireachtas, the banking sector and the property sector: I have never had a relationship with any member of the Government nor the Oireachtas nor the property sector.  I do not golf, do not visit tents at racecourses and am not invited to dinners.  But my sense, as a citizen of Ireland and as a director of EBS for nine years, is that there is a deeply unhealthy relationship between all four.<br\/><br\/>In conclusion, I wish to emphasise that this witness statement refers specifically to my time as a non-executive director on the board of EBS in the period December 2000 to April 2007 when I was removed from it.  By the time I was re-elected onto it in 2008 there had been many changes to its composition and a new chief executive officer had been appointed.  Sadly, it emerged during the next three years that EBS was irrecoverable.  I retired from the board at the end of my third three-year term in May 2011.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015072900002#Y00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Ethna Tinney"},{"type":"speech","time":1438124400,"counter":522,"content":"<p>Thank you very much, Ms Tinney.

And this adverts to January 2004, three years before.  And if you look at the re-election of Ethna Tinney, you will see these words: \"Brian Joyce, chairman of the Board, reported on the outcome of his discussion with Ethna Tinney following receipt of the individual director evaluation (based on the evaluation forms completed by the other 10 directors and collated by Jim Bruce).\"  So, the change in the verbiage is so significant, even though the two processes were exactly the same.  In other words, in 2004, the minutes are accurate.  Our evaluation consisted of being given a page and we had to fill in boxes, from one to five, of how we rated our colleagues under certain headings - attendance; punctuality; collegiality; business knowledge; you name it, it was in there - and of course the gas thing was, since you couldn't mark yourself, it was apparent long before it was collated by Jim Bruce, for anybody who wanted to study this information, who was writing what about whom.<\/p> <p>  The other corollary was that since it was done, to that extent, anomaly, you know, anybody could write any figure they liked about anybody else.

I hope that your valuable work will add to the store of knowledge on this subject contained in the Regling and Nyberg reports and that lessons can be learned.  Chairman, I became leader of the Green Party in 2007 following the resignation of Trevor Sargent.  While we were the only party that based our 2007 election manifesto on a forecast of reduced growth, I don't think anybody in the party could have predicted that our term in government would coincide with the worst economic crisis that this country has ever had to endure.  The Green Party did not create the housing bubble but, in government, we had a duty to extricate our country from the crisis.  This involved making the most difficult political decisions that any small party in this State has ever had to make.  It is a fact that two thirds of what is known euphemistically as the &quot;fiscal adjustment&quot;, which led to the recovery, was made by the Green Party in government.  The Green Party TDs and Senators voted for these cutbacks and tax increases, convinced that this was the correct course of action, while also knowing that it would lead inevitably to electoral annihilation.  I&rsquo;m proud of the dignified way that the Greens conducted themselves during this time of adversity.  I&rsquo;m also proud of the fact that the Green Party insisted that every one of those austerity budgets was progressive.  In other words, each budget hit the wealthier members of our community proportionately harder than the less well-off.  This has been confirmed by subsequent studies of the various budgets by the ESRI.  This is not to imply that the cutbacks were painless; they were not.  Large sections of the Irish people suffered hugely because of the austerity measures and I regret that we were forced to make these decisions.  I believe our economic and financial problems were caused by a combination of factors, which include banking deregulation and poor oversight of the financial institutions, a property bubble fuelled by reckless lending practices and irresponsible land rezoning, huge increases in public spending, over-reliance on property and construction-related taxation, alongside inappropriate reductions in some taxes.  The globalisation of banking and interbank lending also led to a global domino effect.<br\/><br\/>I&rsquo;d like now to concentrate on one of the above subjects and one which is close to my own heart: the role of poor planning in our economic crisis.  Some of the inquiry members may be aware of the report published in July 2010 by NUI Maynooth titled, A Haunted Landscape: Housing and Ghost Estates in Post-Celtic Tiger Ireland.  It is a report that deserves the full attention of this committee.  Let me quote from the executive summary:<blockquote>Government has two principle levers through which it can ... regulate property development.  The first is through fiscal policy with respect to regulating access to credit and determining taxation rates.  The second is through planning policy and the zoning of land and the granting of planning permissions.  Explanations of the Irish property bubble have focused almost exclusively on the former, and the role of the banks, tax incentive schemes, and the failures of financial regulators.  <b>To date, the role of the planning system in creating the property bubble has [not been] considered.<\/b><\/blockquote>The fact is, Chairman, that corrupt and irresponsible zoning practices did play a significant role in our economic crisis.  The above report asked that a commission of inquiry would look specifically at this matter.  That may not happen but you have the opportunity to examine it as part of your own inquiry.  During the so-called boom years, the Green Party representatives on local councils and in the D&aacute;il tried at every turn to highlight the problems of poor planning.  On entering Government, we resolved to introduce a more evidence-based and sustainable planning system.  As Minister, I enacted new planning legislation and intervened at local level in a number of cases of poor planning practice.  I also initiated a number of reviews of local planning following complaints and allegations by members of the public.  The Green Party also insisted on a windfall tax on the unearned benefit to landowners of rezoning land.  All of these measures were designed to counteract the poor practices which had led to the crisis and I am convinced that had they been in place earlier, the property bubble would not have inflated to such an extent and the severity of the economic crisis would have been much reduced.<br\/><br\/>On the question of banking, the Green Party was to the fore in directly criticising the lending practices of the banks.  Our then Finance spokesperson, Dan Boyle, recalls in a book he published on our time in government, a meeting with the Irish Banking Federation in 2006.  He attended this meeting, along with the current leader of the party, Eamon Ryan and I'd like to quote directly:<blockquote>We brought up the question of the efficacy and economic sanity of issuing 110% mortgages, and the general lack of sustainability that seemed to exist in [the] property market; a market the banks seemed intent on inflating further.  The response to our concerns was both arrogant and condescending.  We didn&rsquo;t understand banking, we were told, besides which the market would correct itself in a relatively painless manner.<\/blockquote>Early in our term in government, I recall, at a pre-Cabinet meeting in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s office at the time of the Northern Rock collapse, asking the Finance Minister, Brian Cowen, if our banks were sound.  He told me that there was no problem with our banks and that they well capitalised.  I had no hard evidence to suggest otherwise but a nagging doubt did persist.  It was clear that the Lehman's collapse would have knock-on effects and I asked Minister Lenihan if there were contingency plans here.  He told me that matters were in hand.  I got the impression that Finance were working on a plan but I had no idea that they had been working on it for an extensive period of time, as indicated in the evidence of Kevin Cardiff.<br\/><br\/>I became aware that week from a comment made to me by Minister Lenihan that he had also been in contact with David McWilliams.  I did not know the extent of that contact until David McWilliams published details in a subsequent book.  I phoned David McWilliams on his mobile, while I was in Brussels on 26 September.  We had a long and detailed conversation on what could and should be done on the banking crisis.  In his evidence, David McWilliams seemed to indicate that we had no further contact on the matter.  In fact, there was an important exchange of e-mails, which are included in the appendix, at the request of the Chairman.  When I raised the possibility of nationalisation of the banks during our telephone conversation, he dismissed the idea out of hand.  He did so again in his subsequent e-mail to me.  I told him that I would raise the matter with the Taoiseach and the Minister at a pre-Cabinet meeting on the Sunday, that was 28 September.  I met the Taoiseach and Minister Lenihan in the ante-room opposite the Cabinet room.  I passed Mr. Lenihan the article written by David McWilliams and mentioned his proposals.  There was a cursory acknowledgement of the points but neither of them indicated that there was to be a meeting with bankers the next day.<br\/><br\/>The first indication I had of such a meeting was when I got a phone call from Minister Lenihan at about two o'clock on the morning of the 30th.  I had a brief conversation with Minister Lenihan.  He explained to me the urgency of the situation.  He said that this was an incorporeal Cabinet meeting but that I was welcome to come into Government Buildings, if I wished.  I told him that it would not be necessary if we were going with the &quot;David McWilliams option&quot;.  He confirmed that that what was being proposed.  As this had been the basis of our previous discussions, I was satisfied to give my consent to a Government decision to publish legislation to give effect to the guarantee.  Early that morning, I e-mailed David McWilliams with the news.  When he replied later on that day, he was particularly pleased that the markets had reacted so positively to the guarantee.  Chairman, I would like it noted that I was grateful for David McWilliams's input.  He did not know, nor did I, that we were dealing with an insolvency problem.  Even on the day of 30 September, Minister Lenihan told us that the guarantee was the best way to deal with the liquidity problem.<br\/><br\/>Following the guarantee decision of September 2008, the Green Party maintained a close involvement in the Government banking and budget strategy.  Responsibility for dealing with these matters in government was assumed by my colleague, Eamon Ryan.  That part of my official statement is based on contemporaneous notes taken by Eamon Ryan and I believe it would be in the interest of the committee to interview him separately, as he had a more direct involvement in these matters.<\/p><p> Before concluding, Chairman, I'd like to draw your attention to three small corrections to my official statement.  I already notified the inquiry team that I was attending a meeting of the European Environment Bureau on 26 September 2008 in Brussels and not a European Council meeting.  Secondly, the sentence relating to the National Economic and Social Council should read as follows: \"In answering their question as to whether we were more Northern or Southern European in our current circumstances, it was clear that the former was the case\", and I emphasise \"the former\" there; I think it read \"the latter\".  Also in the official statement, references made to the level of emergency liquidity coming from the European Central Bank and it states that it \"had reached some &euro;130 million\".  That should, of course, read \"&euro;130 billion\".  Finally, Chairman, I have noticed in preparing for this hearing that the record-keeping in the Oireachtas and the various Departments needs to be improved.  I'm referring now to Ministers' diary records, phone and text and e-mail and visiting records.  All of this, I believe, should be in digital format, searchable and readily available and, right now, it isn't.  I'd like to thank the inquiry team and the staff for their unfailing courtesy and I'd like to wish you, Chairman, and the members of the committee every success in completing this important report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015072900002#MM00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Gormley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1438124400,"counter":1067,"content":"<p>Than you very much, Mr. Gormley, and if I can invite Ms Harney now to make her opening remarks please.

And your report will build on the analysis we've had already from Honohan, Regling-Watson, Peter Nyberg and so on.  I have submitted a detailed statement to the committee in response to the lines of inquiry sought of me and I am assuming that that statement has been read so I, therefore, am not intending to read that statement this afternoon.  But I just do want to highlight a small number of issues.<br\/><br\/>You have asked me to deal with the policies in the 28th, 29th and 30th D&aacute;il.  And, broadly, the macroeconomic policy was consistent - the strategic focus of the Government was to stimulate employment, to increase competitiveness so that we could reduce unemployment, and particularly long-term unemployment.  I am particularly proud of the achievements during those Governments.  We brought unemployment down from double digit to 4% or 5%, which was effectively full employment and, in particular, we made a very serious dent on what was long-term unemployment.  In the mid-'90s to 2000, there was reference made to reclassifying the unemployed ... the long-term unemployed as unemployable.  We proved that through activation policies that what could have been a long-term unemployment for ever, those people became employed and I am very proud of that.  We introduced a national minimum wage, we reversed emigration with immigration, we significantly grew take home pay and we greatly advanced the national infrastructure, as manifested most particularly by the motorway ... motorways we see in the country today.  But I'd like to highlight the investment we made in science, research and technology and now two thirds of the IDA jobs are very much dependant on the investments we made around 2000 in basic research in this country.  Ireland is now third in the world in nanotechnology, fifth in material science, first in immunology and so on.  These are major achievements for a country of our size.  We also increased social spending on education, health and pensions, and particularly welfare payments.  We had budget surpluses every year between 1988 ... 1998 and 2007, with the exception of one year.  We reduced, as I said, the burden of taxes and we grew spending.  We established a National Pensions Reserve Fund and 1% of GNP was put into that fund for a rainy day.<br\/><br\/>However, notwithstanding the successes that I am proud of, we made mistakes.  We did not foresee the enormous explosion of credit with entry into the euro.  Prior to entering into the euro, we put an extraordinary amount of effort into what I would call the &quot;changeover process''.  We were very focused on the rate with which we enter, on competitiveness issues, particularly <i>vis-&agrave;-vis <\/i>our nearest trading partner, the UK, and the effect on inflation.  In hindsight, we should have put a process in place that would have allowed us to look at the risks and the potential and the benefits of low interest rates on this economy.  I think if we had done that, it might have helped to arrest the more serious, negative effects of a low interest rate and cheap credit on the economy and we could have put mitigating measures in place.<br\/><br\/>Secondly, we were very trusting of the regulatory environment.  We probably should have been more proactive in monitoring and reporting, particularly the Government but also, I think, the Oireachtas.  We should have had regular assessment of the financial stability and that could have helped.  We could have had more critical analysis of the financial stability report.  And I think we placed undue confidence on the process and the procedure that we put in place.  And whilst it's not the job of Government to micro-manage regulation, if it goes wrong, Government must accept the political consequences of that.  And I believe we have to.<br\/><br\/>And, thirdly, I think we allowed public spending to grow too quickly on the back of what I would call ''transient taxes''.  We had recurrent expenditure on the basis ... or recurring expenditure on the basis of transient taxes mainly from the unsustainable construction activity.  It's understandable why these mistakes were made.  The general commentary in the ... in the country was benign and that helps to explain some of the mistakes.  Even the ESRI in their mid-term report, 2008-2015, forecast a growth rate of 4% and even in their worst-case scenario, the expectation was that the resilience and flexibility of the economy, with appropriate management, would see us return to reasonable growth in 2010.  I mention that simply to say that well-respected and credible organisations - even with the best forecasters - can get it wrong.  We need to learn lessons from that and the lesson is that we need to challenge the consensus.  I think consensus is part of our gene as a nation.  We didn't challenge the consensus and, in particular, the Government should have challenged the consensus and, therefore, we failed to pursue the hard remedies that might have avoided some of the pain that our citizens had to endure.  For those mistakes, of course, I, as a member of the Government, have to share responsibility and I deeply regret all of those mistakes.  I regret, in particular, that we did not dig deeper and ask harder questions.<br\/><br\/>I want to deal now with the issue of regulation and my role and relation to that.  In 1997, when I became Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, I had responsibility for the regulation of the insurance industry and credit unions.  I was conscious that in 1985 an insurance company ICI almost brought a bank down, owing as they did I think it was &pound;400 million at the time.  I was anxious that the Department which didn't have the expertise - we had, effectively, half an actuary - to continue to regulate insurance.  But I was also aware that banks were getting into pensions and life assurance and I believed that one ... eyes should look at an organisation and not separate regulators - one in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the other in the Central Bank.  The Government agreed to the establishment of a single Financial Regulator.  And we subsequently put a process in place to look at how that Financial Regulator would be put in place, whether it would be greenfield option, whether it would be part of the Central Bank or whether it would be what became subsequently known as the &quot;two-pillar approach&quot;.  In the context of those discussions, it was pointed out that the Governor of the Central Bank would have to have the authority to issue binding instructions to the regulator.  This was pointed out both through ECB intervention, through the Department of Finance and though the Central Bank itself.  When the report came, I was happy to go along with that.  We are, after all, a small country and there was no point establishing an organisation for the sake of it and we had to be mindful of the Governor's wider responsibilities as part of a single monetary union.<br\/><br\/>I was also conscious during that time that the role of the consumer was ignored in regulations.  Banks were, quite honestly, in some cases ripping off consumers.  There were hidden costs.  They were helping consumers establish bogus non-resident accounts for the purpose of avoiding tax.  There were many hidden charges and there was a lack of confidence in regulation, as we knew it, and even a State bank was involved in DIRT.  I was involved, too, in a number of inquiries as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment into banks - Guinness Mahon, Irish Intercontinental, National Irish Bank and so on.  And the combination of all these things brought me to the conclusion that all was not well in the manner in which we regulated the financial services and that is why I was so proactive in seeking to ensure that we had a new regime.  The mistake, I suppose, was after the new regimen was put in place, not being more proactive in ensuring that appropriate resources were devolved to the regulation of the financial institutions.  And, in fact, it wasn't until this ... until the Honohan report, I think it was, that I realised that the big institutions only had two individuals responsible for their regulation.  I think that was a serious error and the Government certainly wasn't aware of that.  And I think it's a pity that we weren't aware of the lack of resources that were being applied to regulation.<\/p><p> Chairman, I end there for the purposes of time.  I'm happy to take questions on my statement, or even things that aren't in my statement.  But above all else can I say if there's any lesson I have learned from my time in government, as a result of what happened, it is that we need to be more questioning, particularly of consensus.  And we did have a national consensus in relation to a soft landing in the property market that was not correct.  And it is the responsibility of Government and maybe, secondly, the Oireachtas to be more questioning of consensus of that kind.  And perhaps if we were, it may not have avoided all the problems, or any of them, but certainly I think it's a responsibility we all bear and as we go forward I think it's a lesson that we should learn.

I think we can become a little bit obsessed with how things look, rather that what we do.  I think if there's anything I would say reflecting back, and I don't intend for one moment to scapegoat anyone, because I think, collectively, we all failed, but I think it's more to do with the culture.  The reason I was so keen to have a new regulatory environment was partly because of the cultural issues that I experienced.  As I said, customers of banks were ... had hidden charges imposed on them.  They were being helped set up bogus non-resident accounts to avoid tax.  I knew in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment that we certainly didn't have the resources to deal with a modern insurance industry and I was very worried that what had happened in '85 could happen again, and that's why we sought to move that into a different era.

Could we, for example, have decided to limit the amount of credit going into construction, or to any particular borrowers?  Could we have introduced legislation to deal with the 100% mortgages?

I believe in hard work and the dignity of work.  I believe in lowering taxes on work.  I think the things you want to encourage in the economy should not be subjected to high taxes.  I believe in a broadened tax base and even when the Commission on Taxation, that was put in place post-2007, reported, they did not suggest increasing the tax rates.  We do need a wider tax base.  Regulation, I think, as document ... core document 40 will say, on page 87, I was the one that was being proactive, as the official says in the note to the Minister for Finance.  I think there are a lot of myths about what we stand for.  I'm for regulated markets, appropriately regulated markets.  You know, way back when I was a Minister of State in the Department of the Environment, we established the Environmental Protection Agency because I felt local authorities hadn't the competence or the expertise to regulate very complex industries.  In Health, we introduced new regulation of the Medical Council and of pharmacies - brought in lay majorities.  In the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, I introduced the new Director of Corporate Enforcement.  I think that's an indication of my commitment to regulation.  It's not regulation for the sake of it; it's regulation that is effective.<\/p> <p>  I believe ... we believe in a philosophy that encourages enterprise, rewards work.  I was the Minister that brought in the minimum wage.  So, sometimes there's a lot of myths about what we stand for.  I think my philosophy and my approach to politics is shared by a wide number of people in Ireland.  We certainly weren't a populist party in the run-in to the 2002 election.  We were cutting back on community employment because I believed, at a time of full employment, we didn't need to be moving towards 40,000 people in community employment.  That was unpopular, even among some of the Government Deputies, so I think we ... we reformed the insurance industry.  Again, there was a strong lobby by the legal profession against that, but insurance came down dramatically following the introduction of the PIAB.  So, I hope, Deputy, that in my philosophy and my participation in Government, I pursued what I believed was in the national interest and I am proud overall of the achievements, but, of course, I regret very much the mistakes we made, collectively, as a Government, and the pain that that brought to so many of our citizens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015072900002#RR02100","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Harney"},{"type":"speech","time":1438124400,"counter":1187,"content":"<p>Thank you.

And the question kind of relates to the reorganisation of the Central Bank and the creation of IFSRA and the establishment of the Irish financial regulatory office and so forth.

I was keen to ensure that we'd better regulation, that we'd more proactive regulation and that we'd a single regulator.  As I said, the Department of enterprise was responsible for insurance and credit unions and I didn't believe that that was satisfactory.  We neither had the expertise nor the resources to do that.  And added to that were the inquiries and then the charges, the hidden charges, the fact that the banks were misselling products to their customers and so on.  So a process was put in place, chaired by Michael McDowell, senior counsel, I think there were nine members of it ... including representatives of various Government Departments, a lawyer and a number of other outside people.  And they favoured, by a majority, a greenfield site.<\/p> <p>  And in the intervening period between reporting and the time the joint memo was brought to Government there were lot of discussions back and forth between my Department, both at official level and a political level, in relation to a solution or an agreement.  And because the request was for the Governor to be able to give directions when anything to do with financial stability was involved, I was happy to agree with that obviously.  The Government had its own responsibilities.  We then came forward with a joint memo which is roughly around the two pillar approach, I think the secretary to the Government, Dermot McCarthy, was very involved in that mechanism too on behalf of the Department of the Taoiseach.<\/p> <p>  So we came forward with the two-pillar approach, under the auspices of the Central Bank.  And after the legislation was passed I wasn't involved any more in ... I had no further role.  If memory serves me right, I think the Secretary General of the Department of Finance may have sat on that overarching body and the authority would have reported in, both to the Department of Finance and to the, perhaps to the Oireachtas as well, I think.<\/p> <p>  But I think I said earlier, in response to Deputy Phelan, regulatory change alone, or sorry structural change alone doesn't change the culture.  Now there were regulatory deficiencies at European level which have been since addressed, given we were in a monetary union.  They didn't exist until relatively recently.  But there's no doubt that the culture was one of deference.  And although I want to emphasise the first responsibility is with the banks and thereafter their accountants, the regulator or the Central Bank are down the line from that.  But I think there was neither sufficient resources applied to regulation to just have as ... as Governor Honohan, or Mr. Honohan, said in his report, I think he said there were two people responsible for each of the bigger institutions.

I was anxious to ensure that there was a strong consumer focus, given what had happened.  Remember, when these decisions are made they are made in an environment of what's happening at the time and, as I said earlier, I did take the opportunity to read the debate in the Oireachtas and the focus of everybody was around consumer protection and the fact that it hadn't been taken seriously heretofore.<\/p> <p>  The lesson I suppose, Chairman, is that having established a new regime we probably should have been more hands-on or more proactive in inquiring how it was progressing.  But remember the backdrop then was that there were no prudential issues.  There were issues raised about the expertise in the country and how limited that is, and I share that view, we are a small country.  So I wasn't anxious to establish an organisation for the sake of it.  What concerned me was not the shape of the body that emerged but rather what the body was going to do.

The decision to nationalise Anglo was actually made in a meeting in Brian Lenihan's office which was attended by Eamon Ryan, Brian Lenihan, David Doyle, Cathy Herbert.<\/p> <p>  Again, Eamon Ryan would have talked to us subsequently about that before it went to Cabinet, so that's the information that I have in relation to that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015072900002#WW00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Gormley"},{"type":"speech","time":1438124400,"counter":1311,"content":"<p>Okay, we might come back.

The fact is that if you look at the amount of land that was rezoned at that stage ... at the height of the boom, I think it was 44,000 ha, when, you know, that was 32,000 ha more than was needed.  And so, in the planning legislation that I introduced, we said that each council had to have a core strategy, that they had to have evidence-based zoning, that they had to get experts in, and that it just couldn't be done in the haphazard way that it had been done up until then.  I also initiated a number of planning inquiries because it had come to my attention that there was corruption taking place - a number of complaints from various members of the public.  Unfortunately, those inquiries were shut down.  The final thing that we did, and it's important ... I really do believe it's important because you can go right back to the Kenny report, back in the '70s, which recommended a windfall tax to deal with this sort of corrupt over-zoning that we were witnessing - that's an 80% windfall tax.  And then we went through a tribunal dealing with the corruption, and that tribunal recommended a windfall tax.  We introduced it, and it was a good measure.  It should have been retained and, unfortunately, it was ditched as well, and I find that very regrettable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015072900002#NNN02100","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Gormley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1438124400,"counter":1571,"content":"<p>Okay.

I'd have to get you the exact date but my recollection is that the meeting took place in the Taoiseach's office.  I was there, as was the leader of the Fine Gael Party, Enda Kenny, as was the leader of the Labour Party, Eamon Gilmore.  I have to say I was disappointed in the response.  I suppose, from a political point of view, it's understandable that the leaders of the Opposition were not interested in a type of Tallaght strategy, as you put it.  What they wanted was a general election.  You know, I was quite prepared at that stage to say to people \"Look this is a national emergency.  This is what this country is going through right now.  We need to co-operate and if that means that we co-operate for a period of time and then have a general election, so be it.\"  Now, it was not a runner - immediately, I could see - and, in fact, I heard that before we even went into the meeting that there had been a statement made to some of the newspapers to say that they weren't interested.  During that meeting, my memory is that Deputy Kenny, as he was then, was quite silent - he didn't say that much.  Deputy Gilmore was a little bit more aggressive in saying he wanted a general election now and that was the end of it.  And ... so that's how it turned out.  I was particularly disappointed then afterwards because you may recall that the Green Party then subsequently left Government and we voted for the Finance Bill from the Opposition benches.  And Eamon Ryan, at that stage then, tried again and he approached Simon Coveney with an offer.  And the offer there was ... it related to a motion of no confidence and Fine Gael and Labour said that they would vote ... they would withdraw their motion of no confidence and the reason for that was that we had made it very clear that we would have no option at that stage, because we had withdrawn from Government, that we would have to vote with the Opposition.  And so, therefore, if they had voted, at that stage, no confidence in the Government, the Government would have fallen and the incoming Government would've had to introduce the Finance Bill.<\/p> <p>   Now, from a political point of view, I have to be quite frank with you and say that was my preference - you know, let someone else do the heavy lifting - because I was a little bit peeved at what happened previously, when I had tried to extend a hand of co-operation and it was, you know, put aside.  In the end, a deal was done.  I think ... if I ... I was not at that meeting.  I think Eamon Ryan was at that meeting,.  If I recollect correctly, perhaps Senator Doherty, as he was then, was at that meeting.  And, you know, it was an arrangement that was made.  We voted from the Opposition benches for a terrible Finance Bill and that sealed our fate, you know.

These were: a decision to step up lending to the land and development sector at the height of the Irish property boom and insufficient management oversight of this lending; strong growth in EBS's residential loan book in response to competitive pressures; the fact that EBS was a moderately-capitalised business albeit, within regulatory requirements; and an over-reliance on wholesale funding.  The board of EBS took the decision to enter into land and development sector in 2002 and to step up this lending in 2005.  Controls put in place to mitigate risk weren't sufficient in the face of the timing of the decision and the scale of the financial crisis which ensued.<\/p> <p>  The growth in residential mortgage lending over the period 2000 to 2008 is a reflection of the strategy of the board of the society to retain EBS's mutual status and remain a relevant mortgage provider in Ireland.  This necessitated moving with the market.  Numerous changes to credit policy were approved, which allowed customers borrow more than they had in the past.  At each stage, the options were clearly documented and considered by the executive and the board before approval.  Increased risk appetite, as set out in the society's policies, was supported by a strong economic climate, improved demographics, higher income and lower tax levels - all of which improved loan affordability.  Loan exposure was limited with mortgage indemnity insurance.  Significant investments in underwriting systems, models and management reporting were made.  The long-established management controls in place, including centralised underwriting, loan affordability assessment, mortgage indemnity insurance and independent property valuations, were insufficient to withstand the scale of the economic downturn and the significant correction in house prices.<\/p> <p>  In terms of its capital position, EBS operated within regulatory capital requirements throughout the pre-crisis years.  But its tier 1 capital ratio of 7.9% at the end of 2008 was inadequate to absorb the unprecedented level of provision losses arising from the crisis.  The PCAR II and PLAR exercises in Q1 2011 resulted in a required tier 1 capital ratio of 22.5%.  Finally, in relation to the liabilities side of the balance sheet, the reliance on cheaper wholesale funds of all credit institutions has, I believe, been extensively commented on.<\/p><p>Between 1999 and 2007, EBS's loan book grew by 300%, while deposits grew by 170%.  Similar to other institutions, the gaps that ... had been funded through wholesale funding and international corporate deposits.  As we now know, this was an unsustainable model and new regulatory requirements in relation to loan-to-deposit, liquidity coverage and net stable funding ratios are in place to prevent a recurrence of this situation.  Accountability for these failings was demonstrated to members in the stepping down of the chairman of the board and the finance director early in 2009.  <\/p><p> In terms of the risk management of the society, Professor Nyberg expressed the view that the risk management system in EBS was not adequately resourced and seems to have lacked influence within the bank.  Looking back, and with the benefit of hindsight, I agree with him, although I do not believe that this of itself contributed significantly to the overall outcome for EBS.  The risk team was established in 2002, comprising three people.  It's responsibilities were set by the chief risk officer.  These included establishing and providing input to a credit risk committee, an operation risk committee and a capital committee over the period 2003 to 2006, documenting the society's risk governance framework, developing a risk assessment process for each function, ensuring that all of the organisation's risk policies were documented, developing an enterprise risk report for the chief risk officer with inputs from across the society on key risk trends and risk positions, delivering the Basel II programme, which included the new requirement for capital assessment, the ICAP process, an internal capital adequacy assessment process, modelling and reporting on requirements - a significant undertaking between 2004 and 2008 - also developing loan-loss provision models to meet aspects of the new international financial reporting standards and building and submitting new regulatory reports on liquidity, asset quality, large exposures and impairments.  <\/p><p> The credit risk committee was chaired by the chief risk officer and comprised representatives from the business areas, credit underwriting, the distribution channels, and risk.  Its role was to monitor risk trends and review proposed changes to policy in line with the society's approved strategies for onward recommendation to the executive and board.  The risk team was not involved in strategy formulation, approval or implementation in terms of day-to-day business operations, nor was it involved in the credit approval process.  This was managed by the commercial business and residential underwriting and from 2005, a commercial underwriting unit.  There was a senior management credit approval committee, called the loan advances committee, made up of business, credit and senior management, and separately, a subject which the committee has touched on earlier today, a board credit approval committee, comprising non-executive directors and members of the executive.<\/p><p> This committee has heard there have been many regulatory developments in the area of corporate governance and risk management as a response to the financial crisis.  Risk management is not confined to risk specialist or control functions.  Current corporate governance for financial institutions is set out on a three-lines-of-defence model.  Business units are the first line of defence and are primarily responsible for managing risks on a day-to-day basis, taking into account the institution's risk tolerance and appetite, and in line with its policies, procedures and controls.  The second line of defence is a risk management function, which is independent of operations and management.  Its role is to challenge decisions that affect the institution's exposure to risk and to provide comprehensive and understandable information on risks, enabling the board to understand the institution's overall risk profile.  The third line of defence is an internal audit function, which assesses the adequacy of the operations of the other two lines.  Today, good governance requires that a chief risk officer should be an independent senior executive with distinct responsibility for this job.<\/p><p> In EBS these standards commenced with my appointment as a dedicated chief risk officer and member of the executive team in 2009.  From 2009, I presented a detailed risk report to the board each month with an independent assessment of the level of risk being run in various key areas and the actions management were taking to mitigate risks.  The number of board risk committee meetings increased and I met regularly with the chairman of the committee to discuss the risk position and outlook for the organisation.  The board credit approval committee was disbanded and board training programmes were extended.  We developed a risk appetite statement setting out the board's limit of risk appetite in each area and monitored and reported on adherence to this risk appetite statement on a monthly basis.  <\/p><p> A number of actions were taken to mitigate, where possible, the extent of the downturn in the Irish economy and property market on the society's balance sheet and to manage the business on a day-to-day basis through the global credit crunch.  Lending criteria were tightened.  We brought in external, experienced credit resources to advise us on how to manage our business through a downturn.<\/p><p>The credit function was reconfigured to manage distressed assets and those at risk of becoming distressed.  From the first quarter of 2009, we conducted quarterly reviews of at-risk and impaired cases which informed provision estimates.  We commissioned an external firm to review potential mortgage debt solutions in place internationally and we presented the findings of this review to the Oireachtas committee in 2009.<\/p><p> We completed a number of control enhancement programmes.  These included enhancements to commercial property documentation and security and deeds management.  It ensured that no legal discounts were applied by NAMA, nor capital add-ons applied by the regulator, as a result of missing or incomplete data or documentation.  And, of course, throughout the period 2009 to 2011, we monitored funding and liquidity positions very closely and took all actions available to us to avert the risk of a run on deposits and to make contingency plans for that eventuality or possibility.<\/p><p> Some concluding remarks, if I may?  The crisis and its aftermath have been debilitating in terms of Irish people's financial health.  I fully acknowledge my share of responsibility, together with all who worked in EBS in the pre-crisis period, for that failure, however unintended.  From 2009, I worked to the best of my ability with the executive team of EBS, overseen by the board, to minimise, where we could, its impact on customers, on EBS and on the economy.  And I am sorry that we could not do more.<\/p><p> Concerns of a housing bubble at the start of the 2000s dissipated in the face of sustained economic growth and the apparent levels of increased wealth, reinforced by positive commentary from external bodies and commentators.  The system misjudged both the probability of an economic and property market collapse occurring, and its impact in terms of loan losses when compounded by an international credit crunch - a one-in-100-year event.  It has taken more than six years to fully realise the impact of the deterioration in asset quality which concluded with the publication of the European Central Bank's comprehensive assessment results in October of last year.<\/p><p> In the past, policy followed strategy.  Risk appetite and risk capacity are now considerations which feed into banks' strategy-setting processes.  Limits of risk appetite, in pursuit of the agreed strategy, are set out in banks' risk appetite statements.  Regulatory mandated recovery plans ensure that early warning indicators inform banks where action is needed to prevent bank failure.<\/p><p> Excessive competition must be curbed where it threatens the stability and soundness of the banking system, a concept at the heart of conduct risk considerations.  And I think the recent example of the loan-to-value cap for first-time buyers is a welcome development in this regard.<\/p><p> Finally, it may sound self-evident to state that banks are, at the end of the day, credit institutions.  There needs to be sufficient credit expertise and credit risk evaluation at each level of the organisation, from the boardroom to the bank branches.  Thank you very much.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015072900002#YYY00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Fidelma Clarke","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1438124400,"counter":1611,"content":"<p>Thank you, Ms Clarke, thank you.

It was informed by enormously strong economic growth from the mid-'90s, affordability was very substantially improved with the reduction in tax rates and the low interest rate environment.  Also, there were a number of households where there were two incomes rather than one income as women returned to work, given the demarginalisation of the tax rates.  So decisions were made very much informed by a very positive economic environment and a view that that positive economic environment would be sustained.  We now know, with the benefit, of course, of hindsight, that that wasn't the case and the soft landing that people spoke about for many years in the early 2000s became a very, very hard landing at the end of the day.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015072900002#AAAA00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Fidelma Clarke"},{"type":"speech","time":1438124400,"counter":1614,"content":"<p>There's two examples of the unravelling that you described.

To support the approval of larger loans, it had established a board credit approval committee in 2003 and I think, probably not unlike any other institution, it had a process in place whereby loans were approved within a certain period of time, generally 24 hours.  It was one of the issues that the chairman of the board risk committee raised with me when I became chief risk officer, that he had felt that non-executive directors shouldn't actually be involved in credit decisions.

I think, though, going back to where commercial property lending started in EBS, based on what I have seen in the society's records, it commenced in the early 1990s as a result of a change in building societies legislation.  And, at that time, EBS had a four or five ex-ICC members as senior executives, including the chief executive, who would have taken a decision to enter slowly into the commercial property sector and to limit the amount of lending to the commercial property sector to, I believe, 15% of the overall balance sheet.  I don't believe that percentage was ever exceeded.  And based on what I have seen, the intent was to create some form of diversification of risk because as a primary building society in Ireland, you had a very high level of concentration risk.  All of your assets were relating to residential property in one jurisdiction, which is one of the reasons that EBS, from ... actually from the 1970s, had put mortgage indemnity insurance in place.

Provide mortgages to teachers, guards, nurses and, in the main, PAYE workers, that was EBS's core business.  But through time the pressure on margins as a result of what we now know is absolutely excessive competition meant that EBS was under pressure to be able to create capital.

EBS increased commercial and development lending significantly in the period from 2003 onwards.  I'll just go through some of the slides that we have here.  The first one here is actually this one that went up.  Okay, you see at the top of the screen there, Ms Clarke, \"A self assessment process has been completed on commercial property lending and 29 risks were identified, one of which was external.  There are 6 risks that are considered high in nature\".  It then goes through various bullet points.  Just noting the first two of them, \"Concentration risks on large exposures which could provide a bad debts exposure or large redemptions\".  And, secondly, \"Making losses due to bad lending decisions\".<\/p> <p>  I'll just move on to the next slide, which the 005.  What we have here at the end of the page is a whole load of product offering by the society and just how ... and the upper slide ... a demonstration of how the whole mortgage market was moving in 2006.<\/p> <p>  On to the next slide, which is 006, the highlighted section there is \"Change the Stress Test on Interest Rate\" and how the current policy, which was a stress test at the standard variable rate in the next column of +2% to move up to a 6% that you were exceeding to maybe be 1% above it.<\/p> <p>  And the on to... I'll just skip on to another couple of slides.  This is from 2005 and it says 100% mortgages move from pilot to permanent solution.  EBS are considering a number of options round 100% mortgages at the time.  Option 1 is \"Increase Price\" and that is not considered an option.  As you can see this is in red, because consideration as \"Market pricing would make it difficult to charge a higher rate for this product.  Most lenders are charging between 3.1% and 3.25% for this product\", that's some less the standard variable rate.  There is 2, \"Reduce Cost\", which is \"Genworth have indicated that they will not reduce pricing for this cover.
