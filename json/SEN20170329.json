He is almost as familiar as I am with the subject matter we will deal with.  He opened the gardens of Killarney House, which are a tremendous asset, last year.  It is the St. Stephen's Green of Killarney.  A significant number of visitors have passed through the amenity.  The Minister of State is an annual visitor to Killarney.<\/p> <p>As the Minister of State has said, the investment in the house and gardens involves about &euro;8 million.  It is the foremost visitor attraction in Killarney and is capable of becoming the largest visitor attraction in the south.  Are we hiding our light under a bushel in not having the amenity open?  A year ago, the Minister of State and I thought the gardens would have reopened earlier this year, but that has not happened. <\/p> <p>It is the house of the Browne family, who were the Earls of Kenmare and very involved in the development of Killarney town over centuries.  Latterly, it has been the home of John McShane, the man who built the Pentagon and other famous buildings in Washington.  It is intended that it be the main visitor centre for Killarney National Park.  One can guess how important that is. <\/p> <p>The house has been involved in the development of the town over a long period of time.  It is one of the most, if not the most, valuable tourist asset in the south.  It has become a major attraction, but if the house is reopened it will become the main attraction in the south and south-west. <\/p> <p>I look forward to the comments of the Minister of State.  Mr. Pat Dawson, the regional manager for the area, and his staff are very good.  The Minister of State might refer to the governance and management that is in place.

The Killarney House project involves my Department, the Office of Public Works, as project managers for the construction, and F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  The Department first announced the project in 2011 with a budget of &euro;10 million.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland has committed funding of &euro;5.2 million under its tourism capital investment programme and the balance is being funded by my Department.<\/p> <p>The National Tourism Development Authority&rsquo;s significant financial contribution to the project is a clear statement of its confidence that this project will make a significant contribution in the future to the south-west tourism offering. I am confident that the development will optimise the potential of Killarney House as a top class visitor and tourism centre.  It will do this in parallel to respecting its prime focus as a visitor centre for Killarney National Park and by developing its status as a heritage property managed by my Department. <\/p> <p>In 2016, it was decided to pursue the opening of Killarney House and Gardens on a phased basis.  The opening of the gardens occurred during 2016 and the completion of the historic rooms and the interpretative exhibition is being prioritised for 2017.  I recognise the significant interest at local level in opening the facility as soon as possible, and I assure the Senator my Department is working tirelessly to meet these deadlines.<\/p> <p>The house is being developed as the main visitor and interpretative centre for the national park, highlighting the beauty, richness and significance of the park&rsquo;s landscapes, habitats, flora and fauna as well as telling the story of human interaction with the park over the centuries.  Some of the formal rooms are currently being restored to their former glory.<\/p> <p>As the Senator knows, the original ornamental grounds and gardens immediately surrounding the House have been restored, creating spectacular landscaped areas that will merge into the natural areas of the park and provide vistas linking the town to the scenery of the mountain, woods and water.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Michael Ring:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1000\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1000&amp;amp;pid=MichaelRing&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The gardens were opened to much public acclaim in April 2016 and I formally opened them last August.<\/p><p>The visitor centre will have various aspects, including a newly built extension to the house.  It will be a visitor centre for the national park, explaining its significance and importance to the town and region, providing information on the major themes of the national park: mountains, woods, water and the human impact on the environment.  The final phase of building works to the house is now complete.  I intend to open the historical rooms element of the exhibition during the summer.  In this context, works in the restoration and refurbishment of the furniture collection for display are significantly advanced.  The exhibition phase of the project, to be located within Killarney House, is advancing and I expect the various elements of the works to be completed this year.  It is intended to open them to the public as soon as they are completed.<\/p><p>Visitors to Killarney usually stay in the town and visit other locations and attractions within the immediate area or the wider region.  The length of stay tends to be quite short and, in the case of bus tours, may be just one night.  Often a visit will be confined to Muckross House which focuses on cultural heritage and many tourists will leave Killarney unaware of the true extent and beauty of the national park that surrounds them.  When completed, Killarney House and gardens will explain the relevance and importance of Killarney National Park both from a cultural and a natural heritage point of view which will be to the benefit of tourists and local businesses.<\/p><p>I thank the Senator for giving me the opportunity to update him on what will no doubt prove to be one of the country's most significant assets from a cultural and a natural heritage perspective.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032900002#A00400","speaker":"1334","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490779800,"counter":12,"content":"<p>A good result for the Senator.

I acknowledge that the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross, met a delegation from Donegal municipal district at the end of February, for which I thank him.  Both bridges are in a poor state of repair and in need of immediate attention.  <\/p> <p>Tyrconnell Bridge is located in the centre of Donegal town.  It is an old railway bridge and its construction dates back to 1895.  It is vital in that it links one part of the town with the other.  Unfortunately, it is in a very dangerous state and deteriorating day by day.  Donegal County Council carried out a structural survey in 2000, at which point it reduced the load bearing capacity of the bridge to 7.5 tonnes.  Twelve years later, owing to ongoing concerns about the deteriorating construction of the bridge, another survey was conducted by the council, as a result of which the load bearing capacity was reduced to 3.5 tonnes.  It is probably the case that the construction of the bridge has got even worse since.  As I am sure the Minister of State can appreciate, trying to police vehicles traversing the bridge to ensure they are under 3.5 tonnes is a task in itself.  It is dangerous.  When the repairs are completed, there will be the normal load bearing capacity of approximately 40 tonnes.  The council has progressed the issue as far as it can from its own resources and is now seeking funding which could be spread over three years.<\/p> <p>Fintra Bridge provides a vital link between the towns of Killybegs, Kilcar, Carrick and Glencolmcille.  It is located on the Wild Atlantic Way and a vital piece of infrastructure.  It also provides a link with Slieve League, one of the country's premier tourist attractions which last year was visited by over 185,000 people, and with Glencolmcille Folk Park.  It is, therefore, of national significance.  It is, however, in a poor state or repair.  It is so narrow in parts that two vehicles cannot pass each other and numerous accidents have been recorded.  As a result, there are tailbacks which are a road traffic hazard and create their own dangers.  Using its own resources, Donegal County Council has advanced the project to the point where funding is needed to enable it to be put out to tender.<\/p> <p>For the two projects, a figure of &euro;2 million has been mentioned which, I understand, could be provided on a phased based over a three-year period.  These are two vital pieces of infrastructure, but, currently, they are hazards and a danger to the public.  The last thing we want to see happen is an accident on both.  I earnestly request the Department to seriously consider providing funding for both projects as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032900002#B01000","speaker":"1396"},{"type":"speech","time":1490779800,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this matter which I am taking on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross, who answered an oral question on 22 March on the same issue.  I am happy to restate the position.<\/p> <p>The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads, including bridges, in Donegal and other counties are the statutory responsibility of the local authority, in accordance with the provisions of section 13 of the Roads Act 1993.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Michael Ring:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1000\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1000&amp;amp;pid=MichaelRing&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Works on those roads are funded from the council's own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.  Department officials and the Minister, Deputy Ross, met with a delegation from Donegal County Council on 27 February 2017 to discuss Fintra Bridge and Tyrconnell Bridge in Donegal.<\/p><p>Fintra Bridge is located on the R263 between Killybegs and Kilcar.  It is understood from Donegal County Council that the issue with this bridge is alignment related.  It is structurally sound but is restrictive in width and is located on a bend.  Part 8 planning approval is in place for a new bridge and associated realignment of approaches and the cost of this is likely to be in the region of &euro;1.5 million.  Given the challenging financial climate, the specific improvement grants scheme, under which this scheme would previously have been considered, has been curtailed in recent years in order to maximise the funding available for repair and strengthening work.<\/p><p>Tyrconnell Bridge is a four span steel bridge supported by cut stone piers spanning 29 m across the Eske River at Tyrconnell Street, Donegal town.  A number of structural reports were carried out on the bridge in 2000, 2008 and 2012.  A study in 2013 concluded that the bridge will continue to deteriorate and will result in the closure of the bridge in the coming years.  The council reported that a full-deck replacement is needed.  On 12 October 2016, Donegal County Council submitted its application to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport for the 2017 bridge rehabilitation programme.  Tyrconnell Bridge was not among the bridges prioritised for funding in the 2017 application.  No application in respect of this bridge was received by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport for either 2016 or for 2015.  Following the meeting with the council, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport is awaiting further information from Donegal County Council in respect of both Tyrconnell and Fintra Bridges.  The Minister, Deputy Ross, will fully review the position in respect of both of the bridges when that information is received.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032900002#B01100","speaker":"1334","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490779800,"counter":24,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response on behalf of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross.

It is very important that from the outset those of us advocating this change on behalf of Irish citizens living overseas do so armed with the facts, and use the opportunity to not only hold a national conversation about what place Irish citizens living abroad should have in our society, but also what the functions of the office of Uachtar&aacute;n na h&Eacute;ireann exactly are.<\/p> <p>The President is a symbolic figure, but symbolism matters even more so for those citizens of this State who are Irish, who love this country and who want a meaningful place in our society even if they do not live within the territorial land mass that is governed by this State.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Billy Lawless:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2485\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2485&amp;amp;pid=BillyLawless&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Immigrant voting has emerged as a global democratic norm.  While immigrant voting is not there yet, Ireland is relatively progressive in allowing immigrants the right to vote in local elections.  I recognise that an advance of the proposal for a referendum the Government needs to first decide which category of overseas citizens should have an entitlement to vote.  Other nations with very high levels of overseas citizens let their emigrants vote.  Of the top five nations in the OECD, by emigrant percentage, Ireland is the only one to disenfranchise its emigrant citizens.  New Zealand, Mexico, Portugal and Luxembourg all allow their emigrants to vote.  India, the nation with the largest absolute numbers of emigrants and a global leader in diaspora engagement is also in the process of enabling its emigrants to vote.  I welcome the options paper published earlier this month by the Government.  We will make our formal submissions in due course but I want to make the point to the Minister of State that this is a once in a generation opportunity.  I hope the Government objective is to enfranchise the highest number of citizens abroad possible, not to create further divisions through arbitrary controls such as criteria on the number of years living abroad.  We have to be bigger in our ambitions and not simply replace old barriers with new, albeit less restrictive ones.<\/p><p>I have great faith that citizens living in this State want to extend the franchise to their children, cousins and friends living overseas and give them a meaningful role as well as delivering a clear mandate to our next President, or at the very least the one after that, that he or she represents all Irish citizens at home or abroad.  The President will be as much their ambassador as ours which is something I truly believe Irish people living here would like to share in the recognition of.  What a celebration of modern Irish identity that would be - a nation of emigrants with a President who leads all of us and is elected by all of us.  I can think of not better way to remind the world that Ireland is a global nation.  Ireland is not exiting its relationship with its European partners.  We are not shutting down our borders but we are extending them.  I thank the Minister of State and look forward to debating these matters further.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032900002#C01200","speaker":"1429","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490779800,"counter":36,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat a Chathaoirligh.

Is ceist t&aacute;bhachtach &iacute;.<\/p> <p>I thank Senator Lawless for his own individual campaigning and as a representative of many groups down the years which have campaigned on this issue.  No doubt the Senator is in constant communication and liaison with them and he will pass on my message and the Government's message about our commitment to this issue.  <\/p> <p>The announcement by the Taoiseach at the Famine Memorial in Philadelphia that a referendum will be held over whether Irish citizens resident outside of the State, including potential voters in Northern Ireland, should be allowed to vote in Presidential elections was a historic moment.  It recognises the importance that Ireland places on its relationship with all our citizens wherever they may be.  In times gone by, leaving Ireland meant a person severing their relationship with the State.  We now want to give Irish citizens where ever they may be a chance in choosing the person who represents Irish people at home and abroad.<\/p> <p>Many other countries give citizens resident outside the state a chance to vote in elections.  However, I acknowledge that in respect of our citizenship laws, Ireland has some unique features which make the policy considerations more complex here compared to other countries.  This is a timely development for Ireland given the ongoing and strong commitment of this Government and, indeed, successive Governments to deepening real engagement with our citizens who reside outside the State.  Ireland's diaspora policy, published in 2015, recognises the need to nurture and develop our unique and important relationship with our diaspora.  The issue of voting rights is of enormous importance to Irish citizens abroad who feel it is important that they have a say in electing the President who also represents them as Irish people living overseas.  We drew on the skills and support of our diaspora in recent times of economic crisis.  This initiative is a fitting recognition of the enormous contribution made by Irish people abroad historically and more recently to Ireland's recovery and development.  The Government's decision to hold this referendum is in line with the recommendation with the Convention on the Constitution in its fifth report.  Some 78% of its members were in favour of citizens outside the State having the right to vote in presidential elections.<\/p> <p>Last Wednesday, the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Simon Coveney, published an options paper which sets out how the recommendations of the Convention on the Constitution might be realised.  That paper, prepared in conjunction with my Department, provides a detailed analysis of the legal, policy and practical implications of extending the franchise.  It shows the complexity of the issues but also that the various challenges which arise can be addressed with sufficient planning and resources.<\/p> <p>The options paper will inform public discourse on the proposal that will be put to the people at the referendum.  The upcoming Global Irish Civic Forum in May will further provide an opportunity to discuss the options paper with representatives of Irish communities abroad.  It is intended that this and wider public discussions will allow the Government to identify a preferred option to put to the people in a referendum.  As this House knows, I have had a strong and public personal commitment to extending voting rights to citizens abroad in Presidential elections.  I was pleased to be there with the Taoiseach at the Famine Memorial in Philadelphia when he made the announcement.  I have seen the vibrancy of the Irish community during the St Patrick&rsquo;s Day parade and acknowledged the contribution of the Irish to the United States at the memorial to Commodore Barry and at Independence Hall.  I saw for myself the positive reaction from Irish emigrants and Irish Americans as the Taoiseach said there was \"no more fitting time or no more fitting place.\"<\/p> <p>Article 2 of our Constitution requires us to cherish our special affinity with Irish people abroad.  I believe the Government&rsquo;s decision to hold a referendum on extending voting rights to Irish citizens abroad sends an important message to them on the value we place on them and their connection to Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032900002#D00400","speaker":"1290"},{"type":"speech","time":1490779800,"counter":39,"content":"<p>Senator Lawless has a brief supplementary question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032900002#D00500","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1490779800,"counter":40,"content":"<p>I am delighted to note the commitment both from the Minister of State, with whom I have discussed this on many occasions, and especially the Taoiseach, but it is past time.  I am disappointed we will not be able to hold a referendum before the next Presidential election.  When I mentioned this to our citizens abroad they were really delighted.  They were delighted also when I was appointed by the Taoiseach in that they felt they were being recognised at long last.  It is something of which all the parties are in favour, and of which the convention came out in favour.  However, we do not have a good record in referendums in this country.  I would impress on the Minister of State and the Taoiseach and all the Members of both Houses that when we have the referendum that everybody is fully behind it, and not half-heartedly.  It is a once-off opportunity and we are going to make it happen.  We owe it to our people abroad.<\/p> <p>Do not forget that even in the last five or six years, some 230,000 young people left Ireland.  There are about 500,000 parents of those people who want their sons and daughters to come back here.

We have to make it much easier, with things like drivers' licences, insurance and health care, that when they come back there is a welcome for them and that they feel like they are wanted back home.<\/p> <p>I thank the Minister of State for his commitment.

Within 48 hours of getting this job as Minister of State with responsibility for the diaspora, I was at a summit in Istanbul with President Higgins.  He was our President, but he was seen as an international voice; a voice of hope for a lot of people in humanitarian crises and development.  The international community looks to Ireland for leadership.  I have had a very positive insight into the symbolism of this role at both national and international levels and want to acknowledge the international role that President Higgins is playing.  When one sees African leaders giving the President of this country a standing ovation for his commitment, his words and his inspiration on the international stage, that is where Ireland is going and we should never forget that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032900002#D00700","speaker":"1290","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490779800,"counter":43,"content":"<p> I acknowledge once again the wonderful work Senator Lawless is doing for the Irish diaspora in the United States and wish him success into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032900002#E00150","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1490779800,"counter":44,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 11.10 a.m. and resumed at 11.30 a.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Order of Business","time":1490779800,"counter":45,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032900002#G00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1490779800,"counter":46,"content":"<p>The Order of Business is No. 1, Heritage Bill 2016 &ndash; Committee Stage, to be taken at 12.45 p.m. and to conclude no later than 9.30 p.m., if not previously concluded by the putting of one question from the Chair which shall, in relation to amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the Government, with the debate to be interrupted at 5 p.m. and to resume at 7 p.m. on conclusion of Private Members' business; and No. 2, Electoral (Amendment) (Voting at 16) Bill 2016 &ndash; Second Stage, to be taken at 5 p.m., with the time allocated to the debate not to exceed two hours.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032900002#G00200","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1490779800,"counter":47,"content":"<p>I welcome to the Gallery Councillor Jason Murphy from Waterford.

We are all concerned about the impact this will have on Ireland, especially the threat of a hard border.  Today it is easy to forget the problems our country faced before the Good Friday Agreement.  We take for granted free movement between North and South.  At only three Border crossing points, there are as many as 325,000 crossings per week.  In 2016 Ireland and the UK traded approximately &euro;39 billion in goods and services.  We are faced with a situation that could lead to job losses and have a massive impact on the economy at large.<\/p> <p>The Government has made some superficial moves to deal with Brexit, but mostly we have seen only rhetoric on the common travel area, preventing a hard border and protecting the terms of the Good Friday Agreement.  The Government has yet to appoint a Minister with responsibility for Brexit as Fianna F&aacute;il has advocated.  The Government seems to have completely ignored the impact Brexit will have on key sectors of the economy in which we trade most with the UK, for example, agriculture, food, engineering and manufacturing.<\/p> <p>In Northern Ireland the undisputed facts include we have had two Assembly elections in the past year, we have had parties refusing to serve in the Executive, and we have had Sinn F&eacute;in withdrawing from the Executive because of a refusal to establish an inquiry into cash for ash, which has actually been established.  Now, we have a standstill in the formation of the Assembly at the hour Prime Minister May is triggering Article 50, and at such an hour we need to be united.  We learned this morning a civil servant, David Sterling, has taken control of the Stormont Government budget in the absence of the establishment of an Executive.  All departments in the North, from health to education, may be affected by this action, as a civil servant's budget is a reduced budget.  This inaction by the leading parties in Northern Ireland is inexcusable.  We need to acknowledge the period of peace over the past two decades.  We need to work together to commit to continued peace in Northern Ireland.  Ultimately, we need to see a united approach to reducing the impact the triggering of a hard Brexit will have on our country and our island.<\/p> <p>Today is the sixth day of the bus strike and 2,600 employees have been on strike.  The Minister has gone to ground.  He will attend a committee hearing today to give us an update.

Dublin Bus and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann employees will support their colleagues at lunch time, which I support.  The Minister needs to take some action.  He cannot sit on the fence on every issue.  He needs to meet union members and sort out this crisis.

Despite a decision being taken in September 2014 to remove Mary from the home, the order was not executed until February 2016.  However, because Mary was 18 years of age and deemed to be an adult, she was no longer in statutory care or under Tusla's remit.  How could this be allowed to happen?  How many other cases are there of children or vulnerable people who are still in foster care despite allegations of abuse being known to the authorities?  Are the cases of Grace and Mary just the tip of the iceberg?

She will address the House of Commons on the issue within the next hour.  The Seanad's Brexit hearings are a welcome initiative, but we also need to consider raising the issue of Brexit in other debates in the House.  Yesterday, we in Labour published our detailed Brexit policy, outlining 20 concrete actions that the Irish Government should be taking.  We expressed our concern at the lack of detail from the Government regarding what it proposed to do as the Brexit negotiations got under way.  What positions will it take?<\/p><p>The Government needs to ensure that adequate money - &euro;1 billion from the rainy day fund - should be deployed for the capital investment likely to be needed as a result of Brexit.  A &euro;250 million Brexit trade adjustment fund should be set up to support directly Irish businesses that suffer because of trade upheaval with the UK.  New transport connections will be needed, in particular at major ports and airports.  Others have pointed to the instability in Northern Ireland.  The prospect of Brexit negotiations is not helping that situation.  A special status for Northern Ireland needs to be incorporated in the negotiations.  At a minimum, a new Irish protocol to the EU treaties recognising the common travel area, the Good Friday Agreement and the unique situation of the Irish Border must be negotiated.<\/p><p>There have been disturbing signals about what might happen because of Brexit.  In an article in today's <i>The Irish Times<\/i>, Ms Patricia King points out the downward pressure likely to be applied as a result of the UK no longer having to observe minimum terms and conditions of employment as set down in EU treaties.  The concern is that there will be a race to the bottom among Irish businesses.  Pressure will be placed on Ireland and other EU countries to reduce the quality of workers' terms and conditions.<\/p><p>On behalf of Labour, I express solidarity with the Bus &Eacute;ireann strikers, who will be protesting outside Leinster House today.  We have called for the Minister, Deputy Ross, to take a stand on this matter.  He has been absent, as others have stated.  He needs to be engaged on this and convene a stakeholders forum.  The Government must commit to increasing subvention for public transport to EU levels.

The problem is, if a person accepts this maths waiver, they drop maths from the leaving certificate.

It calls for a medal ceremony in &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;n to recognise the scale of the injustice that they have suffered.

I assume it is because of the structure of the fire services under the management of local authorities but I ask the Leader to raise that with the relevant Minister, who I assume is the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Heather Humphreys, to address this anomaly and to ask her to, even now, belatedly ensure that they are presented with a medal to mark that commemorative year.

The people who knew about it did nothing about it until it came into the public domain.  To say that they instituted an audit within the force to examine it is wholly unacceptable.  When it is found out that there is a problem, the Minister is told.  There is a really big problem here.  It looks to be in the region of 10,000 to 15,000 miscarriages of justice.  We are on the ball now.  We are going to do something about it.<\/p> <p>This same applies to the mandatory alcohol tests.  The problem was known about.  Even Gay Byrne signalled the alarm on the basis of a former Garda reservist who had resigned in disgust on the basis of a letter sent to him two years ago.

We need action now.  We need the Minister with responsibility, that is the T&aacute;naiste, to institute the changes that are necessary in a matter of weeks.

How long did the Patten Commission take for that matter?  We cannot wait.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na must be reformed now.  There is one person who has ministerial responsibility under the Ministers and Secretaries Act to ensure that reform starts now and that is the T&aacute;naiste.

I note from the newspapers that there are 721 teachers who have still not been vetted and that there is work ongoing towards a resolution of that process at the moment.  The entire way we carry out Garda vetting has to be looked at.  A person could be vetted four or five times regarding different institutions or organisations they are involved in.  That is inappropriate.  There should be one vetting and then a person should be on the list.  That should be the routine.  <\/p> <p>I came across an issue in the last few weeks where an under-21 team in a GAA club had minors, that is 17 year-olds, on a team.  Given that they were under 18 years of age, they were informed that the rest of the team would have to be vetted because they are in the same dressing room.  There has to be logic in this.  Someone has to say that Garda vetting is important, but that it makes no sense that there is a need to vet all the 21 year-olds because there is a 17 year-old in a dressing room.

He should not only address the committee; he should address the unions and the company.

There has been debate about the lack of trust but one issue that has not been highlighted is that there will now be a difficulty accepting the evidence of garda&iacute; in courts.  It is important to resolve the Garda's current difficulties at a very early stage, in particular, where judges accepted the evidence of garda&iacute; that the fixed charge notice had been served and there is now clear evidence that it had not been.  A number of legal colleagues were on to me over the weekend about cases in which people went into the witness box and gave evidence under oath that they had not received the fixed charge notice.  The doubt was created but they had to go through all of that and it is an issue we need to address.  We need to build that trust not only in the Garda, but in the garda&iacute; presenting their evidence in court.<\/p> <p>I join my colleague, Senator Lombard, in thanking the Minister, Deputy Coveney, for the announcement yesterday that a major infrastructural development will take place to assist the building of new houses.  In my area of Cork North-Central, over &euro;30 million has been allocated which will enable more than 1,600 houses to be built.  It is a welcome development which could yield over 3,600 houses in the long term.  It is important that the infrastructure is put in place to fast track all the requirements for housing and that there are no further delays outside the planning issue.  Once planning permission was granted, there was always a delay in trying to put in the infrastructure.  It is important it is now done.  I welcome the announcement that was made in the past number of days.  It is important that all local authorities around the country identify projects that can assist the building of new houses.  It is the biggest expense people have in their lives and, therefore, the State must do everything possible to make it affordable for people.  The important part about the development is to make sure we have all the necessary infrastructure such as roads, water and sewage systems.  I welcome the development and the need for it to be fast tracked.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032900002#M00200","speaker":"1409"},{"type":"speech","time":1490779800,"counter":81,"content":"<p>I commend the Minister of State, Deputy Corcoran Kennedy, and the Minister, Deputy Harris, on signing the plain packaging legislation into law.

It causes misery for tens of thousands of others who suffer with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cancers and various other ailments that would be utterly avoidable if they did not smoke.  Plain packaging is a major initiative and one that is very important.  It does one of the most important things we can do, which is protecting children from ever taking up smoking.  Children are not stupid.  The Irish Cancer Society did a little survey where they showed children the current cigarette packets which they thought were nice and lovely to play with and they wanted them.  They were then shown the plain packs and they recoiled in horror.  Who would ever want to smoke?  This measure will save tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of lives in the future.  It will save the State a huge amount of money, some &euro;10 billion annually, that we spend on health and as a result of lost productivity.  This is a great day for children and for all smokers because these packs will remind them of the damage they are doing to themselves.

The Government will defend the Good Friday Agreement as we have always done.  We are working with Mr. Juncker and Mr. Tusk and if one reads their recent comments, one cannot but be heartened by the importance Ireland has been given in their remarks.  The position paper will be published by Government before 29 April.  We will have a very strong case across Europe but it requires the support of all parties.

I reiterate the remarks I made yesterday.  Nobody is winning in this dispute.  Nobody wants to see an all-out ballot of any union - in this case the bus workers - or of Dublin Bus or Irish Rail.  It is in no one's interest.  As Members have said, it is not in the interest of the workers, the company or the travelling public.  There is an absolute certainty here.

Funding was increased in the past two budgets and the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Leo Varadkar, is examining the provision of funding for the free travel scheme.  From my reading of it, the core of the issue is efficiency.  Such issues are best resolved at the WRC.  Everybody wants the dispute to be resolved.  I agree with Senator Diarmuid Wilson in that I do not want management in Bus &Eacute;ireann to keep the dispute going to the point where a solution cannot be found.

Craughwell, Frank Feighan, Michael McDowell, M&aacute;ire Devine and Colm Burke referred to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Government is committed to resolving the matter and an independent review is to be carried out.  I agree with Senator Michael McDowell that it is about governance and that the issue must be rectified immediately.  It amuses me when I hear Members of both Houses, in particular, Fianna F&aacute;il Members who were in government for 14 years in a row and appointed many of those in management in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, look for a head to roll.  The removal of the Garda Commissioner in itself would not lead to the cultural change and reform needed.  Let us not race to the bottom in politics to get someone sacked.  The substantive issue is the way in which An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is operated and how it is viewed by the public.  The challenge presented by the change of culture and regime requires serious political consideration and debate.  We all need action in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is awful and nauseating in waking up every morning and listening to \"Morning Ireland\", or whatever programme one listens to, to hear a new story emerge about An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which does nothing for the morale of rank and file garda&iacute; who are doing the very best they can.  As the party that founded An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which has always held it in respect and that stood up for law and order when others did not, we will stand by it and see a new force emerge.  We need a Patten-type report.  I agree with Senator Michael McDowell that it should not take two years, but we need to see reform which must happen now.  I am very committed, as are the Minister for Justice and Equality and members of my party, to standing by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and bringing about regime change.  There is a need for a regularisation of affairs with the Revenue Commissioners and significant reform.  It was the Fine Gael Party in government with the Labour Party that changed the appointment method for Garda Commissioners and promotions to other senior positions.  Let us be clear: it was not the parties opposite but my party that changed the regime.  What we must also do is restore public trust and confidence in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which, regrettably, are at an all-time low.  I am a member of a number of policing fora in Cork city and county and pose the question to myself every time I attend a meeting as to whether the statistics read out are correct.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na must re-establish the trust and confidence of the public, an gn&aacute;th dhuine.  There is a need for a forensic review of operations to put in place a new An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We should all look at the Garda Inspectorate's report, Changing Policing in Ireland, which contains some very good information and which will result in action.<\/p> <p>Senator Paul Gavan referred to community workers and the Minister involved attending the WRC.  I am not aware of the matter.  If the Senator wishes to send me an e-mail, I will be happy to take up the issue with the Minister.<\/p> <p>Senators Grace O'Sullivan and Frances Black raised the cases of Grace and Mary.  Senator M&aacute;ire Devine also touched on the issue.  It is important that there be accountability and transparency in the protocols between Tusla and the HSE for persons in care and those involved in fostering because it is a specialised area in which so much joy, relief and comfort are brought to people.  However, there is an issue that must be addressed and I will be happy to have the relevant Minister come to the House to discuss it.<\/p> <p>Senator Ivana Bacik referred to President Trump's new executive order.

I join him in hoping the very fine report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children will be implemented and that we will have a soft opt-out system.  I will not get into a debate with him on the role of certain people in helping the cause of organ donation, but what we must do is ensure that we collectively change the policy in order that more people will assist in organ donation.<\/p> <p>I congratulate Senators Lynn Ruane and John Dolan on the reversal of the decision on DIT access students.

I know that what is being sought is not much in terms of change and the Senator and I are on common ground in that regard.  I am trying to make progress on the issue.  To be fair to the Minister of State, he is very amenable but work remains to be done.  I am happy to work with the Senator on the issue.  As regards front-line service personnel, I am surprised by what the Senator said that fire brigade personnel do not receive commemorative medals, given that other first-line responders do.  Perhaps we might raise the issue as part of our discussion with the Minister of State.  The current arrangement does not make sense to me.<\/p> <p>Senator Tim Lombard raised the issue of Garda vetting.  The Minister for Justice and Equality was in the House last week to respond to a Commencement matter on the issue.  It is important that we address it.  It is an area in which improvements have been seen, but we must ensure transparency and uniformity of approach.<\/p> <p>Senator Diarmuid Wilson also raised the issue of judicial appointments.  I reiterate what I said yesterday, that we all recognise the importance of having an independent judiciary.  We accept the excellence of the Judiciary in the work it does and the role it plays.  I will be happy to have the Minister for Justice and Equality come to the House to discuss the issue in the context of the judicial appointments Bill.<\/p> <p>Senator M&aacute;ire Devine referred to children in care.  She raised the issue of access to HSE disability services in the context of the memo to the Government yesterday.  We all accept that it is an important step.

We have some distance to travel in the provision of disability services and I hope the Government will be able to put together a package in that regard.<\/p> <p>Senator Neale Richmond referred to the stand-off between the Irish Hockey Association and Belfield.

It is for the commission to decide and I would be happy to work with the Senator to help reach a common-sense approach<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032900002#O00900","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1490779800,"counter":107,"content":"<p>We should be trusted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032900002#O01000","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1490779800,"counter":108,"content":"<p>Order of Business agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Heritage Bill 2016: Committee Stage (Resumed)","time":1490779800,"counter":109,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032900002#O01200"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1490779800,"counter":110,"content":"<p>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1h:<\/p><p>- (Senator Lynn Ruane)<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1490779800,"counter":111,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.

Roadside hedges are beyond the range of chemicals used in agriculture, also making them more suitable.<\/p><p>Upland areas often hold populations of more specialised rarer butterflies, such as the legally protected marsh fritillary butterfly.  The sociable caterpillars of this butterfly emerge from hibernation in late February-early March feeding on grassland containing its food plant.  Burning destroys this species by burning the larva.<\/p><p>These are the kind of issues that need to be considered in any screening and assessment and it is important that not only are these screenings carried out, but that they should be published.  For that reason, I am happy to strongly support the amendment in the name of Senator Kevin Humphreys.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032900002#S00400","speaker":"1392","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490779800,"counter":171,"content":"<p>I will speak briefly to the group.<\/p> <p>In principle, when a notice is published in respect of a proposed by-law it should have already been screen.  We do not want to see by-laws published where there is a 90 period and there is information missing.  We would expect that if Waterways Ireland is publishing by-laws, it would have already ensured that all of the necessary screenings and checks are taking place.  We certainly should not be relying on members of the public to express concern, to ask for a review or to ask that these obligations would be met because in many cases it will not be feasible within a 90 day period to get the necessary information.  It is a practical amendment.  If the Minister, for example, indicated that she wanted to include it anyway, I am sure we might not even need to press it.  We will have the opportunity to see if that is the case.  That would be useful.<\/p> <p>I recognise my colleague has a similar amendment in respect of birds.  This may be an area where the Minister can indicate that she would plan to ensure that this is a necessary prerequisite on Waterways Ireland before it brings a proposal to the public and opens a 90 day period for consultation.  I recognise and appreciate that the Minister indicated she is open to that 90 day period rather than the previously proposed 21 day period.  It is an improvement.<\/p> <p>I will not speak to all of the amendments in this area.  I recognise there has been some engagement.  We will be watching closely and hoping that many of our other amendments will be reflected by the Department on Report State due to the Minister's contact now with groups such as the canal users, but there are a few amendments which may need to be pressed because they are important points of principle.<\/p> <p>In respect of amendment No. a1z, Senator Craughwell has a proposal, which I strongly support, which states that it is not enough that notice of a proposed by-law should be published.  It is important that a local authority should be directly communicated with in writing to be informed that a by-law will impact on its local area.  I imagine there will be support across the House.  Many of us across the House have contact with local authorities.  It is a reasonable request that if Waterways Ireland is bringing in a by-law, it would write to the local authorities in the area which will be affected by the by-law and simply notify them of it so that they have an opportunity to act in the 90 days.<\/p> <p>I will skip through to another one, which is amendment No. 1ad.  Given the new authorities and the creation of new by-laws, if persons are approached by an authorised officer and informed that he or she is in breach of by-laws or laws in respect of the canals, the persons should be immediately informed of and shown what by-law they are in breach of or in danger of breaching.  These are pragmatic requests.  The reasons they are the ones we intend to press, unless of course the Minister indicates to directly absorb them into the Bill, is because they are important principles.  The amendment states that an authorised officer should be able on request to offer or show physically the by-law - it may be as simple as a booklet.  They should be able to show somebody the by-law which he or she is in breach of.  It is a simple and appropriate amendment.  In terms of any due process of law, it is very reasonable that a person who is told he or she is breaking a law be told what law the person is breaking and that the person is able to see it.  It is simply that they would present a hard copy of the by-law.  It is not enough to be told one is breaking a law and to go and check it on the website later.  One needs to be able to see it, there and then.<\/p> <p>In terms of amendment No. 1ae, this is another crucial and important point.  It is in respect of the new by-laws.  There are considerable powers in respect of by-laws being given to Waterways Ireland.  We have a reasonable proposal here - we would be happy to work with the Department if it has a counter suggestion which is similar and achieves the same policy intent - that Waterways Ireland should, every 36 months, review its by-laws with a specific focus on the new by-laws that have been introduced in the past three years.  They should review how these new by-laws are working and whether there are any unintended consequences and they should hold a public consultation so that they can assess the effect, positive or negative, of the by-laws introduced, and that public consultation should take place during the open season.  Of course, what nobody here wants is a situation whereby a by-law is brought in in October, November or December and it is only in the following summer season, in June, July and August, that is the peak tourism season, where we see the effect of the by-law and maybe some inadvertent consequences.  This ensures that we are able to ensure that by-laws that are put in place are reviewed and tested and that we all can learn and benefit from assessing their impact.<\/p> <p>One last amendment is important.  Proposed by Senator Norris, it is amendment No. 1af.  Waterways Ireland can, in addition to producing by-laws with the 90 day provision that we have heard, add ancillary provisions it deems appropriate.  We do not want to see a by-law the interpretation of which extends at great length to mean all kinds of different things and that we have one by-law with seven subsections that get added at a later stage.  Every new proposal should come through with the same kind of robust public engagement - the 90 day consultation for which the Minister has rightly allowed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032900002#T00200","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1490779800,"counter":172,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 1af is not included in this group.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032900002#T00300","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1490779800,"counter":173,"content":"<p>Apologies.

I thank the Minister for facilitating the helpful consultation period in the AV room with Waterways Ireland staff.  However, I was deeply disappointed by their level of interaction.  There was none, and we felt as if our views did not matter.  I can relate to the experiences of residents and others along the Barrow line, given that Waterways Ireland, which is a North-South body, seems determined to proceed irrespective of democracy or the wishes of local users.  I was disappointed with the consultation.  Perhaps we can touch on that issue later.<\/p> <p>Regarding amendment No. 1x, Waterways Ireland must comply with screening and assessments under European legislation.  I would appreciate clarification on the matter.  Any planning process should cover this, but I would like to hear the Minister's comments on the by-laws in terms of this amendment.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 1y refers to 21 days, but the Minister indicated that she would increase the period to 90 days, which we welcome.  Will she clarify how she will implement that?  Presumably, a departmental amendment will be submitted on Report Stage.  If so, that would be good.  Not just local authorities, but all stakeholders and users should be covered by the 90-day period.<\/p> <p>In light of the recent presentation given by Waterways Ireland in the AV room, an element of local democratic accountability must be brought into the mix.  I do not mean \"consultation\" where people are told what will happen.  That is not consultation, it is dictating, and it is what has happened to date.  Consultation has to be prescriptive and there must be a statutory obligation on Waterways Ireland to engage with the element of democracy closest to the people, namely, the councillors and officials of local government.  This must be done so that the interests of local stakeholders are protected.  That is why the 90-day period is so important.  While I welcome the period, there may be a requirement to follow up with additional measures, and I would be interested in the Minister's comments on same.  Amendments Nos. 1aa and 1ab are linked to the matter of 90 days and I welcome that the initial amendment is being accepted.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 1ad refers to \"Authorised Officers\", a matter discussed by Senator Higgins.  The amendment seeks to require authorised officers to present copies of the by-laws.  This is only right.

Many of the issues covered in the amendments were discussed along with other canal-related issues.  There was a shared understanding on both sides of the importance of the canals to rural areas for tourism development and local communities.  The Inland Waterways Association of Ireland recognised the rights of the regulator to regulate and that legislation should cover regulators, user requirements and by-laws.  The importance of having regular engagement was acknowledged and my officials are happy to work with the IWAI on any issues of concern it may have.  My officials also had a very good meeting with Senators for which I thank them.<\/p> <p>The proposed amendments Nos. 1x and a1y are not needed because any provision in the Canals Act that makes or may make provision for land use must comply with the obligations under the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011.  As with everyone else, Waterways Ireland is subject to habitats directives.  If we keep repeating it in legislation, it becomes very cumbersome.  It is given that it has to comply with them so there is no need to put that in.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 1y is about notifying identified users.  Waterways Ireland automatically notifies all registered boat users, representative groups and local authorities as part of the process.  My problem is that there is no such thing as a registered user of a canal.  It would be very hard to identify them.  This public consultation or notification would be run on the same basis as a local authority would do it, by advertising in the newspaper and publishing it on the website.  It is incumbent on those using the canal to make themselves aware of any changes that might be made.<\/p> <p>As I have indicated, I am happy to introduce an amendment on Report Stage to extend the consultation period for making the by-laws to up to 90 days.  That gives people with an interest in the canals and waterways 90 days to make a submission.  By stating registered users, someone could be left out and we would not even know who had been left out.  It is very hard to do that.

I have a number of examples where it has worked very well on a collaborative basis on projects.  On the Shannon-Erne Blueway, from Ballyconnell down to Carrick-on-Shannon there have been a number of projects that have worked extremely well.  There is a good working relationship between local authorities and Waterways Ireland.  In my county, Waterways Ireland was the lead partner in an application for funding in conjunction with the local authority that actually produced &euro;5 million in indirect money to develop the blueway along the route of the Ulster Canal from Smithborough to Middletown on a cross-Border basis.  They work very collaboratively.  I have complimented Waterways Ireland on how it works with local authorities in introducing good projects with tourism benefits for the local community and the wider public.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032900002#V00900","speaker":"1249"},{"type":"speech","time":1490779800,"counter":210,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for arranging the meeting with her officials which I found quite helpful.<\/p> <p>The Minister did not address the review mechanism.

I introduced legislation in this House which would introduce fixed penalty notices for minor offences for small fishermen instead of convictions in court and fines.  That is what is proposed here as well, a fixed penalty notice with a reasonable limit.  If the only recourse here is a class D fine, then the person or persons convicted are looking at paying out between &euro;501 and &euro;1,000 per offence.  There could be additional offences as well.  There are consequences here and the risk of major financial liabilities.  There should be a staggered system, if nothing else, and not just the option of a class D fine.  If someone is in contravention of, for example, four or five different by-laws it could stack up.  There should be some sort of a staggered system introduced which would include fixed penalty notices.

Fixed penalty notices are the way to go.  They make sense.  The justice system and the courts are clogged up enough without having to deal with minor offences such as these.  The comparator would be fixed penalty notices for driving offences such as speeding which start at &euro;80.  In this instance, they start at &euro;150.  Presumably the system is staggered, depending on the nature of the offence involved, and that there is not just a flat rate of &euro;150, irrespective of the severity of the offence involved.  I am not even sure what the offences could or would be.  Will the Minister give examples of offences and tell us whether she believes a sum of &euro;150 is appropriate?  Should lower sums be specified staggered upwards according to severity?<\/p> <p>Amendment 1ak relates to increasing the payment period from 21 days to 30.  This is a reasonable request as most people are paid monthly.  These are new financial times in which people are in mortgage distress and have bills to pay and so on.  In the financial calendar credit cards, etc. work on a 30-day period.  Would it not be reasonable, therefore, to increase the period to 30 days?<\/p> <p>Senator Jennifer Murnane O'Connor will speak on this issue in more detail, but I agree that there should be some appeals mechanism at the fixed penalty notice level.  It is most likely that the only way to appeal it will be to not pay it, meaning that the person concerned will end up in the courts.  There should be some internal appeals mechanism similar to the appeals system in the Department of Social Protection whereby individuals could within 30 days register their grievance or appeal.  Within a further 30 days, Waterways Ireland would issue a response.  Perhaps there might be some such mechanism.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032900002#Y00800","speaker":"1382"},{"type":"speech","time":1490779800,"counter":328,"content":"<p>I agree with Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill.

We did not have an opportunity to discuss the previous section but it dealt with allowing people to board boats.  Amendment No. 1aaf refers to search warrants.  My colleague and I are concerned that the current legislation allows authorised officers to get search warrants to enter and search boats accompanied by anyone whom they believe to be appropriate.  My colleague and I believe this aspect must be clarified.  In ideal circumstances search warrants should only be issued to a garda, a customs official or a Revenue official.  The ability to grant search warrants to authorised officers is quite a considerable power.<\/p><p>We are concerned about the provision which states: &quot;A search warrant under this section shall be expressed and operate to authorise a named authorised officer, accompanied by such authorised officers or other persons as the named authorised officer thinks necessary.&quot;  We believe that if an authorised officer is issued with a search warrant, he or she should be accompanied by a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, a customs official, a Revenue official or health and safety inspector.  We also believe that they should be the determinants.  Perhaps authorised officers from Waterways Ireland could also ask for a search warrant.<\/p><p>The power I have alluded to is very considerable.  My colleague and I will probably not push the amendment.  We urge the Department to review granting a considerable power to search and enter people's private properties and homes to authorised officers as stipulated in this legislation.  This is particularly important given the fact that we have not been reassured about the accountability of authorised officers.  I do not plan to press these amendments at this point but I want to discuss the matter.  The granting of search warrants is quite a considerable power and the persons who use search warrants must be accountable.  I am concerned about this power and ask the Minister to address the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032900002#BB01500","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1490779800,"counter":409,"content":"<p>Is the Senator forewarning the Minister for Report Stage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032900002#BB01600","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1490779800,"counter":410,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032900002#BB01700","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1490779800,"counter":411,"content":"<p>I agree with the Senator that these powers usually reside with a garda, a Revenue official or a customs officer.

It is absurd for a Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs to come in here and blather on about hedges.  What have hedges got to do with heritage?  It is a complete and absolute nonsense.  The absence of scientific evidence on the part of the Minister has been underlined throughout the debate.  No survey has been done and this is disastrous.  It is appalling that the Government would introduce policy based on no scientific research whatsoever.<\/p><p>The Heritage Bill proposal to allow burning in March would have a very serious impact on upland breeding birds.  Birdwatch Ireland, a professional body engaged in this area, presented the best available data to the Minister but the science is being totally ignored.  It might as well not have been done.  We need Irish data so we need a proper pilot study, not a mass implementation of a policy which is unsupported by science.  The necessary research must take place before this is implemented.<\/p><p>What science underpins the proposed changes to ensure birds are not impacted?  What evidence has the Minister got for this?  She has presented none to this House.  If a pilot study shows that nesting birds have been impacted what will the Government's policy objectives be?  Will this alter the situation?  Can we have the details of what secondary legislation is envisaged by the Government?<\/p><p>According to Derek Mooney, a well-known populariser of natural history, modern farming practice has taken its toll on wildlife and the destruction of hedgerows has greatly reduced the cover of mammals and birds.  He said seed-eating birds will decline drastically in numbers and the shortage of insect larvae will make it difficult for birds to raise their young.  Three quarters of an hour ago in this House I adverted to the impact on the moth and butterfly population so I will not regurgitate it.<\/p><p>We do not have much scientific evidence in Ireland as it simply has not been done.  I would, however, like to put on the record the results of a survey conducted by the University of Leeds on the impact of peat burning on the chemical composition of the landscape.  It states that p<font color=\"#231F20\">rescribed burning on peatlands was shown to have clear effects on peat hydrology, peat chemistry and physical properties, river water chemistry and river ecology.  It is a substantial impact.  It also states:<\/font><\/p><blockquote><font color=\"#231F20\">Burning reduces the organic matter content of the upper peat layers.  The net result is that the peat is less able to retain important particles known as exchangeable cations.  In other words, the peat in burned sites is deprived of chemicals which are important for plant growth and for buffering acidic rainfall.  [By burning peat we are creating conditions that are adverse to important plant growth.]  Lower concentrations of nutrient elements found in peat soils in burned river basins do not support the idea that burning enriches the peat with nutrients from ash.  [We are often told that by burning on grassland, gorse and scrub areas one gets a fresh growth of grass but this does not appear to be the case with regard to peatlands.]  Rivers draining burned catchments were characterised by lower calcium concentrations and lower pH relative to rivers draining unburned catchments.  Rivers draining burned sites had higher concentrations of silica, manganese, iron and aluminium compared to unburned catchments.  There was no difference between burned and unburned catchments in peat nitrogen concentrations or in carbon to nitrogen ratios (high C\/N is considered unfavourable to microbial decomposition of peat) ... Water-table depth is very important in peatlands for maintaining their stability and function as a carbon store.  Water tables were found to be significantly deeper for burned catchments than for unburned ones.  Deeper water tables would suggest a greater scope for degradation of the peat and loss of carbon to the atmosphere.<\/font><\/blockquote> <p><font color=\"#231F20\">In other words it is carbon negative.  The report further states that sphagnum is an important peat-forming species.  Sphagnum grows on the bogs and in historical times it was used as a dressing for wounds as it has powerful medicinal properties.  The report goes on:<\/font><\/p><blockquote><font color=\"#231F20\">Changes in the hydrological properties of the peat after fire make the peat less conducive to Sphagnum moss growth.  River flow in catchments where burning has taken place appears to be slightly more prone to higher flow peaks during heavy rain.  However, this was not a conclusive finding.  Burning vegetation alters the natural peat hydrology in the upper layers of the peat affecting the balance of where water flow occurs.  Recovery of many hydrological properties appears to be possible if a site is left unburned over many years.  [This means the site shows a capacity to recover.]  Thermal regimes appear to recover as vegetation regrows.  This recovery was also seen in soil hydrology data from burned plots of different ages.  Macroinvertebrates play a vital role in aquatic food webs by feeding on algae, microbes and detritus at the base of food chains before they themselves are consumed by birds, fish and amphibians.  The research found that river macroinvertebrate diversity was reduced in burned sites.  [This means there is a reduction in the small fauna in burnt areas.]  In burned sites, river macroinvertebrate populations were dominated by groups that are commonly found in higher abundance in disturbed river systems, such as non-biting midge larvae (Chironomidae) and burrowing stonefly larvae (Nemouridae).  Increases in the abundance of disturbance-tolerant taxa counteract declines and\/or losses amongst some groups (e.g. mayflies) which are typically sensitive to reduced pH, increased aluminium and deposition of fine sediments.  These changes show that burning increases the effect of biological stressors compared to unburned rivers.<\/font><\/blockquote> <p><font color=\"#231F20\">All these things suggest a dramatic impact on the chemistry and ecology of peatlands.  In addition, section 8 extends the burning period which would affect a significant proportion of our most threatened species.  Upland burning has been shown to have some positive aspects but it is essential that threatened species are not wiped out.  Among those species are curlew, which used to be a very common feature of the Irish landscape.  Now one hardly ever hears the curlew's call, or the golden plover.  This section needs to vigorously opposed and then rethought.  I ask the Minister to do so.<\/font><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032900002#DD00200","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"speech","time":1490779800,"counter":450,"content":"<p>I have a real problem with this.

This is primary legislation and the baseline study must be outlined in detail in terms of what counties are covered and how many kilometres of hedgerows will be taken into account.

I wish to be clear that sometimes I do not always get the opportunity to speak.<\/p> <p>I appreciate the concerns that have been expressed by a number of Senators on the impact the provisions might have on biodiversity.  I share the views of Senators that hedgerows are a very important wildlife habitat that provide food, shelter, corridors of movement, nests and hibernation sites for many native flora and fauna.  The changes in timing of cutting which are set out in the Bill will not interfere with any of those functions.  As I stated previously, my intention is that any hedge trimming in the month of August may only take place on road sides or on land where reseeding or tillage is being carried out and that the trimming may only be of the current year's growth and should not involve the use of heavy flails or grubbing.  If a person needs to carry out heavier cutting of hedges such as grubbing and flailing they must do so during the existing permitted period between September and the end of February.  I wish to be clear; it was never my intention to allow the grubbing, heavy cutting or destruction of hedges in August.  The text reflected the wording in the original legislation and I now propose on Report Stage to delete the words \"grubbing\" or \"destroying otherwise\" from section 8(2) of the Bill.<\/p> <p>To be clear, this is a pilot scheme for two years, subject to regulations and guidelines and there will be monitoring of the pilot phase.  After two years it must come back to both Houses of the Oireachtas, which must pass a resolution &ndash; that means it will not be a nodding exercise &ndash; for the pilot period to continue and if it is not passed the pilot scheme will fall and the scheme will cease.<\/p> <p>Section 8 also allows for the controlled burning in certain areas to be specified by regulation during March should it be necessary, for example, due to adverse weather conditions.  Members are all aware of the illegal burning that takes place.  What I want to do is allow flexibility to work with landowners and to do that in a managed and safe way.<\/p> <p>Section 8 also provides for managed hedge cutting to be allowed under strict criteria during August to help ensure overgrown hedges impacting on roads can be tackled.  The sunset clause of two years provided for in section 8 can only be extended by separate resolutions of the Seanad and the D&aacute;il.  It is good practice for the provisions to be reviewed during the two-year period in order that we can assess the works in practice and determine if there are any lessons to be learned or if any improvements are needed.  We must also ensure that the new provisions should not adversely impact on wildlife.  That will be a key aim of mine, taking account of my responsibilities for natural heritage.<\/p> <p>I am aware of some concerns surrounding scientific data to underpin the nesting and breeding periods for wild birds.  I am satisfied that the provisions to be put in place in section 8 fully respect the requirements of the nesting and breeding seasons for wild birds.  Furthermore, Senators will note that the provisions in the section provide that the cutting of hedgerows in August will only be possible if it is done in accordance with regulations which I will make in relation to hedgerow husbandry and to ensure that wildlife and other flora and fauna are protected.  No cutting will be possible in the absence of the regulations.  The provisions in the Bill are for a pilot phase of two years.  In that time my Department will monitor activity under the provisions and an assessment of the impacts will be carried out before any decision is taken on continuing the measures beyond the pilot phase.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032900002#EE00700","speaker":"1249"},{"type":"speech","time":1490779800,"counter":458,"content":"<p>When the damage is already done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032900002#EE00800","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"speech","time":1490779800,"counter":459,"content":"<p>My Department will work towards gathering further data to inform decision making into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032900002#EE00900","speaker":"1249"},{"type":"speech","time":1490779800,"counter":460,"content":"<p>How can the Department get further data when it does not have any?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032900002#EE01000","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"speech","time":1490779800,"counter":461,"content":"<p>My Department will work towards gathering further data to inform decision making in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032900002#EE01100","speaker":"1249"},{"type":"speech","time":1490779800,"counter":462,"content":"<p>It is not further data.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032900002#EE01200","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"speech","time":1490779800,"counter":463,"content":"<p>I also intend to launch a public awareness process for all stakeholders, including local authorities, landowners and members of the public so that they are fully informed as to the restrictions on hedge cutting and burning.

This represents only a small percentage of the overall hedgerows in the country.  Furthermore - I have said it before and will say it again - I will prohibit grubbing and flailing in August.

I will not go extensively into amendment No. 3, which I believe we will be debating together.<\/p> <p>I need to correct two key points for the record.  We have had this debate and I do not think it is constructive.  As a Minister for all of Ireland, the Minister needs to be very clear that it is not constructive to suggest or ascribe comments to the Seanad.  Nobody here has cast any aspersions about farmers.  That has been clear.  We spoke as custodians.  My colleague spoke as her father is a proud member of the Irish Farmers' Association, IFA.  We have spoken about the interests of farmers, for example, horticultural farmers, those growing crops who are deeply concerned about the impacts of this legislation on pollinators.  We need to be very careful and appropriate and not try to create division where division has not been sown in this House.<\/p> <p>I would also like to make a technical correction.  The Minister said \"as all who would live in rural areas\".  All who live in rural areas and many of us who now live in urban areas are aware that the legislation is currently that councils can issue a permit which will allow the landowner to cut the hedge.  The Minister suggested that councils can cut hedges but do not have the capacity to do so.  The section 70 order allows a landowner to cut the hedge.  I do not believe in this context that this was accurate.  Let us be accurate about what the legislation provides.<\/p> <p>That said, I believe there is a resource issue.  It would be useful, as we have often said before, if we looked at places like County Clare and others where resources have been given to county councils to allow them to support the hedge cutting in issues of road safety.  I acknowledge that my colleague, Senator Kevin Humphreys, kindly acknowledged the amendment I put forward along with my colleague Senator Grace O'Sullivan, which would have strengthened road safety.  Our amendment is the only amendment to this legislation that is explicitly set out to strengthen road safety.  It was to ensure that not only landowners would be allowed to cut hedges where they feel there is a road safety concern, but that individuals could do so too.  We heard passionate testimony from persons with a disability about the obstructions for them.  Any person who is a road user or a path user could ask for a section 70 order to be issued.  It was a strengthening provision to allow road users who are concerned about road safety to ask for an exception.  Where road safety is a concern, section 70 allows for cutting at any time of year, 365 days a year.<\/p> <p>I wish to speak on amendment No. 2 and my other concerns around gorse-burning and hedges.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032900002#FF04300","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1490779800,"counter":513,"content":"<p>Is this on a new section?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032900002#FF04400","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1490779800,"counter":514,"content":"<p>It is amendment No. 2.  We are speaking only on amendment No. 2.  Those were simply clarifications of the Minister's speech.<\/p> <p>On amendment No. 2, unfortunately, the Minister did not comment on her views on baseline data.  We have been hearing at length that this is a pilot.  We have been hearing ideas as to what might be done.  We need to be very clear on the messages the Minister has given today with regard to one year's growth, what is or is not included and where it will be targeted.  None of this is currently in the legislation.  At present, the legislation gives clear and wide permission, and none of the constraints or the concerns on which we have heard very welcome suggestions from the Minister are in the legislation before the House.  We need to be very clear.  It is imperative that the Minister puts what she is saying here in the Chamber into the legislation.  We have a very wide divide at the moment between stated policy intent and the legislation that is before the House.<\/p> <p>There is also a concern when we talk about a pilot.  We have not really heard what is the intention of the pilot.  Why are we doing a pilot on cutting?  What is the urgency?  We know that road safety can be addressed elsewhere.  What is the driver?  What is the Minister's perspective as Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs?  What is the major heritage concern in rural areas that is driving this intrusion into our wildlife legislation?  It is a template that has stood for a long time and has been copied across Europe and in the UK.  We need to know why we are doing this pilot, and the case for doing it needs to be strong.  There is a key concern.  The Minister talks about science and such, but she is still talking about assessing the impacts.  If we do not have a baseline, we do not know how to assess the impacts.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->At present, there is no provision for baseline data gathering.  If, in two years' time, we simply say here is the situation now for whatever species may have expired or still be there, there will be no indication as to from where we have come or what we may have lost.  As I have said before and I will not repeat it in the Chamber, we know from the people who write to us and who monitor nature in their own areas that they have seen what has been lost already.  What about a baseline?  The Minister has not made provision for a baseline or indicated for a baseline.  Amendment No. 2 is separate to our general provision.  We have put forward very reasonable and appropriate scientific terms under which a baseline could be conducted so we know what is the biodiversity in our hedgerows right now, what is the nature of our hedgerows, what is there and what species are there.  We have information from the UK, which has done this research, and it is very interesting that when the UK conducted research on its hedgerows and looked at its baselines and impacts, it decided to change and copy our legislation because it was better.  It decided to remove August from the period of cutting and burning.  We also need to be clear that there needs to be freedom.<\/p><p>The Minister mentioned assessment.  At no point in the legislation do we have clarity on what assessment will be published, where it will be shared and how we will all be able to talk about what has happened during the two year period.  There is no plan for the pilot at present.  There is no specification.  It is not simply enough for the Minister to ask for blanket permission to invent a pilot.  The pilot cannot be all of Ireland and the Minister needs to set out what proportion of Ireland will be covered and not covered.  The Minister is giving assurances which, sadly, I do not believe she is in a position to give, that no wildlife will be affected.  We just do not know this unless we have the data and the science.<\/p><p>I welcome the Minister's comments on grubbing.  That is dealt with in amendment No. 3.  I imagine the Minister plans to accept our amendment on grubbing and destroying.  I also welcome the Minister's comments on flailing.  I note we will have an opportunity in this regard, if the Minister is genuinely serious about addressing issues of grubbing and flailing, as amendments to section 10 look to strengthen and set out regulations in respect of both of these practices.<\/p><p>I will not speak to the substance of section 8 until we come to the next group of amendments.

This is no surprise because in essence it is quite clear this section is designed to pre-empt any measure such as section 8 without a baseline data study being put in place to justify it.  There are a few points we must consider on what is being proposed.  The Minister has indicated road safety is an issue which concerns her and motivates the legislation.  If this is the case, I would like to see some mention of road safety as one of the criteria for making regulations in her section when we come to it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032900002#GG00200","speaker":"1403"},{"type":"speech","time":1490779800,"counter":517,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032900002#GG00300","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"speech","time":1490779800,"counter":518,"content":"<p>It seems to me if this is one of the genuine motivating factors one would expect it to appear as one of the criteria by which regulations would be crafted, but we do not see this.  In a spirit of genuine conciliation in this debate it seems to me the Minister should indicate she is open to accepting the introduction of road safety as one of the constraining factors in section 8 if her section 8 is to proceed.<\/p><p>The second point that occurs to me is there is a distinction between section 8(1) which is a burning section and section 8(2) which, at present, is a cutting, grubbing or destroying section, but the Minister now indicates it is purely to be cutting.  It is very notable from the wording of section 8(1) it is proposed it should apply to such part or parts of the State as the regulations may permit.  When we look to the regulations envisaged by section 8(2) no such geographical criteria are there.  If we were considering a genuine pilot study to evaluate whether this should take place on scientific grounds, and bearing in mind the implications for wildlife and flora and fauna, one would expect, even from the point of view of having control studies and the like, that any scientific approach to a pilot study would look at areas where it was permitted and areas where it was not permitted, and see whether there was any significant difference between the two.  I was interested that Michael Viney in an article on this subject in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>pointed out there are particular species which produce second clutches of eggs and chicks in August each year.  The beekeepers of Ireland have come forward and their objections are based on the needs of bees with regard to cutting back that year's growth.<\/p><p>This brings me to the next point the Minister mentioned in her contribution.  She mentioned the regulations she had in mind would deal with roadside hedge cutting and non-roadside hedge cutting where it was necessary for land management in a tillage context.  Why is this not mentioned in the section?  I am worried by a particular point in all of this.  I do not doubt the Minister's good faith for a minute, but it is all very well to say that cutting would be restricted to that year's growth, whatever that would mean for bees and animals dependent on berries, but if somebody brings a machine into a field and starts cutting, afterwards who will say the person cutting went further than this year's growth?  In the real world what inspector will be sent out, and by whom, to crawl along the hedges and state that cutting has gone a bit further than this year's growth and it is 4 inches into last year's growth?  Where will the line be drawn?  People will not be out with secateurs and measuring tapes.  Either a hedge cutting machine will be deployed on a hedge or it will not.  In the aftermath, there will be nothing to show how far into last year's growth the cutting actually went.

There is not the mechanism, machinery, resources or capacity on the part of any wildlife agency or conservation body to do anything effective to stop widespread cutting of hedges in August once an order is made under this regulation.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Michael McDowell:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=719\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Nobody will be able to police any regulations effectively.  I do not see why we have not been shown the draft regulation.  We pass referendums and we see the draft Bill.  The child adoption Bill was put before the people, the abortion Bill was put before the people, divorce legislation was put before the people in draft, various pieces of legislation are put before the people on occasions so they could work out what they were actually voting for.  On this occasion no attempt has been made to produce a draft regulation which has the limiting factor such as tillage and land management and this season's growth, all of these issues are just absent from the legislation.  It occurs to me that if this season's growth is to be a genuine criterion, there is absolutely no reason it should not be mentioned in the legislation in respect of off-road hedge cutting.  I presume the Minister would tell me before we go much further that she would accept an amendment on Report Stage to do that.  If she is not willing to say that, and put it in the legislation that it is intended to have that minor effect, there is no point in making a speech justifying it in this House by reference to something she is not willing to commit to in legislation.  <br\/><br\/>Likewise, if it is required for the purposes of reasonable land management, what do we mean by that?  If it is to be in a tillage context, let us see what is actually meant by all of that.  What I am coming down to is this - that the amendment proposed is effectively putting in place a standstill until some scientific basis for a change in this area is established on scientific grounds.  That is the precautionary principle that we are supposed to follow in environmental matters.  It worries me that this seems to be a very unscientific, broad-brush approach and one which gives a free licence to all farmers to attack any hedge.  Even if the Minister took out grubbing and destroying, as long as there is something left at the end of the operation the possibility of proving that any particular landowner had infringed the legislation would be very small indeed as would the the chance of enforcing it.  <br\/><br\/>Lastly, I do not want to reignite the controversy that we saw some moments ago.  This is not a question of the townies versus the farmers.  This is not about idealists.  Some of us are very conversant with rural Ireland, and know what it is like when a bramble grows out of a ditch and it forces bikes out into the road and such like.  No one needs to have a particular background to know what growth occurs and what the road safety implications can be of roadside hedges growing out onto the road in summer.  By the same token, although some people may get hotheaded on social media and use broad-brush language about this particular proposal, the Minister should not underestimate the feeling that there is on this issue.  It is not just that <i>The Irish Times <\/i>wrote an editorial on this and praised this House for querying what the Minister is doing.  There is a huge amount of people in Ireland who object to this, they object to its unscientific basis, the manner in which it has been done, the absence of draft regulations, the unthought-out way that this has been done; they object to what they suspect is just a deal done with farmers' organisations and that it why it is being pushed forward with such vehemence.  We live in a very uncertain world but I do believe that if by any chance the Minister manages to progress this into legislation she should bear in mind that this Government has a lot of problems - we only have to look around at what has been happening in the last week - and this is going to alienate a very significant area of votes from it.

There are an awful lot of people outside this House who would say she should get on with her Bill and leave out section 8.  Those people would be well disposed to the Minister if they felt that she had listened to a debate in this House where considered opposition to section 8 had been voiced.  I do not think that it would do any harm to her electorally or to her ministerial standing.  As one of the people who admires many of the things the Minister does, I do not believe that it would detract in the slightest if between now and Report Stage, she were to reconsider her support for section 8.  I do not think that the farming organisations would go mad if she modified section 8 along the lines that she says she intends to do and could do by restricting its application.  I do think that with so many political problems around her neck, this is not a case of her taking the hard decision in the national interest.  It does not fall into that category and the Minister should not think of herself, or the Government of itself, as taking the hard decisions with a whole lot of intemperate, ill-informed critics voicing half-thought out opposition.  This is something where most people, I think reasonably, come down against section 8 if they consider the issue.  Most independent commentary comes down against section 8.  I ask the Minister, between now and Report Stage to consider whether this Bill would not be a far better Bill if she walked away from section 8 and said that she had listened to the debate in this House.  That is what the Seanad is for.  She has not tried to push it through on a whip.  The balance of opinion in society is against it.

I am very supportive of the Irish farming community.  We would not have the landscape we have without the farmers.  They have cared for the environment.  We have what we have because of them.  In this House, we have actually listened to each other.  We may have started from different places but we have moved closer together.  At a very early stage, I made the same suggestion that section 8 be shelved, and that we look at the signs and develop a logical approach.  If we want to deal with the road safety element, Senator Higgins's road safety amendment could be adopted by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, when he gets around to doing something.<\/p> <p>I doubt anyone is happy with the idea and taking it on trust.  We have to understand what the baseline is.  The baseline cannot be Twenty-six Counties.  If we are asking for a study to be done, or a change in legislation to allow a study or a pilot project be carried out, it cannot be on a Twenty-six County basis.  I said earlier that this is a place to start from, if we insist on going forward.  This is not a townie versus rural Ireland.  It is actually the opposite.  The vast majority of e-mails I have received on this issue come from outside the Dublin area from the agricultural community and from people who live and work in rural Ireland.  I was accused earlier of just being a Dublin 4 person.  Hedgerows are an important part of our environment.  I thank the Minister for the indication that she is removing the words \"grubbing and destroying\".  I also notice she has changed her language.  In the Bill the word used is \"cutting\" but she is using the word \"trimming\".  Does that refer to a different length or distance?<\/p> <p>A job well done would be to allow the canal section of this Bill to progress, and possibly send section 8 into an Oireachtas committee.  Let us invite everybody in to discuss this in depth to ensure we are doing the right thing.  It is not just the birds, bats and hedgehogs.  It is about farmer's livelihoods as well.  There is REPS and payments are made to the protection of the environment.  That all has to be considered.<\/p> <p>Rural Ireland is facing great problems with Brexit.  Its economic viability is going to be threatened in the coming two years, and as a country and a nation we need to stand together.

I have sat here or in my office for most of the day listening to the contributions, and many Senators mentioned the amount of communications we have received.  We have received communications by e-mail, on Facebook and on Twitter, and I have read most of them.  I have also met people.  I went to Bantry a week ago last Monday night, to the Cathaoirleach's home town.  I met 500 people.  Rarely have I gone into a room with 500 people.  There was an unfortunate feeling, as other Senators have mentioned, that it was them against us.  That was an unfortunate feeling to get from that room.  Entrenchment has become an issue in this debate.  That has been the unfortunate thing in this debate.  Rural people feel that they have been driven into the ground on this.  I am not saying that is on purpose, but they do feel that it has become \"them\" and \"us\".  That has been the unfortunate outcome of this very important debate.  <\/p> <p>There is an issue.  Everybody in this House who understands rural Ireland is aware that when one goes to the local council one of the key issues is cutting hedges.  Anyone who has served on a rural county council knows it is one of the key issues with the engineers at the area roads meeting.  As most of us here who went through the local authority system will be aware, the first thing that the engineer will say is that they do not have the money and that it cannot be done because it is against the law.  It is an issue.  In many ways, this legislation is trying to put something to bed.  Let us look to see what will work and what will not work.  Let us look at a two year pilot study and at trimming back hedges for two years where they must be trimmed back.  Some Senators have said that maybe we will cut every hedge in Ireland.  We will not.

I live in a place called Minane Bridge.  I will not be cutting a hedge in August because I do not need to.  I am a grassland farmer.  I do not need to cut those hedges.  I can cut them when it comes to the appropriate time that is in the legislation at the moment.  However, I have neighbours who have grain farms and when it comes to winter cereals, which is a huge issue further south from me near Kinsale, they need to cut their hedges back because they are doing their tilling and their sowing and their setting in August.   They cannot do it at any other time of the year.  At the moment, they do it afterwards.  The weather goes against them and it affects their crops.  It just does not work.  The use of phrase \"land management\" by the Minister is such an appropriate one because that is exactly what it is.  In many ways, it is helping the environment because at the moment they are doing double the work.<\/p> <p>This legislation is looking to see if there is a better way.  It will come back to this House in two years' time if it is not a better way, and we can take that into consideration then.  This legislation allows for the results of the information to come back to these Houses.  Then the Seanad can look at the results of what we have seen.  That is appropriate, and is what the farming community wants.  It has been an unfortunate, damaging debate.  This is our third day in the Seanad.  I have seen it in the e-mails and text messages I have received from my own part of the world and it is unfortunate how entrenched people have become.  That is something that I am deeply conscious of.<\/p> <p>This legislation set out to do two things.  One was to help the farming community manage certain conditions when it comes to land use regarding re-seeding and winter cereals.  That was the idea of it from an agricultural point of view.  The other issue was to help road safety for the month of August, for the 31 days required.  That is what the Minister has proposed, and if she brings the information back from this two year pilot study to these Houses, we will have a say.  That is important and appropriate and is what people want to know, namely, that the reports will come back to these Houses when we will know exactly what is happening.  How many hedges will be cut in August?  Will it be everywhere?  I would say less than 5%.  In major grassland areas, there will be no hedge cutting done in August.  That is why it is limited to such a small area.  There are parishes further south from mine which have nothing but dairy cows.  There will be no hedges cut there.  There are parishes near Kinsale where they will be cut because that is where grain is grown.
