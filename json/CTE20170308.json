I am joined by Mr. Frank O'Connor, who is head of funding and debt management at the NTMA.<br\/><br\/>I do not intend to read out my opening statement.  If it is okay with the Acting Chairman, I will refer to some of the key points that I reference in it.  We have provided some slides that we use when we are in front of investors around the world talking about the Irish bond market which we thought might be a useful way of drawing out some of the key points that might be of interest.<br\/><br\/>The key starting point is that our debt, as is well known, is quite elevated and is still standing at &euro;200 billion.  That is four times what it was in 2007.  Although our debt-to-GDP ratio is showing an improving trend and our economic fundamentals are good, nonetheless some of the other key ratios that investors look at do not show Ireland in quite as favourable a light.  I will reference some of those.<br\/><br\/>As I say, the economic fundamentals are exceptionally good and have been for a number of years.  A particular focus for investors in the bond market is our fiscal position and our primary surplus.  The fact that the household budget is in primary surplus means that, essentially, our debt levels are stable.  That is an important dynamic and an important statistic for investors.  Our credit ratings have also improved and we are now rated in the A category by all of the rating agencies.<br\/><br\/>In terms of investor demand for Irish bonds, we have moved clearly from being considered a peripheral credit to being what we now consider to be a semi-core credit and we are now trading very much in line with France and Belgium as opposed to some of the peripheral countries when we trade in the market place.  That has been not only talked about in researched reports, but mentioned in the <i>Financial Times<\/i>a couple of days ago.  That has been the case for the past 18 months or so, and it reflects our strongly improving credit performance.  That has been tested in volatile market conditions and even when negative news hits the markets, Ireland has tended to trade closely to France and Belgium as a semi-core.<br\/><br\/>Investor demand for Irish bonds has widened and our investor base has widened.  That is particularly important for Ireland.  Ireland is very dependent on overseas investors for its debt.  Ninety per cent of our bonds are owned by overseas investors and that puts us in quite a vulnerable position versus other countries which have higher rates of domestic savings and participation in the bond market.  One of the few ways we can mitigate that is to diversify the investor base by region and by type, and we attempt to do so.  That has been happening.  Our investor base, I am glad to say, has been broadening significantly.<br\/><br\/>In terms of what we have done in the market in the past couple of years, since 2015 we have issued &euro;27 billion in total at an average yield of 1.3% and an average maturity of 16 years.  Some of the key highlights of that was the refinancing of the &euro;18 billion of IMF debt on which we produced an interest saving of approximately &euro;1.5 billion for taxpayers over the period of four years.  Probably just as important was the replacement of the maturity of that debt.  It was averaging four-year maturity as IMF loans and those were refinanced with maturities closer to 19 years.  By extending the maturity profile, that has also helped to improve the position.  We issued Ireland's first 30-year bond during that period and last year we also issued a 100-year bond at a yield of 2.35%, what was known as a &quot;centenary bond&quot;.  The fact that we were able to do that is a reflection of Ireland's credit but also, and probably more so, a reflection of the extraordinary interest rate environment that we live in, with quantitative easing and the impact that has had on interest rate markets.<br\/><br\/>This year, we have announced to the market that we will issue between &euro;9 and &euro;13 billion as a target for funding for the year.  We issued a &euro;4 billion 20-year note at a yield of 1.73% earlier this year.  We additionally raised, through a dual-auction last month, another &euro;1.25 billion.  We have another auction tomorrow where we will again announce a dual-auction of ten-year notes and 30-year notes, and the size has yet to be determined.  This dual-auction is something that we have not done for quite a few years but we are finding it very effective, both for accessing pockets of liquidity along the yield curve and smoothing out the benchmark yield curve.<br\/><br\/>What about the interest bill, which is probably most of interest to this committee and many others?  The total interest annual interest bill is &euro;7 billion at present.  That is down from &euro;7.5 billion and trending towards &euro;6 billion.  We would be very confident about that number.  As to whether it ultimately could go lower and go to &euro;5 billion, that will be dependent on interest rate conditions and markets, particularly over the next three years.<br\/><br\/>The next three years are an important period for Ireland because there is &euro;52 billion in maturing debt that needs to be refinanced between October 2017 and October 2020.  To put that in context, that maturing debt in the next three years is in excess of the total national debt that existed in 2007.  The interest rate environment, while we are refinancing that debt during that period, will be critical in determining the long-term overall cost of the national debt in terms of an interest bill.<br\/><br\/>The team is on the road constantly.  Ireland is a very small market, a very small country.  It is less than 2% of the European bond markets.  It is less than 0.5% of the global bond markets.  Even somebody who is an index fund manager does not necessarily have to buy a market such as Ireland.  It is a planes, trains and automobiles job.  The NTMA is on the road and always has been.  That is a core part of the business.  Whether we have a lot to issue or a little to issue, we need to keep the credit story in front of investors and ensure that they are fully aware of the dynamics.<br\/><br\/>I thought I might go through some of the slides to show the committee what we talk about to investors when we are on the road.  We tried to pick out some of the slides that we thought might be of most interest to the committee.<\/p><p>The first slide provides a potted history of Ireland's bond yield.  New investors, in particular, need to be able to put the market in context.  Obviously, that history has been pretty extraordinary and I will point to three of the dates we have highlighted to illustrate this.  In July 2011 Irish ten-year bond yields were at 14%, while Irish two-year bond yields were at 24%.  That was at the time we were entering the programme and essentially being shut out of the bond markets.  The next date of note is December 2013 when, following some tough policy decisions and renegotiation of margins, extensions and maturities by the troika, Ireland was gradually able to re-enter the bond markets without a precautionary credit line.  The last date to point to is January 2015.  We can see the considerable impact the announcement by Mr. Mario Draghi of the ECB's quantitative easing programme had on the interest rate markets.  <br\/><br\/>I wish to talk briefly about quantitative easing.  We spoke about the interest bill being &euro;7 billion annually.  In 2014 the official forecast by the Department of Finance for the interest bill today was &euro;10 billion.  We are now at a figure &euro;3 billion lower than what was forecast only three years ago and on our way to it being &euro;4 billion less.  That is an annual saving against what was forecast in 2013.  How has that happened or from where has the value come?  Obviously, Ireland has been a material beneficiary of the quantitative easing environment.  It is a disproportionately high borrower and a highly indebted nation; therefore, we have been a disproportionate beneficiary of quantitative easing.  Various policy decisions and the improvements in our credit story are obviously major factors too, but we are talking about savings of &euro;3 billion to &euro;4 billion against what the Department forecast only a very short time ago.  There have been significant savings for Ireland in that regard.  <br\/><br\/>The next slide in our presentation gives members an idea of where we are <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>the rating agencies.  It is worth noting that we are now in the single A category for all investors.  That is important because many conservative investors around the world need the sovereign to be in the A category in order for them to be able to invest.  An A rating opens up additional pools of capital to us.  Moody's, the last rating agency to bring us into that category, rated Ireland as sub-investment grade as recently as January 2014.  We have, therefore, made quite a move in a very short period.<br\/><br\/>The next slide illustrates the gross national debt composition.  I will not go into detail on it now, but I will be happy to answer questions about it later.  <br\/><br\/>The next slide deals with the evolution of the national debt.  We are stabilising at a point just above &euro;200 billion.  That is the forecast for the next few years.  However, I cannot emphasise enough the extent to which our stock of debt increased from 2007 up until today.  It is four times larger than it was in 2007.  There are very few countries in the world the national debt of which increased by that multiple during the same period.  That is the real legacy of the crisis and that debt position still leaves us quite vulnerable.<br\/><br\/>The next slide refers to some of the key fundamentals in terms of fiscal out-performance that have encouraged investors, as well as the rating agencies, to re-rate our bonds.  Investors have actually been ahead of the rating agencies in re-rating Ireland in the semi-core from the periphery.  In terms of the general Government balance and the budget deficit, we have outperformed the European targets every year for the last six years.  As members know, we are on target to close that gap and go into surplus by 2019.  The next graph emphasises the primary surplus, which is the Government's budget without interest costs and a figure on which investors focus.  Debt as a percentage of GDP is a figure to which the market refers very often and our position in that regard has been improving significantly and smoothly owing to our stronger growth levels.  It is driven by GDP growth rather than by the debt changing; therefore, it does not change the stock of debt as such.  It just changes the position relative to GDP.  Obviously, when we had the distortion of GDP, it caused people to look for other indicators.  We have the GNI* and the working group chaired by Governor Lane which will be very helpful in that regard.  That said, investors have always looked at a number of other indicators.  At what are investors looking?  They can see that our stock of debt is high and need to determine our ability to repay them and refinance our debt.  They are the data for which they are looking.  Obviously, GDP growth is a key indicator in that context.  <br\/><br\/>The next slide contains a number of tables in which Ireland's position does not look so good, on a relative basis, in terms of debt-to-GDP.  Members should focus on the two middle tables which show Government debt to Government revenue and interest to Government revenue.  As only Greece and Portugal rank ahead of Ireland, we still have a long way to go, being the third worst performing country in Europe in both categories.  The tables are a better indicator of our vulnerability.  From our point of view, we want to stress the fact that Ireland is still a very indebted country.  While the interest rate environment has allowed us to refinance and lower our interest bill, the stock of debt is still very high.  It is at a very significant level.  We must bear this in mind.<br\/><br\/>The next slide shows the actual interest bill.  The point I made about the forecast is illustrated in the graph in red in terms of where we were forecasted to be and where we are now.  The interest bill is beginning to decline and headed towards &euro;6 billion.  On the back of the refinancing and fundraising done to date, we can be confident that we will get to the figure of &euro;6 billion, but whether it will be any lower will depend on the interest rate environment in the key period of the next three years.<br\/><br\/>I now invite my colleague, Mr. Frank O'Connor, to go through the next three or four slides.  He is the person on the road with the team, so to speak, and better equipped than me to talk members through the next section of our presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017030800002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor O'Kelly","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1488981600,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I will be as brief as I can.  The next slide shows the breakdown of our investor base.  It shows the last eight syndicate transactions where we launched a benchmark bond of a particularly large size, that is, transactions that were bigger than an auction, going back to 2013.  It illustrates the point made by Mr. O'Kelly about how dependent we are on overseas investors.  If members look at the right hand side of the graph, in terms of geography, about 87%, on average, of participants in the syndicate transactions were overseas investors.  On the left hand side of the graph we have tried to provide a breakdown of the types of investor involved.  The good news for us in that context is the evidence of the quite diverse real money accounts back in the market.  Members will have noted in some of our press releases the size of the order book and the fact that the number of orders was over 200.  In that sense, we were not reliant on ten or 11 large clients.  Members should note that the term \"central banks\" does not refer to ECB quantitative easing but to other central banks buying our debt.  We are talking about what I would call a much healthier, real money account base of long-term debt holders like pension funds and central banks.  The graph gives a description of what the situation has been like in the past few years.<\/p><p>Beyond that is the maturity profile.  I will not delay on it, but I will make a point about the various colours used.  Pre-crisis, there was just one colour of Irish Government bonds.  Obviously, it excluded our retail debt.  As there is now official sector debt, there is a multitude of colours.  The task for us over time is to find a home among traditional investors for that official sector debt, which entails EU money, the last remnants of the IMF money, bilateral loans, etc.  It could be up to a magnitude of &euro;70 billion.  We have bought ourselves time, which is good news, but we must be mindful of this.<\/p><p> I will not stop on the next slide.  It is included for members' convenience and shows the actual numbers per category as opposed to graphically.<\/p><p> I will conclude on the last slide.  It repeats the maturity profile on the left-hand table and the average life of debt portfolios in Europe on the right-hand side.  Look at the clear white bars which show large redemptions.  That is what we have been doing in recent years.  It is debt we have already repaid to reduce our funding profile.  The red is where we have been lengthening the portfolio.  The significant reductions in 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 primarily relate to IMF repayments.  When we repaid the IMF early, the debt only had, on average, four years of life left.  As Mr. Kelly mentioned, we funded to 17 or 18 years, on average, through a 30-year bond.  We took that opportunity, not only to save interest, but also to go further out the yield curve to improve the profile.  In addition, in recent years we have been buying back some short-dated bonds on a bilateral basis.  We have probably bought back &euro;2.5 billion worth of bonds in that regard and switched them to longer maturities.  We have made progress.  The figure a couple of years ago was &euro;70 billion in redemptions, but now it is down to approximately &euro;52 billion.<\/p><p> The right-hand side of the slide shows that the average life of Ireland's debt portfolio is one of the longest among our European peers.  This is on foot of the negotiated extensions in Europe, plus what we have been doing in the market in recent years.  It has left us in a healthier space such that we are not a hostage to refinancing risk in any one year, notwithstanding the fact that a couple of large maturities are approaching.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017030800002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank O'Connor","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1488981600,"counter":15,"content":"<p>That concludes the opening statement and presentation of slides.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017030800002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor O'Kelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1488981600,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Kelly and Mr. O'Connor.

The market buys and owns Irish bonds based on the expectation of forecasts of economic activity and growth, statements of Government policy and the likelihood of X, Y or Z happening.

They subtract them and arrive at a net debt position which they analyse <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>counterparties in any credit decision.  The credit agencies are the same, in that net debt is one of the metrics they consider.  People have subtracted the banks' holdings in arriving at the net debt figure.  Since the degree to which investors are dependent on this for their decisions to invest in Ireland varies widely, it is difficult to say one way or the other.  They do not all speak with one voice.

We are asked questions about whether we are worried about Brexit, Grexit, Frexit and Trump and whether we have contingency plans, but we have none for any of it, the reason being that we are in the permanent contingency business.  Ireland is a small country that depends on overseas investors to borrow a large amount of money.  That makes us extremely vulnerable to potential external events, some of which we might be able to predict like Brexit or are already in the public domain.  More than likely, something we have never even discussed will come around the corner and be a surprise.  When a country has a small, open economy like Ireland, has a high level of debt and depends exclusively on international investors to lend the money to fund it, it is in the permanent contingency business, full stop.  One can do a number of things to mitigate this such as ensuring one has cash and access to it in terms of short-term funding.  Currently, there is &euro;9 billion in cash on the books and additional access to very short-term cash.  One can diversify the investor base by geography and investor type.  One can diversify the product base by, for example, introducing index-linked, green bonds and other securities, as we will look to do in the future.  One ensures the maturity profile is as smooth as possible and that one's debt is as long as possible.

I would welcome it with regard to any of the PPP projects.  I am quite comfortable that value for money exists.  The public sector benchmark is set quite stringently with the sponsoring Department at the outset.  Any PPP must meet that benchmark in the first instance so it must be cheaper.  When the first procurement is done, the figures must be below that public sector benchmark which has been set by the sponsoring Department.  At the financial close, which is normally 18 months later, it must be retested to ensure that it meets the public sector benchmark.  In my opinion, PPPs have more stringent public sector benchmark accountability than direct procurement.  That is my personal view.  It is not our role, but I would welcome the Comptroller and Auditor General or somebody else looking back to demonstrate that value for money for was obtained.

Channels have to be kept open.  Infrastructure has to be built.  Not all projects are suitable for PPPs.  Larger projects tend to be more suitable for PPPs.  What is the cost?  What is being paid?  We can currently borrow money in the market directly at just over 2% for the period of a 25-year project, which is the length of most PPPs.  Approximately 4% to 5% in total in debt and equity is going to be paid in an all-in cost to the State for PPPs.  That is what it will pay in private capital.  It is 2% to 3% higher than what we could get over that 25-year period.<\/p> <p>  What are we getting for that money?  Is that good value?  We are getting the infrastructure built, managed and retained over that 25-year period, and returned to the State in a state that gives it a 20-year life-cycle from that point.

I think it is time to have more PPPs when rates are this low, the requirements are so great and the balance sheet restrictions are so significant.

Mr. O'Kelly stated that NTMA is seeking to issue between &euro;9 billion and &euro;13 billion in bonds over the course of the year.  He said that it got 2017 off to a positive start, raising &euro;4 billion from the syndicated issue, the 20-year bond.  I notice NTMA's achievements in the past few years.  It successfully raised close to &euro;27 billion in long-term debt at a weighted average yield of just over 1.3% since the start of 2015.  It repaid the IMF loan facility of &euro;18 billion.  We saw the first ever issue of the 100-year note, which saw us borrow &euro;100 million at a yield of 2.35%.  The NTMA has those achievements but, overall, Mr. O'Kelly has rightly given a very sobering account of our national debt for this committee of all committees.  The global size of that and the percentage of debt compared with our general Government revenue is almost frightening, in a sense.  It puts the committee and the proposals that we would make for budgets and so on under intense pressure.<\/p> <p>  The period of 2019 to 2020 seems to be a very dangerous time for NTMA and this State in the sense that a quarter of the debt, &euro;50 billion, has to be refinanced between 2018 and 2020.  Other colleagues have mentioned the grave uncertainty that we are in.  We seem to be in a fundamental watershed period of history and therefore we are vulnerable.  Would it therefore be appropriate to refinance as much as possible of the burden that is hanging over us in 2019 and 2020, and get on with it while the waters are relatively calm?  Concerns have been raised that with Brexit and other issues, we could have a perfect storm again, like in 2009, and the agony that we have suffered since then.

I will let Mr. O'Connor take this question since he has been more actively involved in it.  This number was &euro;70 billion not so long ago, and it is probably more accurately based on what we have already done.  In the background, it is getting towards &euro;40 billion of its full obligation.  We are looking at the interest rate markets, and notwithstanding surprises or whatever economic shocks might come, quantitative easing, QE, exists, the European Central Bank, ECB, is anchoring rates very low and investor demand and pools of capital are there.  While it is important to show that we still have elevated levels of debt, the way the market is structured gives us confidence that our ability to finance and refinance at relatively low rates is still quite strong.  Does Mr. O'Connor want to add anything there?<\/p><p>Exactly that.  It is correct to say that despite the progress, it is still substantial.  However, nearly everything for a number of years involved having our minds set on those particular dates.  To go back to the IMF point, the extension was deliberately issued as longer.  None of our recent auctions of syndications has tapped into that part of the curve.  They are always longer.  In addition, we have bilaterally, on occasion, switched with primary dealers and bought back a couple of billion in these short-dated bonds and switched them for longer.  We continue to work on that.<\/p><p> I do not know if members saw it in the material, but at the end of last year we were holding &euro;9 billion in cash and have already done &euro;5.25 billion pretty early this year.  We have another auction tomorrow.  Our target is to end the year with more than &euro;10 billion in cash.  We carry that into that cycle so that while &euro;52 billion is the formal redemption requirement, we are already down at close to &euro;40 billion in our minds.  As such, quite a lot has been done already.  In addition, members might be familiar with the floating rate notes the Central Bank holds.  While it is a matter for the Central Bank to decide what to do with them, we have bought back &euro;6 billion of those over the past few years.  They are bonds that will be sold in that period also.  Dealing with some of that, which is due to come out, is also helpful in terms of what might be happening in the marketplace.<\/p><p> Quite a bit has been done and we are very mindful of it.  We look at it first in terms of getting the liquidity.  Refinancing the debt is one part, including the price at which one refinances it.  Other defence mechanisms are about getting access to the liquidity notwithstanding price.  If one looks at our maturity profile, we deliberately left 2021 quite empty, so to speak.  It is some official sector debt.  At the end of 2015 and in 2016, people were asking us for a five-year bond but we deliberately did not issue one to mature in that year because it can be a defensive mechanism.  While there are large volumes to be rolled in 2020, one could issue some short debt into 2021 and then have a normal year as well.  One could do a bit of both.  In addition, it should not be forgotten that the bonds will not all mature on the same date in 2020.  There will be a couple of bonds.  We are watching it in terms of access to markets' liquidity and price.  As such, quite an amount has been done as we have indicated.  Some people might question why we have one of the longest average lives but we have been doing that with the deliberate view that these are larger redemptions compared to other parts of our yield curve.<\/p><p> What we do is very much of a long-term nature.  To show members how far back these things were thought of, I give the following example.  Ireland sought extensions in the European loans twice.  I remember during the second extension when Portugal was asking for the same, the initial negotiations or conversations were on rolling the debt for a few years.  However, we actually used that profile front and centre to argue that it would just create a bigger problem as we started to enter this period to put the official sector debt in a short maturity.

It is just a minimum as things have improved.  To go back to giving an example, we had &euro;9 billion in cash at the end of last year and already have &euro;5.25 billion.  The Exchequer borrowing requirement for the first few months of the year was actually positive because it is not linear.  It is seasonal in nature.  We have a bond redemption in October, so that is, effectively, funded.  As such, approximately &euro;6 billion in October 2017, which is in the &euro;52 billion figure, is funded.  If one thinks about it, we said &euro;9 billion to &euro;13 billion.  We only need this year, if one takes this year on its own, the &euro;2.2 billion Exchequer borrowing requirement and &euro;6 billion bond redemption.  As such, we have already allowed for the growing of our cash balance into this period and are probably ahead of ourselves this year.  That is in the mindset.  To go back to the Deputy's point about the buffer, we keep a substantial cash balance.

However, it is also due to the policies adopted by governments and decision makers at the time, including Deputy Burton, which improved the credit story and the fiscal position for Ireland.  We saw our credit spread narrowing against Germany and moving into that space.  That had much more to do with our fiscal position than with Mario Draghi and interest rates.  That is Ireland as a creditor moving from the peripheral category with Spain, Italy, Portugal and Greece to the category with France and Belgium, where it is today.  That is really more about Ireland, its credit story and the fundamentals.  That is the credit spread narrowing from 140 to 150 base points over Germany to where it is now at 70 or 80 points above.

It is not really a good idea to borrow more money because interest rates are low.  It is like saying to a household that it should go down to the bank and borrow more money, even though it has a big mortgage and credit card bills and a leased car in the driveway.  That is the kind of situation we are in.  It is difficult for us to suggest borrowing more money, even for capital spending, even though at some point the market will look more favourably on that.  When our debt levels get down further in two, three or four years' time, that is going to become a legitimate option for us and the reaction from the market will probably be quite sanguine for capital investment.  We are still just a bit too elevated for that.<\/p> <p>  There are the other parts of the NTMA that have a remit that is potentially more relevant - first of all the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF.  I was not around when the ISIF was set up but, to me, that was an enlightened legislation from the Oireachtas.  On an international scale, the limitations of monetary policy are now becoming obvious to everybody.  There is therefore a need for fiscal stimulus to be added, yet countries are already indebted.  Ireland, through the creation of the strategic investment fund, having moved the mandate from the National Pensions Reserve Fund, NPRF, to focus on Ireland only, has a fiscal mechanism for investment that is pretty unusual.  Many European countries are looking at that now with some degree of envy.  It is a very powerful vehicle.<\/p> <p>  As the Deputy is aware, &euro;2.6 billion has already been invested by the ISIF in a variety of investments across the country, creating 19,000 jobs - 60% of them outside of Dublin - in all sorts of sectors.  Most importantly, as we always co-invest, the multiple of investment, which we expected to be twice what we put in, has turned out to be about 2.6 times.  We are talking about &euro;7.2 billion being invested because of the ISIF investment of &euro;2.6 billion.  It is an &euro;8 billion fund which gives great capacity still; our pipeline of projects is about &euro;2 billion in value.  That investment can be targeted at infrastructure in all sorts of ways, depending on where the requirement is.  Housing is obviously a big requirement.  There is &euro;550 million dedicated to housing.  There are platforms like Activate Capital, Ardstone or the DCU campus.  Some &euro;54 million was put into a DCU accommodation campus by the ISIF, which released another &euro;150 million from the European Investment Bank, EIB, for an overall campus development.  That is the kind of impact and investment that can be made by the ISIF.  We have a very powerful vehicle there.<\/p> <p>  Obviously, ISIF has to make off-balance-sheet investments, so it has to be commercial.  We have a mandate to have what we call a double bottom line, that is, a commercial return plus economic impact.  We work with investment partners and co-investors, which again helps keep our activities off-balance-sheet by demonstrating commercial capability.<\/p> <p>  The Minister has asked us to look at the housing area and social housing in particular.  In the investments we have made so far, there is a pipeline of about 8,000 residential units which are being built and will be completed.  There is potential for another 8,000 units in other platforms and investments that ISIF is currently considering.  It is a long-term fund.  Although the impact is not as immediate as any of us would like, the ISIF really can create long-term sustainable infrastructure investment to help solve some of those problems.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017030800002#H00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor O'Kelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1488981600,"counter":76,"content":"<p>I see the summaries which Mr. O'Kelly referenced in terms of ISIF's lending.

I just don't see that happening in any serious volume at the moment.<\/p> <p>  What the Irish market lacks is volume.  We have a lot of housing projects.  While that is all very good, the volume in terms of numbers relative to demand needs to be improved.  There is pent-up demand from the ten years since the economy crashed.  Some of the people who got their jobs ten years ago and are now in their early to mid-30s, maybe even older and, even though they might be public servants with lifetime jobs or people in stable, strong sectors, they cannot find houses to buy.  I think everybody here would know people desperately scrambling to get mortgage approval.<\/p> <p>  Is there anything that Mr. O'Kelly believes would generate volume in the Irish market?  I am thinking in particular of levels of affordability, which obviously vary in different parts of the country.  I am also thinking of what people like the social housing authorities, say, are doing.  They are talking now about affordable rent, as well as traditional life-long social housing tenancies.  The volume is not there.  A further issue is the fact that the housing associations are minutely small, given the numbers required.<\/p><p>If one looks at housing associations as they developed in the UK, their numbers are much greater.

The question is what is the cost of the debt.  The cost of debt on current projects for the past 12 months for the average accommodation PPP, the majority of which are 25-year contracts, is approximately 2.5%.  We are raising money at 2.5%.  There is an equity component of approximately 10% of those so the all-in cost for the equity and debt of a PPP for us as a country entering into the contract is approximately 4%.  Let us give a bit of room and say that it is between 4% and 5% depending on where rates are.  The NTMA can borrow directly for that period for approximately 2%.

One can forget about the absolutes and the relatives.  Interest rates are extraordinarily low.  In our opinion they are unlikely to stay extraordinarily low for a very long time.  Future citizens and taxpayers may not be able to borrow at such attractive rates for 25 years.  The risks are asymmetric.  There is an opportunity to borrow all-in equity and debt at between 4% and 5% for a project where the PPP investor takes the risk on delivering the building, managing the portfolio for 25 years and then handing it back to the State in a condition that can survive another 20 years.

When one is above one's quota with the IMF the credit margin in the early years was 3% plus the reference rates &ndash; the special drawing rights, SDR, reference rate &ndash; but after three years if one does not start to repay the IMF another per cent is added.  Three years into it one is talking about a 4% credit margin plus the SDR reference rate, which is why we always talk about IMF money costing 4% to 5%.  When our bond yields started to cross 3% into 2%, there was a desire to repay the IMF early.<\/p> <p>  European loans are different.  European loan are for much longer than the IMF loans and they are cheaper.  In simple terms, the European money, through the ESFS facility and the EFSM are rated AAA and AA.  We are rated A.  One should remember that the pace at which investors expect the money to change from all the other debt we have to fund and the institutional debt coming back into that traditional investor base is different.  I will give one example, the ESFM had to roll one of its maturities so it lent us money by issuing a bond until 2015.  It had to roll that because it had committed to us not repaying until after 2027.  It did three deals at an average of 14 years.  It went to the market with an array of bonds.<\/p><p>This was December 2015, or just before it.  They funded it at 1.13%.

At the moment there are problems in quite a significant part of the country, first, where pregnant women do not get scans at 20 weeks and, second, where the more modern technology which is available in the private sector in Ireland for blood tests for issues a baby might have at around 11 or 12 weeks of gestation is not available.

My colleague, Ms Freda McKittrick, is the head of our guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>service and our resident expert in all these matters.  Between us, we should be able to answer any questions in due course.  We have made a detailed submission to the committee in addition to the opening statement.<br\/><br\/>The story of Grace has shocked and disturbed us all.  It raises deep questions of accountability and practice.  It obliges us, to the extent that we regard our country as a republic, to find out how and why terrible things were allowed to happen to one of our fellow citizens.  These things happened on the watch of the State and while the State was funding the care of a child who grew to be a young woman.<br\/><br\/>In her suffering and resilience, Grace has taught us an underlying and indelible lesson, if only we are willing to listen.  If a child is vulnerable and at risk but has no voice, that risk is multiplied.  If a child is crying out for help and cannot be heard, help will never come.  If corruption or abuse is possible, the existence of closed doors and blind eyes will make it certain.<br\/><br\/>Every day, children appear in front of the courts in Ireland.  If those children or young people are charged with a crime, they are constitutionally entitled to the best defence they, or the State on their behalf, can afford.  That is as it should be.  However, if a child stands in front of a court charged with no crime but faces decisions that can affect the course of the rest of his or her life, that child has no right to be heard.  We know that the judge, whose job is to determine the future of the child, takes that task seriously.  Frequently, they exercise their discretion to appoint an independent person to help to establish where the best interests of the child lie.  However, the point is that this only happens at the discretion of the judge - it is not a child's right.<\/p><p>Over the 20 years of operating a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>service, our guardians have worked with children who have made multiple attempts on their own lives while in the care system.  They have worked with children who have been abandoned, abused or neglected.  They have worked with children who have been put at immense risk by their parents' drug and alcohol problems.  They have worked with children who have been hurt almost beyond repair by sexual and other forms of abuse.  They have worked with children who self-harm, who blame themselves for the things that have gone wrong in their lives or who are full of self-hatred and want to take it out on the world.  They have worked with children who have been left alone, hungry, fearful and cold.  All of those children appear in front of the Irish courts, which is where their future can be decided.<br\/><br\/>It may seem perverse to say it, but in one respect at least, these are the luckier children.  They are children at risk to whom a judge has appointed a guardian whose only task is to represent the best interests of those children and young people, to advocate for them and to seek a better outcome than the life that faces them now.<br\/><br\/>We could supply this committee with dozens of case histories.  We have attached some to our submission.  What they show is a system that wants to produce the best results for children.  There are dedicated and committed social work teams and thousands of carers doing amazing jobs.  However, it is a system that is terribly constrained by resources and other pressures.  In some ways, it is constrained by the culture, which still exists in Ireland, that children should be seen and not heard.  Our case histories show people often working together, though sometimes challenging each other, to try to secure the best result.  They also show a system that has become more legalistic, more adversarial and more expensive in the struggle to balance the best interests of children against scarce resources and often imperfect solutions.  Our case histories do not show happy endings in every case, but all of our experience shows that children always do better when they have someone who represents their views and wishes and no one else's.<br\/><br\/>For that reason, our first reaction to the Bill before the committee is to welcome it strongly, but also to say that it does not go far enough, and in some respects it sends us backwards.  This is a Bill that seeks to make it the norm rather than the exception that a vulnerable child, faced with the decisions that an imperfect world can make, would have someone at their side at all times.  However, this does not make it a right.  The right should be explicit in law.  It is not explicit in law despite the fact the 31st amendment to the Constitution, passed by referendum of the people, provides that, &quot;in the resolution of all proceedings ... brought by the State ... for the purpose of preventing the safety and welfare of any child from being prejudicially affected ... the best interests of the child shall be the paramount consideration [...] the views of the child shall be ascertained and given due weight having regard to the age and maturity of the child&quot;.<br\/><br\/>It is not the law in Ireland despite the fact that the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which Ireland has ratified, obliges us in Article 12 to enable children to express their own views in all matters concerning them.  In particular, &quot;the child shall ... be provided the opportunity to be heard in any judicial and administrative proceedings affecting the child, either directly or through a representative or an appropriate body&quot;.<br\/><br\/>We will always strongly argue that we must move towards progressive realisation of those rights.  The primary purpose of this Bill is to establish a single national provider of the service which is essential to those rights.  We strongly welcome the Bill on that basis also.  In our written submission, we advocate ways in which the Bill can be significantly improved.  I will touch on some of them in a moment. <br\/><br\/>However, the underlying principle of the Bill is that this is an area that needs its own reform.  As the largest provider of guardians in Ireland, last year our 32 guardians worked with more than 800 children.  We have always argued for more and greater transparency in the system.  In several submissions over the years we have made to the Department we have advocated a unified and much better managed approach.<br\/><br\/>There is no doubt that a cloud has been cast over the independent representation of vulnerable children by the and unregulated system which has been allowed to develop.  A recent study by the Comptroller and Auditor General shows clearly that in an unregulated world costs can vary significantly from case to case, and in overall terms there is a huge question mark about whether children are being effectively and independently represented on a value for money basis.<br\/><br\/>Barnardos has always argued that the only remedy to secure proper transparency and accountability while maintaining standards and independence is a stand-alone entity, operating on the basis of a single contract with the State and subject to best practice in the areas of management and governance.  This Bill, together with the necessary processes in areas such as tendering that will follow its passage, is designed to secure that.<br\/><br\/>However, we believe that some of the measures contained in the draft heads will militate against what the Bill aims to achieve.  The provision whereby Tusla continues to be the funder of the service, for example, is both unnecessary and undesirable.  It is not something Tusla wants, and very few of the submissions made to the Department in this area advocate it.  The only provision that makes sense would be a public contract between the Department and the provider.  We strongly recommend to the committee that that approach be taken.<br\/><br\/>It is important to state unequivocally in the law that the role of any guardian must be to seek to promote the best interests of the child.  It is our view and our experience that the best outcomes are always to be found when those who are involved in the child&rsquo;s welfare work together collaboratively to try to develop plans that are adequately resourced and centred on the child&rsquo;s needs.  There will be times when disagreements arise and where there is a need to challenge decisions made around allocation of resources.  Particular issues arise at moments of complex and challenging transition for children.  The moment when they reach 18, for instance, can be the moment when they are most at risk.  Anyone who has followed the tragic story of Daniel McAnaspie will know that to be the case.<br\/><br\/>In that context, it will never be enough for a guardian to be, as the explanatory memorandum says, some kind of expert witness with no role other than to prepare a report.  While we have never had any wish to see an adversarial approach being taken to this work and we do not believe the current frequently highly conflictual situation serves the best interests of children, guardians cannot be passive.  They must be able to support good practice and challenge poor practice.  They must be able to express strong views when necessary resources are being withheld.  They cannot adequately represent the best interests of children to the court by remaining silent.  It must also be said that there is one thing guardians know, that the best outcome for children is found when everyone involved is working together in a collaboration that centres on the needs of the child.  The more conflict that can be removed, the better the outcome that is likely to emerge.  The day-to-day experience and work of guardians prove this.  Getting this balance right is complex and, in our view, requires further drafting work.  We have attached a more detailed examination of the Bill to this presentation and would be more than happy to answer any questions the committee might have.<br\/><br\/>If we get this Bill right, we can make significant strides towards achieving something I believe we all want.  We all want a system that is well-managed and accountable.  We all want transparency and consistency in the investment the State will be required to make.<br\/><br\/>From our examination of the figures as they apply to Barnardos, and I cannot speak for anyone else, roughly speaking it costs between &euro;4,000 and &euro;5,000 per year per child when a guardian working on the case.  That sounds expensive.  When compared with the fact the State pays around &euro;5,000 per week to keep a child in private residential care or about &euro;10,000 per week to keep a child in State-provided secure care, &euro;5,000 a year to keep children out of the care system is actually very cheap.<br\/><br\/>Over and above the question of cost, there is one key point.  We now know that the babies and children of Tuam had no voice.  The thousands of children sent to industrial schools by Irish courts had no voice.  Grace had no voice.  The system fails when it fails to listen.  That is why we believe it is unthinkable, knowing what we know, that we would continue to allow our child care and child protection system to continue to operate without being absolutely certain that the children most affected by the system have a voice of their own, and that that voice is always heard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017030800002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fergus Finlay","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1488963600,"counter":156,"content":"<p>I intend to share my time with my colleague, Ms Edel Quinn.<br\/><br\/>I thank the committee for the opportunity to present on behalf of the Children's Rights Alliance.  We unite more than 100 member organisations and it is our goal to make Ireland one of the best places in the world to be a child.  We are campaigning for the implementation of children's rights in our laws, policies and services.<br\/><br\/>We welcome the publication of the general scheme of the guardian <i>ad litem <\/i>Bill.  This is a very important step.<\/p><p>It is an ongoing part of the dialogue that has been happening in this area with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and the Department, and we welcome that.  There has been extensive consultation in the development of it.<br\/><br\/>For many reasons, we welcome the establishment of the scheme and of the service.  As Mr. Finlay stated, we are dealing with one of the most vulnerable groups of children in the country, namely, those within the child care system.  There are approximately 6,500 children in the child care system.  Only half of them have judicial supervision or even have the possibility of a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>being appointed.  One should be aware that there is a possibility of a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>being appointed in the case of only half of the children in care.<br\/><br\/>The other point that comes through in respect of many of the children who are in the care system is, as Mr. Finlay stated, that they have been abused and neglected, and have been failed in some way.  Through the 17 official reports, we know that the State has failed children in the care system in many different ways and we have to remember that.  One of the most important and shocking findings coming from the Ryan report is that children did complain when they were starved and neglected.  They tried to complain to various people but they were not listened to.  That is why the voice of the child, and ensuring that children can participate in proceedings affecting them, is so incredibly important.  We know the cost of not listening to children.<br\/><br\/>I will outline one or two positives of the scheme and where we might enhance those areas, and my colleague, Ms Quinn, will contribute.  The first positive is there will be a national guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>service that is established and regulated.  That is really important.  We know from the report on child care law reporting that there are potential issues in respect of the quality of service that is provided throughout the country.  There is some very good service on one hand but we are not sure whether children are getting the best service on the other.  That is why regulation is incredibly important.<br\/><br\/>One matter that is at issue for us is that while guardians <i>ad litem<\/i>will be given independent status under the Bill, the service that is to be commissioned will not have independent status.  That could be a serious issue for us because the service will be accountable to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  The financial management of it will be in the hands of the Child and Family Agency but the service itself will not have an independent status.  For example, the Courts Service of Ireland is an independent service.  Previously, the then Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform managed the courts service and there were serious issues around in the courts system's independence because the Department was directly managing it.  It could be an issue.  If the service itself is not given an independent status in the Bill, the Minister could impose certain restrictions, regulations and funding requirements that could impact on the overall independence of the service.<br\/><br\/>Another positive in the scheme is that there is a presumption that guardians <i>ad litem<\/i>will be appointed in child care proceedings.  That is a positive step.  We know from the reports on child care law reporting that these are not appointed in all circumstances.  Not all children who come before the child care courts get a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>.  That requirement should be extended to the Circuit Court and to the District Court.  There should be a presumption that a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>is appointed in all child care law proceedings.  That is an important principle that we need in the future.<br\/><br\/>Another issue coming up in the Bill relates to the role that is defined in the legislation.  At present, under the scheme of the Bill, the position regarding the role guardians <i>ad litem<\/i>will play is quite circumscribed.  Essentially, they will be expert advisers.  The role of the guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>needs to be extended.  I will pass on to my colleague, Ms Quinn, to elaborate and explain, from a human rights perspective, why that is important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017030800002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Tanya Ward","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1488963600,"counter":158,"content":"<p>The issue I want to address, as Ms Ward mentioned, relates to the status of the guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>under head 6 of the general scheme of the Bill.  It is important to ask from the start who is the guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>and what should his or her role be.  For us, the guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>should be the child's representative in the court.  That flows from the child's right to have his or her views heard, as Mr. Finlay mentioned.  Article 12 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child - I will repeat it, although Mr. Finlay mentioned it, because it is important - provides that the child has the right to have his or her views heard in all matters affecting him or her, including judicial proceedings, either directly - by speaking to the child directly - or through a representative such as a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>.  That provision was incorporated into the Constitution as a result of the children's referendum.  Under Article 42A, they now have the right to be heard in child care proceedings and for due weight to be given to those views, having regard to the age and maturity of the child.  It does not mean that the child's views are the deciding factor but they are considered as one of the deciding factors.<br\/><br\/>In addition to the role of the guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>in informing the court of the child's views and advising the court in the child's best interests, over the years the role of the guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>has evolved to have a wider remit.  In practice, guardians <i>ad litem<\/i>have been given legal representation in proceedings.  They have fulfilled the role of defending the rights of the child and they have had a similar status in child care proceedings to the parents or Tusla.  That has meant that they have been able to vindicate the child's rights where there has been a gap.  As has been mentioned by both Mr. Finlay and Ms Ward, under head 6 of the general scheme the status of the guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>will be as a special type of expert witness, and that reduces and dilutes the role of the guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>to a large degree.<br\/><br\/>In effect, what can the guardians <i>ad litem<\/i>do today?  They have the crucial role of being able to cross-examine witnesses.  They can cross-examine parents.  They can cross-examine Tusla where there might be a bad decision that is not in the child's best interests around the allocation of resources.  Critically, they can take appeals against bad decisions.  They have full access to reports in respect of the child.  They can attend meetings with professionals such as, for example, to get a child assessed for psychiatric needs.  They can liaise with a child and his or her parents around access.<br\/><br\/>We understand that they will not be able to undertake any of those roles under the new scheme.  They will simply be able to make a report to the court.  We see that as a big problem.  One of the big questions to be answered then is who will fulfil this role if it will not be the guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>?  Who will undertake that role of vindicating the rights of the child in the proceedings?  These are fair procedure rights that a child is entitled to, and the High Court recognised that recently in a case before Christmas.  Ms Justice Marie Baker recognised that right.  In order for those fair procedure rights to be vindicated, the guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>should have legal standing in proceedings to represent the child and the child, through the guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>, will then have an equal standing in the proceedings to other parties.<br\/><br\/>To wrap up, this function of the guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>where it has had this wider remit predates the children's referendum.  It would be a sad state of affairs if children were left with inferior rights as a result of the status of the guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>now as opposed to before the children's referendum.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017030800002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Edel Quinn"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1488963600,"counter":159,"content":"<p>Can I add one additional point to follow-up on that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017030800002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Tanya Ward"},{"type":"speech","time":1488963600,"counter":160,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017030800002#D00400","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1488963600,"counter":161,"content":"<p>It is not only Tusla that will need to be held accountable in these scenarios.  Potentially, the judge could make a decision that the child would need to question, and challenge, as well.  It is an important check and balance in the system to ensure that decisions are made in the best interests of children.  As one can imagine, social workers throughout the country can be overburdened with high volumes of cases.  Perhaps they are not able to give a child the attention that he or she needs.  Perhaps their supervisor takes a particular view on something or perhaps the judge takes a particular view on something.  There needs to be someone there to defend and vindicate the rights of the child.  Sometimes the parents can do that but, as one can imagine, it is difficult for a parent, if, for example, he or she has been prosecuted for neglecting his or her child, to play that special role.<br\/><br\/>As a final point, to echo what Mr. Finlay said, we recognise that a real attempt has been made to restrict the role that Tusla has in the management of the money in respect of the guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>service in the scheme but, from an independence perspective, it would be much better that Tusla would not have a role in managing the moneys around the guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>scheme.  It could be the Department of Children and Youth Affairs or it could be another body.

Mr. Finlay started off by saying that Grace and the babies in Tuam have taught us a lesson.  Sadly, we need to listen to this lesson.  That is the first message.  I first came into the D&aacute;il in 1998, around the time the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse was established.  There was an apology from the Taoiseach of the time and so on.  We thought that we were recognising what had happened in the past.  Nearly 20 years later we are discovering again the appalling neglect and lack of a voice of children in very vulnerable situations.  The witnesses have certainly brought that home to me this morning.<\/p><p>Both witnesses have rightly emphasised the issue of a rights-based approach.  There has to be a right to a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>.  In drafting this legislation, my first question would be how we can ensure that every child within the courts system, at least, would have that right, so that it would not just be at the discretion of the judge.  I know there are other children outside of the courts system who might also benefit.  Are the witnesses satisfied that the legislation does provide this right to every child?  If they are not, how can we alter the wording of the legislation?  I suspect this will touch on some of the points the witnesses have made already, particularly in their written submissions.<\/p><p>I would like a bit more clarity on how exactly the witnesses believe the system should be run.  Both of them have suggested that the issue of guardians <i>ad litem<\/i>be dealt with directly by the Department, or else by another independent body, rather than by Tusla.  The legislation suggests it should be Tusla.<\/p><p>The witnesses have pointed out that the guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>should not just be an expert witness for the court but should be the voice of the child.  The witnesses have given some documentation around how that should be implemented in their written submissions.  Could they elaborate on this?  Our job is to feed into the legislation as it is being drafted and to ensure that it is as strong as possible.<\/p><p>I was reading the case studies from Barnardos.  One was about Sally, a girl who was in care early on and was given back to her mother's care between the ages of four and six.  She was found out in the open with nobody looking after her and was brought back into care again.  Eventually it became established that something awful had happened to her in those two years.  The guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>in this case appears to have been involved all the way through, right up to her 18th birthday, ensuring that Sally understood all the way along the line what the care provision was going to be.  What I understood from the case study was that the guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>enabled the child to trust the system.  How comprehensive can the role of the guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>be?  Based on that case, it does not appear to be just a matter of appearing in court with the child but seems to be something of a broader role.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017030800002#E00800","speaker":"1325"},{"type":"speech","time":1488963600,"counter":172,"content":"<p>I know Mr. Finlay of old and admire his work hugely, as I also admire the Children's Rights Alliance.  I have no fear of what the witnesses are saying here today.  I admire what they are saying and doing.<\/p><p>I have a couple of questions, though, probably arising out of my own ignorance.  Mr. Finlay mentioned that Barnardos has a panel of 32 guardians <i>ad litem<\/i>working with 800 children each year.  If it comes to pass that we are going to have a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>for every single child who needs our help - we are talking about thousands of children - how are we going to do that?  How are we going to have the manpower to be able to look after all these children?<\/p><p>In the past, we have trusted social workers, Tusla and lots of other organisations with the care of our children, yet we have been let down badly in so many cases.  Although, with the mother and baby homes situation, we seem to be talking about events that happened more than 50 years ago, our digging is getting nearer and nearer to the present day.  Who is going to scrutinise the guardians?  Is there going to be a body that will oversee them and ensure that we do not make the same mistake again of trusting without even looking at the possible dangers that can evolve?<\/p><p>I fully agree that it should be a separate body to deal with the financial aspect of funding this.  It should not be Tusla.  The almost incestuous integration of what is happening in the HSE and bodies like this is too much.  We need to have something that is separate, for the children only and nothing else.  If the witnesses need any backing or support on that issue I will be happy to give my voice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017030800002#E00900","speaker":"1428"},{"type":"speech","time":1488963600,"counter":173,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  Never before did we feel such weight as Oireachtas committee members as this morning in respect of the revelations of the past month.  The Bill is very welcome.  Along with other members, I have been looking for it to come before us for some time.  However long it takes us to get it right, we now need to do so - to get this Bill right in its entirety.  We need to future-proof it so as not to continue making the mistakes of the past.  We will be doing this blind to some extent, without any commission reports or anything.  We all need to take a collaborative approach.<\/p><p>I was very much taken aback by the witnesses' presentations.  They were fantastic.  I know there are 6,344 children in care at this moment.  To think that only 1,500 of them have access to a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>service, and that at the discretion of a judge, is shocking.  The most important thing that needs to be enshrined in the legislation, with the will of everybody, is the right of the child to be represented, and not just on a discretionary basis.  Both witnesses touched on that this morning.  Deputy O'Sullivan has also addressed it.  We need to strengthen the Bill in respect of that issue.<\/p><p>Considering the balances, checks and controls and the overarching body that needs to be put in place, I am concerned that we would be creating another structure.  Will we be able to monitor it?  I  have a concern around creating another entity, when it may be the case that another body cannot manage it.  I have a concern about taking the role away from Tusla because Tusla was set up to protect the child.  That was the whole reason it was taken out of the HSE and the reason we have Tusla there.<\/p><p>I think Tusla is still a department in infancy which we need to grow because it has never been given the opportunity to do that as it has not had enough staffing or funding.  Coming back to collaboration, it all has to work together.  There is a role for Tusla to play here and I am not in favour of leaving it out completely.  I would like to hear what the controls, balances and staffing of the overarching body would be.  <br\/><br\/>What has worried me from the various press articles over the past fortnight is that one person who acts as a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>service is getting &euro;300,000 for providing that service.  I do not know what controls or checks and balances exist for approving those sorts of services.  That is what I want to see happen.  If we go back to the Grace case, we see that someone was given an opportunity to provide respite which turned into full-blown fostering and there is no documentation.  We need to get the balances and checks from its inception and write that in as part of the Bill.  How do the witnesses foresee this working and how would it work with the agency that is in place?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017030800002#E01000","speaker":"1231","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488963600,"counter":175,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an d&aacute; eagra&iacute;ocht anseo tr&aacute;thn&oacute;na as an gcur i l&aacute;thair.  I will make some general observations first and, if it is possible at a later stage, come back with some specific observations on some of the specific headings.  I was very taken with the two presentations in general and I would be very sympathetic to many of the observations.  I agree with the idea that a right to a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>should be explicit in law.  Unfortunately much of the discussion in recent weeks on the guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>service has related to cost and some of the headlines have been misleading, in terms of social workers costing X amount without any real reflection about what service is being provided in the specific instance.  That is unfortunate.  Obviously, some of this discussion has to take cost and cost efficiency and that kind of thing into account but the priority needs to be the voice of the child.  Members of this committee need to be robust in reflecting that this is a very particular service with a very important role.<\/p><p>I am sympathetic and agreeable to the idea that this should be funded and structured separately from Tusla.  The fact that Tusla is likely to be a party to so many cases means that it is logical and sensible that over time if some tensions or conflict were to emerge between the body of guardians <i>ad litem<\/i>and Tusla, there should be a firewall there.  How would the witnesses see a national service operating, providing it was independent from Tusla?  This is not an employer-employee relationship; I imagine it would be a contract for services type of relationship between the guardians <i>ad litem<\/i>and other Tusla services. <\/p><p>If this legislation is passed following some improvement, and I anticipate that it will be, a matter arises which I think would be a positive thing, I imagine there will be increased demand and an increase in the number of guardians <i>ad litem<\/i>required.  Does the capacity exist within the number of people who are qualified to undertake this role?  Will there be a need to bring on more people with the necessary qualifications?<\/p><p>I agree that the presumption should exist that children should be entitled to a guardian<i>ad litem<\/i>and it should be extended to the lower courts.  I am interested in the point about the extension of the role.  This is largely dealt with in Head 3 where the role is defined largely as that of an expert witness.  The witnesses are concerned that it will not be able to undertake some of the functions that it can undertake currently.  The Barnardos submission outlines the idea of a tandem model.  Could the representatives expand on how that tandem model would work where the guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>communicates with legal representation?  I have never seen it in court myself and I am curious about how that works.  Do the legal representation and the guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>currently participate in cross examination?  Is that potentially cumbersome or is it something that should be the aspiration, where a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>conveys the wishes of a child not only to the court but also the child's official legal representation, whether it is a solicitor or barrister?<\/p><p>I have one or two additional questions but that is enough for now.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017030800002#F00200","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"speech","time":1488963600,"counter":176,"content":"<p>For a new member like myself, cases such as the Grave case have happened in my lifetime and are very recent, and that has hit it home to me.

I have previous experience of working as a barrister with a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>and I have been through that process so I understand how the court process works.  It appears that the legal representation provided to a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>is almost a certainty; most guardians <i>ad litem<\/i>are represented in court.  The proposals with regard to the qualifications that a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>should possess include that they should be a qualified social worker with five years experience.  If the guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>is to retain the ability to make court applications and engage in those legal processes, do the witnesses feel that those qualifications are sufficient or should some legal training be provided?  The huge cost associated with the guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>is often the hiring of their barrister.  If the guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>wants to retain the ability to make these applications, which are quite basic and over time they would be making the same applications time and again, how would witnesses feel about the development of a one year diploma course or certificate in legal studies, for instance, that each guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>would have to achieve before they would be able to act in that particular capacity?  This is a long-term plan but maybe it is something that we should work towards in terms of efficiency and cost saving and getting rid of the necessity to hire a barrister on every occasion.<\/p><p>I agree with the presumption of representation or the presumption of a guardian<i>ad litem<\/i>being appointed.  Every child should have representation in court and it should not be at the discretion of one individual.  However, I would say that the justice system does act very well in this regard and judges would be very mindful of this.  The application can come either from the Child and Family Services, parents, the guardian, the court, so there are a number of checks and balances there to ensure that a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>is appointed if needed.  There are probably very few cases where a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>is not appointed where one is needed but I agree that in law we should enshrine the presumption that one would be appointed.  That is a very sensible approach.  <\/p><p>Fears were expressed by Deputy Rabbitte and others about retaining the services under the remit of Tusla, but I wonder if we move it to somewhere else, do we get rid of those risks or would we create other problems?  We could have the same problems with another organisation.  Can we work with what is there to put further checks and balances in place and see if that service works properly?  I agree with Deputy Rabbitte that it is an organisation in its infancy and instead of discarding that link we could work to improve it and address the concerns that have been expressed around that.  Ultimately, we want to ensure that the guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>offers an independent assessment and recommendation to the court, that they feel they can operate independently of any other organisation or body and that there is no fear in doing that.<\/p><p>What checks and balances can be put in place to ensure that continues?  At the end of the day, guardians <i>ad litem<\/i>will be paid from public funds and, therefore, there will always be a link to the State.  Perhaps we can make it more tenuous by putting them at a further remove but the link will always be there.  How can we ensure that an independent assessment will always be forthcoming and there will be no fear on behalf of the guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>in providing that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017030800002#F00400","speaker":"1336","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488963600,"counter":179,"content":"<p>Mr. Finlay said it costs &euro;5,000 a week to keep a child in care and sometimes up to &euro;10,000.

The figures are published by Tusla and within our own published accounts.  Barnardos was paid approximately &euro;3.2 million last year in respect of the guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>service it provides.  That covered approximately 30 guardians and 800 children.  On average, a guardian works with 25 children a year.  Guardians are, by and large, employed as independent contractors by Barnardos on a contract for service.  They earn, on average, &euro;75,000 a year, which is the same as a social work team leader.  Some earn more, some earn less.  The cost to Tusla on a per child basis is approximately &euro;4,500.<br\/><br\/>I agree with the Chairman.  There are forms of care which cost very little and the best form of care is the foster care arrangement, which works well for the child and costs very little.  Keeping children in care in that way in relationships that work well for them is hugely beneficial to the child and to the child's development but it is also very cost effective because the moment a child needs to go into residential care, the costs multiply significantly.  If guardians can help to keep a child out of the residential care system and, particularly, out of the secure care system, they will save the State an enormous amount.  That might sound like special pleading but I do not mean it to be that way.<br\/><br\/>The Chairman declared a special interest and I should also.  It is intended that after this Bill is passed, there will be a tender for a national provider.  Barnardos will be a competitor in that process.  We may or may not be appointed.  Whatever happens, what we want is that the best system will emerge.  In any definition of the best system, value for money has to be included.  There are no two ways around that.  Some of the costs involved are indefensible and they need to be addressed.<br\/><br\/>In response to Deputy Chambers, one of the ways they will be addressed is that a requirement of the tender, as we understand it, will be that the new agency to be established will have an in-house legal resource for the precise purpose of ensuring guardians have more training and more access to advice and so on, and they will not always have to have a legal resource standing beside them when they are in court.  Currently, particularly in the Dublin area, most cases involving guardians also involve a solicitor, although Ms McKittrick will know better.  One in ten or 11 involves a barrister and they tend to be the more complex cases.  The right way to get that cost down is to have a system in place where the provider is obliged to support the guardian with an internal resource.  That would be cheaper and more effective and would result in guardians being over time much more independent of the legal profession to meet the Deputy's point.<br\/><br\/>I feel as passionately as the Chairman about the fact that every penny spent on this is not a penny spent somewhere where it is desperately needed.  Like him, I have spent 30 years advocating for speech therapy and other essential services.  It is a false choice to say that if children are deprived of their voice in court at a moment life changing decisions are being made about them, the speech therapy service or other support services that they need can be more easily afforded.  These are not choices we should ask children to make.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017030800002#G00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fergus Finlay"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1488963600,"counter":185,"content":"<p>By removing the funding of a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>from Tusla, it takes away competition.  The funding would be ring-fenced.  I accept the Deputy's point that if an organisation is to be set up under public procurement, it has to have proper governance.  There is no governance at the moment.  People practising as guardians <i>ad litem<\/i>come into Barnardos on a voluntary basis; they do not have to do so.  They can work elsewhere or by themselves.  There is no regulation at the moment and that was highlighted in chapter 11 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's annual report in 2015.  It is a free-for-all, leading to the kind of difficulties the Chairman is experiencing.  The argument that is held up is that to get a guardian, we are sacrificing resources for Tusla.  We need to get this out from under Tusla in order that we do not have to make such choices.<br\/><br\/>On the legal questions, currently the spend is balanced 50:50 between guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>practice and guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>legal fees and we have no oversight regarding the fees.  The proposed scheme would provide for a legal department and it would allow us to properly examine legal fees, obtain much better value for money in respect of the legal requirement that is needed, and to get on with our practice while opting for legal representation only when it is needed.  It would allow the service to take an overview on when it was required.  It is important the guardians <i>ad litem<\/i>have a proper standing in court and that they are properly equipped.<br\/><br\/>Deputy O'Sullivan asked how it can be made a presumption.  Under head eight, if a child is going to the High Court for special care, which means that he or she will be detained and their liberty will be restricted in the specialist care unit, a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>will be appointed.  Subsection (2) states, &quot;If a child is the District Court or Circuit Court, a <i>guardian ad litem<\/i>may be appointed&quot;.

Sally did not have a guardian until the day she was taken into a special care unit.  She did not have a guardian when she was in an adult psychiatric ward.  She did not have a guardian when she was sent home to her mother when she was six.  She got one when she went into special care and her guardian and social worker worked hand in hand with the Child and Family Agency to obtain resources.  By having a guardian working alongside the social worker, the latter was able to access resources that had not previously been available to Sally.  This is the kind of work that we do on the ground.<br\/><br\/>An element of the Bill that worries me is that guardians <i>ad litem<\/i>, GALs, are not allowed to cross-examine witnesses.  We do not go to court everyday to cross-examine witnesses but when a question arises as to the quality of care that a child has received, we must be able to ask questions of the social workers and the parents if they want their children returned to their care.<br\/><br\/>Another element refers to how the guardian will not request an assessment in respect of a child.  A child might need speech and language therapy or psychological intervention but we cannot ask for that as his or her guardians.  Were the provision to read &quot;the guardian may not require&quot; and require us to make a court application, that would be fine, but to say that we cannot cross-examine or request more information puts us in the back seat and takes away from what we are able to do now.  We do a great deal of valuable work but there are many more Graces out there as well.  That is our worry.  When a child who is among the quarter of children who are represented approaches 18 years of age, we are able to argue for a robust aftercare plan for him or her, but we do not know whether the same is happening for the remaining 75%.  Tusla's aftercare policy, a matter that we will raise directly with that body, states that children with moderate learning disabilities will not get aftercare workers because that is the HSE's job.  There is a gap, which leads to the concern that children with borderline mild-to-moderate learning disabilities are being put into community placements without sufficient protections for their welfare.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017030800002#G01000","nonspeaker":"Ms Freda McKittrick","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1488963600,"counter":189,"content":"<p>This issue entails a range of human rights, the most fundamental being children's rights to protection.

Our recommendation is that a child who requires a GAL should be designated as a party to the proceedings through that GAL.  In this way, the child would have a solicitor.  If the child is not designated, however, that would not be the case.  By being a designated party, the child's voice would be heard and the GAL would have legal representation.

Political and legal accountability for GALs is a major issue.  As Ms McKittrick stated, there are no governance arrangements or regulation of the GAL system.  Establishing the service and regulating it in law are the first steps.  From a legal point of view, GALs can be held accountable by judges, the other parties to a case, Tusla's lawyers and parents' lawyers.  This is how it will happen in court.  Politically, the State can hold the GAL service accountable.<\/p> <p>  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, working directly with the service, is how the system is structured in the Bill, but this raises an issue of independence in that the service's independence could be undermined by imposing too many restrictions and regulations and not funding it properly, which would mean that it could not provide an appropriate service.  This matter needs to be considered.<\/p> <p>  The issue with placing the service with Tusla is that we live in a small country, so one can imagine the impact on local relationships if a GAL presents a view that opposes that of the Child and Family Agency.  What will happen to that information and where will it go?  We need to put procedures and barriers in place so as to ensure that there is no possibility of political interference or even the appearance of same.  Often, the GAL could be in agreement with Tusla's decision, so it is important that we know that that has been done independently as opposed to because the GAL is being funded directly by Tusla or there is a close relationship between the two.  This important issue of accountability needs to be considered.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Jan O'Sullivan asked about broader independent representation for children in care.  Tusla funds Empowering People in Care, EPIC, to provide an independent advocacy service for children in care.  This is an important measure, so the service must be properly funded, but having a legal service specifically for the courts is also important.  Perhaps the two could be merged at some point.<\/p> <p>  Regarding training and qualifications, GALs could be trained in a range of fields that would build their capacity to provide a good service, for example, listening to children, working with children who have experienced trauma, and various forms of legal training.  Training in how to be questioned and cross-examined is a major part of that.  Social workers in Tusla and others must go before courts, but being questioned by judges and lawyers is difficult, so this is an important part of their training.<\/p> <p>  This matter could be addressed in the legislation, not by specifying what type of training people get, but by specifying that they should get training on a regular basis.  There are similar provisions for solicitors.  For example, they must amass so many continuing professional development points annually.  The same could be imposed on GALs, so they would have to update their own training and experience constantly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017030800002#H00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Tanya Ward"},{"type":"speech","time":1488963600,"counter":192,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Ward.

That is why we are where we are and &euro;15 million or &euro;16 million per year is being spent on GALs, who are unregulated and unaccounted for.  In any language, that is wanton waste.  The reason for this is the language - mother's apple pie, the voice of the child and however else it is referenced.  We must remove the emotion and deal with the hard, cold, clinical facts.  There is a finite amount of money for looking after our most vulnerable asset, namely, children who are in need of care from the State.  We must ensure that that is done to the best of our ability, which means that we must discuss money.  That is why I am at a loss regarding the figures.<\/p> <p>  I have a bias, but to put it in context, Barnardos spent &euro;3.5 million on providing a voice for 800 children in court.

When I talk about choices I am asking if we, as a State, are happy to allow that kind of wanton waste and exaggerated costs and fees to give the child a voice in court when we neglect so many other areas?  To put that in context, the &euro;3.5 million would provide 300 children with a roof over their heads, love, warmth and food 365 days a year and would provide a voice in court for 800 children.  I am not saying that the voice in court is not needed.  Of course it is needed, but there is something wrong if we are allowing that to happen, and it is our fault.  I do not expect Barnardos to have raised the cost of guardians <i>ad litem<\/i>, GALs, as an issue.  It would not make any sense for it to do that, but we, and our predecessors, should have examined this issue and asked questions about it.  That is where I am coming from in this regard.<\/p><p>I want to make a point about taking the service from Tusla to ensure independence.  I do not accept that argument.  Tusla has many franchises and avenues.  To distil that down to the logic the witness is putting forward, I should not be allowed comment on Tusla in terms of the foster care system.  We are all impacted by and connected through Tusla.  It would be great if another budget was created somewhere else.  A previous speaker made the point that this did not come out of the Tusla budget but if we create another agency, more layers of management and accountability or whatever, that will swallow up massive amounts of the finite resources available that I want to see going to the areas where they are needed.  Somebody mentioned early trauma, intervention and care.  That is a huge area and if we could get the funding to address that, it would massively transform the area of children in care.  There are many possibilities in that regard but we have to watch where the finances are allocated.  I do not believe taking it from the remit of Tusla makes any sense on a financial level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017030800002#J00100","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1488963600,"counter":197,"content":"<p>If I could come back on the point about one agency versus the Department.  The difference between the voice of the child in court and the right of the child to access speech and language therapy is that the child has a constitutional right to have their voice heard in court.  Unfortunately, the child currently does not have a constitutional right to speech and language therapy.  We believe children should have that right.  That is one of the rights that children have in the Constitution and it is fundamental that it is protected.  I agree completely with the Chairman.  We failed as a country to regulate the system and it has resulted in massive costs.  Why are some GALs getting paid &euro;300,000 a year?  That is potentially more than some of the judges and some legal practitioners in the system.  I agree with the Chairman.  The fact that the Minister and the Department are moving to regulate this area is very important.<\/p> <p>  In terms of Tusla versus the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, we will not be creating another body by allowing the Department to directly manage the money going to this service.  The creation of a new body would be if a new public body was established that involved some level of costs.  Overall, in terms of the funding for the service, there will be more demands on the service but not every child needs the same level of support and representation.  It is only if a particular problem arises on a case, and that is where the GAL needs to act.  If we have regulation of a service, we will have value for money.  The current pot of money will be better spent on the current cohort of children in the care system.  The point to consider is that we will get a better service for the pot of money available to us.  We might not get any savings but more children might be provided with a better quality service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017030800002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Tanya Ward"},{"type":"speech","time":1488963600,"counter":198,"content":"<p>The Chairman is right to raise the money issue.

Many of us, as parents, have fought for children in our care.

It has to be done in a way that is properly accountable to the State and to the taxpayer.  If the Chairman says to me that there has been waste in the system up to now, I will not disagree with that.  If we achieve nothing else through this debate other than a sense that we are all committed to providing a value for money system which is capable of delivering real care, prevention and outcomes that save the State money in the long term and that enable other resources to be put into prevention and early intervention for all children, then that is a good thing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2017030800002#J00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fergus Finlay"},{"type":"speech","time":1488963600,"counter":203,"content":"<p>I tend to agree with Deputy O'Sullivan also.

Without any further ado, I invite the Minister to make her opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2017030800002#A00300","speaker":"1231"},{"type":"speech","time":1488969600,"counter":226,"content":"<p>I am very happy to be here to discuss my Department&rsquo;s 2017 Estimate.  I have a passion for the well-being of all our children and I hope the work we do together will enable and ensure that, ultimately, none of our children will be othered in our State.<\/p> <p>  The Revised Estimate for my Department for 2017 provides a gross funding provision of &euro;1.311 billion.  This represents an increase of &euro;173 million, or 16%, over the 2016 allocation.  This is a significant investment of taxpayers money and I am very grateful for the trust and confidence being shown towards me and my Department as we lead on our objective to improve the outcomes for children and young people in Ireland in that some of their dreams will come true, they will be loved, cared for, protected and safe.  I remain fully committed to ensuring the full delivery of this Government&rsquo;s programme for Government commitments.  I want to see an Ireland where the rights of all children and young people are respected, protected, fulfilled, where their voices are heard and where they are supported to realise their maximum potential now and in the future.  I remember at this moment the four year old boy I met in a community centre in Togher, County Cork, and Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire was with me there.  I spent quite a bit of time with the child in order to enable him to speak with me, getting down on my knees and having a chat with him.  I am also remembering the mother I met in one of Ireland's top legal firms when I went there to speak in the context of how to influence the influencers.  She spoke of how proud she was of her eight year old trans boy.<\/p><p> My Department, and its agencies, have a complex range of policy, legislation and services to deliver on.  Examples of this range from: initiatives to improve the level and quality of early childhood care and education; providing for the needs of children and young people in the care of the State; providing services to protect children against child abuse and to provide help and support to children and their families when that, unfortunately, happens; providing adoption services and; listening to children, learning from them, and finding out what works when we look to improve their lives.  We listened to young people when we gathered some together to hear about what Brexit means for them.  The Acting Chairman, Deputy Rabbitte, Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire and other public representatives were present.<\/p><p> As I noted, I have received a significant increase in funding in 2017 for which I am very grateful.  This funding will allow for a range of key service developments.  The most significant in terms of the level of increased funding relates to the provision of an additional &euro;120 million for early years care and education services.  The additional funding will be directed towards a suite of measures to improve the affordability, accessibility and quality of child care.  That brings the total allocation for early years child care and education to &euro;465 million, accounting for nearly 36% of my Department's overall allocation.  That level of funding allows for the extension of the ECCE scheme into a second year and the further full roll-out of the access and inclusion model.  Just the other day when we finally acknowledged and recognised the ethnicity of Travellers I had a long conversation with my assistant secretary, Bernie McNally, on how to ensure the access and inclusion model is also about including Travellers.  We also aim to provide more targeted child care subsidisation for lower income families as a first step and; to provide for universal subsidisation towards the cost of care for all children aged from six months to three years who are using regulated child care.  I met the early years forum we have established the other day and we looked especially at childminders in that regard.  I am also conscious that we need to assist making the child care sector more sustainable and some of the additional funding in 2017 will be used to acknowledge non-contact time required to deliver high-quality services.  It is an initial important step in terms of doing that kind of work to ensure sustainability but some funding has also been provided to enhance inspections and registration schemes to ensure services are delivered in a safe, supportive and caring environment.<\/p><p> I also welcome an additional investment of &euro;37 million for Tusla in 2017.  Tusla now has an annual allocation of some &euro;713 million which, I am confident, allows it develop as a sustainable organisation which will standardise, streamline and improve its services to children and families.  As Members well know, this agency provides services for some of the most vulnerable children and families in the State.  The extra funding in 2017 will allow it to further alleviate service pressures in respect of matters such as unallocated caseloads, private residential and foster care and services relating to domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  It will also allow Tusla to continue to prepare for the introduction of mandatory reporting under Children First later this year.<\/p><p> As we all know, it has been a challenging time for Tusla.  One of the challenges it continues to face is the bringing together of various cultures and legacies from the HSE, the National Educational Welfare Board, NEWB, and the Family Support Agency, FSA, when it came together to establish itself and move forward with the intention and ambition to provide the best care and protection for children.  I had a recent meeting with the board in Cork to discuss the challenges and the ways in which it has reassured me that it will do all that it can to meet the ambition both in its vision and mission and also in its upcoming business plan for 2017.<\/p><p> The significant additional resources secured for 2017 will allow my Department and its agencies build on the good work by all involved in working with children and families to deliver on the Government's commitment to fundamentally reform the delivery of services.  As far as I, as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, am concerned, in terms of delivering on the Government's commitment and the reform of services I can do it better with the input, criticism, constructive suggestions and support of committee members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2017030800002#A00400","speaker":"1358","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488969600,"counter":228,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

I have a couple of questions.  First, I very much welcome the increase in funding for the Department, which is up by 16%.  I am sure the money will be put to very good use.  A total of &euro;1.6 million is available by way of capital carryover.  Could the Minister indicate what capital investment was not completed last year?<\/p> <p>  There seems to be an increase in spending on sectoral programmes for children and young people.  Could the Minister provide detail to the committee on what programmes they are and what is being done this year?<\/p> <p>  Specifically, in terms of the spending on Tusla, the children and family support programme is &euro;743 million of expenditure for 2017, which is broken down into seven subheads, one of which relates to other current expenditure programmes.  Out of the &euro;730 million or so being spent for this year, approximately &euro;43 million will be spent on these programmes.  Could the Minister explain what is involved?<\/p> <p>  There appears also to be an increase in pay and administration for the agency for this year.  Could the Minister also explain where that money is going?  We do not appear to have a breakdown from Tusla on what it is spending its money on.  No performance information is provided to the committee on where the money is going and I would be interested to hear in more detail about where Tusla is spending its allocation.<\/p> <p>  One of the biggest complaints I receive as an elected representative relates to the provision of social workers.  How many social workers are currently employed by Tusla?  Does the expenditure on social workers come under the heading of administration and pay?  What is the projected expenditure for 2017 in respect of social workers and how does it compare with last year?  Are we spending more on social workers this year and if we are, how much?  Does the Department have any plans to employ additional social workers this year?  Are there currently any vacancies and if so, how many positions remain to be filled?  When does the Minister expect to fill the vacancies?<\/p> <p>  Could the Minister provide some detail on the children and young people's services committee, CYPSC?  I understand new co-ordinators were hired across the country towards the end of last year and perhaps some are being put in place this year.  How many committees are currently up and running?  How many co-ordinators do we have in place?  Could the Minister undertake to provide a performance report to the committee at the earliest convenience?  It would be useful for the committee to perhaps have the national co-ordinator of those committees appear before the joint committee to give an update to members as to how the new programme is working.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2017030800002#B00400","speaker":"1336"},{"type":"speech","time":1488969600,"counter":231,"content":"<p>A substantial amount of funding under the Vote specifically relates to Tusla.

Is it connected with the 41% increase provided for the preschool programme?  If so, what is the breakdown of both figures?  How does the administration system operate?

If I do not answer any of the questions, I ask Deputies to come back to me.<\/p> <p>  In general, many of the questions raised by Deputy Lisa Chambers will be answered in the Tusla business plan, which will be published on Friday, 10 March.  Extensive discussions at official level and my ministerial performance statement have helped in the development of the 2017 business plan and the priorities I have identified will guide the plan.  As I indicated, I met the chair, chief executive officer and board of Tusla.  In 2017, Tusla expenditure will focus on a number of areas.  This is the second year in a three-year initiative to tackle the issue of child protection cases awaiting allocation to a social worker.  I will address the specific question on social work recruitment targets in a moment.  The additional funding provided will allow Tusla to continue its challenging programme of recruiting social workers.  <\/p> <p>  Tusla will continue its preparatory work in advance of the introduction of mandatory reporting under the Children First Act.  Adoption is also part of its plan to ensure it is in a position to implement the provisions of the Adoption (Amendment) Bill, which we are about to complete, and the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill, Second Stage of which will begin in the Seanad later this month.  There will also be a focus on aftercare to ensure Tusla meets its statutory obligation in respect of children leaving care and aftercare supports.<\/p> <p>  I will discuss a number of other aspects of the plan if Deputies wish.  However, I would like to address more specifically the ongoing issue of Tusla's social work recruitment targets.  In September 2015, Tusla published its three-year plan, From Survival to Sustainability, which estimated that 268 additional social workers or 1,627 whole-time equivalent social workers were needed to address the unallocated cases during the timeframe of the plan.  With only 250 social workers graduating each year, the labour market is highly competitive.  I have directed my officials to contact CORU and the Higher Education Authority to discuss the number of social workers graduating and how it can be increased.  However, it will be some time before an increase in graduate numbers is achieved. <\/p> <p>  Tusla has taken a proactive approach to recruitment, including recruiting social workers outside the jurisdiction.  The organisation currently has 1,467 whole-time equivalent social workers and the end target for 2017 is 1,520.  This target is short of the target set in From Survival to Sustainability by approximately 100 whole-time equivalent social workers, which reflects the constraints in labour supply.  Tusla will continue to prioritise the recruitment of an additional 100 family support practitioners, 166 social care staff and 125 administrative staff to allow social workers to focus on their care work with children and their families.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Lisa Chambers asked a question about pay in Tusla.  The allocation for 2017 is approximately &euro;217 million or 38% of overall expenditure.<\/p> <p>  Recruitment is directly related to the issue of unallocated cases.  Deputies will be aware that the Tusla chief executive officer recently stated that the recruitment of social workers was ongoing.<\/p><p>The funding is in place to achieve the recruitment.  The recruitment environment is proving to be challenging.<\/p><p> On its impact in regard to unallocated cases, when Tusla was set up there were almost 10,000 unallocated cases.  This was reduced to 5,413 at the end of 2016, which is a 20% reduction in 2016 alone.  Of the 5,413 unallocated cases, 801 of them were classified as high priority, 3,262 medium priority and 1,350 of low priority.  One of the points I would like to particularly communicate here too today is that there was a downward trend in the numbers of unallocated cases from the beginning of 2016 to October last but that was reversed at the end of the year.  The number of unallocated cases increased then by over 1,100 in the final two months.  Tusla has advised me that this was due to challenges in the area of social work recruitment.<\/p><p> The question on the Oberstown Children Detention Campus was whether the moneys allow for the completion of the repair works.  The capital allocation of &euro;3.25 million includes funding provision for a range of remedial and improvement works that were identified - I also noted the need for some of these in my visits to the campus, and I note the committee visited there too - as being required following a period of operation of new facilities and several incidents, such as damage to the new and previously existing facilities by the young people.  Two of the previously existing units are due to come back into operation in March of 2017 following remedial works and the demolition of a third unit, which was severely damaged by the fire.  Other works have commenced and will be replicated in all of the residential units across the campus during 2017.  The full cost of all of these works has yet to be established as there are some ongoing design elements involved, including the identification of alternative door design.  In my first visit to Oberstown, the issue of doors, and how to design them in a way that is appropriate, both for the living environment of the young people who are there but also to provide the security that is require, continues to be challenging, not only nationally but also internationally.<\/p><p> I will address the capital investment in child care that Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire raised.  Needless to say, capital investment will be required.  We all would agree with that.  As the affordable scheme is rolled out and more families avail of high quality affordable child care, I will soon announce &euro;3 million in capital funding for early years in 2017.  On Monday last, I announced &euro;4 million in capital funding for school-age child care.  I will seek more investment next year and beyond.<\/p><p> In regard to the capital carryover from 2016, the school-age child care capital funding was not spent in 2016.  That is because the Department was finalising an action plan with the Department of Education and Skills in that regard.  I am delighted to have launched that school-age child care action plan this week and the associated &euro;3 million capital scheme to increase the number of high quality after school places as well.  There was also an underspend in the youth requirements but I can assure the Deputy that will be spent in 2017.<\/p><p> Deputy Lisa Chambers asked a question about the administration.  Was it in regard to the Department itself?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2017030800002#C00600","speaker":"1358","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488969600,"counter":239,"content":"<p>No.  It was the children and young people's services committees, CYPSCs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2017030800002#D00200","speaker":"1336"},{"type":"speech","time":1488969600,"counter":240,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

Apologies, I meant to say we will engage.  We are just about to have the discussions with the HEA.  We have been planning to do exactly as the Deputy identified.<\/p> <p>  I would make two points here, specifically, in regard to social workers.  More places need to be created at third level for the significant numbers of young people who want to avail of those place.  Until that happens, one action in the Tusla active recruitment programme is that it must look outside of the country, to Northern Ireland, the UK and beyond, in order to attract social workers here.  This is probably more a medium-term ambition.  If the Deputy has views in that regard or anything that she wants to provide to me and my Department, I would be more than happy to consider them.  In coming into office, this is one of the first items on which I would have had discussions with the Department stating this is what we need to aim for.  The other point is we need to create more places.  I understand that is a big ask and it is good to know we are about to engage in those discussions.<\/p> <p>  The other aspect, in terms of higher education, that we have been speaking about that also influences the challenges in recruitment, particularly within Tusla so that we have who we need for unallocated cases and also working for the care and protection of children, is the issue around the qualifications for social care workers.  We have been looking a lot at that, more from a third level education perspective, to ensure that we support and encourage that the programmes, and content of the curriculum of the many such courses, are geared and reformed in an ongoing way to the challenges in the work, particularly in the care and protection of children.  Many in my Department are working on and committed to that.<\/p> <p>  As I have stated on a number of occasions in other contexts, it is important to emphasise that it is not only about social workers.  I do not mean these comments by way of explicit criticism of the current programmes and degrees for social care workers.  Those working in this field are aware of the challenges.  We are merely identifying that it would be important in ongoing conversations to ensure that there is a match between what is required in terms of the ongoing challenges in caring for children and what is going on in the workplace, particularly in light of the Tusla requirements on social care workers.<\/p><p>Social care staff, administrative staff, etc. can reduce the burden on social workers.  Many members will probably have heard the complaint or concern that social workers are sometimes  caught up in doing more administrative work than they wish.  Therefore, we need to increase the number of social workers. <\/p><p> The Government has provided the money to me in terms of meetings to ensure that pressure is maintained to tackle recruitment issues.

The figure compares favourably with England where the average turnover was 17% in 2014.<\/p> <p>  Over the past number of months I have met with a couple of organisations which represent social care workers and social workers.  The Deputy has rightly identified the challenges of working at the coalface, particularly in the context of Tusla and the work that is required of social workers.  That work is sometimes more difficult than the other kinds of jobs that social workers can access and be employed in.  Representations have been made to me.  I am fully aware of the situation and have shared that experience with the senior management of Tusla whom I meet on a quarterly basis.  They are aware of the concerns too.  I can supply the Deputy with more information at a later point if she so wishes.  Tusla is very focused on finding ways to improve retention policies and practices, whether through employee assistance programmes or other initiatives.  Staff retention is not only a recruitment issue.  As the Deputy has said, social work is not just a money issue.  Resources are available.  We must find ways to improve the ongoing supports available to social workers in the context of Tusla to retain staff.  <\/p> <p>  Retaining staff is a challenge but Tusla has adopted a number of approaches to address the problem.  Recruitment is one aspect.  We must have an internal transfer list to help people to work in areas nearer their homes.<\/p> <p>  In terms of attracting new people, interviews have taken place, panels have been established and positions offered.  I will get the exact figure from my accompanying staff.  Some of the offers have not been availed of because the posts are not close to where people live.  Location raises particular issues.  Tusla is trying to address the problem, along with the professional organisations.  Indeed, they are also focused on continuing professional development, employee welfare initiatives and managed caseloads for newly qualified staff.  These measures will address recruitment and provide support to people in order to encourage them to stay.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2017030800002#E01000","speaker":"1358"},{"type":"speech","time":1488969600,"counter":257,"content":"<p>Is Deputy O'Sullivan happy with the Minister's response?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2017030800002#E01100","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speech","time":1488969600,"counter":258,"content":"<p>Yes.

The first questions were about Tusla dealing with historical cases and the particular expertise required to do so.  It is an excellent question.  Tusla is setting up an expert team to deal with historical cases.  The chief executive officer wrote to my Secretary General last Friday to indicate it would be happening perhaps as a result of ongoing engagement and particularly the Deputy's engagement with the committee.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the 60% of all referrals to Tusla which are directed to family support services, this area is also being developed.  <\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked a question on ICT, which I appreciate very much and know is a particular concern of hers.  Let me outline where things are at and why it is such a challenge.  In 2017, the funding that Tusla requested for the national child care information system has been provided with capital funding of approximately &euro;4 million to support the development and roll out of it.  It is scheduled to roll out to at least three additional areas in 2017 and roll-out of the system nationally is scheduled to be completed by the end of 2018.  The question then is why the progress of the roll-out has been so slow.  To identify the number of technical issues that have hindered the project's progress, it was essential to ensure that all users of the system were on a single domain so information could be integrated and shared.  It was also important to ensure networks were upgraded to facilitate the use of the NCCIS and progress has been made in resolving these technical issues, which it is anticipated will facilitate the continued roll-out of the system in 2017.  It is also helpful to know the project requires formal approval at all stages from the peer review group of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Tusla also had a formal meeting with the peer review group of NCCIS in February 2017.  It is awaiting approval to progress to the next stage of the project.  We are seeing this in lots of different instances in my Department and across Departments.  When there is a roll-out of an information technology system of such magnitude, there are not only technical issues but several layers of management of the process.  Within the Department or agency, a project management board usually oversees it and there are potentially peer review processes as well.  There is also the Office of the Chief Information Officer, OCIO.  Unfortunately many of these roll-outs are slower than what was anticipated initially but I have tried to provide the Deputy with information on their ambition and with all the supports what will be happening in 2017.  We want to get it right.  <\/p> <p>  The Deputy also asked questions about family resource centres.  There are 109.  I was much helped by meeting with representatives of the family resource centre network recently.  They raised a number of issues on what would enable them to continue to develop.  We have been able to provide some additional funding for 2017, in other words, a slight increase in funding.  They identified funding issues and what is really required for them to move towards sustainability and increase the reach of their work.  The allocated funding in 2016 was &euro;13.51 million.  They identified a need for significantly more money for that.  They talked about the need for at least three staff members in each centre.  We are aware of that.  They indicated the budget will not be increased in 2017.  That is what I meant to say.  Tusla will be increasing funding for the FRCs in the 2018 Estimates.  I am working with them to look at how to build the argument for that, particularly in terms of the ways in which their prevention and intervention work can reduce the need ultimately for the unallocated cases on the other end.  The issue of unallocated cases is significant both politically and for the Government.  It is a particularly useful argument to use as I move into 2018 to support those efforts and their call for multi-annual funding.  Tusla provided once-off funding at the end of 2016 of &euro;1.422 million.  They raised issues with me on child care facilities for many of the family resource centres and the challenges they have in the context of working within a community.  I am bringing those specific concerns into ongoing conversations with the Department in terms of community-based services and the challenges they are having.<\/p> <p>  I am encouraged to say that Tusla has a new organisation development plan for the NCCIS for 2017 and a new director of the ICT structure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2017030800002#F00050","speaker":"1358"},{"type":"speech","time":1488969600,"counter":269,"content":"<p>We will now move onto programme B, which is the sectoral programme for children and young people to continue to support the provision of both universal and targeted services for the care, development and well-being of children and young people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2017030800002#F00200","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speech","time":1488969600,"counter":270,"content":"<p>I am very happy to take questions.

I have had a particular interest in it since assuming this position.  One of the first things put in front of me as Minister was related to funding to ensure its ongoing sustainability as we looked at ways to support the area-based approach, as well as mainstreaming the learning from it.  In terms of finding money to do that in 2017 and given the projections for 2017 and the significant increase in funding identified by the Deputies, we are talking with Pobal about all of the sites with the hope of extending programmes to the end of the year.  That is what we are examining.  A number of sites have programmes based on the academic year and, as such, the next challenge is the funding required to mid-2018.  Overall, I want to ensure no site will have to close suddenly.  In addition, we are doing the work with a focus on mainstreaming.  My personal commitment and discussions in the Department relate to enabling that sustainability as much as possible on the existing sites, while working with the challenge of mainstreaming the learning from operations in the past few years.<\/p> <p>  I was asked about the funding of the new affordable child care scheme.  To answer in general terms, the funding we were able to get in 2017 is being identified for the roll-out of the scheme from September.

We had discussions earlier about what would happen in September and the fact that the fully automated scheme might not be available in the way we had anticipated and hoped for.

There is a challenge with the exit of Atlantic Philanthropies, but there is extraordinary work ongoing on those sites.

I ask the Minister to comment on an issue we discussed earlier this morning with Barnardos relating to the pre-legislative scrutiny of the guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>Bill.  The cost of the guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>system has attracted much negative media comment recently.  In my 12 years in public life, I found reading the figures in a Sunday newspaper most staggering.  I am open to being corrected on them.  The Ombudsman for Children's office costs us approximately &euro;2 million per year and we can see the amount of services and support it provides to children across the State.  The guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>system would cost &euro;15 million or &euro;16 million to give a small number of children a voice in court.  I am not downplaying that but in our earlier conversation, we noted the dearth of services available for children in State care, such as speech and language therapy, psychological services and early trauma intervention because the finance is unavailable.

There are two aspects to the question.  It is a lot of money and some of the commentators are wondering if that amount of money is being spent in the best possible way in supporting a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>system.  We all agree there is a requirement for it when it comes to the rights of children.  Within the Chairman's question I hear the query of whether it is the most efficient way to use that money within the system.  Moreover, what about moneys we require for the care and protection of children in other contexts?  The ambition and policy intention of the new legislation is to give a much more cost-effective system, with much more given to the voice of children and less money spent on legal fees.<\/p><p>The second point is we anticipate that in the design of the system as it is rolled out - I know the committee was doing pre-legislative scrutiny on it earlier - more children will have access to it.  In that way, there will still be a cost.  That is what we must consider.  Underneath the Chairman's question is the query of whether the money is being spent in the most efficient manner but the legislation is effectively saying it needs to be better.  That is what we are trying to achieve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2017030800002#H00300","speaker":"1358"},{"type":"speech","time":1488969600,"counter":292,"content":"<p>It is something we will return to with the Minister on 5 April.

The Bill, which has been passed by the Seanad, will make it mandatory for medical practitioners to provide evidence of minimum levels of indemnity cover to the Medical Council, on registration with the Council and on annual renewal of registration.  There is currently no legal obligation on a medical practitioner to have medical indemnity insurance cover.  As a result, some patients and the users of medical practitioners' services may find they are unable to seek redress in the event of a medical mishap or negligent care from a medical practitioner.  Given the high cost of litigation and the long-term consequences of some adverse events, this legislation is to be welcomed as patient-focused and progressive.<\/p> <p>  The main purpose of the original Medical Practitioners Act 2007 is to protect the public and to have a proactive system of robust registration and regulation of the medical profession, in order to minimise the risk to the public and safeguard the health and well-being of people accessing health services.  Under the Medical Practitioners Act, the Medical Council must register every medical practitioner who practises in Ireland.  In anticipation of the enactment of this Bill, the Council already asks medical practitioners on application for registration and on annual retention of registration whether they have indemnity cover.<\/p> <p>  On the enactment of the legislation medical practitioners will not be registered to practise unless evidence of adequate indemnity cover is provided to the Council.  This development can only be to patients' benefit.  The Bill requires that the State Claims Agency would specify the minimum levels of indemnity required for medical practitioners in different medical specialties.  The State Claims Agency has the relevant competence and expertise in the area of managing clinical claims and it also has close links with medical indemnifiers and so is well placed to specify what the minimum levels of indemnity should be.<\/p> <p>  This policy change requires that a new function be given to the State Claims Agency under section 8 of the National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act 2000.  There are currently 58 medical specialties on the Medical Council's register and practising in some would be higher risk than practising in others.  Within different specialties too, there could be a higher risk attached to certain types of practice.  It is important to point out that all doctors who work in the public health system are provided with medical indemnity insurance under the State's clinical indemnity scheme.  Likewise, private consultants who practise in public hospitals are also covered by this scheme.<\/p> <p>   However, doctors who are engaged in wholly private practice must purchase private indemnity insurance cover.  There is a wide range in the cost of cover for consultants engaged in wholly private practice.  For example, a consultant practising dermatology, based on figures from medical indemnifiers, would be considered low risk and the annual premium for this practice would be around &euro;16,000.  Nevertheless, a spinal surgeon may have to pay over &euro;100,000 for annual medical indemnity insurance cover, reflecting the much higher risk involved in that practice.  The cost of this private cover increased by approximately 42% for private consultants in 2014 and this was mainly due to the high cost of awards for clinical negligence.<\/p> <p>  We will now examine the Bill, which includes three minor technical Government amendments.  The amendments are needed because the original text of sections 45 and 50 of the Medical Practitioners Act 2007 were amended by Regulation 95 of the transposing regulations of the European Union (Recognition of Professional Qualification) Regulations 2017, that is SI 8 of 2017.  I will explain the implications of these textual changes on sections 7 and 8 of the Bill as we examine those sections.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2017030800002#B00200","speaker":"1339"},{"type":"speech","time":1488988800,"counter":310,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2017030800002#B00300","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1488988800,"counter":311,"content":"<p>Sections 1 to 6, inclusive, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1488988800,"counter":312,"content":"<p>SECTION 7<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1488988800,"counter":313,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos 1 and 2 in the name of the Minister are related and will be discussed together by agreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2017030800002#B00600","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1488988800,"counter":314,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1.<\/p><blockquote>In page 5, line 4, to delete &ldquo;subsection (7)&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;subsection (3)&rdquo;.<\/blockquote> <p>Section 7 amendments section 45 of the Principal Act to introduce a new subsection (1A) after subsection (1).  Subsection (1A) (a) requires a medical practitioner to provide evidence in the manner in which the Medical Council may specify in rules of the minimum level of indemnity which applies to his or her practice.  The Medical Council will provide all relevant information to registrants and prospective registrants on its website to assist them in complying with the legislation.<\/p><p>Subsection (1A)(b) requires a medical practitioners who is not engaged in medical practice and therefore who would not fall into a class of medical practitioners who must have medical indemnity to provide evidence that he or she is not engaged in practice, again in accordance with rules, which may be set out by the Medical Council.  <\/p><p> Subsection (1)(b) of the Bill had introduced a new subsection (8) after subsection (7) of section 45 of the Principal Act to specify that the Medical Council cannot register a medical practitioner who falls within a class of medical practitioner, which requires indemnity, unless the medical practitioner has provided evidence of his or her minimum level of indemnity cover as may be set out in rules under section 11(2)(va).  However, a minor amendment to that text is required for the following reason, which is that the Medical Practitioners (Amendment) Bill 2014 was passed by the Seanad on 4 November 2015, but section 45 of the Principal Act was amended by regulation 95 of the transposing regulations of the European Union (Recognition of Professional Qualifications) Regulation 2017, SI 8 of 2017 and was signed into law on 17 January 2017 by the Minister for Education and Skills.  These regulations transposed EU directive 2013\/55\/eu of the European Parliament and of the Council  of 20 November 2013 on the recognition of professional qualifications.  In this transposition subsections (4), (5) and (6) of section 45 were deleted by regulation 95.1(e) and an amendment is therefore required to the text of the current Bill to state that subsection (7) in section 45 of the Principal Act has now become subsection (3).<\/p><p> This is the effect of amendment No. 1 in the name of the Minister.

I understand the committee is engaging with a range of groups, including the Irish Penal Reform Trust, the Prison Officers Association, etc.  The meetings will be very important in helping tjo chart the future of the Irish Prison Service in the context of penal reform.<\/p> <p>  The committee will be aware that significant change and reform have occurred in the prison system in recent years, addressing many of the issues highlighted by the committee, including prison numbers, overcrowding and prison conditions.  For years overcrowding caused a strain on the system and created significant challenges for management and staff of the Irish Prison Service in providing appropriate accommodation and constructive regimes for prisoners.  Thankfully, the issue of overcrowding has been eliminated in the majority of prisons.  The numbers in custody have fallen by 20% since their peak in 2011, while the numbers on temporary release have reduced by almost 70% during the same period.  The implementation of the fines legislation is starting to have an effect, with some drop in the numbers coming to prison for fines offences.  Provisional figures for 2016 show a decrease of approximately 15% on the figures for the previous year.  This reduction in numbers has allowed the Irish Prison Service to progress and enhance several key services, including enhanced pre-release planning and resettlement; structured temporary release; the community return scheme and the community support scheme; the incentivised regime programme; drug treatment facilities; developing the psychology service; integrated sentence management facilities; working with the families of those imprisoned, as well as working with the third level sector and in-reach services.<\/p> <p>  The Irish Prison Service has continued to implement a comprehensive capital programme to provide additional accommodation and enhance the quality of accommodation across the prison estate.  The priority has turned to improving existing accommodation and rehabilitative facilities.  The number of prisoners slopping out has decreased from 1,003 in 2010 to just 49 or less than 1%.  The refurbishment of Mountjoy Prison has been completed and all cells now have toilet facilities and wash-hand basins and been returned to single occupancy.  In 2016 we saw the opening of a new prison in Cork.  It provides high quality accommodation and for rehabilitation for families.  It also allows the service to provide enhanced visiting facilities for prisoners and their families.  Current and planned capital projects will result in the complete elimination of slopping out across the estate for the first time.<\/p><p> Huge progress has been made to incentivise prisoners to participate in constructive activities.  The incentivised regime programme has provided real incentives to prisoners to participate and engage and has also reduced levels of violence across the estate.  New training facilities have been provided for the first time in Mountjoy Prison.  It is vital that the services and opportunities provided are available to all prisoners.  As the committee will be aware, some prisoners are unable to associate with other prisoners for various reasons.  These are mainly factors that come into the prison from outside and prison management must ensure the safety of all who work and reside within the walls.  That said, we have made huge strides in reducing the numbers of prisoners who require protection or are accommodated on a restricted regime.  The number of prisoners on 22 or 23-hour lock-up, or solitary confinement, has decreased from 211 in July 2013 to 72 in January this year.  While this figure can fluctuate, we hope to and I am confident that we can eliminate solitary confinement as we know it when we implement the Mandela rules and our new policies.<\/p><p> The work we have undertaken has positively contributed to the goal of a safer, fairer and inclusive Ireland.  Since 2013, in partnership with the Central Statistics Office, CSO, annual recidivism studies have been published that show a reduction in recidivism levels from 55% in 2007 to 45% in 2010, a drop of ten points.  I am confident that we can take that down by another ten points over the next ten years and meet the best practice within Europe. <\/p><p> There are still significant challenges facing the Prison Service, including issues of mental health, the management of prisoners on protection and how the service can best manage violently disruptive prisoners.  I am confident the Prison Service can meet these challenges and the work being undertaken by the committee will assist in our endeavours. <\/p><p> I am confident that the successful implementation of our strategy for 2012 to 2015 and our new strategy, built around four pillars - supporting our staff, supporting our prisoners, supporting victims and enhancing our organisational capacity - will see further improvements across the Prison Service in the years to come.  I have no doubt that we could become a world-class prison service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017030800002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Donnellan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488963600,"counter":339,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Donnellan.

Prisons are always a microcosm of society.  We engage with people in prisons to deal with the situation we encounter.  All prisoners who are on committal will see a nurse or doctor within 24 hours.  Where people who have addiction issues give a history of opiate use and test positive for opiates and where they have been maintained on methadone treatments in the community, we will continue that treatment while they remain in custody.  There are currently just under 10,000 people on methadone treatments in the community.  Additionally, we have a contract with Merchants Quay Ireland to provide addiction counselling in 12 of our 13 institutions.  We have addiction pharmacists in Mountjoy and other facilities, and we have general practitioners, GPs, with a special interest in substance misuse.<\/p> <p>  In summary, we provide a range of services for people addicted to drugs within the prison system.  While the numbers on methadone in the community have continued to rise in the last few years, we have seen a significant reduction in prisons.  There were 750 people on methadone maintenance across the prison system when I came to the Prison Service in 2008.  There are 465 today.  There has been a change in that, notwithstanding the reduction in numbers.<\/p> <p>  We regard prison as an ideal opportunity for somebody to address his or her addiction issues.  We have a self-directed detox programme in the Mountjoy campus where people can reduce their methadone intake by 5 ml a week under the supervision of the doctor and pharmacist.  We did research in the last two years, from June 2014 to December 2016.  We had 530 patients involved in self-directed detox in Mountjoy.  Some 120 have come off methadone completely and 88 are still off methadone as of last week.  Some 197 reduced their methadone intake by a minimum of 20 ml.<\/p> <p>  We are concerned about other drugs, particularly new psychoactive substances, NPS.  Deputies will be aware from looking at recent media footage of what is going on in English jails of the impact of NPS on violence and deaths in custody in English jails.  We have not seen it to any significant extent here yet.  We have seen some small episodes of it.  We have brought over our colleagues from Public Health England and the National Health Service, NHS, to help us to try to ensure that we are prepared if NPS becomes a real problem in the way that it has in English and Scottish jails.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017030800002#B00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fergal Black"},{"type":"speech","time":1488963600,"counter":343,"content":"<p>Are drugs still coming into prisons from outside?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017030800002#B00600","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1488963600,"counter":344,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017030800002#B00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fergal Black"},{"type":"speech","time":1488963600,"counter":345,"content":"<p>It was mentioned that there are 72 people in solitary confinement.

Recently, we developed a mental health course for staff, which is really effective because it begins to help staff to get an insight into people's mental health problems and know the signs to look out for.  Suicide is an issue in prison and very traumatising.  We have a range of supports in place.  We also have a staff support system under which we have staff support officers available to whom staff can go for help or to get advice.  We provide a counselling service, have an employee assistance programme and a freefone number which prison officers can ring 24\/7 if they go home from work and have experienced something really difficult.<\/p> <p>  The Senator is correct - prison can be chaotic because one has a range of people with different needs and from different backgrounds.  The majority have come from highly traumatised backgrounds with early childhood problems that play out in the prison environment.  For many prisoners drugs offer pain relief and they do not care what they take.  They take it to soften the damage caused by their pain.  It is about getting through that barrier with them and supporting staff.  As the Senator said, it is a very difficult environment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017030800002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Donnellan"},{"type":"speech","time":1488963600,"counter":380,"content":"<p>That is something to think about, namely, specifically training staff to understand the impact of addiction, but it is also important for them to learn how to cope with those in the chaos of addiction.

On the drug treatment programmes provided by the Red Cross and Samaritans, we look to celebrate any achievement of prisoners because they have not had many opportunities.  To answer the question specifically, it is really about where a person is at.  He or she needs to want to be part of the addiction programme.

We do everything we can to incentivise prisoners to engage in drug addiction programmes and face up to the challenge of overcoming their addictions.  We do not have a specific checklist in considering concessions for prisoners such as release under a community return scheme, for example.  There are a number of factors we consider, but we always pay particular attention and give credit to any prisoner with addiction issues or who had them in the past and has made efforts within the prison to tackle them.  Essentially, we are talking about an issue of security - fighting the contraband and trying to prevent smuggling.  There is also, as my colleague mentioned, the issue of rehabilitation.

I thank the delegates for coming before the committee.  I am sorry that we have dragged them away from their other responsibilities as we know very well about the good job they do.<\/p> <p>  Before I forget it, I will mention the Red Cross first.  I was going to bring up the issues of programme also.  Reference was made to the importance of celebrating achievement and validating people's experience.  It is critically important to normalise prisoners as productive members of society.  We have seen the value of this and other programmes.<\/p><p>We had organised a visit to the Oireachtas for some of the participants in the scheme - current and former inmates who are willing to give up their time and explain to colleagues what that job involves.  Everything was ready to go but, as members know, it was pulled at the last minute.  My belief is that somebody in the Department of Justice and Equality probably panicked and thought the gutter press would go on a rampage about criminals drinking tea and eating sandwiches in the D&aacute;il while crime spirals, or the usual sensationalised rubbish.  That is the only reason I can see because it is utterly valid for those people to come here and talk about this programme.  We want to do that again.  Without putting the witnesses on the spot in any way, our belief is that this is valid and would be good.  I presume the witnesses do not have any fears that there would be any negative consequences.  Nobody will be harmed by it.  Could the witnesses give us their views on that?  Would they like to come in?  I do not mean to be unfair or put them on the spot but could the witnesses talk more about that programme and how it would be good if they came here and presented it?<\/p><p> I thought Mr. Donnellan's point that, for the first time, the Irish Prison Service is in a position to really deal with the problems and tackle the rehabilitative end was interesting.  I have no hesitation in saying that this ideology and ethos is at the top of the Irish Prison Service and is shared by many of the staff.  The question of whether we are any nearer achieving it is probably a different story.  It is not because of any lack of will.  I fully appreciate that but there is a huge gap in terms of delivering it.  The drugs problem starts with sentencing.  I do not understand why people who have a drug problem are being sentenced to prison.  They should be sentenced to some rehabilitative facility if they wish.  What is the witnesses' level of knowledge of people who are being cajoled, threatened or forced into bringing drugs back to prison when they are on a day out, possibly to pay off a debt?  That vicious circle is very difficult to address.  Even when people are trying to get off drugs, if they are in a chaotic environment where they are isolated, the instinct to go back to drugs is there.  The challenges in this area are huge.  Do the witnesses have any comments to make about criminal involvement sinking in?<\/p><p> Ultimately, training is key.  Following on from the points made by Deputy Jack Chambers, I still do not really get what is happening in the training unit.  The explanation did not satisfy me.  The training unit as an ideology was ahead of its time in the European context.  The training unit in Mountjoy was very high spec and involved working with people who were drug-free, rehabilitating them and normalising their life inside.  It is the only facility in Dublin that does so.  The inmates sleep and eat there, and the staff ratios are incredibly low.  It is probably the cheapest facility the Irish Prison Service runs and yet there have been no assaults and no problems with staff and inmates.  I could not believe it when I heard that it will be shut down in three months time.  I do not see why an old people's facility could not be developed alongside it because it is about more than training.  It is about adjusting to a way of life and it is incredibly efficient.  I would be very worried if it was to go because from where will that experience and acclimatising be replaced?  I do not see how.  <\/p><p> In respect of training for staff, there is a view among some prisoners that new staff often come in and are \"up for it\" with lots of new ideas but that gets knocked out of them fairly quickly.  They become demoralised or institutionalised.  Some of the older staff then feel that they have been there for far longer and are not appreciated.  Sometimes they feel that they are put in vulnerable positions where they do not get backup.  They can become dehumanised themselves because of being cut off and the circumstances they are exposed to.  While there may be some access to supports, it is never enough in any job.  We need to pay a lot of attention to staff in terms of welfare because the environment plays with people's heads and affects the way they think.  People can become dehumanised and institutionalised on all sides and that needs to be addressed.  There is a need for enhanced training.  I am interested in the mental health training programme that was mentioned but that should be mandatory for everybody and should be of a high level.  That obviously means money.  I am not blaming the witnesses, but is that their view? <\/p><p> How many people are in prison because of society's failure to fill the gap caused by shutting down all these horrendous institutions we read about day in and day out, even the psychiatric hospitals?  Previously, people who had problems were sent to these hospitals and locked behind closed doors.  Nobody wants that but there is a huge gap.  How many of these people are now in prison so that the management and staff have to pick up the pieces regarding people who need help?  I know evidence was given to the Committee of Public Accounts that there are 30 inmates with severe psychiatric problems and it is the staff who must deal with them.  In respect of the relationship with the Central Mental Hospital and how it could be improved, it is completely unacceptable that management, prison staff and prisoners are left in a situation where, when somebody requires urgent medical help, only one person is taken in for a couple of weeks and then sent back again.  It is just not on.  I am amazed nobody has been killed in our prisons.  It is incredible.  Is there anything we can do to deal with that issue?  To me, that is the key.  If people who should not be in prison at all got help for issues, it would simplify things.  If we got all of these people out of prison and got them treatment, we could do what they do in Norway where, when somebody comes into prison, he or she is told they will be working with a specific person until he or she leaves prison.  The day ones go in, one is on a pathway to how one reconnects when one goes back out.  Unless we get there, the rates will be higher.  These are just a few observations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017030800002#D00800","speaker":"1259","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488963600,"counter":387,"content":"<p>Before I invite Mr. Donnellan back in, members' contributions must focus on specific questions because a group from the Probation Service will appear before the committee later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017030800002#E00200","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1488963600,"counter":388,"content":"<p>The training unit was state of the art 20 years ago, but it is no longer state of the art.

The training unit was in its heyday when Mountjoy was very poor in terms of accommodation and in-cell sanitation so we find it quite difficult to get people to go to the training unit because the conditions in Mountjoy or the Midlands Prison are far superior.  What we must do is move on and look at what accommodation we have and how we are going to re-purpose it.

It does not make our working environment better.  As Mr. Black and my other colleagues have already said, we are encouraging prisoners to avail of the therapeutic services in place such as those provided by Merchants Quay Ireland.  Methadone clinics also assist prisoners towards achieving their personal goal of giving up drugs.  It would therefore not be easier at all, to my mind.

He spoke of the continuation of supports when people are leaving prison.  That is critical.  Let us face reality: the vast majority of people who go into prison are there for a short period.  Let us suppose they go in with a substance misuse or addition problem and they start a detox programme.  It is critical that the programme is continued on the outside.<\/p> <p>  Many of the people I meet find it really difficult to continue the programme of detox and supports when they come out of prison.  I realise this is probably outside the remit of the Prison Service, because it relates to what happens back in the community, and I realise the Prison Service staff do the best they can to try to match up those services.  However, this needs to be worked on in a holistic fashion.  It cannot simply be left to the Prison Service to try to ensure the continuation of supports and services.

I have read the opening statement from Mr. Donnellan.  I congratulate Mr. Donnellan on his reappointment as director general of the Prison Service.  I believe it was a wise move because he has done an extraordinary job.  The resources of the Prison Service have been cut considerably in recent years.  Yet, what the service has achieved has been remarkable.  We have gone from 1,000 people to 50 people slopping out.  That is only one figure but it is remarkable.<\/p> <p>  The Prison Service officials can take it from the tone of this committee that we are very much in unison in terms of the work the Prison Service staff are doing, their attitudes and their approach.  We are very much of the view that when people go to prison, it should be for rehabilitation.  This view is not shared by the public, unfortunately, and that is the job we have to do.  A prisoner may be given a sentence for several years.  Society needs to embrace the fact that these individuals and citizens will be back out in the community.  We have a duty and responsibility to rehabilitate them.<\/p> <p>  I am one of the longest-serving members because I was on the last committee.  We visited Mountjoy Prison and Cork Prison, before the new prison building was constructed there.  It would not be a bad idea, Chairman, if we were to revisit Cork Prison to see what is happening in the new prison.  There is nothing better than being in a place to really get a flavour for what is happening.<\/p> <p>  The idea of prison as an absolute last resort is something we all support.  I am keen to offer whatever practical assistance those of us in the Oireachtas can give, outside of funding.  The fines legislation has certainly made a difference.  I note that Mr. Donnellan has indicated the Prison Service is already noticing the difference in this regard.  Are there other areas where we can assist?  Would other legislation assist in ensuring that those who should not be committed to prison can be dealt with in another way?<\/p> <p>  I agree with Deputy Clare Daly's suggestion that mental health training should be mandatory.  The committee should write to the Minister and look for additional funding to be made available to the Prison Service in order that it can provide mental health training to all staff.  It is a good thing that new prison officers will be recruited this year.  That is important.<\/p> <p>  My final question is important from our perspective.  I am not convinced that prison visiting committees serve any useful purpose.  I am keen to hear the view of Prison Service officials on how effective they are.

The 1907 Probation of Offenders Act is still very much the core legislation for what the Irish Probation Service does every day.  Probation, across the world, is based on the idea of offering offenders a second chance to make good for the harm they have caused, and specifically not to reoffend.  Probation also works on the basis of a classic carrot-and-stick approach, that is, offering help<i><\/i>to the offender to make positive changes in their life, but within specific boundaries<i><\/i>of supervision, surveillance and control.  While there is an undoubted need for custodial sanctions &ndash; prison &ndash; in penal systems, international research consistently shows that punitive responses to crime alone, such as imprisonment, are in themselves statistically not as successful in reducing reoffending as community-based sanctions such as probation, which are shown to be generally more effective in reducing the risk of reoffending.<br\/><br\/>The two primary areas of work undertaken by the Probation Service are offender assessment and offender supervision.  Most assessments are undertaken by probation officers at the request of the courts to assist in sentencing decisions and to identify what factors need to be addressed to reduce an individual's likelihood of reoffending.  Other individual offender assessments are undertaken by probation officers on behalf of the Parole Board and the Irish Prison Service, for example.<br\/><br\/>Offender supervision programmes come under two broad headings: probation-type supervision and community service.  Probation supervision includes a range of interventions undertaken with offenders, mainly in the community, aimed at helping them to reduce their risk of reoffending and make good the harm caused by their offending.  Specifically, these interventions, which are based on the probation officer's initial risk and needs assessment, enlist the co-operation of the offender and those around them, such as family and other positive supports, to address any dynamic - by which is meant open to possible change - issues or factors that may have contributed to their offending.  These factors can include anti-social attitudes, pro-criminal associates, substance misuse or addiction, homelessness, mental health issues, lack of positive role models, poor problem solving and self-management, and unemployment, among others.  What we term &quot;probation-type supervision&quot; also includes work with those in custody, helping them prepare for reintegration in the community, again with a focus on helping to reduce their risk of reoffending.  Community service is a direct alternative to prison, available to the courts for those 16 years of age and over who are guilty of an offence that would otherwise attract a custodial sentence and who can then be ordered to perform unpaid work in the community as an alternative sanction.<br\/><br\/>At the core of what probation staff do across all our programmes is to motivate offenders to change, help them increase both their ability to change, and facilitate improved opportunities for change.  Probation officers do this through the development of positive professional relationships, within clear role boundaries, and using skills and interventions based on those shown by research to be effective.  These, in turn, are founded on social work training and national and international standards of good practice, including for example the Council of Europe probation rules of 2010.<br\/><br\/>While those we work with are, in the main, those who have committed criminal offences, a central focus for probation work is the impact of offending on victims and the needs, rights and position of victims of crime.  Our work would be one dimensional if we focused only on the offender.  In doing what we do, we need to be conscious of, and seek to repair where possible, the broken relationship between offender, victim and the wider community.  We do this in a number of ways.  When preparing a pre-sanction assessment on an offender, we assess, as part of that, the impact on the victim or victims, the offender's understanding of that impact, and how we can help that offender to avoid creating more victims again in the future.  We also provide opportunities to offenders to make good the harm they have caused.  This includes performance of community service as well as a number of reparative and restorative interventions and programmes that we run, many in conjunction with partner agencies.<br\/><br\/>The Probation Service is an agency of the Department of Justice and Equality.  The organisation, which functions independently, in practical terms on a day-to-day basis is headed by a director who is also a member of the Department's management board and answerable to the Secretary General.  We have almost 400 staff based in offices throughout the country.  We have a presence in every county as well as in every custodial institution in the State.  Our annual budget is now &euro;46.3 million.  On any day, the Probation Service is assessing and supervising more than 8,500 offenders in the community as well as working in all 14 prisons and the children detention school.<\/p><p>Of the 8,500 people being managed in the community every day, around 2,200 are on community service and 3,500 are on probation supervision as direct sanctions from the courts.  Just over 1,300 of the 8,500 are women, 260 are under 18 years of age and more than 1,200 are on post-release supervision after serving a custodial sentence.  Every year, the Probation Service assesses and-or supervises around 15,000 offenders, mainly in the community.  Those referred to us have offended across the wide spectrum of crimes, from relatively minor to the most serious violent offences.<br\/><br\/>While all criminal justice agencies bring their own unique skills, roles and ways of working to how we respond collectively as a society to crime and offending, no single organisation or agency has all the answers.  Probation cannot do what the Prison Service does nor what An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na does, and <i>vice versa<\/i>.  Reducing offending is a societal problem and needs a whole-of-society response.  That co-ordinated response has to start with a whole of criminal justice system approach in the first place.  One key to the success of the work that the Probation Service does is the nature of our interagency and multidisciplinary approach to what we do, especially with our justice partners, namely, the Irish Prison Service, the Courts Service, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Irish Youth Justice Service and the Department of Justice and Equality.  The Probation Service is a community-facing organisation, and community-based organisations are a key group of partners for us in our work.  We channel &euro;15 million in funding from the Department of Justice and Equality every year to community and voluntary organisations that partner with us throughout the country in providing essential services to help in reducing offenders' risk of reoffending and facilitate their reintegration in their communities.  These organisations provide a diverse range of services, addressing offender needs in the fields of training, education and employment, accommodation, addiction treatment, resettlement and mentoring, among others.<br\/><br\/>In many jurisdictions, probation tends to be seen as either an alternative to imprisonment or as something for diverting those guilty of really minor offences, particularly first-time offenders, away from more serious sanctions.  While probation can and does usefully fulfil both of those functions, it is in fact most appropriate and most effective with those who present a medium to high risk of reoffending and who can safely be managed in the community.  Probation officers carry out their work with offenders broadly from the standpoint that the individual person has committed an offence and must be held accountable for the offending and take responsibility for his or her own rehabilitation.  In addition, we recognise that offending typically takes place in a wider family and social context, which must be taken into account in trying to help the offender turn his or her life around for the better.  We also recognise that change is usually difficult and that people are more likely to be successful in making and maintaining changes in their lives if they have the benefit of skilled professional help, which is what we provide.<br\/><br\/>While the full range of work that the Probation Service undertakes is important, I want to highlight some particular priority categories of offender with whom we have been undertaking specific initiatives.  First is prolific offenders.  Recognising that a significant percentage of certain offences, such as burglary, are committed by a small percentage of prolific offenders, the Probation Service, in partnership with the Prison Service, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Department of Justice and Equality, has established the joint agency response to crime, or JARC.  This programme, developed in four areas of Dublin since 2014, is being extended to a number of areas outside the capital and targets in a uniquely intensive, interagency approach those identified as being the most prolific offenders in their areas.  Burglary and violent crime have been the two primary offence categories targeted under JARC, with observable success.<br\/><br\/>Second is young people.  Recognising that the mid to late teens and early 20s are statistically the peak ages for offending by many individuals, the Probation Service has a dedicated division, young persons probation, that specialises in work with this age group, primarily those under 18 years, but extending the same focused and age-appropriate supervision to those up to 21 years of age.<br\/><br\/>Third is women.  Women are disproportionately represented in the criminal justice system and face unique issues in addressing and reducing their risk of reoffending.  For that reason, we have put in place a number of responses to take these issues into account.  These include, for example, gender-appropriate assessment and supervision, female-specific community service projects, peer mentoring, and accommodation programmes.<br\/><br\/>Fourth is sex offenders.  As well as working closely with our psychology service colleagues in the Irish Prison Service in delivering sex offender treatment programmes to those in custody, we also run, with a number of partner bodies, similar treatment programmes in the community as well as accommodation support initiatives and circles of support and accountability programmes.  Since 2010, the Probation Service, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Irish Prison Service, Tusla, the child and family agency, and local housing authorities have worked closely, through the sex offender risk assessment and management, SORAM, initiative to supervise and manage jointly the risk posed by sex offenders in the community.  This work is overseen nationally by a strategic co-located interagency team based in Harcourt Square.<br\/><br\/>In respect of post-release supervision, the Probation Service traditionally worked with those referred directly to us by the courts.  More recently, we have supervised an increasing number of people on post-release from custody under a number of legislative provisions.  Approximately 15% of all those we supervise in the community are now on some form of post-release programme.  These programmes, including community return and community support, have proven very successful and mean that virtually all those released from prison on temporary release now are on one or other form of structured post-release programme, involving some probation input.  Much of our work in relation to life sentence prisoners is undertaken under the umbrella of the parole board process.  As well as preparing assessment reports on life sentence prisoners for the parole board, probation officers work with such prisoners in addressing issues related to their offending and helping them prepare for release and resettlement.  The Probation Service, with the Irish Prison Service and the parole board, is developing a more co-ordinated interagency approach to the management of life sentence prisoners.<br\/><br\/>The Probation Service has developed a number of restorative justice programmes over the past 20 years or so.  Restorative justice services in Dublin and the restorative justice in the community programme, based in Tipperary and Cork, run community-based reparation panels where offenders have an opportunity to confront their offending and its impact on their victim or victims through discussion with panels of people representing community interests, including victims where appropriate, and to take specific actions to go some way towards making good the harm caused.  As part of our restorative justice strategy, the Probation Service now also offers a range of victim-offender mediation interventions, including in relatively serious cases.<br\/><br\/>How effective is probation?  This is a frequently asked and important question.  On the face of it, such effectiveness is something that can be measured quite easily in terms of the rate of reoffending by those who have been under probation supervision.  On that reoffending measure alone, probation is effective both here in Ireland and internationally.  For the past four years, in partnership with the Central Statistics Office, CSO, reoffending rates by all those who have been on probation orders and community service each year has been measured.  This is tracked over a three year follow-up period.  Findings, which are published by the CSO, show that six out of every ten probationers have no further convictions in the follow-up three year period.  This compares favourably with statistics for those who have been in prison and also with probation comparators internationally.  I appreciate there is no room for complacency and we are constantly reviewing our practice, based on statistical and other evidence, to improve our outcomes.<\/p><p> Effectiveness in probation needs to be measured on other scales apart from reoffending.  As well as probation&rsquo;s effectiveness in offender rehabilitation, some of those other effectiveness measures include: probation&rsquo;s relative cost-effectiveness as a sanction; promoting citizenship and social justice; its value as a proportionate and just sanction and as an alternative to custody; reducing the impact of imprisonment on prisoners&rsquo; children and families; as an aid to sentencing decisions; in resettling ex-prisoners; in building up communities; through the unpaid work undertaken in communities by those on community service; and by helping those who have offended to be reintegrated in their communities and to become positively contributing members of society.  In monetary terms alone, supervised community sanctions cost a fraction of custodial ones: &euro;1,500 for a community service order and &euro;5,000 for a probation supervision order.  The unpaid work done annually by people on community service, estimated with reference to the national minimum wage hourly rate of &euro;9.25, is the equivalent of a total of &euro;2.7 million worth of work done in local communities across Ireland every year.  It is valuable work which would not otherwise have been done.<\/p><p> Penal policy has been the subject of ongoing consideration for some time.  A previous Oireachtas justice committee reported in 2013 and made five recommendations, a number of which have been substantially achieved.  The report of the strategic review of penal policy was published by the Minister for Justice and Equality in September 2014.  This report contained 47 recommendations, across the penal policy field, half of which relate directly to the work of the Probation Service.  The Probation Service is fully committed to implementing penal policy, as set out in the programme for Government and the Department of Justice and Equality strategy.  We work closely with our partners to implement Government and departmental policy and, specifically, the actions in the 2014 strategic review of penal policy.  We report regularly to the relevant implementation oversight group, chaired by Dr. Mary Rogan.  Implementation reports are published on the Department of Justice and Equality website regularly.  In that regard, we are well on track towards implementation of the review&rsquo;s recommendations.  Much positive and productive change has been achieved in Ireland in recent years.  More remains to be done and that work programme is being advanced in a collaborative way across the justice agencies.<\/p><p> Probation work done well makes a difference and adds significant value to the criminal justice system as a whole and to making Ireland a safer and fairer place.  The Probation Service&rsquo;s unique role is in helping to create safer communities and fewer victims through offender rehabilitation.  Probation staff are in the business of hope, hope that is based in reality and evidence-informed practice.  In that way, we provide unique services, reducing reoffending and victimisation as part of a proportionate, just and effective response to crime, offending and offenders.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017030800002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Vivian Geiran","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488963600,"counter":422,"content":"<p>Before inviting members to offer their questions and observations, I remind people the recording staff are having difficulty with the sound quality as a result of telephonic matter that is not switched off.

It was really comprehensive.  We are getting a greater understanding of the number of different agencies and services that are there and integrating into each other in this area.  Community service is something we constantly put forward as a much better alternative to prison in terms of the damage done and the cost.  I note the points Mr. Geiran made about why the numbers might have decreased.  Is the option of community service available nationally?  Are there areas where the judges do not use it so the facility to take it up is not really there and there is difficulty in getting useful community labour or employment for the person?<\/p><p>Is it a seamless set-up in all areas where the services are there?  If a judge sentences somebody, is there a ready and useful project into which the person can be integrated?<\/p><p> The next question might make me sound really stupid.  With regard to the national spread of the 400 staff, does a probation officer require a social work background or are they people with good life experience?  Who would be a probation officer and what is that person's educational background or experience?  Are we dealing with young people or people from the communities?  Is it a mix?  It is a good number but I would say more are needed.  The issue in prisons is something I would like to explore a little.  The service has people in every prison but how many people are there and are they in the prison all the time?  If I am a probation officer in the D&oacute;chas Centre, is it my only job or am I only there for a couple of days?  It is my understanding that people want to access the Probation Service but they cannot necessarily do so.  Ideally, the first day somebody is in prison, he or she should be able to have access to a probation officer.  My understanding is people are often told by prison authorities that they are not long enough into a sentence and they do not need an officer.  Such prisoners should be worked with from very early.  Will the witnesses comment on that?<\/p><p> The next question relates to restorative justice.  How many people would have been put through those programmes?  I like the point made that we should not be waiting on legislation.  It is great that there have been some programmes but they are probably under-advertised.  Their success is probably not well known but all the studies show the really positive impact they have.  It is great to see them up and running so is there anything more we can do in that regard?<\/p><p> It is critical to work with people post-release and whereas they obviously need the greatest support if they have a drug problem, they also need employment and housing.  The Irish Prison Service has told us it has a protocol with the city and county managers with regard to housing.  Where are we in delivering employment opportunities?  Before the recruitment ban in the public service, we could have got a fellow into the council or as a porter in a hospital.  That has gone so we need an alternative public source of employment for people coming out.  Where are we with that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017030800002#L01400","speaker":"1259","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1488963600,"counter":436,"content":"<p>I will start with the community service projects and Ms Doyle can respond to the staffing issues.

The majority of probation officers, which form the bulk of our professionally trained staff, are qualified social workers with a recognised qualification in social work.  It is not a requirement to become a probation officer but we have been very successful in attracting people of that calibre and grade.  It is certainly a preference of ours and it is the direction in which we should go given what the director has indicated in terms of social work qualification, knowledge and skill base, as well as effectiveness in engaging with offenders and motivating change.<\/p> <p>  Like much of the public sector, our overall staffing numbers had decreased over the period 2008 to approximately 2015 or 2016, as Mr. Geiran has alluded to.  We are in the process of recruiting and in 2016 we were successful in running a permanent probation officer competition.  We are seeing the benefits of that now with an intake.  We have taken in an additional 20 probation officers since the end of last year, which is a very positive development.<\/p> <p>  In terms of service delivery and its implications, as we are a national service with a footprint in every county in the country, as there is ebb and flow in the rates of referral or the demands placed on us to respond,  we are in a position where we can do so by reassigning staff across the service.  That is facilitated through people with geographical transfers.  To answer another of the Deputy's questions, in the main most of our staff are based in the three urban hubs, as that is where the critical mass of the population tends to be.  That is in Dublin, Cork and Limerick.  That said, we have 40 staffed offices nationwide.  Our staff in prisons are assigned to a prison for the duration of an assignment and, for the most part, staff are based there on a full-time basis.

In Dublin and Cork, we have a graffiti removal project that we operate in tandem with local authorities, targeting different hot spots in order to clear the graffiti.  We are able to do that because we have mobile community service buses manned by community service supervisors with a team of individuals sentenced to complete community service.  It is not something we can do in every county in the country but we have a variety of ways of operating.  We have community service supervisors in every county and in some areas where we do not have community service projects based in schools, community centres or youth clubs, we have individual placements in host agencies where we have negotiated and agreed they would undertake supervision with support from ourselves and constant monitoring.

On any given day we would supervise approximately 80 life sentence prisoners in the community and we work with a couple of hundred others who are in custody.

It could range form a letter of apology to some reparative work such as painting and getting involved in a local community.  The other area in which we are involved is victim offender mediation, where a mediator would work with an offender and a victim, and it would all be about repairing the harm.  It must be voluntary.

An interdepartmental group was also established at the initiation of the Department of Justice and Equality at the most senior level, which invited all of the Departments and significant agencies to be represented.

We absolutely do not stipulate this at all.  We do not make the people working in the local community identifiable as having been convicted.  In some places, it appears as if the probation services get people to do the most menial and meaningless work.

We have a big problem in the State owing to the lack of apprenticeship schemes.  In the construction sector, for example, there used to be a great apprenticeship system years ago but it is now gone.  Has the Probation Service examined this area?  It can be difficult for somebody with no work culture or work experience to get work.  The apprenticeship scheme was good because an apprentice did not cost the employer too much.  The employer was not losing too much money on the apprentice.  It was a great opportunity for the individual to learn.  From where should the initiative come on apprenticeship schemes?  The State probably has a role to play.  That there are no apprenticeship schemes now is a big problem.  We should be considering reinstating them.

That is one initiative.  With the Irish Prison Service, we have a joint project established in which we have employed a national co-ordinator in the area of social enterprise to try to develop different types of employment opportunities for offenders, including self-employment and social enterprise.

I refer to the experience of having a working day, being trained, supervised and having a good relationship with the community service supervisors, who are critical to the work we do on pro-social modelling and giving a lead to the people they are working with, and to the sense of well-being participants get from giving back to communities.  We frequently find that when people have finished their sentence and paid their dues, they still want to stay on because it is a meaningful activity for them.<\/p><p> We also ask the training and employment officers to do a couple of sessions with every person on the system so that they have the opportunity to continue with the training employment officers who link with the Department of Social Protection to explore pathways into employment.
