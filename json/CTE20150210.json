We welcome the opportunity to brief the committee on this very topical subject.  Agriculture has always been a very important sector for our member banks and the banks have been very supportive of farmers during the years, through good and bad times such as the fodder crisis.  We are joined by representatives of AIB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank, each of whom will make a short opening statement on the topic.  We will focus particularly on what banks are doing to assist farmers in the dairy sector as the transition from milk quotas occurs, in terms of the capital expenditure they need to make and their working capital requirements, given the volatility of milk prices.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015021000002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Maurice Crowley"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1423576800,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members of the joint committee for giving AIB the time to provide the Oireachtas and the public with an update on the bank&rsquo;s strong, through-the-cycle support for the dairy sector, including finance for development and expansion and supporting farm cash flow through income downturns.  I am head of business banking with AIB and with me today are Dr. Anne Finnegan, head of our agri-sector division and Mr. Tadhg Buckley, senior agri-adviser with responsibility for south Munster.  I refer members to AIB's presentation which we submitted to the clerk to the committee in advance.<br\/><br\/>AIB has a long association with the agrifood sector.  The bank is the main lender to farmers and accounts for 40% of total Irish farm lending.  Our market strength in the sector is the result of a strong relationship with farmers extending back many decades and cemented with the establishment of AIB's agri-adviser team in the early 1970s.  We have kept our agri-adviser team in place since that time and throughout a period when so many regarded agriculture as a sunset industry.  As a core part of our SME business strategy, today we have an agri-sector team comprising 16 dedicated agricultural science graduates, all regionally based.  The team provides significant training for our front-line staff ensuring they are equipped to support farmers throughout the cycle.  It has worked closely with all customer-facing staff to support farmers through various cycles and crises, including the dairy sector downturn in 2009, the weather and fodder crises of 2012 and 2013 and various downturns in the pig sector.<br\/><br\/>In recent years we have seen strong growth in farm investment, driven primarily by the dairy sector, in land, farm buildings, machinery, equipment and stock.  Our recent agri-financial services survey, completed in January this year by Ipsos MRBI, indicates that half of dairy farmers have plans to invest in the coming three years.  Our analysis of the market predictions from all of the main forecasting agencies indicates that the medium-term outlook for global dairy remains positive.  On this basis, AIB maintains a strong, positive long-term outlook for the dairy sector, in which we are very comfortable to support investment.  Our experience of the sector has been positive, with dairying experiencing substantially lower levels of credit difficulties than other SME sectors.<br\/><br\/>While the outlook is for generally strong dairy prices, volatility will remain a key feature of the sector, aligned with changes in input prices, output prices and weather or a combination of any of these three factors.  Our dairy sector outlook report shows 30% of dairy farmers perceived milk price volatility as a key challenge in the next five years.  We have written extensively in our quarterly farming newsletter, <i>Agri Matters<\/i>, about managing farm cashflow through the cycle and planning for income volatility.  We have also contributed to many external publications on the same theme.<br\/><br\/>In the past three months we have held seven large regional farmer meetings to discuss the prospects for the farming sector.  Approximately 2,400 farmers have turned out at these events.  There is a full list of the meetings in the presentation, including some which are taking place this week and next week.  AIB has always advocated that the opportunity to expand dairy output should be considered by farmers only after they have achieved an efficient cost base.  Our core message at the meetings was and is &quot;better before bigger&quot;.  While we know that all farmers are vulnerable to income volatility, an efficient and lower cost base producer is better positioned to withstand a period of reduced income.  This is illustrated on slide No. 6 of our presentation.  At AIB we consider volatility to be the new norm.  For farmers, managing farm cashflow is now key and requires a planned approach to allow the business withstand both the peaks and troughs of the cycle.<br\/><br\/>When it comes to lending, we must, from day one, factor in the reality that not every year will be a great one.  The average milk price for 2014 is estimated at 38 cent per litre, the second highest annual milk price ever paid to farmers.  The average 2015 milk price is forecast to be 26 to 28 cent per litre.  AIB takes a through-the-cycle view of milk prices, factoring in periods of low and high milk price.  We recognise that, in reality, some years a farm will generate a cash surplus and in others a cash deficit that must be managed.  Milk price is only one component of income; we also take account of cost of production which varies significantly among farmers.<br\/><br\/>It is useful to look at farming sectors that have been dealing with volatility for many years.  AIB has a lot of experience of banking the pig farming sector which has long been exposed to the vagaries of the world market, receives no market support and experiences a high level of income volatility which has been exacerbated in recent years by feed price fluctuations.  Pig farmers have responded to this volatility by improving production efficiencies on an ongoing basis; managing their cost base, particularly feed costs; undertaking strong financial management, including cashflow budgeting; and building a buffer cash fund in good years to support the business in lean years.  In our presentation members will see that there is scope to improve efficiency in all livestock sectors.  AIB plays a key role in supporting pig farms through tough periods, knowing that the cycle will turn.  We take a strategic view of long-term challenges in the sector and continue to do the same in the dairy sector.<\/p><p>The current downturn in global milk prices comes after five years of strong milk prices by historical standards and may give rise to cashflow pressure for some dairy farmers in the months ahead.  Analysis of AIB&rsquo;s dairy farmer customer base indicates that the sector is well positioned, with strong cash balances, available overdraft limits and an overall strong credit performance relative to other SME sectors.  This is in marked difference to 2009. <\/p><p> As in 2009 and 2012-13, AIB will this year work with affected dairy farmers to support them through the current income downturn.  In 2009, when milk prices averaged 23 cent per litre, we worked with farmers on an individual basis to find an appropriate solution to their cashflow problems.  We are well on our way, through a programme of proactive engagement with the sector, to encourage dairy farmers to make early contact with their bank.  We are asking affected customers to estimate, as best they can, the likely deficit in their 2015 annual cashflow.  Experience has shown us that there is no one universal solution at a time like this.  Instead, there are a number of support measures available which we can tailor, depending on the individual circumstances.<\/p><p> Our support package for dairy farmers can include the following: a review of monthly repayment commitments; short-term increases to working capital facilities; short-term loan facilities; and an interest-only period for existing borrowings.  We will utilise our existing core lending products to support the sector at this time, including our farmer credit line which has the lowest cost of any working capital product in the farmer market, at 4.2% variable.  This is extremely competitive relative to the cost of merchant credit.  We are very conscious of the significant opportunity expansion of milk output offers to farmers, the dairy industry and the economy, but we are also aware of the heightened short-term volatility that must be managed.  As the leading bank to the dairy sector, we recognise the key role we play not only in supporting the development of the sector but also supporting it through the fullness of the cycle.<\/p><p>In summary, on behalf of AIB, I express thanks to the committee for inviting us.  We very much appreciate the opportunity to discuss what is one of our most important SME sectors.  We look forward to receiving questions from committee members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015021000002#C00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ken Burke","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1423576800,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and committee members for the invitation to address the joint committee.  I am the senior agricultural manager in Ulster Bank.  I am joined by my colleague, Mr. Nigel Walsh, head of sectors and specialist business.  I have worked in Ulster Bank for over ten years, in the agriculture sector, and have a PhD in farm financial management which I completed under the guidance of Teagasc in the school of agriculture in UCD.  I also farm actively in the Carlow area.<\/p> <p>  At Ulster Bank we believe the imminent removal of dairy quotas represents a major and long-term opportunity for efficiently managed grass based family dairy farms.  However, we also realise that dairy market returns and, by extension, farm gate milk prices have become more volatile in recent years.  The Ulster Bank strategy for the dairy sector is reflective of these issues.  Ulster Bank is lending to the farming sector and provides support for its customers in periods of volatility.  It provides banking services for one in every five farmers and approximately 25% of young trained farmers.  We have a team of 30 agri-specialists, based in agriculture communities and the Ulster Bank credit department.  These specialists are supported by our central agri-team which consists of Dr. Anne-Marie Butler and me.<\/p> <p>  In 2014 we launched our inaugural advance agri-accreditation course, which is accredited by the chartered banker programme and was developed by Dr. Anne-Marie Butler, previously a lecturer in the school of agriculture in UCD.  This advanced agri-accreditation course supplements our annual agri-training courses which are completed by approximately 150 of our colleagues each year.  Our accredited agri-specialists typically come from farming backgrounds and have completed various agri-qualifications.  They have the necessary expertise and insight to support farmers in their day-to-day financial affairs.  Also, our agricultural managers are available to meet farmers on their farms at times that suit our customers.<\/p> <p>  Ulster Bank has a range of products tailored specifically to the needs of farmers.  For example, in October 2013 we launched the Ulster Bank dairy expansion loan to support the growth plans of dairy farmers.  This loan provides an interest only option of 24 months to cover the natural timelag between on-farm investment and the generation of additional cashflow.  We also have a competitive offering for young trained farmers which provides unsecured loans of up to &euro;30,000.  Also, this year we launched the Ulster Bank pasture loan.  We believe the profitability of farms is intrinsically linked with the production and utilisation of grazed grass.  Therefore, this pasture loan can be used by farmers to invest in soil fertility and reseeding activities and providing paddocks and waterways on farms.<\/p> <p>  Ulster Bank has extensive two-way engagement with all key stakeholders and influencers in the agri-sector, including dairy processors, farm organisations, advisory bodies and farm consultants.  The bank also participated in the Department's and Bord Bia's trade missions to China in 2012 and 2014.  <\/p> <p>  I highlight an event organised by Ulster Bank in 2014 to support the growth plans of dairy farmers, an event which focused, in particular, on the young farmer sector.  We held a young farmer seminar, to which we invited 50 young farmers who were considering entering the dairying sector.  We had a panel discussion with a number of experienced dairy farmers who had had expanded their businesses in the previous ten years.  The panel also consisted of a number of pig farmers with experience of working in a volatile business.  We used this discussion to highlight for young farmers the challenges and risks they might encounter if they started or expanded in the dairy farming sector.  We also used the opportunity to educate young farmers on the importance of embedding financial management techniques in their businesses.<\/p> <p>  As we work hand in hand with our dairy farming customers and the wider industry, we realised in 2014 that dairy farmers might face some financial challenges in 2015, owing to a low milk price, perhaps a superlevy fine and possibly a large tax bill.  All of these issues arise at a time of expansion on farms.  Therefore, we have taken a proactive approach to providing support for our dairy farmer customers in 2015 and developed the Ulster Bank dairy farmer tool kit.  This tool kit will provide solutions for farmers on a case by case basis and can include options such as increased working capital facilities, a capital repayment holiday or an interest only option, or a combination of both, depending on individual circumstances.  However, to avail of any of these options, we strongly encourage farmers to complete a capital budget and know their cost of production.<\/p> <p>  I thank the Chairman and committee members for affording me the opportunity to address the committee.  My colleague and I will be happy to address questions members may have for us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015021000002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ailish Byrne"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1423576800,"counter":11,"content":"<p>On my own behalf and that of Mr. Sean Farrell, our chief agricultural adviser, I thank the Chairman and committee members for affording us the opportunity to engage with them.  In Bank of Ireland we are acutely conscious of the opportunity for the economy in the dairy and agri-markets, but we are equally conscious of the role we play in supporting that economy.  We are keen to ensure that, as a bank, we are adequately resourced to fulfil our mandate and help that economy to expand.  To that end, we have completed extensive research on our own behalf and in conjunction with Teagasc to try to understand the needs and demands of the market, particularly in the dairy sector as we look towards the abolition of milk quotas.  We are acutely aware of the risks and challenges this new free market poses and have looked to ensure we have the products and capability that will safeguard and protect farmers and their investment as they move into this uncertain environment.  My colleague, Mr. Farrell, will talk at some length about that issue.<\/p> <p>  Bank of Ireland is the number one business bank, with more than a 50% share of non-property lending in the agri-market, while agriculture is the largest stand-alone sector for the bank in its business banking portfolio.  Agriculture accounts for over 10% of the exposure in the business banking market.  Last year alone, over 23% of our new lending in business banking was to the agriculture sector, which gives some indication of the important role the sector plays in the bank's portfolio and the necessity for us to ensure we have the appropriate products and safeguards for our customers.  I now ask Mr. Farrell to take the committee through some of the issues involved in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015021000002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Cunningham"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1423576800,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I wish to pick up on the points introduced by Mr. Cunningham.  Bank of Ireland approved &euro;620 million for the sector last year, which represented an increase of 19% on the previous year.  During that time approval rates within the bank continued to rise and the bank is currently approving 94% of agri-credit applications presented to us.<\/p> <p>  The importance of agriculture to Bank of Ireland is particularly evident in the branches located in smaller towns which rely most heavily on the agricultural economy.  Within those branches agricultural-related lending typically represents more than 60% of all the business lending.<\/p> <p>  Looking towards the marketplace, land purchase, farm development and annual seasonal loan requirements are the areas where our customers are typically looking for financial support at this time.  We have seen an increase in farm building and farm development requests from the dairy sector over the past 12 months.  We anticipate this trend will continue in line with milk quota abolition later this year.<\/p> <p>  As Mr. Cunningham outlined, Bank of Ireland recently partnered with Teagasc to sponsor a research report which identified a dairy sector investment requirement of &euro;1.5 billion to achieve Food Harvest 2020 targets.  Aligned to this research that we funded with Teagasc, Bank of Ireland anticipates significant investment in the dairy sector post milk quota abolition.  To this end we have put in place a &euro;1 billion investment fund to support dairy expansion at farm level.<\/p> <p>  Based on the analysis of the research, Irish dairy farmers have low debt levels relative to our European counterparts and have lower average costs of production, which in our view position the sector very well to increase output and to compete on the international export market.  For example, average debt levels on all farms holding debt in Ireland are approximately &euro;24,000; on all dairy farms &euro;62,000; and on those dairy farms with borrowings &euro;94,000.  Those figures are significantly lower than our European counterparts.<\/p> <p>  On volatility management, our view is that the outlook for agricultural commodities is positive and that prices will continue to increase over the next five to ten years, but that this increase will not be linear, and there will be peaks and troughs as was experienced between 2009 and 2014.  Bank of Ireland has developed a suite of products, marketed as AgriFlex, which takes this volatility into consideration and allows customer to revert to interest-only repayments on their borrowings with Bank of Ireland during a time of reduced incomes.<\/p> <p>  On 2015 and the potential impact of reduced milk prices, to date there have been few enough requests over and above what we would normally receive from additional customers.  The requests received to date have not typically been milk price-related but are more as a result of super levy issues.  However, we anticipate that requests for cash-flow support will grow as the year progresses and we have plans in place to meet these requests.<\/p> <p>  Our farmer overdraft utilisation levels remain very low with 2014 having been a very strong year in this regard.  Similar to how we supported our farming customers in 2009 and previously when farm-gate prices fell significantly, we will support them as necessary and AgriFlex is just one of the ways we can offer this support.<\/p> <p>  I trust this gives an overview of our current activity, future plans and our ability to support our customers through commodity price volatility.  I look forward to answering any queries members of the committee may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015021000002#E00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sean Farrell"},{"type":"speech","time":1423576800,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank the witness.

There are many sweet sounding words.  If I was a farmer listening to the witnesses today, I would not have any worries, but I know the reality of life on the ground is different.  I was an agricultural consultant for many years and I heard this previously.  I negotiated some significant loans and indeed some write-downs eventually on behalf of farmers in the 1980s.  I am glad to hear about the suite of products.  All the banks have strongly resourced agricultural consultancy or advisory functions, on which I salute them.  We do not want to have a conflation because lending to agriculture is totally different from lending to other businesses.<\/p> <p>  Does each of the banks tailor a suite of products to be pitched at the individual farmer as opposed to a generic group of farmers?  In the dairy sector as elsewhere, no two farmers are the same, just as the outcome of two accidents are never the same notwithstanding that people might say they had the same injury and attended the same doctor.  That is not life.  Any two farmers will have different skills, different technical abilities and different inputs.  Is that where the banks are working in terms of it?<\/p> <p>  We are all aware of the volatility and the reduction in the price per litre of milk from 34 cent to 27 or 28 cent, or maybe even further down.  We all know the Fonterra price of 20 cent a litre.  We have done a lot of work through the Chairman and our colleagues, and we have listened to that.  Have the banks looked at the likely outcomes for the world prices over the next 12 to 18 months?  Farmers now have the freedom to produce, which is great.<\/p> <p>  The AIB presentation used a very wise phrase, \"better before bigger\".  I am convinced of that.  I have consistently sent the warning from this committee that I am scared of everybody heading to the hills and expanding like nobody's business.  It has to be very rational, particularly for those getting into it anew.  Whoever coined that phrase has his or her finger on the pulse.<\/p> <p>  Farmers will be faced with the super levy of &euro;50 million, &euro;60 million or &euro;70 million.  We would all like to magic that away but it will not happen.  That is their problem going back to the mid-2000s.  We have to deal with reality, whether it will be applied to individual farms or at a sectoral level.  How will the banks deal with that?<\/p> <p>  There is always an investment cycle in terms of normal investment.  Do the banks have something for that?  Do the banks have products or options for people?  For example, in 2014 there was a significant output.  Unless the income-averaging principles apply, that is likely to lead to a significant tax bill for farmers.  So there could be a confluence of factors that could eat up farmers' incomes and leave them with virtually nothing on which to live.  The superlevy bill will need to be faced over the coming months or years.  There is a likely price drop, a tax bill and then normal investment.  Is there a suite of products to suit each of those in the aggregate?<\/p> <p>  Have any of the banks carried out an analysis of the investment likely to be required to achieve the 2020 targets?  That is over the next five years so the banks should be on the ball on that.  Mr. Farrell referred to the troughs and peaks and the need to look at it in the round.  Have the banks prepared investment strategies given the likely level of investment farmers would have to make to achieve the 2020 targets, assuming all the other factors are built in at a discounted level to achieve that?<\/p> <p>  It is interesting.  We would be delighted to get any written submissions the banks might have.  Having written submissions is always very useful because we do not just ditch them; we actually review them later on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015021000002#E00300","speaker":"1063"},{"type":"speech","time":1423576800,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I thank the representatives of the three banks for their presentations.  One cannot stress enough the contribution the agricultural sector makes to recovery, hopefully, of the rural economy.<\/p> <p>  As Deputy Penrose said, there are many issues facing farmers in the medium and long term.<\/p><p>From the presentations, the witnesses seem to be preparing for that.  Rather than just focusing on short term, they are considering the situation down the road.  For those from a farming background, volatility includes price and weather.  Where people are depending on harvest or silage for the summertime, they always look at the weather to see whether they have adequate feeding for stock for the winter.<\/p><p> The major opportunity is the dairy sector.  This also comes with a warning because there is a suggestion that the price could drop as low as 28 cent per litre from 37 cent per litre, which is the second highest price ever paid for milk in this country.  In farming, everything recovers although it may take time.  Things turn around after a couple of bad years and the same thing will apply to the dairy sector.  I am not so pessimistic to think that it will drop as low as 28 cent per litre but I think the price per litre will drop to the low to mid 30s.<\/p><p> Have the witnesses considered the age profile of the people they are lending to?  The presentations suggest a huge percentage of the farming community is over 65 years of age.  In lending, that comes into the equation irrespective of the asset involved.  What is needed are unsecured loans up to &euro;30,000 for young farmers getting into the industry.  With regard to renting land with long-term leases, are capital investment or stocking density part of the lending opportunities for younger people?<\/p><p> With regard to training courses, the AIB representatives referred to 2,400 farmers turning up to these events at regional farming meetings.  This is an educational process for young farmers coming into the industry.  Was there a greater demand and did more people want to attend these courses?<\/p><p> The witnesses mentioned reviewing monthly payment commitments, short-term increases in working capital, short-term loan facilities and an interest-only period on existing borrowings.  The superlevy will be an immediate problem in the dairy sector and finance must be made available to farmers to meet that demand.  There may be lending to farmers who are paying off because of overproduction.  The AIB variable rate is 4.2%.  Is there a possibility of freezing the rate for the short period over which the superlevy will be paid back?  Is that not in the interest of the development of farming when farmers will be borrowing and paying back for asset development?  It would be a big investment from dairy farmers to capitalise on the opportunities with the quota gone.  Can they have a commitment on the superlevy?  Can it be frozen and set aside until things turn?<\/p><p> Banks can be very secure because farmers probably have the best record on lending.  Investment in the agricultural and farming sectors has the most potential for rural communities.  Anything that inhibits growth will create problems nationally.  I hope the banks will look at that in a positive way.  It is also good publicity for the banks, coming on the back of bad publicity, and something that will encourage people and put a human face on the situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015021000002#E00400","speaker":"1047","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423576800,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  It is good to see good news coming through.  Hopefully, it will be delivered on the ground.  The question we are often asked was whether the banks were open for business.  This particularly applied to land purchases.  We often get comments from farmers who have long-standing relationships with banks that they are still put through strict procedures when they apply for loans.  Perhaps it is no harm as it may have been too relaxed at some stages.<\/p> <p>  My question for Ulster Bank concerns the closure of some of their branches in smaller towns, which affects some of the areas I come from.  Some small farmers dealing with Ulster Bank may not move to the branch in the nearest town.  It may be 15 miles away and I see this as being a negative point for Ulster Bank.<\/p> <p>  Recovery always happens after two or three bad years and this is happening now in the beef sector after one bad year.

At the moment, we have land being leased with taxation incentives for the person letting the land.  That is right the right approach but most of the advantage is being given away by paying over &euro;300 per acre for ten or 12 years.  There is a drag to get the land.  Do the witnesses know about the merchant credit available?  Do the banks have a tie-in with larger farm businesses?  There could be a false level of credit because of that.<\/p> <p>  The witnesses mentioned dairy farms, and it seems to be all about dairy farms, but I ask them to keep in the back of their heads that there are also tillage farmers and beef farmers.  Will beef farmers in some of the dairy areas be cannibalised?  There will be competition for land.<\/p> <p>  What are the views of the witnesses on retirement?  As a farmer hits 45 years, his or her borrowing potential is considerably reduced because the repayment term must shorten.  It is a lot to ask for health and wealth for 20 years when someone is 50 years of age.  Are the banks actively discussing their retirement plans and transfer costs, which will be considerable?<\/p><p> One thing I am worried about is the 90% stipulation.  It is based on &euro;3 million.  Do the witnesses think &euro;3 million is enough?  What figure would they suggest?  Many people have very valuable herds and equipment and milking products that cost huge sums of money.  <\/p><p> What are the witnesses' views on forward selling?  In the grain industry, we forward sell all the time.  Last year was quite a good year if one had forward sold last March.  The prices for wheat and barley were sound.  <\/p><p> Are the witnesses encouraging diversification?  Are they looking at the business plan and encouraging whatever potential for diversification exists within farms?  In the last budget, income averaging was brought across for five years but it also includes off-farm income which is quite important because any diversification that can happen profitably on a farm will also bolster this peak and trough, which is very important.  <\/p><p> Mr. Farrell mentioned an increase in lending of 19% and that 94% of those were approved.  This goes for all the banks.  Does that include people moving from being a sole trader to being a limited company, which is a very simple way to go because the operator is already with a bank but under a different name?  In those circumstances, what would be the average increase in interest rates when one is switching one farmer over?  <\/p><p> To conclude, the witnesses should be aware of the existence of tillage and beef farmers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015021000002#F00300","speaker":"980","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423576800,"counter":20,"content":"<p>That is Deputy Barry's sign-off plug for the non-dairy sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015021000002#G00200","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speech","time":1423576800,"counter":21,"content":"<p>It is hard to mention it as it is getting a bit lonely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015021000002#G00300","speaker":"980"},{"type":"speech","time":1423576800,"counter":22,"content":"<p>We have a list of questions and comments.

I have a brief question that has possibly already been dealt with.  I could not be here for the presentations earlier.  I thank the witnesses for being here.  It is very important and sends a very strong message of support to the agri-food sector for which the witnesses are to be complimented.  As Deputy Barry said, the banks do not always come in for praise so looking at the presentations, particularly that of AIB, I can see that they have taken a very professional view.  There is a great deal of uncertainty as to what is going to happen once the milk quotas come up.  An issue that arose during a recent meeting with our colleagues from the agriculture committee in Northern Ireland was the fact that there was a lot of investment in the dairy sector which went somewhat awry.  It did not always work out.<\/p> <p>  I know the term \"better rather than bigger\" was used earlier.  While I appreciate that the market has changed considerably and banking procedures and lending practices have changed, all for the better, are the witnesses concerned that because it is such a volatile sector - the witnesses drew parallels with the pig industry which went through a period of volatility - some farmers might be biting off more than they can chew?  Have the banks put in place proper procedures in case investment proposals which may look good on paper and where all the research has been done do not work out?  I am sure the banks do not just give money away willy-nilly but a concern was raised in Northern Ireland that some farmers found themselves at the wrong end of a financial investment because of this volatility.  It seems that in agriculture generally, there are certain flavours of the month.  For a while, it was sheep.  Everybody was into sheep because of the premiums coming from Europe and then that fell through.  After that, it was pigs which also did not happen.  Given the banks' vast expertise and the structures they put in place with its agriculture graduates around the country, are they satisfied they can handle the demand that will inevitably come once the quotas are lifted and in a manner that will ensure we will not see farmers who have over-extended themselves and are in very serious financial difficulties in another two or three years time?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015021000002#G00500","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1423576800,"counter":24,"content":"<p>The witnesses have two definitions of people who are farming - people who own land and people who operate land.  The cohort that own it are generally older on average.  A higher proportion of the people who are now operating the land - there has been emphasis on young farmers - will not own it.  There is a land mobility effort.  We have had the agri-taxation review.  It relates to share farming and people being able to undertake capital investment other than just stock investment into properties they may never own but they nevertheless get their value out of it through some arrangement.  Somebody mentioned unsecured loans of up to &euro;30,000.  In reality, that will not do very much except for working capital.  It will not be investment capital.<\/p><p>Some of the rural development programme options, particularly with regard to the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme measures and farm safety, are not mandatory or essential but are very important.  Are the banks prepared to look at that as an investment that does not yield a return <i>per se<\/i>except the safety and well-being of those to whom the banks are lending?  This needs to be focused on.<\/p><p>We have had presentations from the Irish Dairy Board, Bord Bia, the Irish Co-operative Organisation Society and Positive Farmers, the latter body being led by Mr. Michael Murphy who I am sure the witnesses are aware of.  He farms extensively and not just in Ireland.  He drew a comparison with New Zealand.  Ms Byrne mentioned agri-specialists and agri-managers.  Somebody who is in trouble can expect up to 20 contacts per year with their contact person in the bank.  Are the banks geared towards working with people in financial difficulties due to the front-loading of investment in the face of possibly two years of challenging market conditions, where prices will be very difficult and where things will probably go backwards as opposed to eating into their financial obligations or indebtedness?<\/p><p>The ratios of available specialists to those to whom the banks are lending are very important.  If we drew the comparison with what happened in the building sector, there were too many people given extensive facilities without any experts in the field lending to them who understood the complexities of the market.

We have been working with our farming customers and through the seminars for over a year now to get the \"better before bigger\" message out there.  A number of analogies were drawn around other markets such as New Zealand and Northern Ireland.  As part of those seminars, we have done case studies of the Republic of Ireland versus Northern Ireland and the investment that took place in Northern Ireland in terms of growth in milk output because it was not constrained by milk quotas to the same extent as the Irish market.  We also drew analogies showing that the actual net margins in the Republic of Ireland with the net margins being achieved in Northern Ireland.<\/p><p>My colleague Mr. Tadhg Buckley travelled to New Zealand to observe some of the experience in that market.  There were key things to be learnt in terms of the way the market expanded, the level of debt taken on per farmer, the level of interest only and inter-generational borrowings that occurred.  We have been putting the message across that it is a case of \"better before bigger\".<\/p><p> Senator Mooney asked if we were constrained in the number of people who could attend conferences and seminars.  It is a consistent part of what we do, we will be in Enniscorthy tomorrow night and Cootehill next week.  We were in Limerick last week.  We meet the demand for the seminars, where we take those learnings and share them.  There is great debate and discussion at the seminars which is not necessarily limited to the bank support; it is more a case of sharing the learnings from the experiences of other jurisdictions and economies.<\/p><p> We were asked if there were suites of products available to match individual needs.  We take a tailored approach.  To deal with super levy bill or large tax bills, we have a product called prompt pay where the bill is paid up front and paid over a period of time.<\/p><p> We were asked if we were prepared to offer interest-only repayments or to park levels of debt.  Some of the new money we are lending is interest only repayment from the outset, acknowledging that 2015 will bring challenges but when we take it through the cycle price we know it is an enterprise that we wish to back.<\/p><p> On unsecured loans for farmers up to &euro;30,000, the typical dairy farmer borrows less than &euro;100,000, it is closer to &euro;75,000 to &euro;78,000.  The question of collateral comes down the line, behind the capability and the experience of the promoter, the veracity of the business plan that is put forward, the prospects and the outlook for the sector.  The decision on collateral comes after other considerations.  We are not prescriptive in terms of taking collateral at a certain given level.  Each enterprise is looked at on its own.  Do we lend up to &euro;100,000 unsecured?  Yes, if the business justifies it, if the farm enterprise and the blend between the level of investment by the promoter and the amount of debt that is being sought justifies it.<\/p><p> We can speak on the experience in Northern Ireland if that helps to flesh out the example.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015021000002#G00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ken Burke","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1423576800,"counter":29,"content":"<p>I will talk about the experience in Northern Ireland, as we were keen in our seminars to share that experience and have farmers learn from it.  Since Northern Ireland no longer has quota constraints, milk output has effectively increased by just under 40% but dairy cow numbers remain static.  What actually happened was that yield went up by 2,000 litres per cow.  They have increased significantly their milk output but effectively this has had no effect on their net margins.  Teagasc has a dairy profit monitor.  If one looks at their average net margin, it is lower than what we are achieving in the South.  The removal of milk quotas gives a massive positive opportunity for the sector but it is important that we do not look at expansion just for the sake of it and that it is done efficiently.  We have done analysis on the reports from the Teagasc dairy profit monitor and provided it to farmers.  Between the top 10% and the bottom 10% of the dairy profit monitor in 2014 and taking an average farm of 70 cows, the difference in net margin was &euro;66,000.  This is a frightening gap.  The figure in 2013 was &euro;61,500.  The figure is consistent.  If one looks at the figures for 2009, it was about &euro;40,000 when we had a very difficult milk price.<\/p> <p>  If one is looking at volatility, there is a lot that we can do as banks to help farmers get through volatility.  The best way to deal with volatility in farming is to try to make oneself as efficient and lean as possible.  That is what we have tried to get through to our farmers in advance of the removal of quotas.  While we acknowledge it is a great opportunity, we need to do it properly.  When we are lending to the sector for expansion we are aware that it presents a great opportunity but we must ensure it is done in an efficient way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015021000002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tadhg Buckley"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1423576800,"counter":30,"content":"<p>With the permission of the Chair, I will close with two other points.  I have statistics that show some positivity around the ability of the dairy farmer to weather what might be coming in 2015.  I have the Central Bank figures for 2009 of the total outstanding balances to Irish agriculture, which was &euro;5.5 billion.  In the most recent figures from the Central Bank, the total outstanding balances to Irish agriculture is &euro;3.4 billion.  The level of farm debt has reduced quite considerably post farm waste management investment.  I have statistics on working capital, which will be particularly relevant in terms of managing milk price volatility.  We are seeing credit balances in farmer's current account up 27% year on year.  For every euro that a dairy farmer has borrowed from AIB, there is &euro;3 held in credit funds with AIB.  Over that utilisation rates have been dropping, in particular during the past 12 months.  If a farmer has an overdraft limit of &euro;50,000, 38% was the average overdraft utilisation in the past 12 months.  It has dropped back to 33%.  There is headroom there and capacity in terms of being able to weather it.  <\/p> <p>  My colleague, Dr. Anne Finnegan might cover the question on the investment cycle and outcomes over the next 12 to 18 months and the investment required. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015021000002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ken Burke"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1423576800,"counter":31,"content":"<p>I will address Deputy Penrose's questions.  At the end of 2014 we conducted a study that was as comprehensive as we could at the time, of the outlook for the dairy sector for the year ahead.  We engaged with representatives from the Irish Dairy Board, individual processors, farming organisations to get their views of the dairy commodity markets in the year ahead.  At that point we took the view that milk price would fall - and this is widely accepted - on average by 26 cent to 28 cent a litre.  There has been some firming in the markets in recent weeks.  We keep that under constant review but we are aware of issues that may materialise on farms.  We stress-test farm cashflow in order to support farmer at those levels.  I respect the comment that not all farms will be impacted equally and everybody's circumstance will be different.  Certainly our own experience from last year would be that on some farms there has been considerable investment from farm cashflow last year.  Some farmers forward purchased inputs at the back end of the year.  Some people will have a significant tax bill and superlevy bill, as was pointed out.  We will consider all the factors when we are working with people on an individual basis, looking at the factors of their individual circumstances and the right support for their situation.  For some, it may be something in the short term to get them through a six month period where cashflow is tight, for others it may mean something more long term, such as refinancing some of the capital investment they did from their cashflow in the previous year.  There is a range of options we can work on.<\/p> <p>  We have to watch how this year pans out, but not everybody will be impacted to the same degree.  There are dairy farmers who have plans to invest and will continue to invest as the year goes on.  We will be supporting them.  We take a very long-term view of short-term problems.  Farming by its nature is a cyclical business but the volatility we are seeing means that we will be lending to those farmers who have capital investment plans.  We will be taking a long-term view and a long-term average budget price of what we think milk will cost in the next ten to 15 years.  We will support them on that basis.  While they may need some short-term support from us we do not see that as an inhibitor to supporting the investment in the sector in the year ahead or in the years after that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015021000002#H00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Anne Finnegan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1423576800,"counter":32,"content":"<p>Chairman, may Ulster Bank comment on some of the next set of questions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015021000002#H00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Maurice Crowley"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1423576800,"counter":33,"content":"<p>I will address some of the issues raised by Deputy Penrose.

Each loan is individual to each farmer, no two cases are the same.  Changes to commodity prices; dairy, grain or beef income, is one part of an overall cashflow cycle for farms.  Bank of Ireland takes all income and expenditure into consideration.  Most farms have some source of off-farm income - the single farm payment was mentioned earlier - and all factors are considered when applying a loan solution.  The Deputy asked about estimates for investment requirements.  We partnered with Teagasc on its investment needs report.  It highlights that &euro;1.5 billion will be needed by the dairy sector to achieve Food Harvest 2020 targets.  Bank of Ireland has a &euro;1 billion investment fund specifically to meet this need.  <\/p> <p>  On merchant credit, if farmers do not wish to avail of this credit and essentially become cash purchases, there are seasonal and stocking loans available as part of our overall suite of products for cash purchases or working capital.

The banks and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine are acutely conscious of the age profile of the industry.  Schemes to help with land transfer and young farmers' entrance to the market, on an unsecured basis or in additional schemes, are being looked at.  There are two cashflow issues affecting farmers, namely the tax payments this year and the superlevy issue.  We are conscious of the need to be able to reschedule debt where that is required but the majority of farmers in question are relatively lowly geared at present.  Bank of Ireland approved over &euro;135 million for land purchase, about 24,000 acres, last year.  This is up some 25% on the previous year.  On income upturn forecasts, long-term modelling would anticipate a milk price in the low 30's, factoring in an income upturn on that basis.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Barry was concerned we were forgetting about the  beef and tillage sectors but I assure him we are not.  They are a core part of the agricultural offering and we will continue to support and lend to these sectors.  Interestingly, according to the Teagasc research, investment demands for the beef and tillage sectors are low, the bigger demand being in the pig and milk sectors.  On forward selling, we have worked with co-operatives providing commodity hedging type products with a view to the co-ops themselves doing forward prices for farmers rather than us engaging directly in forward selling arrangements with farmers. <\/p> <p>   Our volume statistics do not include conversions from sole traders to limited companies which would be viewed as a restructure; it would all be new money.  Debt levels in New Zealand were examined and there was a collective concern about our farms expanding too far too fast.  By our own estimate, almost &euro;2 billion was already invested by the dairy sector most of which came from farmers' own resources and cashflow rather than going into debt to expand.  This may cause short-term cashflow problems in terms of the super levy and tax payments this year which need to be addressed.  In terms of flexibility and capability and overdraft utilisation, which in Bank of Ireland's case is as low as 20% for farmers, we feel there is plenty of headroom and we will be as flexible as possible regarding any requests received.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015021000002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Cunningham"},{"type":"speech","time":1423576800,"counter":37,"content":"<p>Reference was made to intervention and market insurance schemes.

We have seen a significant increase in land lease costs over the past couple of years.  In Munster, for example, it is estimated that costs increased by 12% in the last year alone.  That is being driven by a number of factors and is not just the result of increased demand for ground in the dairy sector.  Changes to the single farm payment scheme have also led to an increase in the requirement for land and recent legislative changes also favour a movement towards land leasing over the 11-month lease or conacre option.<\/p> <p>  Where this goes in the future will very much depend on the sentiment within different sectors.  The more profitable a farmer is, the more he or she can pay for land that comes on the market which is available for lease.  On average, dairy farmers have been operating more profitably than other farmers, which gives them a competitive advantage in terms of what they can pay to lease land, particularly if that land is adjoining their milk production platform.  Such land will give them the capacity to increase their milk production in an efficient way by increasing the amount of grass they graze or grow on their platform.  I cannot see land lease costs reducing in the short term.  The supply of suitable land is relatively limited while demand is strong and is likely to continue to be so for the foreseeable future.  <\/p> <p>  In terms of demand from the other sectors, the Deputy raises a valid point.  It is not just all about dairy farming.  We have commercial farmers in every sector.  In the area I cover, for example, we have some of the best commercial cereal farmers in the country and they are very important customers of ours.  Similarly, in the dry stock sector and the pig sector, we have a significant market share.  The same principles apply to pig, dry-stock and dairy farmers - it is about efficiency and ensuring that the farmer has the capacity to repay any borrowings.  When we are lending to these guys, we must lend to them on the basis that their cashflow can support their repayments.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy referred to the single farm payment and changes to that scheme mean that we now have visibility in terms of where it is moving over the next five years.  Therefore, if we are lending on a medium-term basis - and much of our lending now is for capital investment - we build in the reduction in the single farm payment over the next five years.  We factor that into the cashflow calculations.<\/p> <p>  On market insurance and fixed prices, I did some research on this in the past.  In the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in the US there are fixed price options but only 20% to 25% of US dairy farmers avail of fixed pricing even though it is available to all farmers.  That said, it is a very important tool that farmers should have available to them.  At the moment Glanbia is offering that option and it is interesting to note that even during the period of high milk prices, there was strong demand for that fixed-price scheme.  I know that Connaught Gold also offers a fixed price and I am aware that the dairy industry as a whole is examining this area.  It is important that the fixed-price option is available to all farmers.  Farmers should look at such schemes as giving them the opportunity to reduce the potential risks in periods of high price volatility.  They should even consider entering into fixed price arrangements during periods of high market prices in order to cover themselves for future price drops.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015021000002#K00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tadhg Buckley"},{"type":"speech","time":1423576800,"counter":42,"content":"<p>I am concerned about the rush to expand.

While banks are lending they must also ask relevant questions, such as: \"Is this adjacent to your milking platform or is it five miles away?\"; \"Is access okay?\"; \"Will you, in five year's time - with two poor years in a row - be able to pay out those funds?\".  There is a surge in optimism now but enormous sums are being demanded and paid for land without the necessary due diligence and without even fixing ahead.

We might have expanded a little on that to discuss owners, farm operators and long-term leasing.  I may be as guilty of that as everyone else.  Deputy Barry hit on the very relevant point of trying to eliminate conacre for everybody&rsquo;s benefit because it becomes very difficult for people in the lending institutions to lend year on year.  Prudence is needed.<\/p> <p>  The reason for inviting the witnesses was to hear at first hand and in a public forum in the Oireachtas whether the banks have a handle on the concerns that have been raised.  We are reasonably satisfied that they have.  The question of reach is probably an issue, if there are a significant number of farmers.  The Health and Safety Authority told us that 58% of all farm fatalities were on dairy farms which account for 17% of all farms.  That is a concern.  Farmers may improve the herd size, roadways and land to produce more milk but be slower to improve safety features.  It is important that everything is done together.  That is why I raised that point. <\/p> <p>  It has been interesting from the committee&rsquo;s point of view to hear about the different products and approaches from the banks.  They are very similar in ways but they have to work with this industry which is worth &euro;10 billion and has over 100,000 primary producers.  If this was bio-pharma with a turnover of &euro;10 billion it might have ten producers, ten multinationals.  The farmers are more important from the point of view of dispersed rural economies.  Every loan, every farmer, every contributor to the local co-op or meat processing plant is an important integral part of the community.<\/p> <p>  One lesson learned from the pig industry in New Zealand is that sometimes efficiency means consolidation but that has been the enemy of many farmers.  I lived there in the early 1980s when farming was totally grass-based and dairy farms averaged probably 150 cows when there were 50 here.  A few years ago a friend of mine was there and said the difference between a conversion to a 1,000 cow herd after the downturn, before the earthquakes, when construction rose again, was &euro;1.5 million.  What did it cost when one could not get a plumber or electrician?  We have to be wary of consolidating in an open expansionary period but learn from the lessons of others.  There is production and sales and the people who support the players.  The primary producers must be supported in everybody&rsquo;s interests.  There are animal welfare issues and many others we could go into.  We wanted to hear that the banks are standing shoulder to shoulder with farmers to protect family farms and give people a decent quality of life.  We want to emphasis this and that is why the committee engaged in it.  <\/p> <p>  We thank the witnesses for coming in and appreciate the fact that they came here together because they are competitors in one sector.

If I were reporting to a board of directors with information such as that we are not using one half of our resources to their optimum; that half of our available resources is better academically than the other half; that half achieved a 35% higher return on investment than the other half; that half of our resources uses on average one third less capital when setting up a start-up; that half bring in 12% higher revenue than the other half when backed by a venture capitalist; and that the half we are not using tends to be more practical and sensible than the other half, is responsible for up to 85% of all our purchasing decisions in the home, is the largest economic force not just in Ireland but in the world and uses more than half of all the products manufactured, including technology products on websites, then one might think that having that half not just as staff but in positions of leadership would define the future direction of the company and be beneficial and directly advantageous to us.<\/p><p> We know the half I am referring to are women.  This is not about gender equality or managing to some diversity metric; it is about innovation and competitiveness.  When we think about it, because of conscious or unconscious bias, women in the main tend to be excluded.  Through the centuries women have rarely been given credit for their achievements and have been discouraged from studying science, technology, engineering, business or mathematics because these sectors were considered male fields.  Women still face some discrimination at all points of their careers and, more often than not, are shunned by bankers and venture capitalists.  It is a culture issue, it is an unconscious bias issue and it is a chicken and egg issue.  The culture will not shift until there are women in business in the tech industry.  Many women will not feel comfortable in the business and tech industry until the culture changes.  If we fail to get the other half fully involved in our socio-economic sphere then it is a competitiveness issue.  Further, it is not a battle of one half against the other; it is not women against men.  It is about using the strengths of each half to increase the results, not alone in business but in the social aspect of our lives.<\/p><p> In terms of a competitiveness issue, many empirical studies have found that people with more diverse sources of information generated consistently better ideas.  Diverse teams, more often than not, out-performed teams composed of the very best individuals because the diversity of perspective and problem-solving approach trumps individual ability.  Therefore, we must level the playing field for women by supporting their start-ups and removing hurdles that are thrown in their way.  Also, parents must inspire their daughters to step forth and take their rightful role in the innovation economy.  I reiterate, this is not about gender equality or managing a diversity metric, it is about competitiveness.<\/p><p> One of the main issues of concern is education.  Women's educational choices have resulted in the number of women that could potentially set up in business, science and technology or turn an invention into a profitable market products being lower than the number of men.  There is a certain lack of business training when undertaking technical and scientific studies.  This applies across the board for entrepreneurs, not just for females.<\/p><p> Perceptions also play a part.  Entrepreneurship, science, technology, innovation and invention are concepts mostly associated with the male or to be in the male sphere.  There is a pervasive stereotyping of women's capacity for leadership.  Entrepreneurship, science, technology, innovation and invention are male dominated sectors in which women are still perceived by some market stakeholders as less credible or less professional.<\/p><p> Traditionally, the female is the homemaker within Irish families and tends to absorb most of the childminding responsibilities.  That traditional view about the role of women in society and the greater difficulties in balancing family responsibilities with working in fast-moving and competitive sectors creates its own issues.<\/p><p> There is also the exclusion from informal networks.  In many sectors jock-talk and late night boozing still oil the wheels of commerce.  Lack of access to relevant networks creates its own difficulties.  Also, behaviour which in men is seen as assertive or principled can sometimes, in a woman, be seen as overbearing or strident, which creates difficulties.  <\/p><p> In terms of role models, there is a lack of role models on the female side but their number is increasing.  There are too few women in top jobs to show how it is done.  We need more women in these positions in order to send a positive message that women can be successful.<\/p><p>There is an need to increase that.<\/p><p> In business there has been a flattening of organisations in recent years and certain layers of management have been taken out.  This has meant there are steeper steps than there used to be, leaving fewer opportunities for people when they re-enter the workforce at higher levels.  Many women, inevitably, take time off during their careers.<\/p><p> There are difficulties in accessing finance from a female perspective.  Last week a case was brought to my attention involving a 29 year old entrepreneur who happened to be female, but that is beside the point.  She had been asked by her local friendly banker whether she could get her husband, or, if not, her father, to sign a guarantee.  The banker was a female.<\/p><p> There is discrimination against female entrepreneurs in the social welfare system.  Female entrepreneurs looking for maternity leave must have 52 weeks' PRSI contributions, whereas an employee needs to have 39.  This is a 33% difference.  The discrimination continues because a self-employed female must give 12 weeks' notice of maternity leave whereas an employee need give only six.  The way we treat female entrepreneurs at administrative level is pointing to the difficulties.<\/p><p> In a nutshell, we need to tackle these issues.  There is a great need for data on the number of female entrepreneurs currently working.  I am a great believer in knowing the numbers because we can then measure and manage the situation and improve the numbers.  There is no point in talking about increasing female entrepreneurship levels if we do not know our starting point.  We need to undertake a general assessment of policies to assess how big is the gender gap and identify sectors that are more problematic.  I have already spoken about how there are women-specific needs.  Women encounter obstacles and it is important that this is brought forward in education.<\/p><p> It is important to support women's development of their business ideas through coaching and mentoring.  This applies across the board; it is not just a female matter, but it is a specific area that we need to promote.  One of the issues that we come across frequently relates to programmes being put in place by Government, the promotion of which is not as good as it could be.  We need informative events with specific training to encourage women to consider entrepreneurship as a viable or feasible career.  We need to plan activities aimed at facilitating women's networking.  On the finance side, we need to improve the ability of females to network with financial providers, including venture capitalists, bankers, etc., and increase the understanding of the financial stakeholders in respect of women's potential.  Regional forums could be a help in this regard.<\/p><p> I have already mentioned mentoring.  The provision of individual mentoring, in particular, from other successful female entrepreneurs, but not necessarily so, is important.  Increasing the visibility of female entrepreneurs is also important.<\/p><p> Child care is a major issue that keeps cropping up.  If a female entrepreneur in Belgium wishes to take maternity leave, who takes care of her business?  She gets what they call the flying entrepreneurs to come in and replace her during her absence.  In Ireland, we do not have that type or level of assistance.<\/p><p> The discrimination really needs to stop.  There is discrimination across the board with entrepreneurs and self-employed people.  We have a programme under way, as part of which we are trying to get the self-employed to be taxed at the same level as others.  This applies to males and females across the board.  The social welfare anomalies could represent a quick win to get female entrepreneurs in and let it be seen that they are at least the equal of their employees.  We have to level the playing field.<\/p><p>The Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation has the ear of the Minister.  While an equality and a diversity issue, which has been well exposed and discussed by many supporters of equality in all its forms, it is now time to take a different but parallel tack and address the challenge from the basic economic stance of increasing efficiency, productivity and competitiveness in that it is of benefit if we use one half, who are what we call the better half, in a more productive way.  As I said, this is not all about gender equality but is about competitiveness.  I will finish on that and just say we should be using our better half.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015021000002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Fielding","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1423575000,"counter":75,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to address the committee.  I met the committee on 8 July when I updated it on the movement called Startup Ireland and the momentum and initiative we had achieved.  I promised the committee I would come back and update it on our progress.  I am delighted to share with it the fact that I left my job two weeks ago to work full-time in Startup Ireland.  I am living on my savings but I live in great expectations of us becoming funded quite shortly because Startup Ireland has really started to gain momentum.  The address to this committee was a very useful step along that road.<\/p> <p>  The reason I am here today is to talk about a major new initiative which is part of the Action Plan for Jobs 2015.  It is all about a regionally balanced start-up ecosystem which capitalises on the competitive advantages and the historical legacy of industries, multinationals and the indigenous strengths we have in each of our cities and which would be unique to each city.  It is not something one can impose on a city but is something that emerges.<\/p> <p>  Just to remind ourselves of why start-ups are so important, it is now empirically proven that start-ups create two thirds of all new jobs within developed economies.  In a nutshell and to put our mission in Startup Ireland very simply, our goal is to make Ireland a global start-up hub by 2020.  When I started to say that a year ago, people said it was nice to have a dream and to keep dreaming but we are now in a situation where this is tangible.  As I go through my presentation, members will see why it is achievable.<\/p> <p>  What is the start-up of sector?  A very diverse group of players comprise the start-up of sector.  It is quite a new sector and has not really been considered as a kind of horizontal.  It comprises technology transfer offices, the professional service providers and co-working space providers and, until very recently, these were seen as an add-on to a huge range of other projects all these providers would be doing.  Now, for the first time, it is being treated as a specific agenda item in our public policy, within the multinationals and within our city and urban councils.  That is very welcome because it must be treated as a new sector to start to create the density of the networks and the resources needed for it to thrive.<\/p> <p>  What have we been doing to bring together the various disparate players in the start-up sector?  When I spoke to the committee in July, I invited all members to Vision2020 Dublin and quite a number of members joined us on that day in October.  We brought the key stakeholders together to discuss what a strategy would look like to make Dublin a global technology start-up hub.  We had some very big players in the room that day who committed to doing whatever they could to make that happen.  We have now moved on to a situation where rather than just focus on Dublin, we are now looking at regionally-based start-up hubs and we have come up with a strategy as to how to do that.<\/p> <p>  It sounds fantastic and everyone is buzzing about entrepreneurship and the start-up sector at the moment.  Some commentators would say there is a degree of hype and over-inflated expectations but we have to push through that to the reality.  We must face the reality that our country does not appear in any of the key global start-up ecosystem rankings.  <\/p> <p>  If we look at one of the reports in 2012, some of the cities are quite predictable but I do not think there is any validity in comparing ourselves to major cities which are part of homogeneous populations.  London has access to a population of 70 million or 80 million and has a very accessible market.  It is a very long established hub for industry and enterprise.<\/p><p>Two countries with similar size populations, similar size GDP and a similar landmass that are in the top 20 are Israel and Singapore.  What characterises those two global start-up hubs is the sheer degree of density and velocity, which are the two defining characteristics of the success.<\/p><p> With regard to density, if we look at the key elements needed to start a successful start-up, an ideal journey would be for a person to go to their university and engage with the tech transfer office or PhD researchers, and really refine a very strong technology, then go to the local multinational, which would have an interface for start-ups to engage with, and then close the first deal.  The person would then go down the road 5 km to the local top-class VEC, which could fund a &euro;2 million to &euro;5 million round, close all that, and then go to their professional service providers, who would have the skills in doing high value deals, and it would all be done in a very short period of time.<\/p><p> The reason that is possible is density.  When there is density, then the process of going through that - the velocity - speeds up.  We do not have that in Ireland.  If a typical high impact start-up wants to close a deal with a big multinational or a big back-end development engineer vice president - the decision makers - they have to fly to the United States or to London.  Having spent quite a bit of time in the States closing the deal, if they then want to raise a &euro;2 million to &euro;5 million round of venture capital funding, they have to fly to London or to Europe.  Eventually, they get back to Dublin and start actually developing.  We do not have the density at the moment in Ireland and, as a result, the velocity is very difficult.  The committee members will all be familiar with the fact we are struggling to get scale-ups.  When we look at our nearest competitor city, London, the density of the various accelerators, incubators, corporate acceleration arms and corporate venturing arms there is very impressive.  We need to achieve the same for Dublin.<\/p><p> It is not all bad news, however.  If we look at the entrepreneurship policy launched by the Minister, Deputy Bruton, the day before our Vision 2020 event in October, it is clear the Government realises and recognises there is a problem, which is the first step to solving it.  Within the entrepreneurship strategy, the Minister has committed to some very clear milestones which will help to move the whole entrepreneurship agenda to a much more sustainable basis in our country.   The really exciting opportunity for us to move to being a global start-up hub is the current public consultation on the replacement for the double Irish - the elimination of the current tax regime for multinationals domiciled in Ireland.  This presents a real opportunity to make Ireland a global start-up hub because this will be the engine.<\/p><p> To take other start-up ecosystems as an example, in Israel the defence budget and the deep R&amp;D created by that is phenomenal.  Singapore has its pivotal position in south-east Asia and phenomenal access to finance.  We cannot compete with either of those.  However, the public consultation on the knowledge development box closes on 8 April and I would encourage all the members to make a submission on it because it is probably the most important structural reform of the fiscal environment in Ireland in the history of the State, and is a fantastic opportunity to create high value jobs in our jurisdiction.  That is where the value is created.  We will start to get PhDs working for the multinationals here and have a much higher headcount of people who may embark on break-outs.  If we join a consultant and a PhD from a multinational together, we get a really high impact scale-up that can take on the world.<\/p><p> It is great for the future that the knowledge development box is in progress.  However, if that is the engine for Ireland to become a global start-up hub, what are the sparks that will ignite that?  When we look at Ireland and our unique characteristics, not many people realise that Ireland came No. 1 in the good country index, which was compiled from 35 indicators and measures how much the countries around the world contribute to global welfare overall.  How many people are aware of that?  I only came across it very recently.<\/p><p> To take another natural characteristic of our national identity, we will always root for the underdog and will always back David versus Goliath.  Start-ups are classic underdogs, classic Davids versus Goliath.  To take the authoritative text on this area, Brad Feld says that at the heart of successful start-up ecosystems is a sense of community, sharing and paying it forward.<\/p><p>These are characteristics which in previous lives we have shown we have in abundance.<\/p><p> We decided to pull all these elements together, to help differentiate Ireland internationally, draw on our natural characteristics and bring that density and velocity together in one focal point that provides the pivot around which the knowledge development box engine can really fire, the start-up gathering.  The start-up gathering is a week of events, encouraging entrepreneurship and show casing Ireland's start-up sector around our country, comprising five days, five cities and five industries.  In terms of the reach of this gathering, which takes place from 5 to 10 October, more than 50 events will take place.  We are open to any suggestions committee members might have in terms of events they are aware of that could be aligned with that week.  Our goal is to interface with at least 15,000 members of the Irish public and international visitors during that week.<\/p><p> We often wring our hands and say we have lost the best talent from Ireland in the past five years.  A key goal of this gathering is to encourage those people who have left Ireland to come back and be part of the economic renewal of our country.  Therefore, we will set up a diaspora start-up fund, raising the funding for that through a kickstarter campaign and crowd sourcing, which is one of our basic approaches to how we do many things.  Through the kickstarter campaign, we will fund the flights home of from 25 to 50 people from around the world who have good business ideas, who want to come back to Ireland and be part of its economic renewal.  There has never been a better time for this in terms of the supports, infrastructure and opportunity available.<\/p><p> In terms of where we are in the start-up gathering process, we are launching phase one on 4 March - and I invite all members of the committee to our official launch.  This phase is about engaging those stakeholders who organise the events, be they a start-up weekend event or a start-up grind where a local role model talks about his or her experience in organising a successful start-up business.  The theme for these events is: Start, Scale, Succeed from Ireland.  Often with a process like this, perception becomes reality.  If we say it often enough, there will be many more start-ups, scale ups and successes.  Phase one, therefore, is about the projects we are inviting to be submitted to be featured during the week of the start-up gathering.<\/p><p> Phase two is about engaging the nation.  We need a much higher participation rate in entrepreneurship, male and female entrepreneurship and undergraduate entrepreneurship.  We need participation across the whole range.  We need to get CoderDojo kids who are learning to programme to think about how they can monetise the ideas they are developing.  In my former role - which I finished two weeks ago - I would talk to hundreds of start-ups a year and often the reason some of those never proceeded was because it was never the right time.  With the start-up gathering, we are saying now is the right time.  We are saying we have the resources and supports available and there has never been a better time to embark on entrepreneurship.  <\/p><p> The goal of the start-up gathering is to highlight the resources available in Ireland to start-ups and to attract international high impact start-ups.  The more international start-ups that locate here, the more this raises the bar for everybody.  We aim to increase Ireland's international visibility, strengthen Ireland's start-up ecosystem and strengthen Ireland's talent base and entrepreneurial networks across the country.  I ask committee members to help us make this a success and to help engage their networks in each of the five cities.  We would be very grateful for that help.  I am happy to deal with any questions members have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015021000002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eoin Costello","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423575000,"counter":78,"content":"<p>Thank you.  I now invite Ms Mary Buckley, IDA Ireland, to make her presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015021000002#K00200","speaker":"1099"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1423575000,"counter":79,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation to make a presentation.  I am Mary Buckley, head of regional development for IDA Ireland and with me is my colleague, Maeve McConnon, manager of our content and business services division.<\/p> <p>  We are pleased to have the opportunity to make a presentation this afternoon on behalf of IDA Ireland.  As members know, IDA Ireland is the Government agency responsible for attracting foreign direct investment to Ireland.  Its parent Department is the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and IDA Ireland works closely with the Minister and his Department and with other Departments - the Departments of An Taoiseach, Finance and Foreign Affairs and Trade - and our sister agencies, Enterprise Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland in achieving foreign direct investment benefits for the Irish economy.<\/p><p> In 2014, 15,012 new jobs were created with 197 investments by IDA client companies.  The net increase, when job losses were taken into account, was just over 7,000 which was one of the highest levels of net job creation in a decade.  Total employment in IDA client companies now stands at 174,488 people, the highest level in the IDA&rsquo;s history.  There were job gains across most sectors that the IDA is focused on but particularly in digital media and content, technology, international financial Services, life sciences and global business services.  Examples of leading investments secured during the last two years include Regeneron Pharmaceuticals in Limerick, Jazz Pharmaceuticals in Roscommon, Overstock in Sligo, Clearstream Technologies in Wexford, Internal Results in Portlaoise, Valeo Vision Systems in Tuam, Hollister in Mayo, Amazon in Cork, Bristol Myers Squibb Fidelity and Linked in Dublin, West Pharmaceuticals in Waterford, PayPal in Dundalk, Ericsson in Athlone, SAP in Galway, Ethicon in Limerick and online companies SurveyMonkey, Airbnb and Zendesk, also in Dublin.  <\/p><p> The IDA estimates that for every ten jobs created by FDI, another seven are generated in the wider economy.  The contribution is particularly strong in the property and construction sectors where it is estimated that approximately 10,000 people are currently employed on construction projects underway with IDA client companies, providing a considerable economic boost to a sector which has faced unprecedented challenges in recent years, as well as to the wider economy.  Sub-contracting firms are particular beneficiaries of this secondary economic impact, as are local communities in general.  The IDA is cautiously optimistic that Ireland is in a good position to win significant business across a range of sectors this year.  Already this year, up to 250 jobs were announced at Zimmer in Oranmore in Galway, 100 jobs at AMAX in Shannon, 100 jobs at Viagogo in Limerick, 100 jobs at ABEC in Fermoy, while Guidewire Software announced expansion plans with an anticipated 60 to 80 new staff in Dublin. <\/p><p> Multinational client companies of the IDA have a strong culture of gender equality and women feature prominently in senior corporate roles.  In locating here in Ireland, they continue that promotion of gender equality and women in Ireland have benefited greatly from their positive climate and supports.  We have also seen examples where the valuable experience and high-level skills offered to women in such roles and other senior positions in multinational companies have allowed them transition effectively into their own entrepreneurial enterprises.  The heads of many of Ireland&rsquo;s largest multinational technology companies are women.  Examples in the technology sector include Louise Phelan of PayPal, Sonia Flynn of Facebook Ireland, Cathriona Hallahan of Microsoft Ireland and Fidelma Healy of Gilt Ireland, to name just a few.  The IDA&rsquo;s emerging business sector has also seen a high level of women come through in senior positions such as Gina Arcari at Dita Eyewear, Kim Cahill at Squarespace, Kerrie Power at Nordeus and Orla Moran at NewRelic and Geraldine MacCarthy at Dropbox.  That said, it is accepted that there is an imbalance generally in the number of women compared to men involved in technology in this country.  It is also acknowledged that in order to attract more technology companies to Ireland and to allow those already here to grow we need a work force that is fully representative and that includes more women.  Science, technology, engineering and mathematics, the so-called STEM subjects, are critical.  Teaching second level female students about technology, fostering an interest in it at that level and debunking the stereotype that it is a male pursuit is crucial to encourage them to study those subjects at third level.  This in turn will develop the pipeline of highly skilled and qualified graduates needed.<\/p><p> Creating role models for women is also very important and such women are there in considerable numbers in Ireland; we just need to make them known.  The industry itself has a responsibility in that regard.  There are a number of groups and campaigns in place in Ireland to support this initiative, including a new industry grouping, the multinational technology forum, whose members include women leaders from IBM, PayPal and Accenture.  My colleague Maeve McConnon represents the IDA on this forum.<\/p><p> With companies relying increasingly on technology for a broad spectrum of functions from solving business problems to understanding consumer behaviour through analytics, big data, social media and cloud computing, new opportunities are being created for companies and, with them, exciting career opportunities for women.  We need to show girls that much of computing is about problem solving and collaborative thinking and that computing can be applied in diverse and varied domains.  This message must be conveyed to women and the best place to do this is at an early stage of second level education.  Some advocate for it to start at the first level education stage and the recently established CoderDojo programmes help support this.  While women in high profile positions are working for multinational companies, their status in the upper echelons of Irish business can have a positive effect in encouraging female entrepreneurship by providing strong role models.  Networking initiatives and mentoring programmes are also important and there are a number of these in place.<\/p><p> Enterprise Ireland, our sister agency, highlighted in its presentation to the committee last week its solid focus on developing and promoting women entrepreneurs nationally.  There are some great events and campaigns in this area in Ireland, many of which are driven by key IDA client companies.  Examples include the championing by Silicon Republic, one of Ireland&rsquo;s leading technology news wires, of the role of women in technology for a number of years now.  Specifically, it has been running since March 2013 its Women Invent Tomorrow campaign, which is sponsored by Accenture, Intel, the Irish Research Council, ESB, Twitter, CoderDojo and SFI.  The objective of this programme is to highlight the role women play in STEM and to inspire more women to follow in their footsteps.  Concrete examples of Silicon Republic's work include the publishing of a list of the top 100 women in science, technology, engineering and mathematics and the establishment of the Female Founders Forum involving Bethany Mayer of HP, founder of the Women's Innovation Council in the USA, Cork teenager and advocate, Joanne O'Riordan, and Travis Carpico, president of Fidelity Investment Ireland.  In 2014, Silicon Republic also presented a number of special recognition awards for role models in this area.  At the Female Founders Forum in June 2014, delegates heard from Eventbrite president and co-founder, Julia Hartz, amongst others.  The Female Founders Forum also hosted the \"Women Invest Meet-Up\" in November 2014, which was opened by BT Ireland.  Inspire 2015 is Silicon Republic's international event which will take place in Dublin in June to connect science and technology professionals who are passionate about the future of STEM and have fresh perspectives on leadership, innovation and diversity.  The IDA is a gold sponsor of this event in conjunction with SFI and Dublin City Council.<\/p><p> Another IDA client, LinkedIn, has driven awareness building programmes like Bring Your Parents to Work Day, which allows parents of employees access to their workplace so see their children's work and what they do.  Building awareness among parents around the range of roles, functions and opportunities available in the technology industry today is paramount as parents are key influencers in their children's education and career choices.  In essence, Ireland is a destination of choice for global IT skills and demand for IT graduates is only set to increase.  This offers huge opportunities for Irish students over the next five to ten years, both at home and abroad.<\/p><p> I turn to regional business development of entrepreneurial hubs.  Currently, there are over 450 IDA client companies employing approximately 75,000 people outside Dublin and Cork.  While the IDA is responsible for attracting foreign investment to Ireland and its regions, it does not work alone and requires the support of local authorities, third level colleges, Enterprise Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland, to name but a few, to ensure that the environment is right for winning and retaining investment in Ireland.  In many locations throughout Ireland, clusters have been developed in particular sectors or activities.  For example, the west is well known for a cluster of overseas and indigenous life sciences companies.  Clusters are identified where overseas and indigenous firms co-locate within a recognisable geographical area, co-operate and compete around certain activities and establish close linkages and working alliances to improve their collective competitiveness.<\/p><p>While we have seen the co-location of companies in Ireland in a range of sectors and activities, this alone will not realise the synergies and additional economic impact that is possible.  Effective networks, linkages and clustering initiatives will be increasingly important over the coming years to ensure competitive and innovative ecosystems.<\/p><p> A dynamic start-up community is an attractiveness factor for FDI generally.  It is important to recognise that reinforcing a supportive start-up ecosystem in Ireland is critical both for the attraction of overseas entrepreneurs and emerging companies as well as home-grown start-ups.  As I already mentioned, executives in multinational companies have established their own companies having gained experience in the multinational environment here.  <\/p><p> IDA Ireland, through the action plan for jobs, is working in partnership with Enterprise Ireland on the area of global sourcing with the aim of bringing multinational companies in Ireland and local Irish companies together as sub-suppliers.  A trade mission to multinational companies within Ireland commenced in 2014 in Cork, Galway, Dublin and Limerick.  IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland collaborate in this area, particularly so when multinationals visit Ireland as a location to invest, providing opportunities for indigenous companies to pitch for business from the earliest opportunity.  Another example is the Department-funded technology centres around the country.  The programme Enterprise Ireland runs jointly with IDA Ireland involves clients of both agencies collaborating on technology issues which are close to market.  Out of such collaboration, businesses will emerge.  The Minister has a keen interest in it to make sure that it continues to grow.  <\/p><p> Indeed, he has spoken recently about the Department's development of the regional strategy frameworks in each region with IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and other agencies.  This involves working collaboratively with regional stakeholders on the development and implementation of a regional enterprise strategy.  Work is currently underway in the midlands region focused on harnessing the region&rsquo;s strengths and opportunities.  This will be critical to ensuring that key business factors are in place to support the sustainability and growth of all enterprises &ndash; overseas, indigenous and entrepreneurial.<\/p><p> The importance of the education and training sector in providing a supply of talented graduates cannot be overstated.  Skills are probably the most important factor in determining IDA Ireland's success in attracting high-quality FDI to Ireland.  Having a dynamic talent pool in Ireland was an important component in IDA Ireland's strong performance in 2014.  Ireland is considered by client companies to have a very good skills base.  When making investment announcements, companies often cite skills availability as a key reason for locating here but there is no room for complacency.  We must keep abreast of changing skills needs and be in a position to meet that need.  To that end, IDA Ireland has forged good relationships with third-level institutions and engages on an ongoing basis with them to ensure the changing skills needs of FDI clients in terms of graduate capability are understood and are being met through continued openness to working collaboratively with clients on their skills agenda. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015021000002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Buckley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423575000,"counter":83,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Buckley and invite Senator White to start off the questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015021000002#N00200","speaker":"1099"},{"type":"speech","time":1423575000,"counter":84,"content":"<p>Perhaps my colleague, Deputy Calleary, would like to speak.

I agree that the sum of the gender parts far outweighs the individuals.  Last week a ground-breaking female entrepreneur appeared before the committee.  One of the key points she made was that for better or worse, in many families women take the brunt of the responsibility of minding and rearing the children.  Another point she made - this was confirmed by the representatives of Enterprise Ireland - was that middle management in business is a key seeding ground for future entrepreneurs.  If we could ensure that more women find themselves in middle management in those companies, we would have more female entrepreneurs seeded from that ground.<\/p> <p>  The Government can play a role in ensuring that the key issue of supports for women in those areas are there.  How do we make businesses more friendly?  How do we make that middle management space more family-friendly - friendly for women, who, unfortunately, take on most of the responsibility?  While I might be wrong in this, in a private business a person could take maybe two years out on a career break and not find himself or herself at the bottom of the professional ladder or even struggling to get back into work.<\/p> <p>  There is a cost to business supports and businesses are struggling.  There is a fine line between having the supports and yet keeping the businesses are viable.  The idea of the flying entrepreneur is a fascinating example of what could potentially be done.  If we can drill down into more of those supports and give them some kind of statutory support from the State, that could make a difference.  I ask the witnesses if they could speak to that.<\/p><p>Mr. Costello gave a fascinating presentation.  One of the nuts we are trying to crack here is the <i>Mittelstand<\/i>, as the German's call it, that middle sized indigenous SME.  There is a desert in that space in the State.  I am aware the witnesses mentioned start-ups specifically but do they have a view on how we can ensure that businesses get into that level of growth and space?  It is probably more difficult for FDI industries than it is for EI to put on particular programmes in this area but do FDI industries target women-led businesses?  I am aware that having women in visible positions often inspires young girls and women to go for those positions in the first place.  One of the key areas in which the witnesses probably have influence is in the engagement between FDI industries and local direct investment, LDI, that space where we want local business to engage more with FDI industries.  Are there any particular programmes or incentives to ensure that women entrepreneurs are in that space?<br\/><br\/>I congratulate the witnesses on the IDA figures in respect of the work they have been doing this year.  I note the regional distribution and the improvement but there are many counties, some of which I have mentioned previously, which still need more IDA investment.

That is something we can aspire to across the board for companies in Ireland.  A number of companies are doing much work in this area.  For example, Accenture has been running its inspire women in technology programme for many years which champions the role of women in science technology and STEM subjects.  Its action programme for women recognises the need to take action for women and the need to adjust its polices accordingly.  Part of this programme is to introduce mentoring and some supports for women, including women going on maternity leave who are appointed a maternity buddy who comes in while the person is out and after the person comes back.  The maternity buddy keeps them up to date on what is happening in the organisation and  attuned to strategies and changes in policy so that when they return they assimilate very quickly back into the organisation.<\/p> <p>  Those types of initiatives are innovative and have led to great sharing and best practice both across their organisation and into the greater economy where they are working with producing reports on those who have the greatest influence on women in technology.  They have looked at reports on who influences; it is really the parents.  Parents primarily influence a child at secondary school and that influences career choices in their CAO applications.  Accenture has been doing much research in this area.  Again it is about looking back into the profile of what jobs a girl and boy should go into and changing some of those stereotypes.  Accenture do some great work in that area.  I am sure the committee is aware of some of the work Facebook is doing as well, led by led by its CEO, Sheryl Sandberg.<\/p><p>EMC has been very vocal, as has Intel.

It would be great to be able to afford that.  Mentoring is an issue in terms of being able to mentor a person into the workplace because technology and business are moving so fast, people are left behind.<\/p> <p>  Training managers is needed in terms of mitigating unconscious biases in business.  Analysing job descriptions and recruitment practices for unconscious bias is important and would help more females to reach a higher level.  I agree and disagree with my IDA colleague in the sense that I think secondary level is too late to be talking about STEM and female students.  It must take place at primary level.  Entrepreneurship must start at primary level rather than waiting for somebody to get to the leaving certificate, or transition year where they spend a couple of hours every week making socks and selling them to each other.  We need to start talking in terms of what the reality of life is and that has to be done well below secondary and tertiary level.  <\/p> <p>  We hear about the culture fit.  Women talk about how when they go for interviews, they are told they do not fit in.  It is not a culture fit.  It is because they are female and the technology area is so male-dominated that there is a difficulty there.  Again, this is where we need to talk in terms of the people who are interviewing.  If one looks at any engineering business, it is very difficult to get women at the top level but very often the directors are not engineers.  They are all different.  The difficulty is that women are held to a different standard and this needs to be overcome. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015021000002#R00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Fielding"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1423575000,"counter":109,"content":"<p>The issue of scaling is a multi-factorial problem.

The entrepreneur's ambition in Silicon Valley and London was for $1-billion valuation companies.  Otherwise, they would not get out of bed for it.  In respect of the average entrepreneur in Ireland - a lifestyle business possibly employing three or four staff - do we talk to the broad mass of people embarking on entrepreneurship?  We focus on the really motivated and passionate people and the kind of ambition that will scale up those companies, take on the obstacles when they pass the &euro;200-million or &euro;300-million valuations and keep going.  In a sentence, it is about the scale of ambition of entrepreneurs.  Our culture is not ambitious enough for our entrepreneurial ecosystem, so we must be ambitious.

The Global Entrepreneurship Monitor 2013 stated that men are 1.9 times more likely to be at the start-up entrepreneurship stage.  If we want to encourage women into business and start-ups, there are two strands.  First is the initial strand of education.  I agree that primary school is the key time to encourage young girls to get interested in entrepreneurship.  I would be interested to know from the witnesses how that should be approached from a teaching perspective.  One would have to go into the teacher training colleges.  If one is going to do this, one will have to approach it in a particular way and not only through the STEM subjects.  The second strand is where women are already in the workforce where the perennial issue is that of child care.  Reference was made to mentoring and the buddy system, which is all very good, but child care and its cost falls back on women.

On the education of our young people, I advocate and support strongly what Mr. Mark Fielding has said around the integration of the teaching of entrepreneurship at a primary level.  Some of our European counterparts are actually teaching entrepreneurship at preschool level.  Rather than use the word \"teaching\", I would suggest \"learning\".  First and foremost, it must be part of the curriculum so that time is allowed in the school and it is not considered an add-on where one has the luxury of a spare hour at the end of the day.  It should be an integral part of the curriculum.  Second, it must be done through the role models within the community.  We are all very aware of the absolute necessity of having role models presented to our younger population so that boys and girls at school can understand what is achievable right across the spectrum.  Those role models should be accessible from a very young age.  Ms Mary Buckley has mentioned several of them through the IDA businesses.  There are role models right across our community from small indigenous businesses to the multinationals.  I suggest that there is a means of exploring how a more formalised, restructured system could be put in place to engage those role models right across the country within our educational system for the benefit of the student and to work with and support teachers on the integration of entrepreneurship.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015021000002#S00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Siobhan Finn"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1423575000,"counter":112,"content":"<p>I agree with the previous speaker.

I am trying to translate some of the very good work the group does where it has a very strong role in communicating and influencing to first, second and third level students as well as to parents, career guidance teachers and everyone else.  For entrepreneurship, there are role models and a requirement for people to speak positively about and encourage it.  That is the most important piece.

She is in business there and is actively involved with different groups and it seems to me that there are quite a number of Irish people who have succeeded in France.

Is there anything we can do with regard to languages, both European languages and the languages of emerging economies like China?  I have a grand-daughter who lives in China and speaks Mandarin.

This has been a very enlightening and interesting meeting so far.<\/p> <p>  There is a dichotomy in Ireland.  We talk about entrepreneurship and how much we need it but Government Departments are suspicious of entrepreneurs because of issues like taxation, PRSI and so forth.  I really believe that is the situation.  They do not trust them and think they are all making a fortune and not telling.  There is a distrust there.  I am talking here about culture.  Within Government Departments there is an innate distrust of entrepreneurs.  It is all very fine to talk about ten and 11 year olds having no fear but their parents are culturally bound too.  When push comes to shove, they want their children to become doctors, barristers, lawyers, teachers and so on.  They want them to do something safe that has status in society rather than being an entrepreneur, at which they could fail.  Despite all of the talk about entrepreneurship, we are still culturally bound.  That is why we depended so much on multinationals and still do.  While some people are developing their own indigenous companies, there is still a real lack of desire to be an entrepreneur.  <\/p> <p>  I also wish to raise with Mr. Fielding the issue of child care from the perspective of small and medium companies.  What is his honest opinion on women taking child care leave or the Government increasing the availability of such leave?  Increasing such leave for workers in the public sector is fine but I do not know how a female entrepreneur could start a business if she had a baby or small child.<\/p><p>In my experience, it would be very difficult to be an entrepreneur and raise a baby or young child at the same time.  However, as Senator Naughton said, we need to get more women to start up businesses.  If we got as many women as men starting up businesses, we would create more employment and jobs.  The culture is an issue.<\/p><p> I have a question for Ms Buckley.  In the context of balanced regional development, every county now has a local enterprise office.  We had a presentation last week from Mr. Tom Hayes which I found a cause for optimism, because these offices are on the ball.  However, I have had questions in regard to how successful they can be and whether they will really be entrepreneurial.  Will IDA Ireland have any input in that regard?  Will it provide role models or have any creative or innovative interaction with the local enterprise offices?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015021000002#T00300","speaker":"1156","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423575000,"counter":118,"content":"<p>I ask Mr. Fielding and Ms Buckley not to forget the question put by Senator Quinn on language when they respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015021000002#U00200","speaker":"1099"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1423575000,"counter":119,"content":"<p>I would never forget Senator Quinn.

I outlined in my submission some of the large multinational companies that are based here and their skills requirements.  For example, Google, whose activities are spread across Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia, would have about 45 languages within its operation in Dublin; SAP would have another 20 or 21 languages in Galway; and Apple in Cork is a multilingual centre.  Therefore, the breadth of language skills is much greater now than it ever was before.  When one is conscious of working in business, the need to have another language is critical.

That is something that needs to be examined.  It is almost like providing a guarantee for people so that, if they do not succeed, there is somewhere to go afterwards and failure is not frowned upon.  It should be the view that, \"You did not succeed but you tried\", and that in itself should be given credibility and recognition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015021000002#V00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Siobhan Finn"},{"type":"speech","time":1423575000,"counter":127,"content":"<p>I thank all the witnesses for coming in to help us with our deliberations, which have been most helpful and engaging.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015021000002#V00600","speaker":"1099"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1423575000,"counter":128,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 3.15 p.m. and resumed at 3.25 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"speech","time":1423575000,"counter":129,"content":"<p>We will resume in public session.

It is a delight to be here.  I am the Dublin commissioner for startups.  This role is a collaboration between Dublin City Council, Enterprise Ireland and the Dublin Chamber of Commerce and it came out of the Activating Dublin report, which was published in August 2013 and which brought together all the stakeholders in the community in Dublin to talk about how we could make Dublin a great start-up city.  One of the key recommendations was that we needed one message, one role, one voice and one platform to position Dublin internationally as a great start-up hub and start-up city, along with all of the other great start-up hubs and cities like London, New York, Berlin and Silicon Valley.  That is my role in this job.<\/p> <p>  To put my comments into context, I have been in the tech world for all of my career.  I spent the past 16 years in the States.  I applied for this role from New York and when I received a \"Yes\", I came home and set up shop here with my family.  In regard to my background in the States, I initially worked for Enterprise Ireland for six years as a VP of software, helping Irish tech companies come into the States.  It was a very exciting role.  Many great Irish tech companies are coming into the States all the time, as we know.  I then worked for Orbiscom, an Irish payments tech company, which was bought by MasterCard in 2009.  It is another great success story out of Ireland.  It is a really great exit to a really great parent company, MasterCard, which has set up MasterCard Labs in Dublin as its global HQ for payments innovation.  Out of an Irish start-up which moved to the States very early, we have this great innovation centre for payments based out of Dublin for the world, which is very exciting.<\/p> <p>  After that I started consulting, working with companies coming into the States on an individual basis.  It was very similar to what I had done in Enterprise Ireland but off my own bat and in my own company.  I did that for a couple of years and then I started to invest in start-ups.  I am an angel investor in a group of start-ups in New York - ten start-ups in total.  I started to invest in 2011.  Two of those companies died on the vine, as they do, and seven of them are still going strong.  One of them had a great exit.  We have not done too badly so far.  One of them which is still going strong and we think will eventually get a great exit out is a woman-led company called PublicStuff, about which we are very excited.  That is my background.<\/p> <p>  After investing in companies and getting very close to the start-up scene in New York as a mentor and an investor, I caught the bug to set up some start-ups myself.  I set up two start-ups in New York and was in the middle of my second start-up when this role came up in Dublin.<\/p><p>The reason I applied for the role was because I had been coming back to Ireland on a regular basis and had seen the start-up scene here emerge as something very interesting with huge potential and with a lot of energy.  Every six months I came home and each time I could see it had taken another giant leap forward.  It was exciting for me, coming from a great start-up city like New York, to come back to Dublin and get that same sense here in pockets around the city and then to see more and more of it.  All of a sudden, back in 2013, I got that sense as I walked around this city.  I knew Dublin had arrived as a great start-up city and it was now a question of growing it.  <\/p><p> When the role came up to be the Dublin commissioner for start-ups I thought to myself what a great opportunity and what perfect timing for Dublin, this is a window of opportunity that Dublin has, I have a lot of experience on all sides of the start-up world and I can add value in this bigger role in Dublin.  Lucky for me I got the job and here I am.  That is my background.  <\/p><p> The role has many goals and metrics which I shall encapsulate into two things.  First, I want to put Dublin on the map.  As I mentioned before, Dublin has arrived.  There are many great start-up companies in Dublin.  We are very innovative in many different areas of technology which range from payments to enterprise software.  We are doing some great stuff in consumer Internet and on the Internet aspect of things.  There is no shortage of role models, success stories and potential for global leadership in certain categories, coming out of Dublin.  It is just that the story has not been told outside of the country.  Nobody knows that Dublin is a great start-up city.  One can guarantee that is the truth in the US, Europe and further afield.<\/p><p> The first goal of my role is to put Dublin on the map.  I want Dublin to be spoken about and to be a member of the club when people talk about great start-up hubs like New York, Berlin and London.  Ireland in its own way and with its size - not to compete or copy them but be of our own selves - can be a great place to attract talent and act as a magnet for start-ups, investment and innovation.  We are starting to do so.  That train has left the station.  It is just a question of how we speed things up and get the message out.<\/p><p> The second part of my role strongly reflects my background.  As I have spent the past 16 years in the US, I can help Irish companies to internationalise more purposefully.  We do a very good job, with Enterprise Ireland, in providing support for  companies to get into foreign markets.  We bring foreign investors into Ireland and the Government supports all of these activities.  The next step that needs to be taken is to help companies, at an earlier stage in their careers, to imbed themselves on the ground in their primary markets, wherever those primary markets are located.  Often those primary markets are in the US but sometimes they are in other countries.<\/p><p> It is very important that the emphasis of start-ups is taken off funding, to some extent, and focused on markets.  The following questions must be asked: Does one know one's markets?  Does one know one's customers?  How can one validate customers?  How long has one spent with them?  How can one benefit from the talent that sits on those markets?  How can one bring that talent on board at the right time for one's company?  How can one build relationships with investors early on so that they can be investors when the time comes to scale them up and get that kind of investment?  I am convinced that if companies do not spend more time in the primary markets that they are selling into then they will be unable to compete globally.  That is one of the big challenges that we have and is one of my areas of focus.  We are doing lots of different things about the situation.  <\/p><p> Enterprise Ireland does an outstanding job and we support a soft landing for companies into the US.  What we really need to do is imbed them into the communities they are selling into and imbed them into the start-up industry that they could join in New York.  The Germans do this in New York by way of providing an accelerator option for German companies that is very competitive and the Canadians do the same thing.  During my time in this role I want us to move slowly but surely in that direction.  I have a project this year that will start us off on that route.  I have outlined the big goals for my role.<\/p><p> In terms of women in tech, we are going in the right direction.  It is a positive story when compared with the statistics coming out of Enterprise Ireland.  In 2011, EI supported seven women-led companies in total from across Competitive Start and High Potential Start-Up schemes.  In 2014, EI supported 43 companies in total, which represents 23% of its overall funding and was spent between Competitive Start and the  HPSU companies.  That percentage is way ahead of our international partners.  In the US, funding across the board for women-led companies varies from between 15% and 20% and in Europe the percentage is even less.  A rate of 23% means we are doing a very good job and more of that is the story we need to tell.<\/p><p>When it comes to companies that need to scale and one is looking at the venture capital market, we have very few Irish female VCs.  This is a concern for a number of reasons.  Obviously, the female-led companies that pitch to VCs are talking to men who see things through a male's lens and a man's understanding of the world.  However, it is even more challenging if the companies they are building are female oriented, in that they may be fashion companies, jewellery companies or something women understand more innately than men.  Consequently, it is even harder for women to sell and pitch an idea to try to create this vision of a global market if they are sitting in front of men only as the investors at the table.  While there are a lot of super investors in Ireland and lots of educated global citizens among them, we need more female investors, VCs and angel investors in Ireland and this is something which should be encouraged.  Together with STEM, we should encourage greater proficiency and more talent in the financial area and women to be the people who make the decisions about who is and is not funded and who helps them to scale.  This is another area that is very interesting.<\/p><p> Outside the VC area all of the research will show - Enterprise Ireland's in-depth research and interviews with female entrepreneurs also tell this story - women's lack of confidence to \"big up\" their businesses in comparison with men.  This is typical and not just an Irish thing.  I also saw this in the United States and I am the product of that fear of positioning oneself too broadly.  However, in general women are afraid to tell the big story and to have \"wow\" numbers.  They are afraid to put themselves out there because they are always anxious to know how they will get to that place.  They want to move step by step and position that deliberate and measured approach as to where they are going, but that does not work in a fast moving, technology-driven, highly ambitious investor and customer market.  Women must be able to talk about their vision for a couple of years hence in respect of where they are going, who will be category leaders and from where they will get their customers.  They must have that big story at their fingertips.<\/p><p> When I was looking for investment in the United States, I had a couple of mentors who helped me to prepare my pitch.  One female mentor looked through my deck and told me that it simply was not \"wow\" enough.  There were not enough big numbers in it; there was no big vision.  She told me I would not get the attention I required and that I needed to increase the numbers significantly.  I responded by saying they were the numbers with which I was comfortable, that this was what I was comfortable saying and, were my back to the wall, they were the numbers behind which I could stand and support in the future.  I said I wanted them to believe in me as somebody in whom they could invest.  Her response was succinct: I should think like a man and pull it out of my proverbials.  That was a moment of realisation for me that while I considered myself to be strong willed and confident - if not a feisty entrepreneur - I was still unwilling to pull the figures out of the air and stand behind them.  <\/p><p> We need to help women to present better and have the confidence to imagine the dream and bring people on a journey when they talk about their businesses, wherever they may be going.  It does not need to be global domination or a billion dollar company, but whatever is the capability of that business and however big is the market, women should be able to position themselves as being able to take a massive share of it.  That is how one gets investment and one excites markets.  That is how someone convinces large companies to roll out his or her product when they have never heard of his or her company previously.  Success needs that confidence to be able to pitch and sell and one should then fill in the gaps as one goes along.  A person does not need to have all of the answers - nobody does - and every entrepreneur is in a dark tunnel for the vast majority of the time.  He or she is just figuring it out step by step as he or she goes along.  It is an iterative process, about which one should not worry.  We need to talk a lot more to female entrepreneurs, as well as to all other entrepreneurs in Ireland.  This is something entrepreneurs in Ireland, when compared to somewhere such as the United States, do not do well.  We do not \"big up\" our companies or talk about changing the world or being category leaders, but we need to do this a lot more often to get the attention we deserve because our products are worth it.<\/p><p>While the quality, innovation and leadership are there to be seen, the marketing is lacking.<\/p><p> My second start-up was tech-heavy in that we invested all of our own money on the tech side.  Although I have worked on the tech side world all of my life, I have always been involved at the business end and have no background in technology.  My partner and co-founder was a man and when I was down in the mines with him trying to understand what was going on from a product development roadmap scenario, how to prioritise different pieces of functionality and get rid of bugs in our product that were annoying our customers, it was a very challenging conversation every day and it took up so much time because I did not understand what he was talking about.  He might as well have been speaking a different language.  The chasm one has to cross if one has no technical background is massive.  The earlier we can get people to have fluency in the language of technology the better, even if they do not end up becoming coders or developers in order that they can understand what is happening in a tech-driven business.  Technology and data science should be foundational degrees for those who want to build companies.  We should consider this very strongly.<\/p><p> We do not have many great role models for successful Irish female entrepreneurs.  We have Anne Heraty of Cpl who is on my advisory board and Susan Spence of SoftCo.  In a couple of years we will have more role models because some great companies such as Restored Hearing, Pharmapod, Beats Medical and Love &amp;amp; Robots are coming up.  They are breaking down barriers in terms of the innovations they are bringing to the market and the role models of female-led companies coming out of Ireland and going on to make it big.  Within a couple of years and with more of the support we have been giving them these companies and many more about which we have not heard will fill the gap and be the role models.  It is very exciting.<\/p><p> It is very interesting that, anecdotally, Enterprise Ireland and others are reporting that it is women at middle management levels who tend to come out and become entrepreneurs.  We can increase and accelerate this trend and encourage women by giving them an insight into how business works, encouraging them to fix problems that they see in their organisations and perhaps receive support from their organisations for spin off companies and bring them back in-house later.  This is an opportunity for us.  These women are smart and in the &ldquo;superwoman&rdquo; phase of their careers, when they probably have children who need them and elderly parents, as well as being at the apex of their careers.  Given that they are superwomen, perhaps they can spin out and build companies if they receive enough support and enthusiasm.  Given that they are already doing it, the question is how we can help them to continue.<\/p><p> This is a wonderful time.  The trends are all positive and the funding and supports are in place.  While there are cultural and environmental issues, they apply across the board and if we keep up the level of awareness and the Government talking about start-ups, we will be doing very well.  We want to keep hearing the Taoiseach talk about start-ups and the potential of great, innovative, domestic companies to build strong businesses for Ireland in global markets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015021000002#Y00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Niamh Bushnell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423575000,"counter":134,"content":"<p>I call Ms Anna Porter, an award winning student at the recent BT Young Scientist and Technology Exhibition, to discuss her project entitled, \"Why do Women Stay in STEM Careers?\"  She is most welcome and probably one of the youngest speakers we have had at the committee.

I love science and I hope to study chemistry and biology for my leaving certificate.  I participated in the BT Young Scientist and Technology Exhibition three times, in the SciFest competition and in the Northern Ireland young scientist competition.  I love doing project work and carrying out research.  I noticed that in all these competitions the majority of judges were male.  Last summer, I decided to look at the statistics and this was the beginning of my research.<\/p><p> STEM stands for science, technology, engineering and mathematics.  These are important subjects and, with such a rapidly changing economy, we need an increasing number of people with a STEM qualification.  Education in these subjects is essential to create a future generation in a highly qualified workforce capable of critical thinking and solving real world problems such as global warming, disappearing habitats and Third World hunger.<\/p><p> Recent figures from the CSO show that in Ireland less than 25% of the almost 180,000 people working in STEM careers are women.  That is less than one quarter of the STEM workforce.  A report published by the Forf&aacute;s expert group on future skills needs in 2012 stated that Irish companies will have an estimated 44,500 job openings for people with high-level ICT skills in the coming six years.  In order to prevent a shortfall and to ensure that Ireland can compete in the global market, we cannot ignore 50% of the talent pool.<\/p><p> The problem is not just in Ireland but a global phenomenon.  Statistics in Europe and America show a similar gender bias.  Why are women not fairly represented?  Men and women are different but neither gender is less able to do STEM.  Having both sexes being equally represented in the workforce would maximize creativity, innovation and experience.  Many studies have been carried out to find a reason for the imbalance.  The majority seem to focus on why women do not go into STEM careers or why, when they do enter STEM careers, they drop out.  I decided to investigate why women choose to work in STEM and, as a result, come up with recommendations to encourage more women to follow in their footsteps.<\/p><p> I contacted a number of women who had worked in STEM careers for ten years or more.  I interviewed three of these women.  My aim was to do an online survey but before I designed the survey I needed to identify themes and ideas on which to base the questions.  I also did a lot of reading of previous reports, news articles and books.  I wanted to be as informed on the topic as I could be before I published my survey online.  I compiled my survey and tested it.  I then published a final version online. <\/p><p> To distribute my survey, I e-mailed women and organisations, including Women in Technology and Science, WITS, and Women into Science and Engineering, WISE.  All were eager to help and posted about it in newsletters and websites.  I was excited to follow the survey as it went out on social media, particularly Twitter.  I closed the survey on 14 December 2014 with a sample size of 216 respondents and began to analyse the data using both OpenOffice Calc and Microsoft Office Excel.<\/p><p> I was delighted to see a fair cross section of women working in STEM careers represented in the survey.  The responses came from both academia and industry, with about 60% from academia.  The percentages for women working in the different fields of STEM varied, with 54% working in science and only 5% in mathematics.  A genuine interest or passion for STEM seems to be the main reason a woman would choose to study a STEM subject in third level and continue to a career in STEM.  Some 81% of respondents cited interest as the main influence.  Teachers and parents appear to be the main human influences in a woman's choice of STEM, with teachers rated at 74% and parents at 65%.  Guidance counsellors appear to be less influential than parents and teachers and rated quite low, sometimes having a negative influence.<\/p><p> A large majority of respondents believed role models were important in the choice to do STEM in college and as a career.  Peer pressure, which affects me, was quoted by at least a third of the respondents as a major factor.<\/p><p>A number of negative factors cited included difficulties in managing the family-work balance, the lack of job security, sexism-positive bias toward the male employee, the general culture and a lack of clarity about job prospects having studied STEM subjects.  The workload and administration duties in a STEM job were cited as the least favourite aspects.<\/p><p> My study made the following recommendations: STEM subjects needed to be presented in as interesting a way as possible at school level; the subjects needed to be taught in a way that would appeal to students in general and, in particular, stimulate girls&rsquo; interest in, love of and curiosity in the subject to counteract gender stereotyping; it was essential teachers received additional CPD training to support them in providing a classroom environment which fostered gender equality - positive reinforcement by the teacher is important to encourage a girl&rsquo;s long-term interest in STEM; parents needed to be more informed to guide their daughters in choosing STEM subjects; guidance counsellors needed better support in respect of information on the wide variety of STEM careers available; role models should be advocated and more females in the STEM field might help - another point that was brought up, however, was that role models did not necessarily have to be female to encourage a girl into taking STEM subjects; more flexibility regarding workload and family in terms of job sharing, the provision of cr&egrave;che facilities and retraining after parental leave, as STEM careers are fast paced - therefore, it is important that parents be comfortable in taking parental leave before resuming their jobs; this may be where we are losing much of the STEM workforce; and encouraging Government, industry and schools and colleges to work together more to maximise the impact of their programmes on students, teachers, parents, guidance counsellors and people in general to make sure information was getting out.<\/p><p> These are my recommendations.  I hope to conduct a more in-depth analysis of my data and enter my project in the SciFest competition in May.  I enjoyed working on my project very much and thank the committee for listening to my presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015021000002#BB00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Anna Porter","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423575000,"counter":138,"content":"<p>Thank you, Ms Porter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015021000002#DD00200","speaker":"1099"},{"type":"speech","time":1423575000,"counter":139,"content":"<p>The two ladies were first class.

Culture is an interesting aspect of this issue.  Cultural factors in teaching and nursing, for example, have led to a gender imbalance in these professions.  There is also a cultural background to the gender imbalance in respect of women in enterprise.  Education plays a massive role in that regard, while flexibility in work practices is also important.  Ms Bushnell worked in the United States, where there is even less flexibility and maternity leave arrangements and so on are not as good.  I advocate stronger supports to provide flexibility for women in enterprise.

The Deputy is correct that there are no supports of that nature for women who have kids and want to be entrepreneurs.  What helps as an entrepreneur if one has young kids is that one can choose one's own hours to work, which is great.  That helped me because I had my son in 2009 and started my first start-up when he was two years old.  I could spend an hour with him in the morning and then go into my home office - the proverbial working out of a basement - work for a few hours, get stuff done and make conference calls before checking on him and returning to the office.  Even though somebody else had to mind him - in my case, my husband who also had a flexible arrangement in his profession - it allowed me not to leave him all the time at a young age and not to see him when I was working.  The positive side of having young kids and becoming an entrepreneur is that there is no clocking in and clocking out.  A person may end up working late hours, or early in the morning or having to be creative about what he or she is doing, but it gives flexibility to choose the hours he or she works and to be deliberate about when he or she works.  However, he or she will end up working long weekends and so on.  It is not ideal, but the flexibility was massive for me knowing that I did not have to get up every morning and take the subway into the city to a job.  Every day was different and I could be there at different times.  That was important and added a great value to our family life.

One cannot get early stage funding in the United States for feasibility studies, demonstrations and so on to build a minimum viable product, MVP.  People get on with it by looking to friends and family to support them and \"bootstrap\".  It is great to provide funding in the early stages, but I am concerned that companies may spend more time focusing on securing the funding than figuring the market they are entering.  I would love to see more emphasis on validating the market and predicating the funding on market validation at certain stages.  One does not have to have the complete map of the market in one's hands, but I still see companies that focus on funding and when they get it, they still have not figured the product market fit, what the market looks like, how big it is, who the customers and competitors are and not spent time in the market pressing the flesh.  Sometimes in Ireland it feels a little like putting the cart before the horse when it comes to early stage funding.<\/p> <p>  Later stage funding is hard to get, as everybody says.  Here it is hard to get series A, B or C funding.  It is challenging to obtain funding in excess of &euro;1 million.<\/p><p>Anyway, the good news is that then we co-invest with great partners in the United States and the United Kingdom.  They bring that smart-market focus or emphasis to the start-up to help it to get into those markets.<\/p><p> We need more later-stage funding for companies here.  It is all about scaling.  I joke that an entrepreneur is a tourist until she starts scaling.  A woman is not an entrepreneur until she starts scaling a business.  Ideally, it is not until she has revenue but at the least she must have customers.  Until an entrepreneur has a product she is not at the races.  It is a question of lean, lean, lean until she can get to there.  Then, we should focus all our support on picking winners and helping those companies to scale with funding, market intelligence, role models and mentoring etc.  That is my view generally on the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015021000002#EE00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Niamh Bushnell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423575000,"counter":150,"content":"<p>Ms Porter, you referred to the project you are entering into the SciFest in May.

These are women who operate at a very high level operationally.  They operate tight and successful ships and they are great leaders.  If we give women the necessary support at the early stage in order that they stay with it and can build their vision over time, then it is likely they will be more successful than men at bringing it to fruition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015021000002#FF00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Niamh Bushnell"},{"type":"speech","time":1423575000,"counter":154,"content":"<p>Thank you.

With the indulgence of the committee, I will use the acronym PRB for brevity as I go through my statement.  The board is now a little over a year in existence.<br\/><br\/>The Pyrite Resolution Act 2013 was commenced by the then Minister on 10 January 2014 and the board was appointed immediately thereafter.  The board consists of myself as chairman and three other members.  It has a small staff supplied from existing staff of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Housing Agency.  The board does not employ any staff directly.  Some administrative, information and communications technology and legal services are provided by or through the Housing Agency.<br\/><br\/>At the request of the clerk to the committee we supplied in advance an opening statement for the information of the committee.  We hope the committee finds this helpful.  It sets out in detail the provisions of the pyrite remediation scheme and the arrangements in place for the implementation of remediation of eligible dwellings, current activity levels, funding and other significant aspects.<br\/><br\/>The Oireachtas passed the Pyrite Resolution Act with the purpose of providing for Exchequer-funded remediation of houses and apartments suffering significant damage due to pyritic heave of floors in cases where the owners have no other practicable option.  The PRB, which had previously been operating on an informal basis, was appointed under the Act and mandated to draw up a scheme for the remediation of pyritic damage to dwellings, accept applications from affected homeowners and direct and oversee the implementation of a pyrite remediation programme.  Responsibility for the testing of dwellings and the execution of remediation works is assigned to the Housing Agency.<br\/><br\/>The pyrite remediation scheme sets out the conditions that must be satisfied to qualify for remediation under the scheme.  They require, <i>inter alia<\/i>, that a dwelling must be assessed and certified in accordance with the relevant Irish standards as having a damage condition rating of 2, attributable to pyritic heave; a dwelling must be located in Dublin city, Fingal, Meath, Kildare or Offaly, although this has now been extended to include South Dublin and D&uacute;n Laoghaire local authority areas; a dwelling must have been constructed and completed between 1 January 1997 and 12 December 2013; and the applicant must be able to satisfy the PRB that he or she has no other practicable option to remediate the dwelling.<br\/><br\/>The terms and conditions of the pyrite remediation scheme were produced by the PRB on 13 February 2014 with the approval of the Minister.  They are bound by the parameters set out in the Act and have regard to the findings of the pyrite panel that reported to the then Minister in June 2012.  Following consideration of representations and evidence from affected homeowners in locations outside the remit of the original scheme, the board has now amended the scheme, with the Minister's approval, to include South Dublin and D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown areas.<br\/><br\/>For a dwelling included in the scheme, the costs to be met out of public funds in addition to remediation works include the services of a building professional to specify and supervise the works, the general cost of managing the programme and necessary vouched costs incurred by the applicant on alternative accommodation as well as removal and storage of belongings.  The building condition assessment will also be met within stated limits.<br\/><br\/>As I have said, the Act sets out the respective functions of the PRB and the Housing Agency.  I am pleased to note that the two bodies have been working together efficiently and effectively.  This co-operation is underpinned by a memorandum of agreement that sets out the respective roles in the interests of clarity and accountability.  Financial accountability is vested by the Act in the Housing Agency.  The PRB and the Housing Agency have collaborated in the design and installation of an online system for the making, receipt and processing of applications.  The system is working efficiently, it is user-friendly and enables applicants to track the progress of their applications online.<br\/><br\/>The PRB has secured an agreement with the HomeBond company, under which the company is committed to provide staffing and services to the value of &euro;2 million towards the implementation and administration of the pyrite remediation scheme.  These arrangements, which include the provision of testing of hard core, are working satisfactorily.<br\/><br\/>The PRB is acutely conscious of the need to ensure that the draw on public funds is kept to a minimum consistent with achieving the scheme's objectives.  To ensure value for money, framework panels have been set up for building professionals and contractors following open tendering.  Contracts for individual projects are subject to further tendering from these panels.  There will be strict control on cost overruns.  Individual applications, when approved, are grouped into projects to secure maximum efficiencies consistent with the need to ensure that the works are not unnecessarily prolonged for the homeowners.  The Act recognises that it will not be possible to carry out all these remediation works at once and provides that the PRB will progress the remediation programme in accordance with a system of priorities based on given criteria.  The pyrite remediation scheme makes provision for the ordering and prioritisation of works in accordance with these provisions.  The PRB and the Housing Agency have put in place procedures for the creation of an orderly schedule of projects to be progressed through the implementation stages of the scheme.  We are keen for this to be seen as an informative, objective and fair process.<\/p><p> With regard to activity in terms of applications received by the PRB, up to end January 2015 632 applications had been received, of which 146 are still awaiting validation - stage 1 - mainly due to the issue of alternative practicable options not being resolved.  A further 158 cases are at the testing and verification for pyrite stage and 328 applicants have been notified of inclusion in the scheme, of which 230 are in the process of having remedial works plans prepared.  A further 73 cases are in the tendering process and work is about to commence on a project covering 20 dwellings.  Five dwellings have been already remediated and I am glad to say that this pilot project was completed on time and within budget.  The homeowners concerned have expressed satisfaction with the process.  The stated aim of our strategy and business plan is the remediation of 600 dwellings over this year and next year.    <\/p><p> On funding, total expenditure on the process in 2014 was &euro;1.1 million.  This money was made available, as required, through the Department's Vote and at year end the PRB was allocated a further &euro;1.1 million to cover contractual commitments at the end of the year.  The Department's Estimates for 2015 provide a capital allocation of an additional &euro;10 million to fund the programme going forward.  The availability of funding has not been an issue that in any way affected progress on the scheme.  <\/p><p> The legislation provides that the PRB will recover from any party with a liability and the capacity to pay all or part of the cost of remediating a dwelling.  While the PRB does not consider the initiation of legal proceedings to be a practicable option for homeowners it is taking action where considered appropriate to pursue builders or developers for a contribution towards the cost of the works.  The level of co-operation forthcoming from builders and developers varies but some success has been achieved, thus reducing the burden on public funds.  This is a legally complex and demanding area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2015021000002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John O'Connor","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1423578000,"counter":163,"content":"<p>Deputy Fergus O'Dowd took the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1423578000,"counter":164,"content":"<p>The PRB and the Housing Agency are acutely aware at all times of the difficulties and distress endured by homeowners whose homes have been damaged by pyrite.

The problem does not exist nationwide.  It can be identified as involving a defined number of quarries in a relatively defined area of the country.  The pyrite board considered it better to start off and define the areas where we saw the problem properly identified, taking account of the evidence presented to the pyrite panel.  Noel Carroll was a member of the panel and he will add to what I have said.<\/p> <p>  We had evidence in respect of certain areas and 600 applications came in - a small number came from D&uacute;n Laoghaire and south Dublin.

We came to the conclusion the scheme should be extended to include these areas because there was a genuine issue here.  The board extended the scheme and the Minister approved this last week.  If corresponding evidence arises for areas beyond those covered at present the board will look at that.  It is not a closed shop. <\/p> <p>  We dealt with block work and concrete product in reply to Deputy James Bannon.  The Deputy asked how many houses had been done and the answer is five.  We did a pilot project of five dwellings to test the system - the drawing up of contracts and remediation plans, consultation with occupants, getting them to vacate premises etc.  There are many stages to be undergone.  It might appear slow initially because we have in operation for a year and have only completed five but we are progressing.  Five are finished satisfactorily, on time and within the budget.  We have contracts in place with another 20 to be followed by further contracts in the months ahead and the numbers will increase.  We will draw up remedial work plans - one does not just give a builder a job, plans must be drawn up by an engineer and so on.   We can go into more detail on the process if members wish.  We are putting in place a schedule of work,  grouping individual applications into viable projects.  We are not doing one house jobs.  They are grouped giving the engineer a remit to draw up the plans for the required remediation work, moving on to the tender stage, getting the person to vacate the dwelling and then on to doing the work.  There is a lot happening but it is going a bit under the radar in terms of numbers completed.  <\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about costs.  We are in the middle of tendering at the moment.  I am reluctant to go into details about costs as the information is commercially sensitive.  I have no trouble sharing cost information in private with the committee but I do not wish to prejudice ongoing commercial tendering. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2015021000002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John O'Connor"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1423578000,"counter":183,"content":"<p>The red, amber and green came up first in the context of the pyrite panel report.

If one is joining and one's property only has a one rating one may very well be taken into the scheme as an exception because of the impact of what is happening next door to one's own premises.  <\/p> <p>   Deputy Ellis mentioned HomeBond.  I will not comment on the comment that HomeBond got off lightly.  All I will say is that the PRB has negotiated a certain level of contribution to the implementation of the scheme with HomeBond in terms of testing services which they are in a position to provide.  The PRB has received a commitment from HomeBond to provide testing and other services to the value of &euro;2 million over the next couple of years.  The PRB is keeping an eye on how well these services are working.  To date, as I said in my opening remarks, it is working out pretty well as we had anticipated.  It is something that the board set out to do at the start, that we would try to secure whatever contribution we could from HomeBond in terms of easing the burden on the tax payer.  The Deputy mentioned the issue of the pursuit of builders and developers the board is conscious of the need to do that and is doing it.  Mr. Carroll has spent a lot of time on this particular aspect.  It has taken quite a lot of time as it is a legally complex matter.  The level of co-operation from builders and developers varies a lot.  Some of them, quite honestly, are good and others are not so good.  It is interesting to observe how different companies and different developers have reacted to this.  Mr Carroll might say a bit more on this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2015021000002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John O'Connor"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1423578000,"counter":186,"content":"<p>I am happy to say some of those are coming to fruition and will provide significant contributions to the scheme.

The standards that are being implemented come in two parts - part 1 and part 2 I understand - for sub-floor and the testing of the sub-floor.  Is there any scientific geological survey of the country to find out exactly from where the pyrite emanates?  We have inspections and architects and others signing off on buildings and that is leading to trouble in itself particularly for an owner signing of on one-off housing.  It would be good to pinpoint the problem.  Initially it was thought that it was all sand based but it has now been found that it can arise when quarry is blasted.  Is there a map?  I saw a map that just shows the areas that are included but it is not a geological survey map.  It is basically a pyrite identification map of Ireland.  Is there a proposal to have a geological survey carried out to determine which quarries will not be certified and should be closed down?  In this way the problem could be nipped in the bud rather than having multiple testing.  For example, if one house is built with stone from a certain quarry, it must be tested and another house built with stone from the same quarry must also be tested.  The same testing could be carried out 100 times on the same material whereas only one test would be required if the source of the stone was known.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2015021000002#F00600","speaker":"1135"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1423578000,"counter":189,"content":"<p>I reiterate that this is not within the remit of the PRB.

To put it in very simple terms, it depends on the type of pyrite it is but more than anything else it depends on the type of rock that it is present in.  In Dublin and its surrounding area the pyrite was in good quality limestone and did not create any problem.  Where it is present in mud stone it creates the problems because the mud stone is weak and the pyrite begins to expand in it.  It is very interesting to see.   One sees stone all around the city of Dublin; all the historic buildings, including this one, are all built in stone that has been there for hundreds of years and nothing has happened to it.  There is probably pyrite in it.  With mud stone containing pyrite, it is hardly in the ground before it starts to react.  One can see the chemical reaction and within a very short time it breaks in one's hands when picked up.  As it is such a ubiquitous material the means of determining whether a stone is at risk or not is through the testing standard, which works well.  It breaks down the individual chemical constituents and the various physical properties of the stone.  It is not very difficult to do.  <\/p> <p>  Now, one might say one quarry is okay and another is not but it is rarely that simple because there are different seams within different quarries.  The same quarry can have a harmful seam and that is why the management at the quarry, the process - as Ms Neary mentioned earlier- and the production control systems are so important.  Another element is that products are produced for different purposes.  One might take a load of the stone and decide to lay a temporary pathway into a field or something like that, and it will be suitable for this purpose, but one would not put it under the floor of a house.  That is why it is important to specify the stone that one has and to get evidence to support this, to have the paper trail on that.  If I were a builder and I was building houses regularly, given the history of these things in the past, I would do some testing on the site to keep them straight.  A code of practice is being prepared and is at an advanced stage.  I believe it is out for public consultation.  The purpose of the code is to advise people on the procurement of stone and how they should go about it.  That should cover all the trials.  I should also add that in the remediation process the PRB is carrying out, it is being ensured and certified that the stone that is going back under the houses meets the standards and that it is appropriate for its purpose and will not cause further problems.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2015021000002#F00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Noel Carroll"},{"type":"speech","time":1423578000,"counter":191,"content":"<p>I have another brief question.

The bottom line is if one does not have the damage one does not have the problem.  There could be pyrite and it might even have expanded a little but if it did not push up the floor, one would not go looking for it.  In truth there was no problem prior to the mid to late 90s in this area.  It is quite clear again from the pyrite panel report that it was the expansion in terms of the amount of stone being produced in quarries that prompted this problem to occur.<\/p><p>It would appear that people started using quarries that might have been marginal or not considered suitable before they started producing this stone, production of which increased from 30 million tonnes annually to 130 million tonnes annually.

During my 11 years as a councillor with Fingal County Council it was a major problem.  Fingal is one of the areas worst affected.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the establishment of the board.  As stated by Senator Keane, all of the quarries responsible for this are still operating.  To the best of my knowledge, none of them has had a licence revoked and nothing has been done to them.  Mr. O'Connor mentioned in his opening statement that up to end January 2015 632 applications had been received by the board.  Would he agree that that number of applications is a drop in the ocean in terms of the pyrite problem in this country?  As I understand it, the estimate of the number of houses affected varies between 10,000 and 20,000.  I do not believe that is an over-estimate for the following reason.  In my own estate of Castlecurragh in Mulhuddart there are 720 housing units.  I am not aware how many applications the PRB may have received from people in that estate but I know from the countless meetings I have had with residents of the estate on this matter that most of them have not submitted an application to it.  Most of them are still not aware that their homes contain pyrite.  When I was out canvassing around the estate I could see as soon as many of the doors were opened that the houses had been damaged by pyrite, to which I then alerted people.  <\/p> <p>  Pyrite damage tends to be a problem in estates made up mainly of starter homes, many of which are rented out.  I can assure Mr. O'Connor that the 632 applications received is only a drop in the ocean.  Of the 720 housing units in my estate, approximately 100 to 150 were represented at various meetings I held on the matter.  I know from those meetings that houses in only one part of the estate are affected, which may be a reason for the number of applications received to date being very low.  Within a two-mile radius of Mulhuddart, houses in another four estates are affected by pyrite.  One of the estates is a council built estate that is being leased to the Respond housing agency.  As I understand it, because the residents of those houses do not own their own homes they are exempt from the PRB scheme.  This is another anachronism.  Perhaps Mr. O'Connor would clarify if the scheme is to be opened up to people whose houses are decaying around them.  <\/p> <p>  Has the PRB considered taking out advertisements to advise people of the symptoms of pyrite?  It was only when I held public meetings and showed people photographs of what pyrite looks like that they realised their homes were affected.  In my view, the PRB needs to be more proactive in terms of making people aware of the scheme.  I presume there is a deadline for receipt of applications and so on.  Money needs to be spent on encouraging people into the system.  As a councillor I did a great deal of work in this area, with no help from the council.  I was accused on many occasions, when pyrite was not being openly talked about, of devaluing people's houses, etc.  Residents who purchased homes in my estate in the past five years are now living in pyrite-affected homes.  Secrecy does not do anybody any good.  As I said earlier, the figure of 632 is only a drop in the ocean.  I appreciate that things are slow to get started, that five houses have been remediated and the aim is to remediate a further 600 this year.  <\/p> <p>  Mr. O'Connor also stated in his opening submission that the availability of funding has not been an issue.  Surely it is an issue.  Work would be progressing much quicker if more money and staff were available.  Mr. O'Connor might think work is progressing at a satisfactory pace but I am a little more impatient because I am dealing constantly with people who have been living with the problem for many years.  <\/p> <p>  My next query relates to HomeBond.  When many of us bought homes we insured them with HomeBond.  At that time, it was the biggest insurer of homes and was State-advertised.  It is an absolute disgrace that it has forked out only &euro;2 million.  HomeBond under-insured all of us.  Surely, that is a crime.  It is criminal to take from people payment for premiums which one knows will not cover potential damage.  Other insurers like Premier Insurance did not do that and are doing a good job.  The &euro;2 million provided will remediate only six or seven houses.  I know from experience that the worked involved per house is between &euro;20,000 and &euro;30,000. <\/p> <p>  What will be done in regard to council and housing authority houses affected by this problem?  There seems to be a slowness to act by some of the housing agencies in this regard.  As elected people councillors can at least raise this issue but the housing agencies do not have that facility.  I am not picking on the housing agencies but they do not appear to have the expertise or knowledge to address their tenants' housing issues, despite that they are receiving rent from those tenants and that there has been no reduction in rent in respect of houses affected by pyrite.  Will the PRB consider inclusion of council and housing agency houses in the scheme?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2015021000002#G00300","speaker":"1195"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1423578000,"counter":196,"content":"<p>In regard to the quarries that are still operating, that issue is, as stated earlier by Mr. Carroll, beyond our remit.  On the number of applications received, we have in no way hidden the scheme.  Our website contains information about it and has received a great deal of publicity over the past 12 months.  As I said, some 632 applications have been received to date.  While the intake of applications was initially quite heavy it dried up fairly quickly.  We are currently receiving approximately three applications per week, which is only a trickle.  We were a little surprised that the level of applications dried up so quickly but at the end of the day we can only deal with people who have made applications to us.  I can understand that there may be reasons people do not want to apply and so on.  We would encourage people whose homes have been damaged by pyrite to make an application under the scheme.  Our website contains an informative document, which includes photographs of the effects of pyrite, to help people to make an intelligent assessment as to whether their homes are pyrite affected.  The Deputy might when dealing with people refer them to this document which will assist them in making an intelligent call as to whether their homes contain and have been damaged by pyrite.  To qualify, a house must contain pyrite and also have been damaged by it.  Also, there is no time limit for applications.

Pyrite is appearing in blocks; it is not pyrite heave which is within the board's remit and on which I have made representations.  I do not know the extent and scale of the problem, but I have asked some parliamentary questions, like my colleague.  I imagine there are people who do not know what they are dealing with in terms of the problems with their blockwork.  To what extent has the board been asked to look at this as a problem?  Ms Neary has explained that there are building regulations relating to blockwork, but the reality I have found in dealing with individuals in respect of one-off houses and estates is that the same constraints, restrictions and inability applies in pursuing those responsible for supplying faulty goods in the first place.  Some people did not know who had supplied the foundations, for example.<\/p> <p>  Watching the pyrite issue evolve and the establishment of the board, my understanding was that people would be compensated as a last resort when all legal avenues were exhausted.  The word \"pyrite\" only became current in County Mayo recently, but the same problems are facing people in finding a solution.  There is a great need to assist them on the issue of pyrite in blockwork.  I say this notwithstanding what Ms Neary has said.  In the past few years the building regulations have been tightened, as have the standards of workmanship, etc. that we expect.  We are talking, however, about houses that were built before the regulations were tightened.  We are postponing the inevitable, as the people I know do not have the means to fix this massive problem.  If the scheme could be extended on foot of the precedent in respect of pyrite heave, it would only be fair to those with pyrite problems in their blockwork.

The Conservative Party&rsquo;s partner in Government, the Liberal Democrat Party, has not gone along with that and neither has the Labour Party.  Unless the Conservatives win a clear majority on 7 May it is not certain that the referendum will go ahead.  Mr. Cameron indicated on Sunday in a newspaper that he might hold the referendum in 2016.  The original commitment had been for 2017.  Whether this referendum happens depends on the result of the general election on 7 May.  Recent opinion polls put the Conservative and Labour parties level in voter preferences.  Each seems to have 32% or 33% support which means that neither would win an overall majority.  Most of the political commentators say it will be a hung parliament with possibly another coalition Government or a minority Government.  Possible coalitions could involve the Liberal Democrats who are in coalition with the Conservatives but could go into coalition with the Labour Party.  The Scottish National Party, SNP, is expected to win a clatter of seats in Scotland.  It is a first past the post, winner takes all electoral system.  If the SNP gets even 40% of the vote in Scotland it could win almost all the seats and it looks as if that will happen.<\/p> <p>  Only a Conservative majority would lead automatically to a referendum on EU membership.  Neither the Liberal Democrats nor the SNP favours a referendum but it is not inconceivable that they would agree to one as part of a coalition.  That is pure speculation.  The Labour Party is opposed to a referendum.  If one pays attention to bookmakers' odds as a method of predicting the future, they will offer 4\/1 or 5\/1 against the Conservatives getting a majority and 10\/1 against the Labour Party getting a majority, which shows that they expect a hung parliament.  That of course could change.<\/p> <p>  There is no certainty that a referendum on UK membership of the EU will be held.  If a referendum were to be held in 2017 or possibly sooner there is no certainty that it would result in a vote to leave the EU.<\/p><p>There is no certainty it would result in a vote to leave the EU.  There are opinion polls hypothesising about a referendum and asking people how they would vote.  Mr. Cameron is saying that he would renegotiate the terms of membership in respect of immigration and other matters.  These hypothetical questions have been put to voters in opinion polls.  If a victorious Conservative Party could achieve some concessions in pre-referendum negotiations with the EU partners and if it recommended staying in, the polls suggest the electorate might vote to stay in.  A substantial number of people would vote to leave in any circumstances.  The conditional question has been put on the basis of David Cameron negotiating a new arrangement and some concessions.  When people are asked how they would vote if he recommended it, it is possible people would vote to stay in those circumstances.<\/p><p> Some members may remember a referendum on staying in or leaving held in 1975.  The Labour Party was in government at the time and the Conservative Party was keener on Europe than the Labour Party at that time.  It has reversed a bit now.  The referendum resulted in a clear majority in favour of remaining in the European Union, or the Common Market as it was.  A majority, it appears, would vote to stay in if the unspecified and hypothetical deal with the EU was recommended by the Conservative Party.  That would presumably mean the deal is recommended by all of the UK political parties, with the exception of UKIP, which will recommend leaving the EU no matter what happens.<\/p><p> There is no certainty that the Conservative Party will win the election.  If it does, there will be a referendum.  If it does not win, or if there is a coalition, there still might be a referendum depending on the deal done and the coalition that is in place.  The chances are there might be a referendum.  If there is one, there is no certainty about the result.  If some concessions are secured by the UK Prime Minister and the government recommends people vote to remain in it, it is entirely possible that there will be a referendum and that people will vote to remain in the EU.<\/p><p> I want to focus on the issues that this raises for us.  A number of them are quite important.  When Ireland joined the then EEC in 1973, Britain joined on the same day.  Ireland has never been in membership of the European Union without the UK and the UK is still our biggest trading partner.  If Britain were to leave and Ireland were to remain, Ireland would end up as the only Atlantic country, so to speak, in what would then be a continental Europe bloc.  To most observers, it seems that Britain would draw closer to the US if it ends up outside the European Union.  This could lead to pressure in British politics for an Atlantic trade deal between Britain and the US.  The US is another important trading partner of ours, as well as being the principal source of foreign direct investment.  That is not to say that we do not have a lot of trade with continental Europe, which we do and we have much more than we used to.  However, Britain and the US remain big economic partners for Ireland.<\/p><p> If Britain was to vote to quit the EU in 2016 or 2017, which looks unlikely but is not a remote possibility and is not something we could say has zero chance of happening, there would be serious consequences for Ireland under a number of heads.  It is worth reminding everybody that we never joined the EU until Britain did.  We applied to join in the 1960s, Charles de Gaulle vetoed British membership and we promptly withdrew our membership application on that occasion.  We have never been in the EU without the British.  Under the terms of the Lisbon treaty, there is a provision for countries to leave the European Union.  A British vote to quit would be followed by negotiations on the terms of departure.<\/p><p>There would be something almost like a treaty of departure for the United Kingdom in those circumstances.<\/p><p> Members should note these terms of departure would have been influenced by the pre-referendum negotiations that would have followed a Conservative victory in May.  In this scenario, there will be two sets of negotiations.  Let us pretend the Conservatives will win on 7 May, as that is the simplest situation.  They will win by getting more than 325 seats and while it does not look like this will happen, let us pretend it has happened.  There will then be a referendum, as the Conservatives will announce their intention to hold a referendum in one or two years' time or whatever.  That government then will seek to renegotiate with its European partners certain terms of the United Kingdom's membership of the European Union and it is pretty clear what those terms would be.  They would include Britain's budgetary contribution, about which people are unhappy, and various issues pertaining to immigration.  As everyone is aware, there is completely free movement of labour and movement of people throughout the entire membership of the European Union and some people in Britain are not happy about that.  There would be various other things like that.  There also is a lot of resistance in the United Kingdom to what is seen as excessive European regulation and such like.  There is a kind of eurosceptic opposition in the UK to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice and issues of that sort.<\/p><p> Consequently, the first thing that would happen following a Conservative victory would be an attempt by the government of the UK to negotiate various new terms under these various headings before the referendum.  Depending on the outcome of those discussions, that government would recommend whether people should vote \"Yes\" or \"No\" in the referendum.  The issues about which Ireland should be concerned will arise immediately after the election - if the Conservatives win and if there is to be a referendum - because whatever arrangement is arrived at prior to the referendum will condition the negotiations under the relevant article of the Lisbon treaty subsequently.<\/p><p> In view of this it is not the case that the Irish Government could wait until the referendum before it starts to take an interest in the matter.  The terms of ultimate departure for the UK, if that is what happens, will have been influenced by the pre-referendum negotiations that would follow a Conservative victory in May or the election of a Conservative-led government that opted to hold a referendum.  The Irish Government should insist from the outset on close involvement in these negotiations before the referendum.  There can be little doubt but that a Tory victory in May would concentrate minds in Europe.  I believe that many British demands would be met because nobody wants Britain to leave the EU.  I rather suspect the leadership of the Conservative Party does not really want to do so either but has been forced into promising this referendum by the rise of the UK Independence Party, UKIP, and eurosceptic sentiment.  Irish interests will be affected in both the pre-referendum and post-referendum discussions and the former are bound to influence the eventual divorce deal - if there is one - since the electorate's verdict will have been delivered on the terms put before it.<\/p><p> It appears to me there are three areas in which important issues will arise for Ireland.  There may be others.  The first is the free movement of people.  Ireland is the only EU member state which shares a land frontier with the UK.  Were this frontier to become the external border of the EU it could become difficult to maintain free movement without visas or passports.  It is worth reminding oneself that Ireland has never faced - either pre-1922 or post-1922 - immigration or passport controls of any kind with the UK.  Indeed, under the Government of Ireland Act, Irish citizens in the United Kingdom are called \"non-foreign aliens\".  I used to live there and used to be very proud of being a non-foreign alien, whatever that is, but the impact in this regard is that there have been free movement of labour, free rights to reside and all the rest between Ireland and Britain.  We were part of the UK until 1922 and the free movement arrangements, which are close enough to common citizenship, have prevailed ever since.<\/p><p>This reciprocal arrangement between Ireland and Britain goes beyond the free movement enshrined in the European treaties and predates our membership of the EU.  If an external border of the EU were to exist between Dundalk and Newry, people would need to be very careful to negotiate arrangements which would permit our current situation to survive, if it is possible.  The current arrangement is a more intimate relationship even than the Schengen Agreement between continental EU countries.  It is clear that immigration is a political issue in the UK, including immigration from countries already in the EU.  The issue of free movement will feature in the pre-referendum negotiations between a victorious Conservative Party, if that is what happens, and their European partners.  It is a very important issue for Ireland.<\/p><p> The second issue is the free movement of goods.  Ireland-UK trade is free of tariffs, quotas and customs inspections and delays.  Britain remains Ireland's key trading partner, particularly in labour-intensive sectors, and Ireland has a special interest in the details of whatever free-trade arrangements the UK might negotiate were it to depart the EU.  The post-referendum negotiations under the relevant article of the Lisbon treaty would be about such matters and the UK would try to negotiate a free-trade area deal with Europe.  A number of non-EU countries, such as Switzerland and Norway, have detailed free-trade arrangements with the EU.  We had a free-trade agreement with the UK in 1965, before we joined the EU.  We have completely free trade between Ireland and the UK.  There are no tariffs or quotas and, by and large, we have common standards and specifications.  The Irish economy is more integrated with the UK economy than those of the continental European countries.  It is also a matter of geography.  Ireland, therefore, would have a very special interest whatever free-trade arrangements the UK might negotiate.<\/p><p> Free trade in agricultural products could be difficult to maintain with Britain outside the EU.  The British have never taken to the CAP.  They think it is too costly and constantly grumble about it.  Agriculture would be a significant element of the post-referendum negotiations if exit from the EU is chosen.  There could be issues concerning GM foods, to which opposition in the UK is weaker than in continental Europe and which are accepted in the USA.  This is one of the bones of contention in the current negotiations on a free-trade agreement between Europe and the US.  If the UK were to leave the EU, it might regard the ability to depart the CAP as a bonus and seek to negotiate arrangements on agricultural trade that might not suit Ireland.<\/p><p> Free trade in services is another issue, and for the UK it means financial services.  Despite the UK's non-membership of the eurozone, the City of London remains Europe's financial capital.  London and New York are the two great financial centres of the world.<\/p><p>It is still the case that most wholesale financial markets are built around London.  This status is likely to come under threat should Britain depart the EU.  Both the French and the Germans have always been jealous of London's status as the financial capital in this part of the world and there have been attempts to wrest away some of the financial business from London to Paris and Frankfurt.  It is not an accident that the European Central Bank is headquartered in Frankfurt.  Germany has always wanted to build that city as a financial centre, while the French have wanted to do the same with Paris.  There are fears in the City of London that if Britain quits the European Union, it will be used as an excuse to screw the city's competitive position as a financial centre through various European regulatory oversight mechanisms.  Many people in the City are keen on Britain staying in the European Union for that reason.<\/p><p> Members may ask what that has to do with us.  The IFSC is partly a satellite of the London financial market, although many other activities are independent of London.  Ireland has persuaded people to locate satellite activities here for operations based in London.  Most people in the industry would agree that if the City of London gets screwed, it will not be good news for the IFSC.<\/p><p> At this stage it seems unlikely that the Conservatives will win the election.  One can get odds of 4\/1 or 5\/1 against that proposition in the bookies.  However, the election is nearly three months away and who knows what will happen in the interim?  Even if the Conservatives win and hold a referendum, voters might decide to stay in the EU.  Overall, a British exit from the EU is not the most likely outcome but stranger things have happened.<\/p><p> The Irish authorities should seek to get involved in pre-referendum discussions on the deal the UK might be offered, as well as in post-referendum negotiations should Britain opt to depart from the EU.  Ireland has more at stake in this matter than any other EU member state.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015021000002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423576800,"counter":260,"content":"<p>As I have to leave the meeting temporarily, I ask the Vice Chairman to take my place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015021000002#G00200","speaker":"1076"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1423576800,"counter":261,"content":"<p>Deputy Se&aacute;n Kyne took the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1423576800,"counter":262,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy for his comments on an important topic for Ireland, the UK and the future of Europe.

The Border, for trade purposes, has more or less disappeared.  There is no customs, and there are not that many taxation differentials North and South either now so the Border, as an economic barrier, has disappeared except for washing diesel and such practices.  For legal activities, however, it has more or less disappeared.<\/p> <p>  If the British leave the European Union an option for us would be to say, \"We are off with them\".  That is an option that should not be entirely dismissed but if the British leave and the Border becomes the external frontier of the European Union, that could be very awkward for the Border counties because we could end up with passport controls, customs inspections and so on at that frontier.<\/p> <p>  I spent a good deal of time in Croatia in recent years.  Croatia joined the European Union last year.  That has created a lot of hassle for small rural communities on the border between Croatia and Bosnia, which is not part of the European Union, and the border between Croatia and Montenegro, which is not part of the European Union either.  There were suddenly many more people marching around in uniforms and peaked caps making life awkward, collecting statistics and so on.  That is an issue, and we need to be alert to it.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Byrne raised the important question of the transatlantic free trade and partnership deal being negotiated.  That will take years.  One consequence, particularly if Cameron wins and accelerates the referendum to 2016, which is next year, is that the British might decide to be outside the European Union and negotiate their own transatlantic free trade agreement, not just with the United States but with Canada, with which Britain has traditional relationships.<\/p><p>We could also negotiate our own Atlantic free trade agreement, not just with the United States but also with Canada and Great Britain as part of traditional relationships.  It could move in odd directions in the event that the British leave.  The point was rightly made that Norway, Switzerland, Iceland and a number of other countries were not members of the European Union but that they had free trade access and that in some cases there was also free labour movement.  It varies case by case.  Countries outside the European Union would, I am sure, negotiate precisely these arrangements.  <\/p><p> This does raise the issue of how bad it would be for a European country that was not a member of the European Union.  The answer is that it would not necessarily be that bad with the right trade deal and the right deals on the free movement of capital and labour.  Such a country would not have much of a voice at the table when decisions were being made, but a lot of people argue that we do not have much of a voice anyhow.  Perhaps that might not be true in the case of Britain, but it certainly is true in the case of a small country such as Norway.  What does Norway lose in not being a member of the European Union?  One could argue that it does not lose very much.  It means that people do not have to fly to Brussels all the time, which is not a big issue.<\/p><p> It seems that the transatlantic trade deal will not be concluded by the time the referendum is held, if it is held at all.  The British could go off on a completely different tangent as regards transatlantic trade arrangements if they were to see a future outside the European Union.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015021000002#H00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423576800,"counter":270,"content":"<p>I congratulate the Vice Chairman and wish him success on his accession to the throne.<\/p> <p>  I compliment Mr. McCarthy on his address and paper.  He paints a very grim picture, about which there is no doubt.  A few issues remain that worry me a little.  To what extent does he think the outcome of the next British general election might be affected by the decision to hold a referendum?  It will have a considerable impact one way or the other.  This has not been included in the equation in any of the discussions I have heard.<\/p> <p>  I note Mr. McCarthy's speculation about Ireland and the United Kingdom ultimately removing themselves from the European Union.  That would be a disaster following on a disaster.  It would have huge negative consequences for Ireland, the United Kingdom and the European Union.  In terms of European unity, it would have a huge detrimental impact in that we would be reversing the concept of the European Union devised in the 1950s.  <\/p> <p>  I do not agree with Mr. McCarthy's assessment of some other European countries, Norway for instance.  It had other reasons for remaining aloof from the European Union - mainly to do with resources - and it was a shrewd decision on their part not to do so, but, of course, everything does not stay the same forever.  Even though it will have very considerable resources long into the future, fossil fuels may not be as useful, vital or pivotal as they are in the future.  That forms another part of the issue.<\/p> <p>  I am certain that if we see a slow fragmentation of what we have come to know as the European Union, we will see its disappearance.  That is the only logical conclusion one can come to.  That is why some members of the committee have advocated holding a series of meetings to address the issue of euroscepticism which means different things to different people?  What does it mean to the United Kingdom?  Usually we hear the words, \"we want less of Europe and more national input and influence.\"  How do we do this in a union of 28 countries?  Does every country wish to superimpose its own will on the European Union and does every country have to agree with this?  Things do not work that way in the real world - unfortunately.<\/p><p> One of the things we must keep in mind is that Switzerland, which is much in the news in regard to other matters at the present time, happens to be almost in the centre of Europe.  Unlike Ireland, it is not on the periphery, so there were compelling reasons as to why it should have certain concessions that were almost equal to membership of the EU, with the exception of not being able to influence decisions at the centre.  They have got that and they lobbied hard for it.  Some of us were here when they did that and it was seen as a concession.  I cannot see the same thing happening in this case.  I have a very sad feeling of late that a conclusion has been reached in the minds of some people across Europe that we do not want that kind of Europe anymore, we want a different, re-nationalised Europe.  If that happens, it will also be a political disaster.  Mr. McCarthy painted the picture of two political disasters - a disaster from this country's point of view, a disaster from Britain's point of view and ultimately a disaster from a European point of view.  Where does Europe go and why do we not address what appear to be fundamental concerns expressed by people across Europe?  <\/p><p> Everybody wants more freedom of expression.  When one is in a union, one cannot have the same freedom one had before.  Do we now agree with the concept of a union at all?  Do not forget that the fact that we do not have a single currency across Europe is an indication on the part of some in the Union.  Some may not qualify and some may not have the fiscal stability and stamina to enter the eurozone but, as I have pointed out before, I would like to see how it would work if the United States had a multiplicity of currencies.  It could never and would never work.  I strongly urge that sane people across Europe will do two things: address the consequences of an exit of some of the major players and address the fundamental issues - real issues, not imaginary ones - of European scepticism across the European Union, including in this country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015021000002#J00200","speaker":"957","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423576800,"counter":272,"content":"<p>I join my colleague, Deputy Durkan, in congratulating the Vice Chairman on his elevation, wishing him well in the role, and expressing my complete belief that he will distinguish himself in that role as he has in others.  I welcome Mr. McCarthy.  We have met on a number of occasions and he has good connections with the Breffni county.<\/p> <p>  Mr. McCarthy did not talk much about the role of UKIP, although I know there is now an expectation that it will not do overly well.  It just occurred to me and I would like him to comment on this: if UKIP got a number of seats, it would be very aggressive supporters of the referendum and of exit.  That could queer the pitch a bit, if it were to become partners in government, particularly with the Conservatives.  He might comment on how he would evaluate that.<\/p> <p>  This is a quirky question.  Mr. McCarthy is very much aware that there is a huge opportunity for traders in the Border counties - Cavan, Monaghan and across Donegal and Louth - for retailers and all kinds of manufacturers and small traders.  It would be no harm if he said it on the record here as we are in public session, because it is something we need to exhort traders along the Border to avail of.  As the euro is at its lowest level in a long time, there is huge potential to sell into Northern Ireland and to increase sales.  There is a huge opening for Internet sales.  While not completely germane to this meeting, it would be good to have Mr. McCarthy accept that point in public, because I would like to exhort traders in the Border area to grasp this opportunity, particularly in Internet sales.  There is a huge opening there, and it could be done by small traders.  It has a very low capital input.<\/p><p> If the UK were outside of the EU and sterling were weaker than the euro - that may not seem a reasonable hypothesis at the moment - that could have a significant impact in terms of UK tourists coming into our country.  Could one argue, in a perverse way, that if sterling were strong relative to the euro, we would have more tourism from the UK, as well as a greater potential for trade?  There would also be the converse, of course.  Is there a possibility that it may not all be negative and opportunities could be presented by the UK leaving the EU?<\/p><p> I share Senator Kathryn Reilly's concern over the customs issue.  We have spent years achieving normalisation in this regard.  To go back to a whole bureaucratic apparatus around the Border would be a great disimprovement in the lives of people there.  As we are an agricultural country, the GM foods issue and the difference in emphasis in that regard is another important consideration.<\/p><p> Could we stand alone with the IFSC?  Could we hold the jobs we have there or would there be much displacement of jobs?  While I am a layperson in this area, it makes sense to me that many areas of specialisation are satellites of London, the financial capital of the world.  How would we stand jobs wise in that regard?<\/p><p> I accept Mr. McCarthy&rsquo;s basic conclusion that we should be proactive in negotiating with the UK if it negotiates with the EU.  I am happy the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade is taking an initiative in this regard.  We should be proactive at the diplomatic level, using the Irish communities in the UK and our connections there to thwart the referendum in the first instance.  Failing to do so, we must ensure a deal would be negotiated that would work.  This discussion is very interesting.  Living where I live, the whole community stands to suffer if the UK leaves the EU.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015021000002#K00200","speaker":"971","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1423576800,"counter":274,"content":"<p>Deputy Durkan is right in that there has been a fracturing of cohesion in Europe over the past several years.  Eurosceptic parties of various types are on the rise in several European countries.  UKIP is the one that is relevant in this context but there are other eurosceptic parties in other countries such as the Front National in France.  There will be a presidential election in France in 2017 and current opinion polls put the Front National as the largest party.  While it might not win because of the run-off second stage in the presidential election, it must be remembered the Front National came second in 2002.  It then lost to President Chirac in the run-offs.  Clearly, the party is more popular than it was before.  It is not inconceivable that Marine Le Pen might win the presidential election.  One might get good odds against that but stranger things have happened.  She has said that the day she wins the presidential election, France will leave the euro, never mind the European Union.<\/p> <p>  One of the reasons for the rise of these eurosceptic parties across Europe is the euro.  The single currency was a premature project, badly designed and badly managed.<\/p><p>It has given rise to feeling in this and other countries, notably in Greece, that countries are getting screwed by Europe, a generalised notion which may not be reasonable but people feel it.  People have been attracted more to national sentiment rather than a European vision these past few years.  I think the common currency has done damage to the European project and if it comes apart, and that is still possible, it could do serious damage to the European project.  Let us leave that to one side.<\/p><p> If the British were to leave it would be a significant blow to Europe.  It is not as if Britain is a small country on the edge, it is one of the three important countries in Europe, along with France and Germany.  If Britain were to leave, it would be a huge blow to the European project.  I hope it does not happen.<\/p><p> On the question of how many seats UKIP might get, it is possible that UKIP could poll very well and win no seats.  The winner is the first past the post.  It is a very strange system.  It looks like the Scottish National Party will win a large number of seats and it will not stand candidates except in Scotland.  If one gets a large vote in a small geographical area one wins seats under the system of first past the post.  In reading up on the topic over the weekend I saw projections by people in the University of Essex based on their model of all 650 constituencies, having fed in the voting patterns in the most recent opinion poll as well as local elections results, and in one scenario, UKIP wins 15% of the vote throughout the United Kingdom and gets no seat.  That could happen.  It is not what they think will happen, but it is not inconceivable.<\/p><p> Let me address what will happen if there is a referendum.  People should resist the temptation to offer free advice to the British electorate as to what way they should vote.  As they will pay no attention to it anyway one is wasting one's sweetness.  We should focus on the fine print of the issues, how the external frontier of the EU is to be policed in counties Cavan and Monaghan and such places.  That is what we should focus on and the British electorate will reach a decision regardless of what we say.<\/p><p> Deputy O'Reilly raised the issue of the sterling exchange rate.  There is nothing we can do about it.  We decided in 1999 that we would use the euro and have no Irish currency.  The British decided that they would not do that.  Ever since the exchange rate between the euro and sterling is something that happens.  It is like the weather.  We have absolutely no influence over it, good, bad or indifferent.  There have been times when retailers on the northern side of the Border were doing fine and there may well be occasions in future when it is the other way around.  It is entirely outside of our control.<\/p><p> Deputy O'Reilly also raised the question of whether the IFSC could stand alone if there were problems in the City of London.  That is entirely possible and there are many good businesses in the IFSC that are independent of what happens in London and hopefully would survive and prosper.  The demise of the City of London has been predicted regularly down the years.  It was predicted that when the British decided to stay outside the euro this would be the death knell for London's financial business and that it would all migrate to Paris.  That was the fashionable view 20 years ago but it did not happen.  These businesses are sticky in the sense that the City of London has a big business in very technical areas, one such example is the reinsurance market.  The reason that business will always be there is because it has the infrastructure of the markets, companies and human capital that is devoted to these things.<\/p><p>London has survived and prospered as a financial centre against a lot of gloomy predictions made during the years.  That might even be true here, too.  Dublin has a lot of technical infrastructure in the financial services centre that is not easy for others to replicate.  Some of the businesses located there would certainly survive.  However, if there are ongoing operations, as there are, that provide support and back office services for companies in London and if these companies were to get into trouble, there would be a ripple effect here.  That would be inevitable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015021000002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423576800,"counter":277,"content":"<p>Mr. McCarthy is very welcome.

He is regarded as the sage of Ireland; the wise man who brought forward an bord snip nua and so forth, all of which we have survived and are still around.<\/p> <p>  The British would be absolutely mad to leave the European Union.  If that country wants to self-destruct, all it has to do is sign an order to leave the European Union.  The European Union is a massive market of over 500 million people, but, quite frankly, I do not think that will happen.  The British had a very narrow escape in the Scottish referendum, which possibly could have led to the break-up of the United Kingdom.  Surely they learned a lesson from it.  Now, however, they are proposing the break-up of the European Union, of which Britain has been very proud to be a member for a very long time and from which it benefited.  It has benefited enormously from its proximity and links with the Union.<\/p> <p>  I agree with Mr. McCarthy on the question of interference.  I argue that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and other Departments should desist from becoming involved in the campaign because such involvement would only be viewed as acting in self-interest.  It is in our interests that Britain stay in the European Union and it is tempting to go and canvass.  However, we know only too well how much we resented others becoming involved in the Lisbon treaty and other campaigns here.  We resented British parliamentarians and politicians coming here and telling us what to do.  That said, we could certainly try to be persuasive on a one-to-one basis in discussions through our embassies, business connections and so forth.  <\/p> <p>  There is, however, a positive side to all of this; it is not all negative.  If the British were to pull out - may God be good to them and I would wish them well - this would be the last remaining country in the European Union in which people spoke English in the context of inward investment.  Even the fact that there is a proposal for Britain to pull out of the European Union has affected investment decisions in board rooms in the United States of America.  The Americans are very wary because the way they see it is that if they were to build a plant in Britain and Britain then pulled out of the European Union, they would not have direct access to EU markets.  We have such access which we are guaranteeing.  Britain can do what it likes, but we are not pulling out.  As far as I know, that is the policy of all parties in this country.  I certainly subscribe to the view, as does Fianna F&aacute;il, that under no circumstances should Ireland leave the European Union.  We would negotiate an agreement with the British, in the event that Britain pulls out, which would be favourable to both sides.  Ireland is Britain's fifth biggest customer and we would not jeopardise this.  Ireland is a very big customer relative to its size.  <\/p> <p>  Frankly, it is useful to plan ahead.  One should never fatten the pig on the day of the fair.  People like Mr. Mc Carthy and other academics should be brought in by the Government to examine all possible scenarios.  We must decide where we would stand if this scenario were to come to pass.  It might not happen; for now it is hypothetical.  However, the fact that it has been proposed means that we must be alert.  That is why I am glad to see officials from several Departments and the Taoiseach's office here.  They are watching the situation closely and I presume there are officials in the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Taoiseach who are gearing up and assessing our position and objectives.  They are bringing in people like Mr. McCarthy to discuss the issues involved.  In that context, the committee is playing an important role in looking ahead.<\/p><p>Its role is to look ahead and provide a forum for people like Mr. McCarthy who holds an academic position to outline how they feel at this point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015021000002#N00300","speaker":"1140","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423576800,"counter":279,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. McCarthy.  We are usually accused of navel gazing but today we are gazing into a crystal ball.  The debate is interesting.  If Britain were to leave the European Union, it would be a disaster for Ireland.  Senator Terry Leyden says the British would be mad to do so, but there is also the expression about mad dogs and Englishmen out in the midday sun.  Britain might well take that route.  If that scenario were to happen, we must focus on what we should be doing in the run-up to it.  Mr. McCarthy says Ireland should be involved in negotiations on its exit.  Is there anything else we could do?  As Britain is Ireland's largest trading partner, should we line up a free trade agreement similar to the one we had in the past?  There is synergy and also, as Mr. McCarthy pointed out, an historical aspect to the relationship, as well as a trade aspect.<\/p> <p>  It would be a disaster for the peace process in the sense that we are selling the island as an all-island economy.  What impact would it have in that regard?  It would have an impact on ordinary people's lives.  At the height of the Troubles people were crossing back and forth.  It would change the dynamic if we were talking about an external border as happened in the early days of the State when there was more of a frontier mentality.<\/p> <p>  Mr. McCarthy referred to the negotiations.  There is almost an arrogance among the Tories that they will come out with a good deal, as they are talking about getting a favourable deal.  If a decision is made, will it strengthen or weaken their hand?  An element will say Britain was never really part of Europe.  Mr. McCarthy referred to the City of London.  At one stage the Germans would have loved to have had the City based in Germany.  <\/p> <p>  With regard to fortress Ireland, dealing with foot and mouth disease and animal health issues, we sell the island of Ireland from the aspect of tourism.  This is because Ireland is a small country and there would be ramifications.  We must sell it on the basis of the impact it would have on Ireland and Britain, rather than on the wider European Union.  Does Mr. McCarthy agree that this is the way to sell it?  There would be a major impact in places such as Lifford, Strabane, Blacklion, Belcoo, Newry and Dundalk.<\/p> <p>  Does Mr. McCarthy think it was a mistake for the then President of the European Commission, Jos&eacute; Manuel Barroso, to become involved in the Scottish referendum?  Mr. Juncker has become involved in the Greek issue.  Did it sour things in Scotland with the pro-independence parties?  What would be the impact on the EU budget if Britain were to leave?  We argue that the budget is not big enough to deal with current problems.  Britain moving closer to America makes sense, but I am more interested in what the impact would be on our small country.<\/p><p>It is understandable that people in Europe are sceptical about the way Europe is developing.  That is a legitimate concern for people in Britain and anywhere else.  We need to take those concerns about its development as a union on board.  Does Mr. McCarthy think the model that is developing is part of the problem?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015021000002#O00200","speaker":"1037","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1423576800,"counter":281,"content":"<p>Senator Leyden made a reasonable point, which I omitted to mention, namely, if Britain left the EU and we remained in it there might be some opportunities.  He made the point that we would then be the only English-speaking country left in the EU.  The others are catching up very quickly and English has become the business language not only of Europe but of the world.  It is worth thinking about whether in the event that Britain did leave, that would throw up some positive possibilities.<br\/><br\/>Deputy Crowe wondered if the British left would we be able to negotiate a separate free trade type of arrangement.  The fast answer is &quot;No&quot; because the EU is a single negotiating body for commercial policy.  Economists use the phrase &quot;commercial policy&quot; to describe anything to do with tariffs or quotas and so on.  The commercial policy of each member state of the EU is no more.  It is all done at Community level.  The divorce settlement would include the terms of trade access for Britain to the EU markets and <i>vice versa<\/i>.  Our position I guess would just fall out as a by-product of that.  It is not open to an individual country such as Ireland to have a trade agreement with somebody.  Ireland cannot negotiate tariffs or quotas with Bolivia or Mongolia or anywhere like that.

That is not the remit of the committee.<\/p> <p>  If the UK left and its economy improved - and the sky did not fall in - would other countries feel that they also would be better off outside the EU?

They will arise in the negotiations if the Conservatives win the election prior to the referendum.  So if we did not get involved prior to the referendum, the game could be over by the time the referendum got carried in the sense that commitments would have been made about some of these things.<\/p> <p>  The big European countries, particularly France and Germany, will go to some lengths to try to keep the United Kingdom in.  Everybody knows it would be an extraordinary blow to the Union if one of the three big countries were to leave.  Many efforts will be made to try to meet whatever grievances they may feel they have.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman asked if other countries would follow if the United Kingdom were to leave.  I cannot think of one that wants to.  Certainly euroscepticism is pretty strong in some parts of eastern Europe.  Hungary for example is not as europhile a country as it used to be.  There is some irritation with aspects of European policy.<\/p> <p>  The eurozone has a greater capacity to fracture European unity.  Greece is the obvious example.  Cyprus also feels it was badly done by and mistreated.  There is some unhappiness in this country about things the ECB did and so on.  The eurozone has the potential to be a source of political fragmentation in Europe, more so than the European Union itself.<\/p> <p>  I do not know of any country that is contemplating exit in the way the United Kingdom is.  There are two major political parties in Britain - the Conservative Party is one of them.  If one of the main political parties in the country is committed publicly to an \"in or out\" referendum, that is a pretty serious development.  I do not think that is the case elsewhere.  Even in France where the Front National is eurosceptic, it is talking about leaving the euro but not leaving the European Union - not at this stage anyway.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015021000002#Q00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1423576800,"counter":287,"content":"<p>Mr. McCarthy is right about the fears about GM food.  There is no scientific evidence, but there is a lot of emotion, which creates its own impetus.  There was also the fear that certain brand names would achieve a world monopoly in respect of certain products which would have an impact on poorer countries and developing countries in particular.  The scientific evidence is not there to support that.  However, we know of cases where multinational corporations for their own particular reasons exploit such situations and have always done so.<\/p> <p>  I do not agree with the tendency in this country to downgrade the euro's importance.  The UK is not in the euro and it had its own economic downturn.  It had all the advantages that we profess we should have had and would have had in the economic downturn, and still could not avert its own economic downturn.<\/p><p>It had the advantage of size in terms of economies of scale.  Ireland or other small countries would not have that.<\/p><p> I may be slow to understand these issues but I worry when people pick at the euro generally and wonder what would happen if we did not have it.  If there were more currencies and the euro was in a smaller space there would be wide-scale speculation in the financial markets among the various currencies, which always takes place but would take place to a much greater extent.  In the 1960s, I remember Harold Wilson, God rest him, speculating about what would happen next when there was a run on the pound; Mr. McCarthy might even remember that far back.  It was a serious situation and the Prime Minister of the country was virtually helpless to do anything about it.  Once the run started and it was perceived that the currency was relatively weak, immediately it went into a roll and it was effectively the end of a particular administration at that time.  I bring that to people's memories because that can happen, and will happen, if we continue to pick at the euro to the extent that it falters.<\/p><p> I will make a final important point.  The banking sector here, and across Europe, was strongly opposed to the euro at its inception and speculated grimly as to what the consequences would be for the banking sector.  It did not happen that way.  It self-destructed in a totally different fashion because of what I regarded was the lack of responsible controls.<\/p><p> I could go on forever but the Vice Chairman would not like that.  I am sure Mr. McCarthy is fed up listening to fellows like me as well.<\/p><p> The number of eurosceptics is growing.  Sweden and the Netherlands have their share of eurosceptics.  It was pointed out at a meeting of this committee not long ago that other countries are of similar thinking and, when pressed on that subject, the identity of those other countries was disclosed.  I would have serious concerns, as do many other people, both politically and economically, for the countries within Europe in the event of one country leaving or that starting an avalanche would end up reversing the entire European concept.  It would be a disaster for Europe, a disaster for the United Kingdom, a disaster for this country and possibly a disaster globally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015021000002#Q00400","speaker":"957","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1423576800,"counter":289,"content":"<p>I think the Deputy is right that nobody should be attributing all of this country's problems or those of other countries solely to the euro.  On the other hand, most people understand now that it was not designed as a proper monetary union.  It is only a common currency area and common currency areas are less stable than monetary unions.  The United States is a proper monetary union.  Nobody expects the Governor of Texas to sort out the banks in Texas.  The \"Feds\" do it in Washington.  Europe was not set up as a thoroughgoing monetary union.  Perhaps we will construct that in the next few years with more centralised bank supervision and bank resolution, and a centralised macroeconomic policy, but right now we do not have those things and in that sense I believe the experiment was premature.<\/p> <p>  It is certainly not the case that if we had stayed out of the euro everything would have been fine.  If we had stayed out of the euro we would have had a bubble, and we would have got into trouble.  The bubble might not have been as big but countries outside the euro had bubbles also.  Denmark, for example, is outside the euro and they had a bit of a banking bubble, and a housing bubble, although not as bad as here.  That is a complicated issue.<\/p> <p>  The more immediate threat to cohesion in Europe is not the possibility that the British might vote themselves out, although they might, but that some country might fall off the edge of the eurozone.  It nearly happened in Cyprus where there were capital controls and the currency was rendered inconvertible inside Cyprus, never mind externally, for a while.  That is no longer the case but an accident can happen.<\/p><p>It could happen that Greece exits the eurozone during the current poker game.  This is a dangerous game because it could result in a lack of confidence in the ability of Portugal and other countries to survive in the eurozone.  In regard to Britain, the committee is correct to be discussing the issue.  Chances are it will not happen, however.  If one was betting, one would bet that Britain will still be a member of the European Union in ten years' time but it is important to be alert to the dangers.  Given that a referendum is likely if the Tories win the election, it is important to get involved in the discussions prior to any such referendum because those discussions will determine the shape of the divorce settlement.  We have a legitimate reason for getting involved, namely, because it matters more to us than to any other country in Europe.  If our neighbour and biggest trading partner quits the European Union, we will be in the situation of being in the EU without it for the first time ever.  We would not have joined the EU if it had not.  We should remind ourselves of the practical reasons for that.  This is a vital national interest and we need to get involved at the earliest opportunity if a referendum appears likely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015021000002#R00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423576800,"counter":291,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy for his comments on an important topic which we will be pursuing in the coming weeks and months.

Although it is little under a week away from the meeting, and the final agenda may change, it is a useful opportunity to discuss the issues before finance Ministers at the Council.  This will be the second ECOFIN meeting under the Latvian EU Presidency, Latvia having taken over the Presidency for the first time from 1 January 2015.  I understand the Latvian ambassador to Ireland already briefed the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs on 20 January on the Latvian priorities for its term.<\/p><p>I will also provide a brief overview of the proceedings of the January ECOFIN meeting which took place in Brussels on 27 January and at which I represented Ireland.  The agenda was dominated by two main areas, investment and governance.  As part of the formal agenda, several items were approved under the A list procedure - that is, without debate - including the final compromise text of the anti-money laundering directive and regulation.  On the taxation side, the anti-abuse clause to the parents-subsidiary directive was adopted, along with a recommendation for a regulation amending Regulation (EC) No. 2532\/98 concerning the powers of the European Central Bank to impose sanctions.<\/p><p>Ministers discussed the European Commission proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the European Fund for Strategic Investment and amending Regulations (EU) No. 1291\/2013 and (EU) No. 1316\/2013, as detailed in the communication An Investment Plan for Europe: European Fund for Strategic Investments, which was published on 26 November 2014.  It is an initiative mobilising &euro;315 billion of additional investment from public and private sources over the period 2015 to 2017.  The Presidency updated the Council on the establishment of the <i>ad hoc<\/i>working party on the regulation, which involves the establishment of a European fund for strategic investments.  Ministers had a preliminary exchange of views.  This is a key priority for the Latvian Presidency, the European Commission and all member states in delivering jobs and growth for the people of Europe.<\/p><p>ECOFIN noted a Presidency report, Current Legislative Proposals, on the state of play in negotiations on current financial services legislative proposals.  This is a standard item at each Council and keeps Ministers appraised of the latest position on the individual financial services dossiers.  Ministers were then given a presentation of the Latvian Presidency six-month work programme outlining priorities in the ECOFIN area.  The European Commission also made a presentation on the communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on the Commission's 2015 work programme, entitled A New Start.<\/p><p>Minsters discussed two items under the heading of economic governance and commission communications.  The first one related to the communication from the Commission on the review of the six-pack and two-pack, entitled Economic Governance Review: Report on the Application of Regulations (EU) Nos. 1173\/201, 1174\/2011, 175\/2011, 1176\/2011, 1177\/2011, 472\/2013 and 473\/2013.  The review found that, overall, the reformed governance framework introduced by this legislation proved effective, although it acknowledged that the period of the review was limited.<\/p><p>The second item is another communication from the Commission which clarifies the flexibility in the existing rules of the Stability and Growth Pact, entitled Making the Best Use of the Flexibility Within the Existing Rules of the Stability and Growth Pact.<\/p><p>The Commission presented both communications together.  There was a broad-ranging discussion, and all parties agreed that progress had been made on these issues.  The Council will come back to these in due course as the semester process unfolds.  Finally, Ministers adopted the terms of reference under the agenda item Preparation of G20 Meeting of Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors on 9-10 February 2015 in Istanbul.<br\/><br\/>That was a brief overview of last month's ECOFIN meeting.  Now I will turn to the draft agenda for next week's ECOFIN meeting and provide an outline of the key issues that are likely to arise.  Work is continuing at the level of officials, so there may still be changes between now and the meeting in terms of content and the order of the discussion.  The draft agenda is divided into two parts.  The first part of the agenda relates to legislative deliberations.  These are items which are held in public.  The A-list items are matters agreed without debate.  At present there are no items under this heading.  These will only become clear as the agenda is finalised.<br\/><br\/>The next item is Investment Plan for Europe: European Fund for Strategic Investments (First Reading).  Ministers are scheduled to have a state of play discussion on this issue as a follow-up to that at the January ECOFIN.  The Presidency will update the Council on the progress of the <i>ad hoc<\/i>working party on the regulation.  Discussions are ongoing.  The Presidency is aiming to have an agreed Council position on the regulation to establish the fund by the March ECOFIN meeting in order to meet the deadline of agreement on the issue with the European Parliament by the end of June.<br\/><br\/>The final item under this portion of the agenda is the item on current legislative proposals.  This is the regular update from the Presidency on the financial services files.  The second part of the agenda relates to the non-legislative activities.  The first matter listed is the approval of the A-list items.  This is without debate.  We are not aware of any items under this heading at the moment.  The next item listed is 2015 annual growth survey and the 2015 alert mechanism report.  Ministers will have an exchange of views and adopt the draft Council conclusions on the 2015 annual growth survey and alert mechanism report.  I understand that the chief economist of the Department briefed the committee on 21 January last on this matter.  The publication of the annual growth survey kick-starts the annual cycle of the European semester.  The annual growth survey identifies broad reform priorities for member states, to act as a foundation for the creation of growth and jobs.  The 2015 survey has three pillars: a co-ordinated boost to investment, a renewed commitment to structural reforms, and fiscal responsibility.  The reform priorities set out in the draft Council conclusions, once considered and agreed by ECOFIN, are expected to be endorsed by Heads of State and Government at the European Council in March.<br\/><br\/>The alert mechanism report identifies the member states for which further analysis in the form of an in-depth review is necessary in order to decide whether an imbalance in need of policy action exists.  The draft conclusions note the Commission's intention to publish analytical work for the 16 member states whose readings suggest they are in need of further analysis.  These are expected to be published later this month.<br\/><br\/>The next agenda item is a follow-up to the G20 meeting of finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors on 9-10 February 2015 in Istanbul.  This is an information point.  Terms of reference were adopted by the Council at the January ECOFIN and the item will provide an update on the discussion and outcome of the meeting.<br\/><br\/>Next on the agenda is a Council recommendation on the discharge procedure in respect of the implementation of the budget for 2013.  The discharge procedure is the annual process whereby the Council makes a recommendation to the European Parliament on whether to grant discharge to the European Commission for the manner in which the annual budget has been spent.  At ECOFIN, the Council will be asked to consider and endorse the outcome of Council working group and COREPER deliberations on the Council's discharge recommendation to the European Parliament on budget 2013.  This is an annual item and requires a qualified majority vote.<br\/><br\/>Next up is the draft Council conclusions on the European budget guidelines for 2016.  The budget guidelines are the Council's input to the Commission preparations for the 2016 budget proposal, reflecting the Council's priorities for the following year's budget.  At ECOFIN, the Council is expected to endorse the draft guidelines.  <br\/><br\/>Turning to the next item, first assessment report of the high level group on own resources, there will be a presentation by Mr. Mario Monti, chairman of the high level group on own resources, which was established with the aim of undertaking a general review of the EU own-resources system.  That is the system by which the EU budget is financed.  At ECOFIN, the group's chair will present the first assessment report, which was published last December.  This initial assessment is a scene-setting document which, among other things, provides a background analysis of the current own-resources system, outlines the position of the various stakeholder institutions and highlights the issues to be considered in achieving reform in this area.  It does not raise any issues of concern for Ireland.  <br\/><br\/>The final item on the agenda is under the heading of any other business.  No items are listed on the agenda under this heading at the moment.<br\/><br\/>I trust the Chairman found the summary of last month's ECOFIN meeting and the outline of this month's ECOFIN agenda informative.  I believe they give a good insight into the current issues before the Council.  I thank the committee for its attention and, at this point, I am happy to respond to any questions or observations members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015021000002#B00600","speaker":"955","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423593000,"counter":302,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and his officials and thank him for his opening statement on January's ECOFIN meeting and the ECOFIN plan for next week.

The European Central Bank regards the investment programme as a very important parallel initiative to quantitative easing and believes that quantitative easing on its own would require an investment programme as well.  I expect things to proceed very quickly after Tuesday's ECOFIN meeting.  A national quota system is not applied to it.  Initially, the timeframe was very short.  We put in all the infrastructural projects which were available across different Departments and Government agencies.  The next step for us is to prioritise and to select, from the very substantive list that was put in, the shovel-ready projects which would have most effect on growing our economy by providing essential infrastructure or by expanding on essential infrastructure.  There is an indication that infrastructural projects with a trans-European relevance will be ones that continental Europe is interested in.

There was an election in Greece, which Syriza, the main opposition party, won.  It quickly formed a government, and a cabinet was put in place.  Then the Prime Minister and the Minister for Finance embarked on a diplomatic initiative around Europe and visited the bigger countries, in particular, while representatives of the various European groups visited Athens.  For example, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the president of the Eurogroup, went to Athens.

We know in general terms from the election campaign what they require, but they have not specifically put a request on the table.  The Irish position is that we do not favour write-offs.  Write-offs or write-downs will put a hole in the balance sheets of all 28 member states.  There are other ways of meeting the objectives without writing off the capital amounts on the balance sheets.  Beyond that, I will listen to the Greek proposals and treat them on their merits.

One suggestion for a bridge is that the Greek authorities would be allowed to sell treasury bills up to the level of the bridge required.  Originally they were talking about &euro;15 billion, but it now appears the bridge would be more than that, because there has been fall-off in the collection of taxes.  The European Central Bank has set a limit on the amount that can be raised on treasury bills.  If that request is made, the first intervention in reply will be by the European Central Bank.  It is a technical issue, so I am not quite sure.  There are media reports that there will be a four-pillar approach, but I do not know whether that is correct.  I do not wish to speculate on it.  The Deputy is familiar with the suggestions that have been made in the newspapers, and that is one of them.<\/p> <p>  The German reports were that a programme is finishing in February, that the conditions of the programme have not been fulfilled by Greece and that Greece should fulfil those conditions.  The negotiating space is to negotiate a new programme.  That appears to be a rejection of the bridging proposal by one of the lead participants, but we must wait and see.  There are various other suggestions around, but I do not know what weight the Greek Government would attach to them.  However, they are attributed to the Greek Government.  One of them is that it would be willing to comply with 70% of the reforms and it would like to replace the other 30% with structural reforms as designed by the OECD.  The OECD would be generally recognised as the international authority that is best fitted to restructure economies and certain aspects of countries' economic approach.  That is one of the pillars.  There is also a suggestion that instead of having a primary surplus of 3%, as required at present, the Greeks will seek to have that reduced to 1.5%.  Then there are proposals on debt reliefs and debt swaps of various types, including growth-linked bonds.<\/p><p>The European Central Bank is the first responder, but it seems there are technical difficulties immediately once one goes down that route.  I do not know whether the newspaper and media reports are correct, but there is an indication that it is somewhere in that space.

I thought there would be more time, but things have moved very rapidly in a very short space of time.  However, I do not think the discussions will conclude tomorrow.  We will have the Eurogroup meeting, to be followed by the ECOFIN meeting on Monday and Tuesday next.

We negotiated the changes and I put forward the proposition in Europe that, as far as I was concerned, it was one piece of the negotiations, that there would be rolling negotiations over the lifetime of the Government.  As late as last September, we were still negotiating changes and got our colleagues to agree to refinancing the IMF loans, for example.

I do not want to overdramatise it, but I cannot understand why the Minister and the Government are stabbing the Greek people in the back.  In the process we are stabbing in the back all of the victims of failed austerity policies, including in this country, by refusing their initial proposal, which is very clear, that there be a debt conference along the lines of the post-war debt conference, from which Germany benefited, with a 50% write-down of debt and an extension of the rest of the debt for such a period that it effectively wrote it off.  This allowed for the reconstruction of Germany and, essentially, the rebuilding of Europe.  It was a very good proposal and I do not understand why the Minister did not support it.<\/p> <p>  Does the Minister accept that the election result in Greece stems from the fact that the policies pursued by the troika have been a disastrous failure in Greece?  Is it not absolutely obvious that the policies have been a disastrous failure?  We have seen the verdict of the Greek people against the background of a humanitarian crisis caused directly by austerity.  It did not produce the growth the troika stated it would, led to a collapse of the economy and produced a humanitarian crisis, which is appalling.  It turfed thousands of workers out of their jobs and slashed incomes, leaving 40% of young people in poverty and 26% unemployed.  The Greek people have rightly said this policy is not working and that we need a radically different approach, saying the debt is unsustainable and needs to be written down and that we need an end to austerity policies.  Does the Minister agree that they are right to say austerity has not worked?  We should support them in saying, after six years, that it is clear it has not worked, that we need a different approach and that the proposal was a fair and reasonable one in order to start looking in different directions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015021000002#G00800","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1423593000,"counter":386,"content":"<p>There have been problems in a number of European countries.

They have not mentioned a debt conference in any of their bilaterals as reported in the international press or in my briefing notes.

It is stuck at a fixed exchange rate compared to the drachma.  I predict that this problem will recur despite efforts to make up for it via massive transfers.  The lack of an exit mechanism may be a design fault in the euro.  Apparently a state can leave the EU but it cannot leave the currency.  Greece's problem is that it is locked into a relationship in which it cannot survive.<\/p> <p>  Last Friday I attended a meeting in TCD which Deputy Boyd Barrett addressed.  I was only in the congregation, but it was interesting.  One of the speakers was from Syriza and some of her comments were relevant to the Irish case.

Margaret Hodge, MP, the chair of the Public Accounts Committee in the UK, pointed out that some of the financial institutions which not long ago were knocking on the UK Treasury's door to ask for a bailout are now facilitating tax avoidance in a number of countries, at great cost to the rest of society but substantial profits for the banks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015021000002#H01200","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1423593000,"counter":411,"content":"<p>I fully share the Senator's views on tax evasion and tax avoidance.

There are many people trying extraordinarily hard to sort things out.  It is a very difficult model.  We must remember there was civil war in Greece until 1949.  When our Civil War was over there was conflict between the combatants, but in Greece there were a lot of consequences for the losing side.  People in the public service were forced out, and a lot of people emigrated.  Nearly half a million Greek communists settled in Bulgaria.  There was huge emigration to the United States, Canada and Australia.  As a result of what happened in the 1950s, Melbourne is the second biggest Greek city in the world after Athens.  When the first left-wing government formed in 1980 under Mr. Papandreou senior, its policies also had consequences because he attempted to right the wrongs of what had happened after the civil war.  The civil service and the public sector were increased dramatically so he could have his own supporters in there.  Our Civil War was not as extensive, but by 1924 the sons of opposing combatants were playing on the same Gaelic football teams, and people were doing business together and were intermarrying.  That is not the way it happened in Greece.  The Greeks had a difficult past, interrupted by the colonels taking over.  There is a long tradition and we should not be judgmental.  We should do our best to be of assistance, but we have our own priorities also.  That is the point I am making.

I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for inviting me to attend today's meeting.  It has been a privilege for me to serve as chairman of the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, since January 2012 when I was nominated to the position by the then Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar and last appeared before this committee.  I am honoured that the current Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Donohoe, has now nominated me to serve a second term as chairman of the group.  It has been a pleasure to work with him and his team in defining the objectives and direction of the DAA.<\/p> <p>  Before turning my attention to the DAA over the past three years and the objectives of the group going forward, it may be helpful to briefly outline my own background and qualifications for the job.  I am from Bishopstown in Cork.  I studied law at University College Cork and qualified as a barrister in King's Inns in Dublin.  I then moved to the United States of America, where I completed a Master of Laws degree at Harvard Law School.  I began my career with a Wall Street law firm before joining the Irish law firm, Arthur Cox, to run its New York office.  I returned home to Ireland in 1996 after seven years in the US.  I was elected managing partner of Arthur Cox in 2003 and re-elected to the position for a second and final term in 2007.  I continued to be a practising corporate partner in Arthur Cox, which employs 700 people and is one of Ireland's largest law firms.  I am also a non-executive director of Paddy Power plc which is listed on the Dublin and London stock exchanges and now employs over 3,000 people.  <\/p> <p>  When I became chairman of the DAA in early 2012, the company faced some significant challenges which I outlined in my nomination hearing before this committee at that time.  The previous chairman of the company had resigned, the term of the company's then chief executive was coming to an end and there were several vacancies at board level.  Traffic at the airports was weak, debt levels were high and relations between the company and the shareholder - the State - as well as some of its primary customers, were often quite strained.  Morale among staff at the DAA was low and shortly after my appointment, Dublin Airport was served with an Article 15 security compliance notice by the European Commission.  <\/p> <p>  Since then I am happy to say that traffic at Dublin Airport has increased by 16% to 21.7 million passengers, making it one of the best-performing EU airports in terms of traffic growth over that period.  We have reduced our debt levels by 20%, or &euro;150 million.  We have rebuilt a very strong and cohesive board and critically, have found an exceptional chief executive in Mr. Kevin Toland to lead the group forward.  Under Mr. Toland's leadership we have restructured and reinforced management and the way we run the company.  We have redefined the company's values and developed a clear strategic plan.  We have been clear in our objectives and have communicated actively with all of our stakeholders in realising them.  We have refocused Aer Rianta International, ARI, our international duty-free business and have initiated a promising new business in daa International.<\/p><p> Our relationship with our shareholder, that is, the State and the Department, is cohesive and transparent and we have returned to our roots of being a customer-focused organisation.  We have totally reorganised and reinforced our approach to security and have been focused on restoring staff confidence in management and sense of purpose as a team.  Above all, we are playing our role in the economic recovery of the country, in terms of passenger numbers and our intention to return to paying dividends to the State.  Dublin Airport and Cork Airport are also providing the central support to the ConnectIreland initiative, which is creating more than 1,000 sustainable jobs in the country over the next three to five years.  Despite the progress we have made in each of these areas, real and immediate challenges remain for the group.  The two primary challenges are the resolution of the pensions position for our staff and the reduced traffic levels at Cork Airport, to which I will return in some detail.  Before that, I will focus on our journey at the daa over the past three years.<\/p><p> A good chief executive is the primary driver of everything at a company the size and importance of the daa.  He or she defines the business priorities, builds the teams and relationships and provides the leadership that makes a company successful.  The most important job for any chairman is to ensure that the correct chief executive is identified and appointed as well as supporting and challenging that chief executive in appropriate measure.<\/p><p> As our previous chief executive, Declan Collier, was leaving the company, my immediate priority when I was appointed was to find a new chief executive to lead the company.  Between the search process and notice periods this took nearly a year to complete, but the time was well worth it.  We were particularly fortunate to attract a person of the calibre of Kevin Toland, who at the time was chief executive and president of Glanbia USA and Glanbia Nutritionals, to join the daa in January 2013.  Mr. Toland had been with Glanbia since 1999 and had previously held the roles of group development director, chief executive of consumer foods and director of strategy and marketing.  Mr. Toland has been a transformational chief executive and precisely the kind of person we need in senior roles in the State sector.  Given time, I believe Mr. Toland will lead the daa back to being the jewel in the crown of semi-State companies it once was as Aer Rianta, for all stakeholders, including the State, customers and our employees.<\/p><p> I argued strongly before Mr. Toland's appointment for a remuneration policy at Government level which would allow the daa to pay its chief executive at a level more in line with his private sector value.  I make that argument even more strongly now, in respect of base salary and in reintroducing performance-related pay at chief executive level.  It is critical to the semi-State sector to find and retain leaders of Mr. Toland's ability.  I urge the committee to do what it can to assist the board of the daa in achieving this objective.<\/p><p> In addition to recruiting a new chief executive, the board of the daa was in a transition phase when I was appointed chairman, since the term of a number of non-executive directors had already ended.  I worked with the Minister on the range of skills and competencies required to build an effective board and I am pleased the Minister has put in place a board of strong calibre, the members of which, together with our worker directors, have worked in a focused and cohesive way to deliver our key shareholder priorities.  I wish to take this opportunity to thank my board for its support and dedication.  Moreover, I thank the former Minister, Deputy Varadkar, and the current Minister, Deputy Donohoe, for the care they have taken to equip the board with the people and skills we need.<\/p><p> In the transformation of Dublin Airport and the building of terminal 2, which has become a real success for Dublin Airport, the group took substantial levels of debt onto its balance sheet.  Over the past three years, we have made significant progress in eroding this debt.  In the three years from 2010 until 2013, the daa's net debt was reduced by &euro;151 million to &euro;614 million, which is equivalent to a 20% reduction in debt.  The daa has not yet produced its annual results for 2014 and, therefore, I am somewhat constrained in the detail that I can provide on last year's performance.  The accounts, when published, are likely to show a further overall reduction in net debt levels.  As with many large infrastructural businesses, the daa's debt profile is related to its capital expenditure programme and debt levels had increased to fund necessary capital investments at the airport.<\/p><p> At the end of 2011 the daa had a credit rating of BBB CreditWatch negative.  I am pleased that on the back of strong growth in the daa's business and its current profile the group's credit rating was late last year raised to BBB+ with a stable outlook.  This rating bodes well for the group as it prepares to re-finance its long-term debt over the next two years.  This is critical to the company.<\/p><p> I will set out the position on increasing passenger numbers.  In 2011 traffic at the daa's three airports was poor and had increased in that 12 month period only by 0.5%.<\/p><p>Since then, overall passenger numbers at Dublin and Cork airports have increased by 13% between 2012 and 2014.  This was due to a combination of the improving economy, Government policy on travel tax and VAT and very focused efforts by daa to attract and keep new airlines and routes over that period. At Dublin, passenger traffic levels are moving back towards peak levels and in some sectors of the business, we are seeing record levels of business.  Passenger numbers at Dublin increased by 8% to 21.7 million last year, helped by a record 2.1 million transatlantic passengers and good growth across all major markets comprising Britain, continental Europe, the Middle East and North Africa.<br\/><br\/>Last year's 8% increase at Dublin Airport followed a 6% increase in passenger numbers in 2013.  This growth at Dublin is outpacing the average traffic performance at airports within the European Union, as recent ACI Europe data show that passenger numbers across airports within the EU increased by 4.9% last year.  Dublin is also positioning itself as a significant hub for transatlantic transfer traffic, which is a new development, as a record 750,000 passengers connected at Dublin last year.  Pre-clearance into the United States by the US Customs and Border Protection in Dublin is at the core of our ability to provide this connectivity and is essential to the future growth of Dublin Airport as a hub.<br\/><br\/>I now turn to Shannon Airport and the renaming of daa. <b><\/b>In early 2012, when I was appointed chairman of daa, the Government was considering a number of options for the future structure of Cork and Shannon Airports.  In May 2012, the Government announced that it planned to restructure the State airports by separating Shannon Airport from daa and putting the former Shannon Development and Shannon Airport under a new group structure.  The establishment of the Shannon Group in 2014 brought together Shannon Airport, Shannon Commercial Enterprises Limited, which includes the Shannon Free Zone and a significant property portfolio, Shannon Heritage and an International Aviation Services Centre, IASC.<br\/><br\/>Shannon Airport was separated from daa on the basis that daa retained all of the &euro;100 million debt attributed to Shannon and this, together with the significant rent roll of the new entity, has provided particularly strong long-term financial support for Shannon.  In order to reflect the new structure of the business, the group's name changed from Dublin Airport Authority to daa last year after the State Airports Act 2014 became law.  The new name more accurately reflects the group's business, which now comprises Dublin Airport, Cork Airport and two overseas businesses, Aer Rianta International and DAA International.<br\/><br\/>I now turn to Cork Airport, which is a key focus of the company and of the board.  The growth in passenger numbers in daa is all generated in Dublin and masks the challenging situation in Cork, where passenger numbers continue to decline.  As a Corkman who grew up close to Cork Airport, this is a problem very close to my heart.  Despite a global survey finding in 2014 that Cork Airport was rated the World's Best Regional Airport for Customer Service by both business and leisure customers, passenger numbers declined in Cork Airport by 5% to 2.1 million last year.  Last year's traffic decline at Cork Airport was due primarily to Ryanair moving some of its eastern European flights from Cork Airport to Shannon Airport.  This was an unintended consequence of the separation of Shannon Airport from daa, with Shannon Airport now able to offer airlines materially greater incentives than Cork.<br\/><br\/>Kerry Airport enjoys direct State support and also has the advantage of direct State subsidy of certain airlines flying there on the basis of a public service obligation contract.  In contrast to Shannon and Kerry, Cork Airport has no such advantages.  In this environment, despite very dedicated efforts by daa management in Cork and Dublin to reverse the trend, traffic at Cork has continued to decline, despite the fact that airport charges at Cork have not increased in more than ten years and are highly competitive when compared to Cork's peers in Britain and continental Europe.<br\/><br\/>However, this is only part of the picture.  An airport is, in many ways, like a bus station.  It cannot generate traffic on its own.  It needs the active support of the region and active marketing to visitors to come to the region. We are perfectly poised to take advantage of this.  We have an excellent airport facility in Cork and provide a world-class product in terms of the customer service that we offer to passengers.  As a relatively small regional airport, Cork provides exceptional service, with 42 scheduled routes and great connectivity into Heathrow, Schiphol and Charles de Gaulle, the three major European hubs.  Therefore, we remain optimistic and are actively seeking answers to Cork.  We have established the Cork Airport Development Council to assist us in that task.  For the first time we have full board meetings each year in Cork and have a permanent sub-committee of the board focused on Cork Airport.  <br\/><br\/>Only 37% of Cork Airport's passengers are inbound, which is notably low by international standards.  This signals that there is significant potential for tourism growth into Cork and the wider Munster area.  However, this potential can only be realised by a cohesive and funded regional tourism emphasis on the region, perhaps most obviously in marketing Cork and the region more generally as the start of the Wild Atlantic Way.<\/p><p>The airport will continue to work closely with tourism and all other relevant agencies and organisations to exploit this potential market.  I ask the committee&rsquo;s support in generating the necessary tourism, policy and other initiatives to improve traffic to and from Cork.  In the meantime, we continue to work hard to attract new business to Cork and sustain the traffic we have.  This summer, Cork will welcome a new twice-weekly scheduled service to Prague from CSA Czech Airlines and the airport continues to engage with customers and stakeholders to help expand its overall traffic base.  We will continue to stay very focused on doing whatever we can to restore Cork to growth.<\/p><p> A focus on costs is a constant within the aviation sector, as it is within many spheres of business.  Between 2010 and 2013, overall costs at the group grew from &euro;248 million to &euro;250 million, which is an increase of less than 1% during those three years.  Within the Irish element of the business, costs have increased somewhat, due primarily to additional staffing in security areas, whereas costs in daa&rsquo;s overseas operation have declined as the mix of our businesses has changed.  Costs to our airline customers have not increased in recent years.  Airport charges at Dublin have been effectively flat since 2012 and will decline by 4% this year, while charges at Cork Airport have not increased in more than ten years.<\/p><p> Turning to pensions, which is a critical issue for us, finding a sustainable resolution to the challenges that faced the multi-employer Irish Airlines Superannuation Scheme, IASS, has been a major focus for the group for several years.  It is an area of critical importance to the lives of our employees and, as a board, we have enormous focus on resolving it in the best possible way.  The IASS had been seriously under-funded for many years and the roots of the problem stretch back to flaws in the scheme since its establishment nearly 60 years ago.  Last March, an expert panel was established by the Government, ICTU and IBEC to review how a final resolution of the industrial relations issues relating to the IASS could be secured.  The expert panel issued its report in June 2014, with separate recommendations for daa and Aer Lingus.  The extent of the funding issues in the IASS were such that the issues in question could not be resolved by the scheme&rsquo;s trustee without some impact on members.  In this context, resolving the issue was never going to be easy or painless.<\/p><p> It was unfortunate that the company found itself in a situation last March, faced with a potential closure of Dublin and Cork airports, that we had no choice but to secure injunctive relief from the High Court to avoid a SIPTU strike at the airport in regard to the pensions issue.  The view of daa was that the planned industrial action by SIPTU was unwarranted and untimely, as the expert panel had just been established to consider the matter.  Since the injunction was granted in March, the expert panel has reported and we have now, I believe, put forward an offer to staff and deferred members of the scheme which significantly bridges the cuts that have been made by the trustee to pensions they had contributed to, and offers a way forward on this very complex and understandably emotive issue.<\/p><p> daa is making a very significant investment to resolve this issue, with &euro;72 million being invested for employees and deferred members of the IASS.  daa will also fund higher ongoing employer contributions into the new defined contribution pension scheme for all current employees, which comprises 1,400 employees who were previously members of the IASS and 1,200 other daa employees.<\/p><p> Regrettably, despite protracted opportunities for engagement with unions, the company offer, which reflects the expert panel recommendations and which is open until 15 March, has not, as yet, been made within a collective bargaining framework.  As a result, the company has gone with the only available alternative.  In a situation where the IASS was frozen by its trustee on 31 December, daa has honoured its commitments within the expert panel report and made the offer available to staff and deferred members on an individual basis.  Deferred staff are in a position to benefit from moneys invested by the company in a pension scheme resolution.  Some deferred members are aggrieved that they are not in a position now to avail of an anomaly in the scheme which had previously allowed them to receive what was in effect a double pension &ndash; a full pension from the IASS with a State pension on top of that again.  The IASS was never funded on this basis and this anomaly has been removed by the trustee as part of the overall solution to the pension issue.<\/p><p> The company has communicated extensively to members of the IASS in respect of the offer and the board believes it has done everything it can to support as fully as possible the pensions position of its members.<\/p><p>The company is actively encouraging members of the IASS scheme to avail of the offer before the cut-off date.  I hope members accept this offer and secure their pension position, but I accept the decision is entirely within their hands.<br\/><br\/>The expert panel is currently re-engaging with SIPTU and ICTU to provide clarification on a number of points and the daa is assisting with this.  The daa's preference throughout this process has been to secure collective agreement for the company&rsquo;s proposal, which is a full and final offer to resolve the pension issues at the company and follows the recommendations of both the Labour Court and the expert panel.  I cannot however rule out the prospect of further industrial action being contemplated by trade unions over the coming weeks as we approach the deadline for acceptance of the offer.  We need to move forward, to bring closure to this difficult issue for everyone involved, for our employees for whom this is a critical issue, and for the company.  Deferring the date for acceptance of offer is not an option.  The Retired Aviation Staff Association, RASA, which represents former employees of the daa and Aer Lingus, has indicated in recent days that its members have voted to proceed with a legal challenge in regard to cuts in pension benefits imposed by the IASS trustee.  It is not clear against whom such a case would be taken.<br\/><br\/>On the question of regulation, airport charges at Dublin Airport are regulated by the Commission for Aviation Regulation, CAR, which last autumn completed its determination for the period 2015-19.  The daa's intention, which had been communicated to the CAR, had been to keep charges flat over the next five years to stimulate passenger growth while simultaneously prudently investing in key areas to facilitate expansion and further improve the overall passenger experience at Dublin Airport.  Instead, the regulator opted to reduce airport charges at Dublin by 19% during the period.  Dublin&rsquo;s charges are already 22% lower than the average airport charge at its peer European airports.  We believe this significant additional reduction is unwarranted and will inhibit the development of Dublin Airport as the key gateway to the country and materially reduce the daa&rsquo;s ability to return dividends to the State, with this value being transferred to private airlines.<br\/><br\/>The regulator&rsquo;s latest determination is further confirmation that the current prescriptive regulatory model is not working.  Dublin Airport typically accounts for less than two thirds of all air travel to and from the island of Ireland.  This provides the necessary scale for Dublin Airport to function as a hub and is clearly a strong market position.  However, Dublin does face competition, both from other airports on the island of Ireland and, crucially, airports in other countries seeking to attract airline capacity.  Airlines operate mobile assets and exert considerable competitive pressure on airports.  Capacity can and does move from airport to airport, as we have recently seen in Cork.  Dublin Airport also faces considerable market pressure, as its two largest customers account for approximately 75% of its traffic and, individually and collectively, exert considerable buying power.  Dublin Airport does not have market power to price that the current regulatory environment presupposes that it has.  This is evidenced by the fact that Dublin Airport has chosen in specific years not to price to the current price cap, precisely for reasons relating to the potential impact of such pricing on the market.<br\/><br\/>A more responsive regulatory model that would set broad parameters for the business should be the aim of the forthcoming regulatory review.  The regulator should be <font color=\"#212100\">supportive of investment in airport infrastructure that meets current and future requirements of the country and also enables the airport to comply with all necessary safety, security and policy regulations.  The regulated business should be able to have the confidence of the financial markets, and be able to grow value for its shareholder, the State.<\/font><br\/><br\/><font color=\"#212100\"> In regard to s<\/font>ecurity, in March 2012, shortly after I became chairman of the daa, a regular EU audit of security processes at Dublin Airport regrettably identified a series of legacy security issues that required intervention at EU level and remediation.  The issues raised by the EU auditors, which resulted in an Article 15 notice being issued, were taken very seriously by the daa.  The company reviewed all of its security processes in light of the findings and worked closely with senior officials in the Department of Transport on resolving these issues.  One of the issues flagged was rectified immediately, while the other matter was resolved within a month.  Neither issue related to the screening of passengers or their luggage at Dublin Airport.  In the wake of the audit, the board immediately undertook a root and branch analysis of the manner in which security was implemented and monitored at Dublin Airport.  This resulted in a thorough overhaul of the systems and management of our security processes and has resulted in a sea-change in our approach to security.<br\/><br\/>With regard to the future, in recent weeks there has been much comment in regard to the proposed takeover of Aer Lingus by IAG and having requested our view, this committee received submissions from both Dublin Airport and Cork Airport with regard to this issue in late January.  As indicated at that time, based on the limited information which has been issued by both parties, it appears there may some potential positives for Dublin Airport should the transaction proceed.<\/p><p> If a takeover were to go ahead, management at Cork Airport would work, not just to maintain the existing services offered by Aer Lingus at Cork, but would also examine the potential for new services from IAG's key airline subsidiaries and its membership of the Oneworld alliance.  No formal takeover offer has yet been made by IAG and it is not yet certain whether such an offer will be made.  In the absence of a formal offer document, and given that Aer Lingus, British Airways, Iberia and Vueling are all customers of daa, there is little further that I can add in regard to the potential takeover at this stage.<\/p><p> The core purpose of daa is to connect Ireland with the world and this is at the heart of what we do on a daily basis at our two Irish airports in Dublin and Cork.  It plays a vital role in the Irish economy to boost trade, tourism and investment.<\/p><p> As indicated previously, Dublin Airport is currently enjoying strong passenger growth and will welcome 15 new services this year.  daa is continuing to develop Dublin as a transfer hub for transatlantic traffic and this is working well.  Last year, transfer passengers numbers increased by 34% to three quarters of a million.  The group's near-term target is to grow this business to two million passengers per year.  These additional transfer passengers can play a major role in underpinning the viability of new routes at Dublin, and also encourage airlines to expand the number of flights they offer on existing services.  The Aer Lingus service to San Francisco is a perfect example of the importance of a steady flow of transfer traffic for overall connectivity from Dublin Airport.  Aer Lingus launched the new San Francisco route last year and operated four return flights per week.  A direct connection to the west coast of the United States was warmly welcomed by IDA Ireland and many US technology firms that have operations in Ireland.  This year, thanks in no small measure to the transfer business on the route, Aer Lingus will operate a daily return service from Dublin to San Francisco.<\/p><p> This summer, Dublin will be the sixth largest airport in Europe for transatlantic connectivity as only the major hubs of Heathrow, Schiphol, Paris, Frankfurt and Madrid will have more flights to North America.  The airport is increasingly winning business from passengers in Britain and continental Europe who are now choosing to transfer via Dublin.<\/p><p> Dublin has also witnessed a significant expansion in long-haul services to the Middle East in recent years.  Dublin Airport's passenger numbers to the Middle East and North Africa doubled between 2011 and 2013, and increased by a further 19% last year.  Etihad and Emirates both now operate double daily services from Dublin to the Middle East and offer passengers onward connections to India, Asia, Australia and New Zealand.<\/p><p> Short-haul services are also growing at Dublin.  Aer Lingus and Ryanair have added extra services over the past couple of years.  New overseas airlines such as Vueling, Transavia, and Wow Air are all entering the Irish market for the first time this year.<\/p><p> Given the growth at Dublin, there will be a requirement for the company to build a second runway at the airport in due course.  daa received planning permission for the construction of a second parallel runway in 2007.  The various options with regard to the development of a second runway will be considered.<\/p><p> At Cork Airport, which is the State's second largest airport, the intention as I have described, is to work with the regional and tourism agencies to stabilise traffic and return to passenger growth.  Our focus is on building sustainable demand from both inbound traffic and Cork Airport's hinterland, which has a population of 1.2 million people within a 90-minute drive.<\/p><p> daa welcomes the publication of the State's draft national aviation policy, NAP, to which we have contributed.  daa looks forward to the publication of the final NAP shortly.  We are particularly pleased to see the inclusion of a number of important initiatives in the draft NAP that will enhance Ireland's connectivity and enable traffic growth.  In particular the following: support for the development of Dublin Airport as a secondary hub; the co-ordination of enterprise and tourism marketing efforts in support of new route development at airports; and a commitment to a more liberal approach to the award of fifth freedoms as part of aviation agreements.  We have some concerns about the position of Cork Airport in the draft NAP, given that Cork is the second largest airport in the State and a key national asset.  While there is explicit provision for other airports, there is no specific designation for Cork Airport in the draft policy.  We would be hopeful that the final policy, when published, will address this issue.<\/p><p> daa also intends to continue to grow revenue from its international activities, ARI and daa International.  ARI operates in eight countries and made a profit of more than &euro;29 million in 2013.  ARI manages travel retail outlets in countries such as Canada, India and Cyprus.  It runs daa's award winning Irish retail operation and it also owns a 20% stake in Dusseldorf Airport.  ARI is a hidden Irish multinational, as through its partnerships and joint ventures it had managed turnover of more than $1 billion in 2013 and employed more than 3,500 people worldwide.<\/p><p>During the past three years, the company successfully and in a very timely manner completed its planned withdrawal from operations in Russia and the Ukraine to focus on higher growth opportunities in its core markets.  Last year, ARI significantly expanded its Cypriot business when it acquired full control of CTC-ARI, the company that has the concession to run the retail outlets at Larnaca and Paphos airports.  ARI now operates almost 5,000 sq. m of retail space across the two airports in Cyprus and employs approximately 375 people directly in those stores.  ARI also operates airport retail stores in locations such as New Delhi, Beirut, Barbados, Montreal and Muscat.<\/p><p> At home, ARI is close to completing a major upgrade of the retail offer in terminal 1 at Dublin Airport which will bring in a number of new innovations.  As a major travel retailer with international operations, ARI can leverage its expertise and skills across the business to great effect.  For example, the award-winning Christmas marketing campaign, Joy of Giving, which was originally devised for the Irish market, is now being successfully used in Canada, Cyprus, Bahrain, Delhi and Muscat.  Through ARI, daa is constantly exposed to the latest trends in the international travel retail sector.  The revenue earned by ARI is vital for the group as the income from its Irish operations effectively subsidises airport charges at Dublin and Cork while funds generated by the overseas business are typically re-invested in the Irish market.  This income is crucial to the group, as the core Irish airport business was barely profitable in 2013.<\/p><p> Given the essential role played by the ongoing revenue generated by ARI's overseas business and shareholdings, the group has taken a strategic decision to continue to hold these assets and seek to expand income from these areas.  Over the past three years, the group has created a new overseas business daa International to take advantage of the broader skills base within the organisation as well as the very strong reputation of daa as an airport operator internationally.  The experience of the investment programme delivered at both Dublin and Cork airports and the way in which new assets were delivered successfully into operational use have helped built a knowledge bank internally and an excellent brand for daa within the international aviation sector.  As such, daa International is positioned to provide airport management services to financial investors in the global airport sector and also operates an international aviation training business, which has significant potential.<\/p><p> There is a large amount of acquisitions activity within the global airport sector and many of the financial investors in airports are keen to partner with industry experts and airport managers such as daa.  In this regard, daa has already won business in the Middle East, India, Australia and the United States of America and has a strong pipeline of potential deals in its core markets.  Our strategy is to build this into a second significant international business which delivers value to the State.  The group is also a recognised leader in airport car park management systems, having pioneered a yield management structure for its long-term and short-term car parks.  This expertise is now being sold to airports in North America and Europe.<\/p><p> Against the backdrop of a slowly recovering Irish economy, daa has made significant progress over the past three years.  Overall passenger numbers at Dublin and Cork increased by 13% between 2012 and the end of 2014.  Traffic at Dublin Airport increased by 16% during the same period, with particular growth in long-haul passenger numbers.  Transatlantic traffic increased by one third over the past three years and is now at record levels.  Dublin is becoming a hub for transatlantic connections and now has 750,000 transfer passengers.  Despite the growth in passenger numbers, daa's core airports business was only marginally profitable in 2013, which is the most recent period for which figures are publicly available.  The passenger experience at both airports has been improved while there has been a continued focus on cost control.  Net debt levels were reduced by 16% between the end of 2011 and the end of 2013.<\/p><p> ARI has continued to trade well during the period.  It has refocused on its core geographies and significantly expanded its business in Cyprus.  The group has also launched a new international arm with significant long-term potential.  It would be a privilege for me to contribute to these initiatives as chairman of daa and to continue to do what I can to help optimise the contribution daa makes to the economy as a whole.  Again, I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for the invitation to appear this morning and I am happy to address any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015021000002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. P&aacute;draig &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423570200,"counter":449,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in for that long and thorough statement.

I have a few questions, which I will ask together.<\/p><p>In Mr. &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in's statement, he said he would be seeking the committee's support for his argument that remuneration policy should reflect the equivalent post in the private sector.  He said that he makes that argument even more strongly now, both in respect of base salary and in reintroducing performance-related pay at chief executive level.  Before the committee can decide whether to support that argument it needs to know the levels of pay and bonuses Mr. &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in is proposing for Mr. Toland.  Could Mr. &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in comment on this?  If that bonus structure is agreed - Mr. &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in refers to performance-related pay so it is effectively a bonus - on what basis are the targets set and who would be assessing the chief executive's performance in that regard?  Before the committee makes a decision, it would need some more details.<\/p><p> I will focus on Dublin Airport in respect of it being a transatlantic hub.   It is very interesting to see that three-quarters of a million passengers, which is a record number, connected through Dublin.  Perhaps Mr. &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in might be able to expand on future plans.  The free clearance both in immigration and customs at Dublin Airport gives us a distinct advantage.  There has been talk about Air India and various other airlines.  Mr. &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in might not want to talk about specifics but there is massive potential there.  Added to that is the small comment in Mr. &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in's statement on the second runway at Dublin Airport for which planning permission was granted through An Bord Plean&aacute;la in 2007.  A number of conditions were set at the time in respect of the planning permission that the daa said would make it too restrictive.  Those of us who live beside the airport would be very aware of the number of jobs that are created.  I have supported the daa and the airport over that period.  One thing that is missing from Mr. &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in's statement is information about how the daa, which has responsibility for Dublin and Cork, is interacting with the community and how to ensure that the daa is a good neighbour.  People have genuine concerns about a second runway although they want to see the airport expand and more jobs being created.  Mr. &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in has quoted a figure of between 3,000 and 5,000 new jobs to be created over a five-year period.  That is very welcome.  I know many people who work in the airport.  Could Mr. &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in expand on what the next step will be?  He has spoken about moving towards what is effectively the construction of the second runway.  Is he happy that the daa can do that under the conditions laid down by An Bord Plean&aacute;la in 2007?  <\/p><p> In respect of the good neighbour strategy, the daa has a good social responsibility fund.  My concern is more to do with the day-to-day operation of it.  Why has the daa remained silent on the greater Dublin drainage proposals for the largest sewage plant in the country to be established within two miles of the airport and very close to the flight path when it also knows that the daa is very active, as is Aer Rianta, in commenting on other planning applications in the area for agricultural buildings?  That is strange.  Was it because one of the proposed plants is a State contract and proposal?  The plant will be four times the size of Croke Park and very close to the airport.  I would have thought that the authority would have some comment or interest in that regard and I would welcome a comment on it.<\/p><p> Mr. &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in outlined the daa's perspective on the IASS pension scheme.  Many of us here, including Senator Barrett, Deputy Flanagan and I, have commented on this.  In fairness, Mr. &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in has mentioned that it is very emotive and has affected 15,000 members of the scheme, many of whom are former employees of the daa.  The deferred members came in for particularly savage cuts as part of what is termed the expert panel's proposals.<\/p><p>I take issue with one comment made by Mr. &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, that they were allowed to receive what was in effect a double pension.  If those were the terms of the pension scheme they signed up to, that was not the problem of the scheme being underfunded.<br\/><br\/>I put it to Mr. &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in that the trustees, including the current trustees, badly managed the scheme.  The deficit doubled in the past two years, from &euro;360 million to more than &euro;700 million when we knew this was coming down the track.  I hope there is a resolution to it but I do not believe there will be.  RASA, the retired aviation staff association, has stated it will take a legal case.<br\/><br\/>I do not want to spend more time on the pensions issue, as we are working on it, but let me put the following point to Mr. &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in and the trustees of Aer Lingus that when the plan is put to individual members, those members have to waive their rights to taking legal action or being part of any legal action in the future.  While the staff are being offered a deal, one is saying to them that if they accept the deal they are waiving all future rights to being a party to a legal action against the trustees.  That does not seem to be the best way of trying to gain agreement.  The people for whom a resolution is most desirable is effectively the employer.<br\/><br\/>There are two general issues that are important to transport.  It is good to see the increasing numbers using Dublin Airport.  Why has there been no comment in the statement on the North Dublin Transport Study?  The airport has a significant role in that plan.  There is no mention of metro north in Mr. &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in's statement although there are advance plans for future passengers and development of the airport but there is no mention of a rail connection.  Most people do not want a spur from Clongriffin to the airport.  As chairman of the daa, Mr. &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in has referred to future development <i>vis-&agrave;-vis,<\/i>the second runway but fails to mention connectivity to the airport itself.  He mentioned car parking and the expertise Dublin Airport Authority has in the operation of car parks but as the sixth busiest airport in transatlantic travel surely it would have been an absolute priority for the daa to ensure that metro north or something similar is delivered.  I have been surprised, as a representative for the area, that the daa has not been more vocal on that issue in the North Dublin Transport Study.  Fingal County Council has been very clear that it would support the metro.  I have not heard that from the Dublin Airport Authority but perhaps Mr. &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in could say so here.  It would be great were he to do so.<br\/><br\/>My last point is procurement, an area in which Mr. &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in gained expertise with Arthur Cox.  He mentioned Aer Rianta International, ARI. For those who travel in and out of the airport all of the time that is very important.  Will he comment on the position of the airport as a showcase for Irish retailers?  The comment has been made and I would not completely disagree that when one looks at all the retailers and the concessions located in terminal 2 it is akin to flying into Manchester Airport, with its WHSmith's and so on.  There are very few Irish owned companies, with a few notable exceptions.  I believe we could showcase Irish businesses much better.  Will Mr. &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in comment on the procurement and the tendering process for concessions at the airport?  I do not believe it is as transparent as it could be.  I receive many complaints from Irish indigenous businesses.  When people come into our airport we can offer them the opportunity to see Irish businesses but the Irish owned and run shops are in a minority in both terminals 1 and 2.  The daa is due to embark on major works on terminal 1 and I am aware that the tender for food has been awarded to an Irish company.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015021000002#M00300","speaker":"1139","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423570200,"counter":453,"content":"<p>I thought we had pre-empted all the questions but a number have been raised there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015021000002#O00200","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1423570200,"counter":454,"content":"<p>I thank Senator O'Brien for his pertinent questions.  I will address the first question on remuneration policy for the chief executive.  This issue goes beyond the daa because of the issue of State policy on chief executive pay throughout the sector.<\/p><p>I understand there are different perspectives concerning the country as a whole.  I come at this from the perspective of trying to get a company to operate optimally for the benefit of the State.  People like Mr. Kevin Toland are genuinely a rare commodity.  He has come back from a job in which he earned a significant multiple of what he will earn with daa.  It is a job he does extraordinarily well.  It is important for us as a country to value that type of leader because they really do make a difference in how a company operates.  I can already see that clearly in daa.  In a couple of years, this will be seen amazingly clearly.  I am not here to propose Mr. Toland&rsquo;s salary should be moved to X or Y.  When he was appointed, the Government was looking at a policy of introducing performance-related pay.  That has not come to pass, however, which I am sure is a disappointment for him.  He is still on exactly the same salary that he was on several years ago.  I am very much of the view that a bonus means a bonus or that performance-related pay should be related to real performance.  This is done all the time throughout private companies, whereby remuneration committees set very clear targets.  Mr. Toland himself sets very clear targets for his people internally which was not really the case before in the daa.  I agree some of these matters need to be carefully calibrated and implemented.  The point I am making, however, is that there really is a necessity for this to retain people in the system.<\/p><p> Developing Dublin as a transatlantic hub is one of the biggest developments in the airport for several years.  It will give the airport much critical mass and will support connectivity from Ireland across the globe.  We can support that connectivity with English and Scottish air passengers who come through Dublin Airport and use its routes.  It does not just support the airport financially with, say, landing charges and what people spend in the airport, but it also supports how we can market Dublin to a greater range of international airlines.  We can tell airlines that if they have the passenger loads, we can produce them, and it is not just from the Irish population but also by feeding people in.  It is a fantastically strong message.  We have new relationships, to which the Senator alluded, such as Ethiopian Airlines coming through Dublin to pick up passengers and move on under fifth freedom rights, an exciting development.  Capital expenditure will be needed because we have to reconfigure some parts of the airport to make the product for transfers much more efficient.  This is a significant priority.  There has been some resistance to this by some of the airlines at regulation level but it is important to the company&rsquo;s development.<\/p><p> I referred to the second runway because we are moving to a phase where we will need one.  A second runway would be tremendously good for Ireland in the long term.  It is amazing when one looks back at how previous generations of daa management had worked on planning for a second runway.  Their work is fantastic and quite extraordinary in comparison with other airports like, say, Heathrow.  A good landbank has been secured to ensure the airport is not on top of its neighbours.  It is too early to get into the details of this.  I am just flagging this as something we will look at in the medium to longer term to start that process.  There is nothing imminent in this area but it is a development we keep an eye on all the time.  We will have a full conversation with our neighbours when the time comes.  The daa in general is very conscious of its position in the community and of its neighbours.<\/p><p> I am not sure why we have not commented on the greater Dublin drainage plan.  It may be an issue concerning the project&rsquo;s distance from the airport but I will check it out for the Senator.  Generally, we pay a lot of attention to any planning issues or projects that will affect the development of the airport in the long term and we do respond reasonably well to these.<\/p><p> Pension provision is a very emotive issue.  As a board, we really care about this issue because it impacts on individuals&rsquo; lives for a long period, as well as their quality of life in retirement.<\/p><p>The problem we face is one that has not been addressed in 60 years.  Some of the anomalies in the scheme genuinely are anomalies.  For example, there is a double pension in the scheme.  I will try to explain how it works.  I was amazed when I took up my position at the airport to learn how this works.  Generally speaking under a defined benefit scheme a &euro;30,000 pension is met with &euro;18,000 from the scheme, with the remainder being met through the State pension.  That is how it operates everywhere.  Because of an anomaly in the IAS scheme, a person who retired on his or her 65th birthday would get a &euro;30,000 pension but a person who retired earlier than that would receive a pension of &euro;30,000 from the IAS scheme plus the State pension, bringing the total pension to &euro;42,000.  The difficulty is that none of this was funded.  People who contributed to the scheme were contributing to the &euro;30,000 pension, not the &euro;42,000 pension.  That level of payment becomes unaffordable because, as I said, it is unfunded.  Under the IAS scheme, the trustee has been paying that for some time.  It is a double pension.  <\/p><p> In terms of what is now being proposed - this has gone through the Labour Court, the LRC and the expert panel - the expert panel has proposed that the fairest possible way of resolving this is exactly what has been proposed by daa, namely, that all active members of the scheme would have their pensions reduced by approximately 20%, that &euro;72 million be provided by daa to bring their final pensions back up to &euro;30,000 and there be no further payments of the double pension.  People have said that what is proposed is very complex.  I agree it is very detailed.  However, when it comes down to what is on the table, as proposed by the expert panel, and what daa, as a company, has genuinely stretched to do, it is a fair offer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015021000002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. P&aacute;draig &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423570200,"counter":457,"content":"<p>We cannot debate that issue now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015021000002#Q00200","speaker":"1139"},{"type":"speech","time":1423570200,"counter":458,"content":"<p>I remind members that we are required to vacate this room soon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015021000002#Q00300","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1423570200,"counter":459,"content":"<p>Senator O'Brien asked why daa as a company would ask people who sign up to this for a waiver.  The reason is simple.  One of the reasons for the many problems in daa, and not only in terms of pensions, is a lack of clarity.  As a country, we lack clarity in relation to so many matters.  When this pension problem is resolved it needs to be resolved in a permanent way so that everybody can move on from it and build value in the company.  The purpose of the waiver is to ensure this issue does not arise again next year, the following year and the year after that.<\/p> <p>  On metro north, we support it and have made our position in that regard very clear.  We may not have been very vociferous recently but our position is very much that metro north is the right way to go in terms of capacity and frequency.<\/p> <p>  We have a very strong procurement policy.  For example, we have developed the Irish whiskey collection which is now available worldwide.  We pay a lot of attention to promoting Irish business.  At the same time, we have a mandate from the Oireachtas to ensure we operate the airport in as commercial a manner as possible.  This means getting the best franchises we can.  While we, too, would prefer to have as much of an Irish flavour as we can, we have a mandate to respond to that requirement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015021000002#Q00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. P&aacute;draig &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in"},{"type":"speech","time":1423570200,"counter":460,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in to the meeting.  I will try not to overlap with the questions raised by my colleague Senator Darragh O'Brien.  While I acknowledge the difficulties around security the current arrangements in this regard from the customer point of view are a hassle.  While the staff are very courteous security arrangements are making travel an ordeal.  I believe security is in part responsible for the decline of Cork Airport.  Previously, approximately ten flights a day operated between Dublin and Cork.  Now, because of increased security at either end such travel is no longer worth the hassle.<\/p> <p>  I support what the daa is doing in relation to travel to the US.<\/p><p>I know US immigration must satisfy itself to its standards, but it seems strange to the passenger to go through the same procedures with Mr. &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in's people first and then when they go downstairs it starts all over again.  Perhaps it could be harmonised a bit better.<\/p><p> On both projects that were mentioned, the chief executive's pay and the metro, that is just the way this country is.  Like daa's chief executive, whom I applaud for his work, I had more as a graduate student in Canada than when I came to work here.  It is a bankrupt county that we are trying to rescue and everyone from the Taoiseach down has taken cuts in pay.  That must be explained to chief executives.  We are not ready to move to a different situation.<\/p><p> Regarding the metro, the access to the airport from the west side, through the M50, is more efficient than people from that area going into St. Stephen's Green at vast expense, going through an underground thing and out to the airport.  On the east side, the time from the Point Depot, as we used to call it, to the airport is 15 to 17 minutes away through the port tunnel.  We have the access.  According to the figures I see, the time from St. Stephen's Green to the airport is 17 minutes.  One can do that substantially from both the west of the city and the centre.  One must question a plan that involves running up vast amounts of debt to build a metro without proper cost-benefit analysis.  We are in a country that is still borrowing and still has a heavy debt-to-GDP ratio.  Those projects must be looked at much more stringently.<\/p><p> That is also part of Cork's problem.  It built a terminal at the wrong time.  I do not know whether it can be sublet or sub-contracted to anybody, but having two terminals in an airport that is declining in passenger numbers is the burden of debt on Cork.  I wish Mr. &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in success in his efforts.  However, I proposed in the Seanad that Cork should go the same way as Shannon and try to develop itself, but I found remarkably little interest in it in Cork.  I imagine daa is trying to drum up interest for its committee.  Do Cork people want to promote the airport as actively as people in the west do with Knock?  Cork must make that decision itself.<\/p><p> On pensions, I note Mr. &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in's expertise in restructuring AIB, Bank of Ireland and so on.  We said when the Governor was here that there seemed to be a tradition in Ireland that trustees could operate with impunity, giving added years and early retirements, as Mr. &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in has said.  I do not know whether the same lax standards in banking and accountancy influence the way pension trustees carried on, but as Senator O'Brien said, given the massive increase in debt in a recent two-year or three-year period, we should have been on notice that the pension fund was in trouble.  Some accountability by pension fund trustees, wearing their wider financial services hat, is a significant part of that.<\/p><p> The other point Mr. &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in mentioned was the regulation of the airport charges.  I like what he is doing now rather than what happened in the past, because I recall academic conferences where the previous regulator, Cathal Guiomard, would give papers and so on.  He was a pretty popular fellow among economists.  His determination was previously overturned by ministerial order.  One can imagine he is trying to referee a contest between daa and the airlines and somebody outside says, \"I wish to award all the proceeds to one of the parties\".  In economics there is a serious fear that the producers always win and consumers never do.  It is called regulatory capture.  There was about a 40% increase a number of years ago.  That has to do with the construction of the terminal.  Some studies were done about the number of square feet per passenger, the amount of terminal space and so on.  daa is working on those now to get them out of the system so that it can have a more harmonious relationship with the airlines.  That is to everyone's credit at present because substantially low-cost airlines, which both Ryanair and Aer Lingus are now, can do deals in airports and there is one airport per million people all through Europe, which are not comparable with the ones in capital cities.  Perhaps what daa has now is a low-cost terminal and people want more services.<\/p><p> It was being said that the Dublin charges were lower than any other capital city, while the airlines were saying they were higher than what they paid anywhere else as they negotiated deals and so on.  It was the way the airport business changed.  That was what Professor Alfred E. Khan questioned during Mr. &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in's term in Harvard, namely, why was it twice as expensive to fly from Boston to Washington as it was from Los Angeles to San Francisco?  The second route is in the state of California, which had a low-cost aviation policy, as distinct from the feds, which did not at the time.  That has also been changed.  <\/p><p> Holding down the costs, as Mr. &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in says, is important.  I would be more concerned at what the daa has said about the takeover of Aer Lingus.  There is probably the expertise within the daa.  What it has done in the north Atlantic and elsewhere is spectacular by comparison with Manchester, Birmingham, Edinburgh, Glasgow and Belfast.  I see British Airways as never developing transatlantic routes except in Heathrow.  It is a gesture of great faith and trust to say that if it got control of Aer Lingus it would not also divert the business into Heathrow.  When I first started to write about this, Heathrow traffic was 35 million.  It is now 72 million.  There is always enough capacity at Heathrow for British Airways, but everybody else gets kept out through the slots system.  <\/p><p> Mr. &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in mentioned the importance of the Aer Rianta International brands.  Aer Lingus is one of those brands and what has been done in San Francisco and Washington is huge.  I estimate that for a country larger than us, 5.3 million would be impressive.  Scotland is doing about 400,000 passengers on the north Atlantic and Ireland is over 2 million.  I would hold on to Aer Lingus rather than accept any guarantees regarding what British Airways would do.  It is a brand worth having and an airline that has been performing very well.  We were saying last week it carried 11 million passengers.  That is about what Ryanair and easyJet had at the turn of the century.  One has gone on to carry 65 million, the other is heading towards carrying 100 million.  It is more difficult to do it now because the other two operators have vastly increased their capacity but it is not out of all bounds of possibility for Aer Lingus to develop well beyond 11 million as the two other airlines have done.  I would strongly favour not having the British Airways takeover.  <\/p><p> I do not know what IAG brings to the party.  Its British end - its home market - is significantly overshadowed by easyJet.  Iberia, the other part of it, never did much to develop Spain as a tourism destination.  The charters were doing 95% of the market between the UK and the Canaries and so on.  We should be looking for some dynamism to help the daa as a dynamic company to hold on to the Aer Lingus management brand, rather than selling it for what is a relatively small amount of money.  I wish Mr. &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in well in all of his tasks and compliment him on being returned to office.  A lot of people around this table will be trying to accomplish that within the next year or so.  If Mr. &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in has any hints we will take them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015021000002#Q00500","speaker":"1157","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423570200,"counter":463,"content":"<p>We will take Mr. &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in's comments on or answers to the Senator's contribution.

Going through his questions, we have done a huge amount of work on making security as efficient as possible.  The regulations for security are imposed on us by Europe and implemented here in Ireland as well.  We have to make sure that we are as efficient as we can be in respect of those rules.  The new gels rules, for example, and various other aspects do slow things down.  I can tell the Senator that we have had our senior management down on the floor of Dublin Airport from 4 a.m. to make sure we understand exactly what is the process and how to make it as efficient as we can.<\/p> <p>  In terms of US Customs and Border Protection, CBP, I agree with the Senator.  It is necessary to go through a second process but their process is different.  The difficulty is that if we applied that process to everybody, including those to whom we do not have to apply it, that would slow things down even more.<\/p><p>We pay a huge amount of attention to getting an efficient process and anybody who has used Dublin Airport in recent years will find that we have got a lot better at that in terms of queue times and everything else.<\/p><p> In terms of pay, I totally understand the Senator's point.  We have had a stressed country.  There is only a certain amount of money to go around but the reason I think about this slightly differently is because I know that a good chief executive can make a difference of potentially tens or even hundreds of millions of euro in terms of the country and in terms of daa.  If a new chief executive can increase passenger flow into Ireland by 1% or 2% by making sure that we leverage the company to the maximum of its ability, the benefit to Ireland will be off the charts.  In the way I look at the world, to lose something like that would be a shame, but I understand the differences of opinion on that.<\/p><p> With regard to metro west, I am not in a position to go into it too much but our position is that we believe metro west is currently the best option, but we would be very happy to get into the debate on that.<\/p><p> On Cork, what the Senator said is arguable in that &euro;200 million was spent on the Cork terminal.  The original terminal was over 50 years old so it had to be renewed, but that came at a bad time in the cycle in terms of what has happened.  We are doing everything we can to focus on Cork.  There is a permanent sub-committee of the board that focuses only on Cork.  We have four Cork people on the board, including myself.  Our chief executive travels to Cork very regularly, which was not a feature previously.  We have a very good chief executive in Cork.  We have the Cork Airport Development Council.  A major focus of daa is making sure that Cork improves, and we have a lot to bring to the party in terms of relationship with airlines and so on to do that.<\/p><p> In terms of the pensions and trustees, as the Senator knows, the trustees are separate from the company so I do not want to comment unduly on the trustees.  The trustees are regulated by the Pensions Board as well so it has its job to do in regard to that.<\/p><p> On the regulation of airport charges, in recent years we have been very commercial in what we do.  What we want to achieve as a board is to make daa a very commercial organisation so we are not relying on price caps or artificial anything to make the business very strong.  We are just implementing normal business practice.<\/p><p> I do not think there is regulatory capture.  I am being as objective as I can when I say that the current regulatory system does not work because it is defined in a particular way.  I will give the committee an example.  Developing Dublin Airport as a hub, for example, would benefit Aer Lingus significantly but Aer Lingus opposes the money we would spend on a hub because it sees that as a much shorter-term issue than we do.  It will figure that, in the long term, we will have to find some way of getting it built anyway.  Sometimes there is a disconnect in terms of what it is we are trying to achieve for the benefit of the country.  That is often not reflected very well in the current regulatory scenario, therefore, we welcome the regulatory review.<\/p><p> On IAG, our position is straightforward.  We have not seen the IAG offer yet so it is very difficult for us to comment unduly on it but in regard to the slots in Heathrow, for example, the Irish traffic into those slots is very strong.  The loads on the Irish routes into Heathrow are very strong, therefore, those routes should be sustainable on their own merits.  They also feed a lot of traffic into the British Airways network and into the IAG network, therefore, they are very valuable routes.<\/p><p> In terms of looking at what IAG could potentially contribute on a Dublin basis, it could contribute significantly in regard to transatlantic routes and in regard to the hub.  Heathrow is jam-packed.  It does not have any customer borders protection, for example, so therefore it is a much less attractive product in terms of getting people from the United Kingdom to the United States.  If people are flying from the north of England through Heathrow to the United States, they are much better off flying through Dublin.  There are potential merits to having access to that IAG system and channelling it through Dublin.  We are quite measured on this and we would like to see what will be the final outline of the transaction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015021000002#S00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. P&aacute;draig &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423570200,"counter":466,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. P&aacute;draig &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in for his very informative statement.

However, profits have not increased accordingly.  Perhaps he can give us the reason for that.<\/p> <p>  Cork Airport was mentioned by other speakers.  I have flown through the airport on a number of occasions.  I agree that it needs active support if it is to contribute to tourism growth in the region.  There are two flights to Prague every week from the airport.  Should it also be connected to other European capitals or would that interfere with other regional airports?

What benefits will the pipeline bring and has daa identified any safety concerns in regard to it?  It will take a number of trucks off the road, but they already use the Dublin Port tunnel.

There is major opposition to the proposals to locate the plant on the periphery of the Fingal County Council area.  It would service a number of counties and the location does not seem right.  Perhaps a series of smaller plants would have been a better option than one monster plant.  What forum exists for the local community, stakeholders and public representatives to make criticisms, ask questions or communicate with the daa?  How do they go about it?<\/p><p> Regarding IASS, there is major unhappiness among pensioners at the unfairness.  The deferred pensioners in particular feel they are being singled out, that there is no equity in the cuts that have been applied and that the cuts should apply to all workers equally.  They feel the terms and conditions of their pension arrangements are being broken and they face cuts of 50% to 60%.  Under UK pension law, the deferred pensioners in Northern Ireland and the UK cannot be targeted and must receive their benefits.  Only the Irish deferred pensioners are being penalised.  As Mr. &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in described earlier, these workers have put significant time, effort and service into the airport companies and I am seeking a fairer deal for them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015021000002#U00400","speaker":"1182","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1423570200,"counter":471,"content":"<p>Senator Brennan asked about the 20% debt reduction.  We want to reduce it further.  To the extent that we have any degree of profitability in the airports or generated by Aer Rianta International, ARI, we will reduce our debt.  We have to refinance all our debt - approximately &euro;550 million - over the next two years.  The fact that our credit rating has improved is tremendous because the debt will cost us less, and we continue to be very focused on it.  The question on the other six transatlantic airports in Europe which have the same or more transatlantic traffic as Dublin Airport was very interesting.  From my memory and knowledge of the airports, I would say all of them probably have very strong connectivity from the city centre to the airports.  On the question of why profits have not increased while passenger numbers have, we have high capital expenditure and other expenses.  Low regulatory charges inhibit our ability to create profit in the airports.  Although our costs have increased by only 1% over the past three years, we still find it very difficult to find profit because of restrictions such as the regulatory caps.  Pension costs must also come out of the budget.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015021000002#V00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. P&aacute;draig &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in"},{"type":"speech","time":1423570200,"counter":472,"content":"<p>I was going to mention those also.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015021000002#V00300","speaker":"1138"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1423570200,"counter":473,"content":"<p>All of those factors have an influence.  Given that we are running the business on a very strongly business-oriented basis and have a proper strategic plan, I hope the financial performance will continue to improve.  I could not agree more that Cork Airport needs the active support of the entire region.  The fact that only 37% of people who use Cork are inbound travellers indicates that we are not attracting enough visitors.  A general tourism initiative needs to be implemented for Cork.  The question of whether there should be a public service obligation, PSO, route from Cork to Dublin is very important for transatlantic connectivity into Cork, through Dublin and on to other airports and as a support to airlines that come into Cork, which could advertise their services abroad.  Much can be done and we are working hard on it.<\/p><p>In response to Deputy Terence Flanagan's question regarding the aviation fuel pipeline, I am not quite sure what is the current status.  However, we can provide that material to the Deputy separately.  I simply do not have the brief to hand at present.  As for the connectivity with the city centre, from the point of view of the airport and what we can achieve there over a period and in particular, if we have a second airport - again we are talking in the medium to longer term - that degree of connectivity is very important.  Of the options we have reviewed to date, the metro north option is the one we would find preferable because it is a long-term solution.  It would give us the capacity into Dublin Airport for the conceivable future development of the airport.  In terms of an airport in particular, it is really important to think in the long term, not about what is around the corner next year or the following year.  As I stated previously, generations of good boards of management in daa have done this for many years.  In terms of a long-term solution, metro north is quite strong.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015021000002#V00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. P&aacute;draig &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423570200,"counter":475,"content":"<p>What about the Swiftway or link to Clongriffin options?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015021000002#W00200","speaker":"1182"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1423570200,"counter":476,"content":"<p>Perhaps we could have a separate conversation on that because I would need to be briefed properly in respect of what precisely is our position on each option.  However, I would be happy to do that at some stage if the Deputy wishes.<\/p> <p>  On the plan for Dublin as a transatlantic hub, we would be happy to prepare and circulate a paper on that in order that everybody is aware of what is the plan.  It is part of our strategic plan at present.  I probably have responded to the question regarding the Dublin drainage scheme already.  I am not entirely sure why we have not been an active participant in that discussion.  While distance from the airport may be one issue, again I will check separately on that matter.<\/p> <p>  In respect of daa interaction with the local community, people can interrelate with us in many ways, many of which now are on social media.  As we have a good social media programme, we respond to issues quickly and over the past two years, we have become very outward-looking again.  Our relationships with all stakeholders, including the State itself, obviously, the airlines, our employees and the community have been strong.  Again, it is a particular strength of Kevin Toland that he does this.  He does a lot of workshops for people and he goes out and speaks to people in town hall-type settings quite often.  Again, if there are individual issues from a community perspective, we absolutely would engage fully in that regard.<\/p> <p>  As for deferred pensioners - this is an important point - when deferred pensioners are talking about cuts of 50% to 60%, they are talking about cuts of 50% to 60% from the double pension.  In the example I gave earlier of a &euro;30,000 pension, they are talking about cuts of 50% to 60% from the &euro;42,000, not from the &euro;30,000.  The additional &euro;12,000, the State pension, is something to which they never have contributed.  What they are saying is that because of the anomaly in the scheme, they believe they have an entitlement to the &euro;42,000 and therefore, are judging their numbers from there.  If one looks at what they have contributed to as pensioners in the scheme, that is, the &euro;30,000, they will be getting a maximum of a 10% cut from that &euro;30,000, which is exactly the same as what the existing pensioners are getting under the restructuring the trustees have put in place.  Consequently, they are not being treated very differently from other parties.  The other point to remember in respect of the deferred pensioners is that nearly all of them left Dublin Airport Authority on the basis of a voluntary severance scheme or an early retirement plan, both of which involved quite sizeable packages.  For example, in recent years, daa has spent &euro;50 million on those packages it has paid either to pensioners or to deferred members of the scheme.  When one stands back from this and looks at it objectively, it is not as unfair as one thinks.  The expert panel has listened to absolutely everybody on this and has stated the solution to which we now are signing up is the fairest solution.  The panel would not have done this were the figures as skewed as a 50% to 60% reduction in pension.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015021000002#W00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. P&aacute;draig &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in"},{"type":"speech","time":1423570200,"counter":477,"content":"<p>Through the Chair, what members are hearing as public representatives on the ground is there is huge anger over these cuts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015021000002#W00400","speaker":"1182"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1423570200,"counter":478,"content":"<p>I know.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015021000002#W00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. P&aacute;draig &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in"},{"type":"speech","time":1423570200,"counter":479,"content":"<p>The Deputy has made that point.

Cork Airport is competing with Shannon Airport, and when the latter was separated from the daa, the daa retained &euro;100 million of debt.  That debt was written off and a substantial rent roll was put into the group so there is non-aeronautical revenue coming into the group.  In addition, when assets were moved from the daa to Shannon Airport, they were substantially written down.  This means there is a lower depreciation cost for the assets of Shannon Airport.  This frees up Shannon to offer deals that are not commercial in Cork.  Cork could not responsibly provide these deals.  If Shannon is offering deals to airlines, they will naturally follow their commercial interests and go to Shannon.  That is why a number of flights, particularly to Poland, have transplanted from Cork to Shannon.  The same number of passengers are travelling but coming from a different airport.<\/p> <p>  It is very important, particularly in the national aviation policy, that we recognise Cork as a sparkling airport with great connectivity and a good hinterland.  It has decreasing numbers and we need to focus on it as the second airport in the State and ensure we do what we can for it.  This involves a cohesive tourism effort in getting people into Cork.  The fact that we have not been able to persuade one of the airlines to fly from Dublin to Cork is a big negative for Cork Airport.  People would use it and fly on to Dublin whereas at the moment they are using the motorway.  Much can be done for Cork Airport and I ask the committee to focus on it.  There has been a big focus on some of the other regions over the past period.  I make no comment on Knock airport but refer to Shannon particularly.  In Kerry, there is a public service obligation and a subsidy of &euro;270 per passenger.  There is none of that for Cork Airport and I ask the committee to focus on that point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015021000002#X00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. P&aacute;draig &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in"},{"type":"speech","time":1423570200,"counter":482,"content":"<p>We must be careful with the language we use.
