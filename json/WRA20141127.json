This is on foot of recommendations set out in the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) Policy Advice on &quot;Supporting Students with Special Educational Needs in Schools (May 2013) and the recommendations of the NCSE Working Group Report &quot;A Proposed New Model for Allocating Teaching Resources for Students with Special Educational Needs&quot;. <br\/><br\/>  Following the publication of these reports, my Department advised that it would commence the process of gathering information which would be required to develop the proposed new model, to allow its impact to be assessed, and to assess if, and from when, the model could be implemented. Part of this process involves the collection of information in relation to the social context of schools.<br\/><br\/>  The working group report recommended that a school's social context should be used because it can contribute strongly to the level of learning needs that students have. The report considered that, on the basis of available research evidence, the use of a school's social context is valid in developing an educational profile, as socioeconomic disadvantage is associated with the incidence of certain types of special educational needs, including low achievement in academic learning and emotional or behavioural disorders. <br\/><br\/>  The report also noted that a school within a disadvantaged social context may have a higher share of students presenting with emotional or behavioural disorders. While some of these needs are likely to be reflected in low test scores, others may not, as students with relatively high levels of educational achievement can have emotional and behavioural disorders. <br\/><br\/>  Accordingly, it was recommended that consideration of a schools social context should form part of any proposed new resource allocation model.<br\/><br\/>  Pending the availability of a more objective source of information, the working group stated that it was confident that survey reporting by school principals could produce robust up to date data on school context in a similar manner to DEIS and earlier initiatives. <br\/><br\/>  The Department therefore, in conjunction with the NCSE, asked the Educational Research Centre (ERC) to conduct a survey of schools to assist the development of an educational profile.<br\/><br\/>  Though recognising that all schools would not be able to have specific detail regarding all of the questions asked in relation to their pupil populations, schools were asked to provide their best possible estimates in relation to the questions being asked in the survey, in order to ensure that as accurate as possible a social context allocation component of any revised allocation model could be developed for each school. <br\/><br\/>  At all stages of the development of the advice and in particular in the work of the working group there was comprehensive consultation with education partners and stakeholders and through this consultation there was awareness and broad support for the proposed approach including the deployment of a survey. <br\/><br\/>  The data which schools were requested to return as part of the survey was non-personal, anonymised data. Schools were not asked to return data in relation to the social circumstances of individual pupils.<br\/><br\/>  Schools were also advised that the ERC had put in place a dedicated phone help line in order to provide assistance and support to schools in completing the questionnaire. I understand that many schools used this help line to gain assistance in completing the questionnaire.<br\/><br\/>  Whereas I understand that the return of this survey has caused extra work and some difficulties for some schools, I am confident that having up to date social context data will be highly beneficial to the Department and the NCSE in developing proposals for a new profiled allocation model for schools.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112700048#WRC00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Staffing","counter":81,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112700048#WRC00950"},{"type":"question","counter":82,"qnumday":37,"qnumall":"[45367\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112700048#WRC01000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"her assessment of the impact of the moratorium on filling posts of responsibility at post-primary level; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1054","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":83,"content":"<p>When the moratorium on the filling of posts of responsibility was introduced in 2009, the Government exempted Principal and Deputy Principal posts in all primary and post-primary schools.

As at 20 November 2014, a total of 35,381 internships have commenced with 6,700 participants currently on a JobBridge placement, and 1,933 internship posts currently advertised on the JobBridge website.  <\/p><p>  In County Kerry, there have been a total of 1047 internships since the scheme commenced.  Of this, 232 are currently on a placement, with 815 internships completed at this point in time.  A total of 232 of these interns progressed into employment, either with their host organisation or another organisation on completion of their JobBridge placement.  This represents a 28% progression rate, immediately on completion of the scheme.<\/p><p>  Progression into employment on completion of an internship understates the impact of the scheme as many people use their work experience to apply for and secure employment in the months immediately following the internship. In this regard, an independent evaluation of JobBridge found that 61% of individuals who have participated in the scheme have progressed into employment within five months of completing their internship placements.  A total of 45.2% of these were in full-time permanent employment, 9.3% were in part-time permanent employment, 35.0% were in full-time temporary employment and 10.5% were in part-time temporary employment. The majority of these have progressed to employment with their host organisations, while the remainder took the skills and experiences gained during their internship to employment in the wider labour market. This high level of progression into employment exceeds that of similar schemes across Europe. <\/p><p>  I am confident that JobBridge will continue as a positive activation programme, and that the scheme will display similar progression rates into employment, into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112700050#WRE01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1033"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Appeals","counter":135,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112700050#WRE01250"},{"type":"question","counter":136,"qnumday":55,"qnumall":"[45670\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112700050#WRE01300","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the position regarding a carer's allowance appeal in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kerry;

This was\u00a0not matched by proportionate import growth, despite the growth in domestic demand in the same period. As a result net exports increased by 11.0 per cent year-on-year in the second quarter to stand at &euro;11.2 billion, or 24 per cent of GDP.<br\/><br\/>Part of the strong performance in goods exports can be put down to what is known as  contracted manufacturing'. This contracted production occurs when an Irish-resident (though not necessarily Irish-owned) enterprise contracts a plant abroad to produce a good for supply to a third country. The sale of the good is recorded as an Irish export as the economic ownership of the good prior to sale is regarded as belonging to the Irish-resident enterprise. Imports used in the production process are also recorded as Irish imports. Neither these exports nor imports associated with contracted production are recorded in the monthly trade series which is based on measurement of when goods physically cross the Irish border.\u00a0<br\/><br\/>The difference between national accounts-based and trade-based measures of exports and imports are known as national accounts adjustments. In the three years to 2013 national accounts export and import adjustments have largely offset each other. This relationship appears to have broken down in the first half\u00a0of 2014. The export adjustment has increased considerably more than the import adjustment and is believed to be associated with a sharp increase in contracted production, adding significantly to the contribution of net exports to GDP growth. However, other adjustments (such as the correction for carriage costs of imports) are also made. It is important to stress that the contribution of contracted production to growth cannot be calculated with precision with the publically available data to hand.<br\/><br\/>Contracted production involves very little employment effect or second-round impact on the wider economy and complicates the task of forecasting net exports. Developments in contract production are sector-specific and product-specific and have\u00a0little relationship with concurrent indicators of export performance. As such, they have the potential to unwind or accelerate with potentially large impacts on measured GDP.<br\/><br\/>Notwithstanding these developments, there is no doubt that economic recovery has gained momentum this year and that it has broadened to include a recovery in domestic demand.\u00a0 High-frequency data such as retail sales, industrial production\u00a0and purchasing managers' indices (PMIs) are all in strong positive territory. Employment growth resumed in 2012 and the Live Register continues to fall month-on-month.

In 2013 export volumes were largely unchanged but values increased by 3% to over &euro;520 million, continuing the growth seen in recent years. Pigmeat prices tend to be cyclical in nature with periods of lower prices and production followed by recovery and this has remained the case for many years. <br\/><br\/>My Department carefully monitors developments in the pig sector, both domestically and internationally. I also met with members of the IFA National Pigs and Pigmeat Committee last month to hear their views on recent developments.<br\/><br\/>In relation to the<b><\/b>Russian ban on EU pigmeat exports, I am fully aware of the concerns Irish pig farmers have as a result of the closure of this market. At EU level the Commission has referred this matter to the WTO for resolution. I have called on the European Commission to monitor the developments on markets and where necessary, to quickly activate safety net provisions such as public interventions and\/or private storage aid.<br\/><br\/>Indeed, at the most recent EU Agriculture Council meeting on 10 November, I supported a request from my Danish counterpart for the introduction of Private Storage Aid for the pigmeat sector. While this proposal had the support of a number of Member States, it was refused by the European Commission who nevertheless, pledged to keep the issue under review. <br\/><br\/>Support is provided by my Department for the pig sector in a number of ways. Firstly I have included provision in 2015 and throughout the whole RDP for an on-farm capital investments scheme, TAMS II, with an overall budget of &euro;395 million across all sectors, with &euro;37 million allocated for 2015. \u00a0Amongst the areas identified for initial funding are investments on pig farms for energy, water meters and medicine dispensers.Other elements of the RDP, such as targeted on farm animal health and welfare scheme will also be of benefit to the pig sector. <br\/><br\/>Other supports for the sector come through Teagasc which, through its Moorepark pig research facility and courses in pig production, plays an important role in improving production at farm level. Through its Joint Research Advisory Programme, Teagasc will support Irish pig producers by providing advice, research and education across a range of issues of importance to the sector. The programme has enabled Teagasc to employ four additional advisors and researchers to support producers and the sector through advice, research and education across a range of issues of importance to the sector. The high level objective of the programme is to enhance the sustainability of Irish pig meat production, including improvements in economic, social and environmental standards. This will result in improvements in the production and marketability of Irish pigmeat. <br\/><br\/>I am also conscious of the need to promote the consumption of Irish pigmeat in domestic and overseas markets. Bord Bia provides assistance to the pigmeat sector through its marketing and promotional activities, and the pigmeat quality assurance scheme helps to consolidate the position of Irish pigmeat on the domestic market and helps expand its presence on EU and third country markets. <br\/><br\/>For my part, I have undertaken to ensure that as many alternative markets as possible are open to Irish Pigmeat processors. In this regard I was pleased to recently announce the opening of the markets in Vietnam and the Philippines for Irish pigmeat which will serve as valuable alternative markets to Russia for Irish pigmeat exports.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112700055#WRK01000","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Single Payment Scheme Applications","counter":249,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112700055#WRK01100"},{"type":"question","counter":250,"qnumday":92,"qnumall":"[45679\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112700055#WRK01200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when a person (details supplied) in County Mayo will receive their single farm payment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1071","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":251,"content":"<p>An application under the 2014 Single Payment Scheme was received from the person named in my Department on 24 April 2014.

The superlevy is set by milk quota Regulations agreed at EU level.  Any amendment to the regime requires a proposal from the Commission and agreement of a qualified majority of all other Member States.  At numerous Agriculture Council meetings over the recent past the issue of additional measures to ensure a &lsquo;soft landing&rsquo; to milk quota abolition in 2015 was discussed.  I, and some other like-minded Ministers, consistently called on the Commission to take action to ease the burden of the super levy in the final year of the quota regime but such an agreement was not forthcoming at the time and this remains the case.  As there is no common position at the Council of Agriculture Ministers such an adjustment looks unlikely to be achieved.<\/p><p>  It must be clearly noted that a number of other countries are opposed to any action on this and have sought to link the issue to possible measures to regulate supply after quotas are gone.  I am obviously resolutely opposed to any talk of supply controls after quota abolition next April on the basis that these quotas have only served to shackle Irish farmers over the last 30 years.  The resultant stalemate means there is insufficient support for any change to the regulations and no agreement has been possible.  The current Italian presidency agreed to consider the issue at their first Council meeting in July, it was again discussed in October and I fully expect that the issue will remain high on the agenda for discussion at future Councils, including December, where I will continue to seek to have the matter progressed in a way that is fair to both Irish and EU dairy farmers.   <\/p><p>  In preparing their enterprises for the post quota era, I have at all times urged that farmers have regard to the fact that milk quotas would remain in place until April 2015, along with the associated superlevy regime, and I would take this opportunity today to reiterate this call.  I would again urge farmers to use the time period between now and the removal of milk quotas to identify, with their dairy adviser, steps to manage both their milk supply and their dairy herds so that they have an efficient herd as they enter the post quota era.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112700056#WRL00700","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disadvantaged Areas Scheme Payments","counter":271,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112700056#WRL00800"},{"type":"question","counter":272,"qnumday":99,"qnumall":"[45763\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112700056#WRL00900","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when payment will issue in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Galway under the 2014 disadvantaged area based scheme; the reason for the delay in issuing this payment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":273,"content":"<p>An application under the 2014 Disadvantaged Areas Scheme was received from the person named on 13 May 2014.

The funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 380,000 young people and involve approximately, 1,400 youth work staff in 477 projects and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country.  In 2014, funding of &euro;49.78m has been provided to my Department for these schemes. <\/p><p>  I am pleased to advise that Budget 2015 has confirmed that funding of &euro;49.78m will again be provided to my Department in 2015 to support the provision of youth services.

There is limited funding available for new projects over the next multi-annual period 2015-2019 given the level of commitments and the costs to completion already in place.

Under the legislation, determination of an individual&rsquo;s eligibility for a medical card is the responsibility of the HSE. The 1970 Health Act obliges the HSE to assess whether a person is unable, without undue hardship, to arrange GP services for themselves and their family, having regard to their overall financial situation and reasonable expenditure. There is no automatic entitlement to a medical card for persons with specific illnesses, or with a disability.<\/p><p>  The system of assessment for eligibility for those 70 years of age and over is based on significantly higher gross income limits rather than the standard net income thresholds. This advantageous arrangement for persons aged over 70 years has facilitated a much greater share of this cohort qualifying for a medical card compared to the general population as a whole. In the main, persons in the over-70s age cohort do not have the same outlays and expenses as those under 70 years of age who are assessed on a means basis. However in circumstances where their income exceeds these limits persons aged over 70 years may still be eligible for a medical card where discretion is exercised where they face undue hardship in arranging medical services as a result of medical or social circumstances.<\/p><p>  The Deputy is aware that the Director-General of the HSE established an Expert Panel to examine and recommend the range of medical conditions that would be considered as a basis of eligibility for health services.  The Expert Panel report was presented to Minister Varadkar last month.  The Expert Panel concluded that it was not feasible, desirable, nor ethically justifiable to list medical conditions in priority order for medical card eligibility. It also concluded that a person&rsquo;s means should remain the main qualifier for a medical card and recommended that the existing eligibility assessment should be extended beyond financial hardship to include an assessment of the burden of a medical condition, but it noted that there are significant challenges to including such an assessment. It is however recognised by Government that there is a need for discretion and sensitivity in assessing eligibility, which will take into account an individual's medical condition and needs, rather than a list of specific medical conditions. In that context, the Government has approved a number of immediate improvements that the HSE is making to the medical card system. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112700060#WRP01000","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"question","counter":375,"qnumday":132,"qnumall":"[45600\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112700060#WRP01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a medical card decision will issue in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Cork","asker":"996","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":376,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p><p>  The Health Service Executive operates the General Medical Services scheme, which includes medical cards and GP visit cards, under the Health Act 1970, as amended.

Officials recently raised this case, and our concerns regarding the blasphemy laws and persecution of Christians generally, with the Embassy of Pakistan.<br\/><br\/>At EU level, freedom of religion or belief and freedom of opinion and expression play a central role in the EU&rsquo;s dialogue with Pakistan.  The former High Representative for Foreign Affairs of the European Union, Catherine Ashton has expressed her concerns at the judgment, and others like it, on numerous occasions, and has called on Pakistan to respect human rights as guaranteed under international conventions.<br\/><br\/>On 18 October last, a spokesperson for the European External Action Service expressed sadness and deep concern at the High Court decision to uphold this person&rsquo;s conviction, and called on Pakistan to ensure for all its citizens, full respect of human rights as guaranteed by international conventions to which it is party.  The spokesperson further noted that the EU considers the death penalty a cruel and inhumane punishment and expressed the hope that the verdict would be appealed to the Supreme Court and struck down swiftly.<br\/><br\/>The issue of the death penalty in Pakistan and this case were also the subject of a statement made on behalf of the EU High Representative\/Vice-President Catherine Ashton at a plenary session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg on 22 October last.  In the course of that Statement, it was noted that the EU, and particularly its Delegation in Islamabad, would continue to follow the case closely and would continue to advocate for the verdict to be overturned and for the person concerned to be released.  While not trying to intervene in an ongoing court case, the Statement noted that the EU would use any opportunity to raise this case and the wider issues of the death penalty and blasphemy law, with Pakistan.<br\/><br\/>The EU Special Representative for Human Rights, Mr Stavros Lambrinidis also visited Pakistan at the end of last month, where he held an in depth dialogue with the Pakistan authorities on key human rights issues.<br\/><br\/>At the UN level, Pakistan underwent a &lsquo;Universal Periodic Review&rsquo; of the human rights situation in the country at the United Nations Human Rights Council in October 2012.  At this review, concern was expressed about this case and calls were made for Pakistan to consider adopting an official moratorium on the death penalty.  During the process, Ireland recommended that Pakistan take all appropriate measures to combat and prevent discrimination against religious and other minority groups, including by removing educational material which could serve to perpetuate discrimination.<br\/><br\/>Ireland attaches great importance to the fundamental human rights of freedom of thought, conscience, religion or<font color=\"#FF0000\"> <\/font>belief.

They place a strong focus on education and prevention strategies to deal with bullying behaviour including, in particular, cyberbullying and identity based bullying such as homophobic and transphobic bullying.  The procedures make clear that the focus of any prevention and education awareness measures in schools about cyber-bullying should be on educating pupils on how to stay safe while on-line and also on developing a culture of reporting any concerns about cyber-bullying.  The procedures also recognise that parents and pupils have a role and responsibility in helping the school to prevent and address school-based bullying behaviour and to deal with any negative impact within school of bullying behaviour that occurs elsewhere.  <br\/><br\/>The procedures set out requirements in relation to the consistent investigation, follow up and recording of bullying behaviour amongst pupils.  They also require that a programme of support for pupils who have been bullied must be in place in all schools.  Details of the school's programme for working with pupils affected by bullying must be set out in the school's anti-bullying policy.<br\/><br\/>There is no requirement for reporting incidents of bullying centrally to the Department.  The procedures contain new oversight arrangements which include a requirement that the school Principal reports regularly to the board of management in relation to the overall numbers of bullying cases and provides confirmation that they are being dealt with in accordance with the anti-bullying procedures.  The board of management is also required to undertake an annual review of the school's anti-bullying policy and its implementation by the school.

Longford, Inland Fisheries Ireland&rsquo;s (IFI) has co-ordinated actions of a range of State bodies, including the design and build of a disinfection station prototype and four units, funded by ESB, and the fishery has since reopened with strict biosecurity conditions including the prohibition of keep nets at the site.    <\/p><p>  Alien invasive species are a relative new issue that Irish public bodies have had to address and while IFI does not have a statutory remit as regards such species, it continues co-ordinating the comprehensive multi-agency response to the infestation and has been facilitating and chairing meetings of the Agencies since the infestation was discovered.  This group includes the IFI, the National Parks &amp;amp; Wildlife Service (NPWS), the Office of Public Works (OPW), Roscommon County Council, Longford County Council, Bord na Mona (BNM), the ESB and Waterways Ireland (WI). <\/p><p>  A detailed scientific assessment of the nature and extent of the infestation has been completed and based on this assessment the Agency Group agreed a dredging operation of the &ldquo;hot water&rdquo; stretch.  The possibility of a dredge operation on the navigation cut to Lough Ree is also being considered by the Group. <\/p><p>  The Agency Group has worked on a plan to carry out a trial dredge operation on the &ldquo;hot water&rdquo; stretch.  This trial is required to inform on the feasibility and success rate of the method(s) to be used in any larger scale operation, the method of disposal of the material collected and the overall funding that will be required to conduct the operation including disposal.<\/p><p>  The trial operation has required a number of matters to be resolved, including:<\/p><p>  1. Categorisation by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) of the material for disposal to determine where and how it can be disposed of and the cost of disposal.  Substrate samples were obtained by IFI with the assistance of the ESB, and BNM.  These samples are currently being analysed.<\/p><p>  2. Both Longford and Roscommon County Councils are investigating potential disposal locations and BNM is also investigating the suitability of one of their sites.<\/p><p>  3. Waterways Ireland has indicated its preparedness to carry out the trial dredge operation with the support of the Agency Group once the disposal requirements are determined by EPA.

Currently, this is\u00a0a 'straight-to-court' offence which attracts 5 penalty points on conviction.  The change\u00a0I will be implementing shortly - by commencing section 10 of the Road Traffic Act 2014 - is to bring this offence within\u00a0the Fixed Charge Payment System so that persons will have the option of receiving 3 penalty points on payment of the Fixed Charge rather than automatically being required to go to court.<\/p><p>  The RSA has overall responsibility for the operation,\u00a0oversight\u00a0and delivery of the National Car Test and as such, statistics\u00a0relating to NCT waiting times at any particular test centre is a matter for the Authority.  I\u00a0have therefore referred\u00a0this aspect of Deputy\u00a0&Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's question to the\u00a0RSA\u00a0for direct reply.\u00a0 Please advise my Office if you do not receive a reply within 10 working days. <\/p><p>  I am advised that,\u00a0while there is currently a high demand for car tests, the vast majority of car owners will receive an NCT appointment within 28 days.  Customers who need an early appointment are put on a priority list and get the test within this timescale. <\/p><p>  I also understand, from the RSA, that the availability of appointments on the NCT website is not a reflection of the total number of slots available for customers.  Customers are advised that if they cannot obtain a suitable slot online they should contact the NCTS call centre directly on (01) 4135992.<\/p><p>  To further facilitate demand, an NCT may now be\u00a0undertaken up to 90 days in advance of the test due date without affecting the expiry date of the new certificate.  This system is in place to ensure that owners have ample time to have their vehicle tested before their current NCT certificate expires.  The RSA has\u00a0run a significant\u00a0advertising campaign since September to highlight this and\u00a0informs me that it is\u00a0in a favourable position to deal with current demand.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112700070#WRZ02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1007"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Transport","counter":627,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112700071#WRAA00150"},{"type":"question","counter":628,"qnumday":218,"qnumall":"[45661\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112700071#WRAA00200","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the status of the feasibility report on the new Cabra-Finglas link bus, which is due before end of November 2014.","asker":"966","askee":"1007"},{"type":"speech","counter":629,"content":"<p>The issue raised is a matter for the National Transport Authority (NTA) and I have forwarded the Deputy's question to the NTA for direct reply.<br\/><br\/>Please advise my private office if you do not receive a response within ten working days.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112700071#WRAA00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1007"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tourism Ireland Funding","counter":630,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112700071#WRAA00350"},{"type":"question","counter":631,"qnumday":219,"qnumall":"[45690\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112700071#WRAA00400","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if he is satisfied with the current operation of the Dursey Island cable car; if he will provide investment for the cable car to ensure a consistent and quality service; and if he will make a statement on the matter.
