I am sure the Leader will agree that it is not in the best interests of the House or its future that on a Wednesday there are very long suspensions when there is no business to be conducted.  I understand the Leader is relying on Ministers to bring legislation before the House, but I would like to put down a marker and suggest he increase the pressure on his ministerial colleagues to try to bring more legislation before the House because it deserves it.  Ministers who come here will testify that this House acts in the most professional way possible in dealing with legislation.  Ultimately, this enhances the House.<\/p><p>The first report of the advisory group on tax and social welfare was published yesterday.  I understand that overnight the Minister for Social Protection kicked the report into an Oireachtas committee and that the newspapers are reporting that it could be 18 months or after the next general election before an attempt is made to address the issues raised in it.  The Minister should come before the House to outline her views on the report which she has had for over one year.<\/p> <p>Last evening we could see on television a member of the committee which drew up the report and even she admitted there was no guarantee the savings that would accrue as a result of the implementation of these recommendations to reduce child poverty.  Ultimately, the impression being created by this report, its recommendations and the immediate aftermath of its publication is that the Government would save \u20ac200 million through its implementation but there has been no discussion about how to address the wider issue of providing support services.<\/p><p>This country does not have a great record for support services for children and it is obvious from reading the report that if any aspect of the two preferred options would be implemented, it would not only have a severe impact on the squeezed middle but would affect those at the lower end of the income scale.  The recommendation on the top-up payments is that there should be abolition of the family income supplement.  Ultimately, the people targeted by the recommendations would lose out.<\/p><p>It is important in that context that the Minister should come before the House and outline her views not just on child benefit but how the money would be distributed if the recommendations were implemented to address support services.  For example, there is the high cost of child care.  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Fitzgerald, some months ago indicated her belief that there should be a change in child benefit and that it should be targeted at child care places.  Before we take on any recommendations that will affect those at the bottom end, there is a need for a debate on how the money for child benefit is distributed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013022100002#A00300","speaker":"1128","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1361442600,"counter":9,"content":"<p>The Minister, Deputy Burton, will be in the House next Tuesday to debate issues arising from the Mangan report.  She has put on record several times her concern and anxiety to ensure reform of social protection payments in general and payments directed at alleviating child poverty in particular.  We have seen rates rise but outcomes have not improved.  As I said yesterday, it is worrying to see how outcomes of child poverty do not appear to have improved despite the money that has been spent.  We need to consider how best to spend the money we have and ensure outcomes can be improved.<\/p><p>Senator Mooney has mentioned putting money directly into the provision of services.  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Fitzgerald, will come to the House in two weeks; she was scheduled to come here some weeks ago but we had to postpone the debate because of the funeral of Detective Garda Adrian Donohoe.  She will come to the House in two weeks to debate issues surrounding children's rights and child care, so we can have the debate on both of those days.<\/p><p>I welcome the fact that today we will have another session of the Seanad Public Consultation Committee from midday on the subject of making change through social entrepreneurship.  As the Leader noted, all Senators are welcome and encouraged to attend the hearings in this Chamber when there is public consultation.  Anybody who attended the last consultation on lifestyle changes and prevention of cancer or the previous consultation on the rights of older people would have found it a valuable experience.  There are some really impressive speakers coming today, as we have had previously.  I urge colleagues to sit in for at least some of the hearings today, when we will hear from Ms Deirdre Mortell of One Foundation, Mr. Paul O\u2019Hara of Ashoka Ireland, Ms Caroline Casey of Kanchi, Mr. James Whelton of CoderDojo, Mr. Se\u00e1n Coughlan of Social Entrepreneurs Ireland and Ms Niamh Gallagher of Women for Election.

There will be a people's parade, a new part of the Dublin festival, and those of us privileged to live in Dublin or near the parade will be encouraging friends and relatives to join us, visit the parade and celebrate the day.<\/p><p>I know we will debate the Magdalen report next week and there are some reports today about possible preclusions or restrictions on applications from survivors who went through the redress board.

It is a commendable exercise.<\/p><p>Yesterday the House was alerted to the imminent dangers of the practice of medicine by doctors without insurance, with all sides of the House agreeing on the urgency of the matter contained in Senator Burke's Bill.  The only element not in agreement was, of course, the Department of Health.  Committee Stage is scheduled for next Tuesday and it should go ahead.  We cannot be alerted by Senator Burke to a major problem and allow uninsured doctors to practise for a minute longer than necessary.  We do not want the Bill to go the same way as when Senator Crown alerted the Department of Health to the dangers of smoking in cars when children are present; that Bill disappeared into the Department of Health nearly a year ago.  The Department of Health and other branches of the permanent Government should take note of what happens in Parliament.  Now that we have been alerted by Senator Burke to the problem of uninsured practice of medicine, it cannot be allowed to continue for a minute longer than is necessary.<\/p><p>There are manifestations of the same kind of problem with other Ministers and Ministers of State.  Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, has refused to allow any role in Science Foundation Ireland for the Royal Irish Academy and the Royal Dublin Society.  Civil servants do not have a monopoly on wisdom in this country.  A completely inadequate regulatory impact assessment was circulated approximately six weeks late for the taxi regulation Bill, which is not good enough either.<\/p><p>We have been alerted to the practice of medicine by people without insurance and that should be dealt with urgently.  I urge the Leader to ensure the Bill can proceed, and the Department can put in amendments as we all do.  It is an urgent issue that should proceed.  I am delighted that Senator Burke is not deterred and has published another Bill today dealing with civil law and missing persons.  I commend him on his energy and commitment, and the Senator performs a notable role here.<\/p><p>We want regulatory impact assessments, as they are not a discretionary part of governance in this House.  They must be circulated with a Bill and comprehensively cover their contents.  We are paid to play a role and are very well led by the Cathaoirleach and Leader.  Nevertheless, we have been shoddily treated with the medical insurance, Science Foundation Ireland and the taxi regulation issues.

We do not know exactly what has happened but I encourage the Minister to allow the Bill to go through, as was intended up to an hour before its arrival in the House.  It was considered acceptable to that point.<\/p><p>There is a dangerous gap in Ireland in the detail of statistics for children, particularly with regard to obesity.<\/p> <p>In a week when we learned that one in four children in Ireland are obese it is something we need to give urgent attention to.  On the website of the UK National Health Service there is an obesity or body mass calculator.  Parents can put in basic information about their children and assess where they are.  When a child is born she is weighed regularly to see that she is gaining weight in the appropriate way.  There should be a system whereby the progress of a child's health, comprising all the various components, including weight, be assessed not on a seriously regular basis but certainly frequently.  Moreover, once a child presents to a general practitioner showing signs of obesity, serious measures should be taken to deal with it.<\/p><p>There has been public consultation and a good report on the subject of lifestyle and how to reduce cancer and increase life expectancy.

This relates to the comments of Senator Bacik.  Apparently, officials from the Department of Justice and Equality have cast doubt on whether the Magdalen survivors would be included in the redress scheme because some of them have already been party to the residential institutions redress scheme.  They were given an assurance at that time that this was a stand-alone inquiry.  These are not avaricious people.  They have indicated that they were not primarily looking for money and it is humiliating for them to suggest in any way that they are.  The logic of it is odd.  If a person was injured in two successive car crashes separated by several years, one would expect, rightly, that the person would be compensated for both.<\/p><p>  I wish to address the business of Bethany House.  As Senator Bacik generously indicated, I have raised this issue over many years.  In particular and in general I have raised the question of the apparent exclusion for Protestants from any kind of ill-doing in this area, whether bullying in schools or this kind of institutional abuse.  I am concerned about an article that appeared in the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>, usually a reasonable and balanced newspaper, on 3 January.  This seems to me to be a sensationalised, ill-informed and opportunistic piece.  The language does nothing to justify or assist in this cause.  The article stated: &quot;There was slaughter from 1935 to 1944&quot; and &quot;They died because it suited.&quot;  That is an accusation of mass murder and I do not believe it is appropriate or balanced.  The person indicated that the church did not run the homes and that there was an involvement by an evangelical wing.  As someone who has raised this matter, I am not in any way attempting to excuse the people at the institutions involved.  Most worryingly, the article inaccurately states:<blockquote>And I have heard this self-awareness clearly in some voices and actions in the Catholic Church.  But none in the Church of Ireland.<\/blockquote>Where was this person when on radio the previous Archbishop of Dublin, the Reverend Dr. John Neill, demanded that Bethany Home be included in the redress scheme?

The survey revealed that one in four children are overweight.  The Government is going about the matter in the right way by conducting surveys.  A high percentage of obese children were in poor circumstances.  This is related to what the Minister for Social Protection is doing in respect of child care and children's benefits.  I support Senator Bacik in seeking an early debate on this issue.<\/p><p>I ask that a statement be issued on the survivors of the Bethany Home.

I refer to the undocumented Irish in America.  If they come to Ireland they are in grave danger of being unable to return to America.  They are living in a no-man's land.  They are part of the Irish nation but they must be suffering.  I know of one case involving an individual from County Tipperary who married an American girl.  The couple returned for a holiday but, unfortunately, he was not allowed to return to America, and she had to return on her own.  The Taoiseach has indicated that he will be raising this question at the highest level and President Obama has gone on record as favouring legislation to resolve the issue.  I hope we succeed on this occasion.  There are hundreds of thousands of undocumented Irish, and their numbers are increasing by 400 or more per day as people emigrate from Ireland.  A considerable number of members of the Irish nation are in America but they are not recognised.  I hope that anybody who has an influence not only in political circles but also in business and organisational circles will raise the issue.  We should treat it as a matter of urgency.  Whoever walks down Fifth Avenue on St. Patrick's Day will be watched by people who are hiding their identities and faces.

I am aware of many people in Meath whose parents come from Dublin, Meath, Westmeath and further afield to mind children.

I heard the T\u00e1naiste indicate yesterday that in the course of his forthcoming visit to the United States this issue will be at the top of his agenda and that he will work with the US authorities and Government to try to make progress on the matter.  There appears to be a window of opportunity in view of the recent comments of President Obama, but the issue will require cross-party support in the US political system.  A number of years ago, the late Ted Kennedy, in conjunction with Senator John McCain, produced legislation which would certainly have been effective in transforming the lives of tens of thousands of undocumented Irish in the US if enacted.  Sadly, the legislation did not pass.<\/p><p>The momentum may be there now for similar legislation and I am sure the Government will be very helpful on the issue.  Lobby groups in the United States are very strong and are doing tremendous work.  My first visit to the US as a politician was in 1989, when being without documents was a profound problem, just as it appears to be again.  At that stage, the Irish Immigration Reform Movement was the main organising body and a young gentleman from Dublin, Daniel O'Leary, whose uncle was the Captain of the Guard here in Leinster House, was one of its leaders.<\/p> <p>This problem went under the radar in the 1990s and perhaps in the first decade of the new millennium.

On a few occasions, this House and the other House have passed various motions of support for these people.  Perhaps it is something we could consider doing again, particularly in advance of St. Patrick's Day.  I support Senator \u00d3 Murch\u00fa, as I believe everybody does.

One in four children are regarded as being overweight.  It would be remiss of me not to comment on it today.  Obesity is a complex area from two perspectives, the first of which relates to genetics.  I know the Children's Research Centre is doing a great deal of research in this area.  Children who have become obese as a result of genetic factors, regardless of their fitness regime or diet, will always have to deal with this issue.  The second perspective on obesity relates to the lack of education on fitness and diet.  More importantly, there is a lack of understanding of what motivation is all about and of the lazy society we are dealing with from parents down.  There are numerous initiatives in this area.  The Growing Up in Ireland study has been mentioned.  The Minister for Health is launching an initiative in the Mansion House next week.  The Irish Sports Council, the national governing bodies and groups of individuals around the country are doing wonderful things to educate children who participate in physical activity.  We have to challenge those who are lost to physical activity.<\/p><p>Although it is just a reality television show, I believe &quot;Operation Transformation&quot; is a six-week wonder.  At last week's meeting of the Joint Committee on Health and Children, I asked whether the fitness and awareness levels of people in Ireland had improved or worsened during the programme's six years in existence.  Despite the fact that &quot;Operation Transformation&quot; is an awareness campaign, my opinion is that such levels have worsened.  When the witnesses at last week's meeting proposed a seven-point plan, I pointed out that it is a no-brainer to those of us who grew up in sport.  The most important issue is the implementation of the plan.  The Departments of Education and Skills, Health, Children and Youth Affairs, Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and Transport, Tourism and Sport are all doing wonderful things in different directions.  We need a little cohesion in this area.  I am pleased to be able to tell the House that since I brought my Points for Life initiative to the Seanad in November 2012, I have been working closely with the Departments of Education and Skills.  My initiative is now a priority on the Department's schedule.  In the next couple of months, I hope to formally launch a physical exercise programme that will enable children to learn the fundamental skills of what this is all about.<\/p><p>I would like to finish on another note.

Over Christmas, I spoke to a lady whose husband had died and whose two sons in the US were not in a position to come home for the funeral.  As both of them are in the US illegally, they were afraid they would not be able to get back into that country if they came home.  That is an example of the human suffering of citizens of this country who are in the US without documentation.  The Government and the Oireachtas have a responsibility to do everything they can to assist our bipartisan friends in the US Congress as they consider this legislation, with the aim of ensuring it gets over the line.  There have been a number of possible dawns in this respect.  I attended a rally in Washington in 2007 when the Kennedy-McCain Bill, which ultimately faltered, was being considered.  Some 3,500 undocumented Irish people braved the snow to attend that rally.  They want to be able to pay their taxes.  They want a pathway to legalisation.  They want to be able to come home for family events.  They want to be legal.  They do not want to be illegal.  They want to play a part in the country they now consider to be their new home.  We often talk about giving the vote to Irish people who live abroad.  We should get the fundamentals right first.  We can improve their quality of life by sorting out their legal status.

He was right when he said that civil servants do not have a monopoly on wisdom where legislation is concerned.<\/p> <p>I must say I was perturbed that, given this is a Bill the Department of Health has been talking about bringing in for the last four years, it was not ready to accept Senator Burke's Bill, deal with it and have amendments made to it.  I do not believe Committee Stage of the Bill will come to the House next week.  However, we will certainly be putting pressure on the Department of Health to put in place a Bill, which it says it has practically prepared at this stage, and bring it before the House, or else amend Senator Burke's Bill.  I agree with the Senator that some civil servants may think they have a monopoly of wisdom and do not like Members bringing in legislation.  However, it is a matter of fact and they are going to have to live with it.

When it was suggested in the other House that we were not making sufficient efforts to deal with the Republican Party, the T\u00e1naiste outlined six people in that party with whom we were having conversations to try to address this situation.  This issue is important not alone for the undocumented Irish in the United States but also in regard to the human problems which their families suffer as a result of them not being able to come back for funerals and various other family events.  The House can be assured the T\u00e1naiste and the Taoiseach will do everything possible to address this in the coming weeks in particular.<\/p><p>Senator Mullen referred to funding for public service broadcasting and called for a fairer distribution of resources.  We all appreciate the work done by local radio stations, which play a very important role in society.  I will invite the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, to come to the House on that issue.  There are quite a number of issues on which we are looking for the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, to come to the House but, hopefully, he might be able to combine some of them in a debate here soon.<\/p><p>I will speak to Senator Mullins afterwards.

Some 5.2 million people have died, which is close to the figure in the Holocaust.  Certain specific actions are requested by politicians, the international community and the media.
