Insurance Ireland has advised that this is because livestock marts have a significant exposure to injuries to employees and members of the public.  Consequently premiums are reflective of the hazardous nature of this sector as well as its overall claims experience.  However they have indicated that they are not aware of any recent major increases in the cost insurance for agricultural mart owners.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In order to try and mitigate the hazardous nature of the marts environment, Insurance Ireland has also advised that insurers have developed active risk management programmes to try to reduce the level of accidents and injuries.\u00a0 In addition, I understand that insurers have been working with marts with a view to implementing improvements in management practices and facilities to reduce claims as this is the key area to manage claim costs.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy should also note that in my role as Minister for Finance I am responsible for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation.

This will use the SWITCH model to consider the impact of the Budget on poverty levels, in particular how the &lsquo;at risk of poverty&rsquo; rate changes as a result of the social welfare and tax measures contained in Budget 2018.  My Departments provide inputs to DEASP when they are preparing the Social Impact Assessment.  However, preliminary analysis carried out by my Departments indicates that, in overall terms, as a result of Budget 2018, households experience an average increase in the order of 1% in weekly disposable income. Gains are highest for the first (lowest income) quintile at over 2 per cent and lowest for the fifth (highest income) quintile at below 1 per cent, pointing to a progressive Budget package.  Notwithstanding the usefulness of SWITCH in providing results which are representative of the full population of households in Ireland, it has a number of notable shortcomings. It does not, for example, model the impact of expenditure on public services such as health or education, which has an important impact on alleviating poverty.<\/p>  <p>  As a tax-benefit model, however, SWITCH does show the impact of tax and social welfare changes announced in the Budget.  I note that Ireland has the second most progressive income tax system in the OECD, meaning that those on higher incomes pay proportionally more in tax than those on lower incomes.  By definition, this implies that any tax reduction will benefit those who earn most. The SWITCH model results for the Budget tax package reflect this fact; it is a consequence of having such a progressive tax system in the first place. <\/p>  <p>  The CSO produces statistics on poverty using the Survey of Income and Living Standards (SILC). The survey provides data on household income, poverty and deprivation rates, and income inequality.  The latest SILC data relate to 2015 and indicate that the &lsquo;at risk of poverty&rsquo; rate in Ireland was 16.9%, below the EU28-average.  The &lsquo;at risk of poverty&rsquo; rate represents the percentage of the population in households where equivalised disposable income per person is less than 60% of the median. <\/p>  <p>  If all social transfers were excluded from income, the &lsquo;at risk of poverty&rsquo; rate would have been 46.3% in 2015, according to the same survey.  I note that the difference between two rates points to the effective role of the overall social welfare system in combatting poverty.<\/p>  <p>  This is also reflected in the fact that Ireland&rsquo;s Gini co-efficient for disposable income is below the OECD-average (2014 is the latest year for which data are available).  The Gini co-efficient is the most common measure of income inequality and the lower it is the lower the level of income inequality.  Indeed, Ireland&rsquo;s tax and welfare system lead to the largest absolute reduction in income inequality in the OECD.<\/p>  <p>  In summary, the discretionary measures announced in Budget 2018 will result in income gains, with the greatest impact for households on the lowest incomes.  I look forward to seeing DEASP&rsquo;s assessment as to its impact on poverty.  I reiterate that the tax and social welfare system overall continue to reduce income inequality and reduce poverty in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102400059#WRA01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Financial Services Regulation","counter":16,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102400059#WRA01500"},{"type":"question","counter":17,"qnumday":17,"qnumall":"[44660\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102400059#WRA01600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he is satisfied that the avenues of complaint available to mortgage customers who may have been overcharged on their mortgages, including, for example, complaints to the Financial Services Ombudsman, are fit for that purpose.","asker":"1259","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":18,"content":"<p>The first avenue of complaint for any customer aggrieved by an action of a regulated financial service provider is to complain to the entity concerned.

The Ombudsman&rsquo;s website\u00a0has a simple on-line complaint form. Of course, it will also accept complaints in writing. <\/p>  <p>  The Financial Services Ombudsman has informed me that he tries, in the first instance, to resolve complaints in an informal manner by mediation through its dedicated Dispute Resolution Service.  Where disputes are not resolved through mediation the FSO will investigate and adjudicate the complaint.\u00a0 The FSO has a wide range of powers and can direct compensation of up to &euro;250,000 and direct rectification which could, for example, include redress where a borrower has been charged the incorrect interest rate. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, the time limit for long term financial services was recently extended and consumers are now able to submit complaints within three years of becoming aware of the reason for their grievance.

The central purpose of the R&amp;amp;D tax credit is to encourage companies to undertake high-value added R&amp;amp;D activity in Ireland, thereby supporting jobs and investment here. Reflecting these considerations, the Government&rsquo;s Innovation 2020 Strategy aims to achieve the EU 2020 target of increasing overall (i.e. public and private) R&amp;amp;D expenditure in Ireland to 2.5 per cent of GNP by 2020. <\/p><p>The cost of the R&amp;amp;D Tax Credit in 2015, which is the latest figure available, was &euro;708 million. <\/p><p>A review of the R&amp;amp;D credit was carried out ahead of Budget 2017, and it concluded that:<\/p><p>- The R&amp;amp;D tax credit is responsible for 60% of the R&amp;amp;D being conducted.  This is considered to be a reasonable level of additionality.<\/p><p>- The bang for buck ratio is estimated to be 2.4 (i.e. for every one euro in foregone tax revenue, &euro;2.40 in additional R&amp;amp;D is being conducted).  This is also considered a reasonable result. <\/p><p>Overall, the paper&rsquo;s findings suggest that the rationale for the R&amp;amp;D tax credit is not in question.  Firms clearly respond to it by increasing their R&amp;amp;D.<\/p><p>It important to note the changes that have occurred in the R&amp;amp;D tax credit since its inception, which have contributed to the increased cost of the tax credit.  In particular, the removal of the base year threshold and the introduction of the refundable element of the R&amp;amp;D tax credit have contributed to an increased cost.<\/p><p>Between 2012 and 2015, the base year threshold of the R&amp;amp;D Tax Credit was phased out and ultimately removed.  This entailed that all relevant expenditure could qualify for the R&amp;amp;D Tax Credit.  Previously, qualifying R&amp;amp;D was only that in excess of the expenditure incurred in 2003.\u00a0 The concept of the base year threshold ignored the fact that the availability of the R&amp;amp;D tax credit can be an important factor in deciding whether to undertake a new project or not.  It is important to recognise that the R&amp;amp;D tax credit is not just important for stimulating additional R&amp;amp;D investment, but also for maintaining the R&amp;amp;D operations currently undertaken in the State.  It was anticipated that this change would lead to an increase in the cost of the tax credit.<\/p><p>My officials and I are conscious of the need for regularly evaluating the R&amp;amp;D tax credit.  However, it is important to recognise that while this is a generous tax credit, it is one of the few corporation tax credits that we have in Ireland, when compared with other jurisdictions.\u00a0 My officials and I are mindful of the need to constantly monitor the cost of the R&amp;amp;D tax credit and will continue to do so in line with the Department's Tax Expenditure Guidelines.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102400060#WRB01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Insurance Costs","counter":39,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102400060#WRB01100"},{"type":"question","counter":40,"qnumday":25,"qnumall":"[44693\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102400060#WRB01200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the status of the second phase of the cost of insurance working group on employer liability and public liability; the timeframe for the working group to come forward with recommendations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":41,"content":"<p>Following the publication of the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance\u00a0in January 2017, the Cost of Insurance Working Group commenced its examination of the cost of business insurance, in particular employer liability (EL) and public liability (PL).

Revenue&rsquo;s collection of receipts is essential to the Exchequer and the funding of public services for the State.<\/p>  <p>  Budget 2018 includes an additional &euro;100 million to be raised from three compliance measures, in relation to employer PAYE compliance (&euro;50 million), eCommerce\/online business compliance (&euro;30 million) and tax avoidance and base erosion capacity (&euro;20 million).  To support delivery of these measures, Revenue has been allocated an additional &euro;7m for extra staffing and ICT enhancements in the estimates for 2018.  These extra resources will enable Revenue to target additional compliance activities in the areas specified and deliver the &euro;100 million expected from increased audit and intervention yield as well as changes in taxpayer behaviour prompted by Revenue&rsquo;s actions.  This is also in line with the recent Review of Ireland's Corporation Tax Code which\u00a0recommended that, to reduce uncertainty and ensure that Ireland protects its corporation tax base, Ireland should ensure an adequately resourced Competent Authority.<\/p>  <p>  The additional funding allocation and expected yield estimates are based on analysis of historical data recording the compliance receipts generated by Revenue in recent years.  They are also informed by work currently underway in these areas as part of Revenue&rsquo;s national compliance imperatives, which indicate the yield that could be expected in 2018 from increasing resources in these areas.<\/p>  <p>  Revenue&rsquo;s Comprehensive Review of Expenditure 2014 noted that Revenue staffing levels had reduced by 13% since 2008 and that by increasing resources additional revenue yield could be achieved.\u00a0 In recognition of this, the 2015, 2016 and 2017 Budgets provided for an increase of 266 (126, 50 and 90 respectively) in additional staffing resources for Revenue to deal with a wide variety of requirements across audit and compliance functions, debt management functions, LPT, international tax and Brexit. \u00a0I have again provided for additional staffing in Revenue in this year&rsquo;s Budget.<\/p>  <p>  Revenue received an additional funding allocation of &euro;3 million in 2016 to increase staff resources and assist in the delivery of the compliance measures announced in the 2016 Budget.

It is too early to accurately assess the impact of, or collection under, these headings for 2017.  This will not be possible until after the end of the year.

Lenders may only commence legal proceedings for repossession of the borrower's primary residence after it follows a number of steps.  The steps include:<\/p>  <p>  - making every reasonable effort under the CCMA to agree an alternative restructure arrangement (ARA) with the borrower;<\/p>  <p>  - time bound requirements to inform the borrower the regulated entity is not willing to offer an ARA and of his\/her options;<\/p>  <p>  - time bound requirements to inform a borrower, who is not willing to enter into an ARA, of his\/her options; and<\/p>  <p>  - a decision to classify the borrower as non-cooperating. <\/p>  <p>  Lenders must ensure that the case of each borrower is individually assessed on its merits to ensure fairness.  The Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) framework sets out the steps which lenders must follow.  A lender must carry out an affordability assessment by examining each case on its own merits and must base its assessment of the borrower's full circumstances including their ability to repay as determined by up to date information on a Standard Financial Statement (SFS).  A lender must explore all options for alternative repayment arrangements (that they offer) in order to offer the most viable option to each borrower.  The Code also requires lenders to review an alternative repayment arrangement at appropriate intervals for the type and duration of the arrangement.  The lender is also obliged to carry out a review of an alternative repayment arrangement at any time, if requested by the borrower. <\/p>  <p>  I am informed by the Central Bank that there is a broad range of available restructures offered and delivered by both bank and non-bank entities and there is strong evidence that both banks and non-banks look to exhaust available restructure options before moving to the legal process. <\/p>  <p>  I would like to draw the Deputy's attention to the Mortgage Arrears and Restructures Data released by the Central Bank on 12 September, which shows that to end-Q2 2017, the number of mortgage accounts in arrears for principal dwelling houses (PDH) has declined for the last sixteen consecutive quarters.  120,398 PDH accounts were also classified as restructured, of which 87% were reported to be meeting the terms of their arrangement.  A total of 340 Primary Dwelling Home properties were taken into possession during Q2 2017, down from 370 properties in Q1 2017.  Of the properties taken into possession during the quarter, 109 were repossessed on foot of a Court Order, while the remaining 231 were voluntarily surrendered or abandoned.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may also be aware of the Abhaile mortgage arrears resolution service, established to ensure that those either in mortgage arrears or at risk of going into mortgage arrears on their primary residence are able to access State-funded professional legal or financial advice on their resolution options.  <\/p>  <p>  The aim of Abhaile is to help mortgage holders in arrears to find the best solutions and keep them, wherever possible, in their own homes.  The service is proving very successful in assisting distressed borrowers, particularly those in longer term mortgage arrears. A dedicated adviser will work with borrowers in mortgage arrears and their lender to find the best solution for their situation.  <\/p>  <p>  If those in mortgage arrears need financial advice, they can get a free face to face meeting with an expert financial adviser.  The adviser can help them to work through their financial situation and explain the options available to them to help deal with their home mortgage arrears.  The expert adviser could be a MABS Money Adviser, a MABS Dedicated Mortgage Arrears adviser, a Personal Insolvency Practitioner (PIP) or an accountant.<\/p>  <p>  Distressed borrowers may also need legal advice on issues related to their mortgage arrears.  Under Abhaile they can have a free face-to-face meeting with a solicitor, who will explain their legal situation and advise them how best to resolve it.<\/p>  <p>  If they are called to court to face repossession proceedings on their home, they will be able to meet a Duty Solicitor at the court.  The Duty Solicitor may be able to speak for them in court and explain the proceedings to them.<\/p>  <p>  A MABS staff member will also be present at court to help them.<\/p>  <p>  A Helpline is also available Monday to Friday, and a face-to-face service which is completely free, confidential and independent is also available in more than 60 locations nationwide.<\/p>  <p>  It is worth mentioning as has been done here many times before that where a borrower actively engages with their lender it is more likely that an equitable arrangement will be to try to assist the borrower to remain in their family home.

The consequence of this is that the Insurance Compensation Fund (ICF) has been deemed responsible for the payment of such third party claims.<\/p>  <p>  As the judgment has been delivered, the process of making payments in accordance with the provisions of the Insurance Act, 1964, as amended, has commenced. Under the current legislation payments can only be made out of the ICF, with the approval of the High Court and only if it appears to the High Court that it is unlikely that the claim can be met otherwise than from the ICF.  If satisfied, the High Court can order payments out of the ICF up to 65% (or &euro;825,000, whichever is the lesser) due to relevant claimants.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Liquidator has informed my Department that, as of 30 September 2017, there are 1,576 active claims, of which 573 claimants have been paid compensation from the ICF subject to the 65%\/&euro;825,000 limits.  The process of settling claims is still ongoing and are subject in some cases to complex negotiations between all relevant parties.  The Liquidator is currently working on settled claims and preparing them for inclusion in the next application to the High Court, expected to be made in February 2018.<\/p>  <p>  Over and above the 65% ICF payment, it is expected that a proportion of the balance of money due to third party claimants will be met from the proceeds of the distribution of Setanta&rsquo;s assets on completion of the liquidation process.  An actuarial report, commissioned by the liquidator, estimates the claims reserves at 30 June 2017 at between &euro;105.9 million and &euro;112.9 million.  This is an increase from the first report in 2014, which estimated the claims reserves at between &euro;87.7 million and &euro;95.2 million.<\/p>  <p>  A consequence of this is that based on this actuarial report, the liquidator now estimates that he will not be in a position to meet more than 22% of the claims out of the assets of the liquidation, rather than the not more than 30% of claims figure previously indicated. <\/p>  <p>  I am aware of the issue referred to by the Deputy regarding the potential liability of Setanta policyholders to third party claimants in the event they do not receive full compensation. \u00a0On the question of a Government assurance for such policyholders, I cannot make any commitment on this matter as there is a legal concern that any Government intervention could undermine the priority status of claimants in the liquidation.  Consequently, the Department of Finance is seeking legal advice on the impact on the State's ability to recover from the liquidated company if it were to compensate third party claimants for the balance due to them.

The carry forward of unrelieved trading losses is a usual feature in other tax jurisdictions.<\/p>  <p>  The effective tax rate of companies in 2015 was provisionally calculated by the Revenue Commissioners as 9.8%, representing a marginal increase on the 2014 rate of 9.7%.  In 2012 and 2013, the effective rate was 10.1%.  I would note that while these percentages are lower than the 12.5% headline rate, this can be attributed to the availability of the small number of targeted measures, such as the RandD tax credit, available in Ireland which may lower the effective rate of corporation tax paid.<\/p>  <p>  The issue of tax avoidance has been at forefront of the international tax agenda in recent years.\u00a0 The agreement of the OECD BEPS reports in late 2015 represented a landmark achievement in agreeing comprehensive reform of the international tax system. \u00a0Ireland has taken a number of steps towards implementing the BEPS recommendations and the Coffey Review sets out a roadmap for Ireland to follow in bringing certainty to the implementation of the remaining recommendations, beginning with the launch of a consultation process which is now underway. <\/p>  <p>  In keeping with our commitment to transparency, Ireland was among the first countries to implement Country by Country Reporting.  The first reports under the Country by Country Reporting requirement will be filed with Revenue in Ireland and worldwide this year.  These reports will be exchanged with all relevant countries to ensure tax authorities have a clear picture of the activities of large multinationals and can assess any risk that the correct tax has not been paid in the correct place. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Ireland was also among the first countries to sign the OECD BEPS multilateral instrument (MLI) in June this year.  This MLI will provide the mechanism for extensive changes to tax treaties globally.  It will ensure that tax treaties are updated to reflect a number of important OECD BEPS recommendations, including agreed standards on treaty shopping and dispute resolution.  Ireland will now seek to ratify the MLI, with the first steps in this process being taken in the Finance Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102400061#WRC01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":84,"content":"<p>Question No. 40 answered with Question No. 11.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Insurance Coverage","counter":85,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102400061#WRC01700"},{"type":"question","counter":86,"qnumday":41,"qnumall":"[41698\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102400061#WRC01800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the fact that residents in a housing estate (details supplied) are being refused home insurance by two major insurance companies due to flood risk; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1219","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":87,"qnumday":45,"qnumall":"[44701\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102400061#WRC01900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the consultations he has had with a group (details supplied) regarding difficulties faced by persons in Dublin 3 in relation to home insurance due to flood risks.","asker":"1291","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":88,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 41 and 45 together.<\/p>  <p>  I am conscious of the difficulties that the absence or withdrawal of\u00a0flood insurance\u00a0cover can cause to homeowners and businesses, and that is one of the reasons the Government has been prioritising\u00a0investment\u00a0in flood defences over the last number of years.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  However, you should be aware that the provision of insurance is a commercial matter for insurance companies, which has to be based on a proper assessment of the risks they are willing to accept.\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, neither the Government nor the Central Bank can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products or have the power to direct insurance companies to provide flood cover to specific individuals or businesses.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Government policy in relation to flooding is focused on the development of a sustainable, planned and risk-based approach to dealing with flooding problems.\u00a0 This in turn should lead to the increased availability of flood insurance.\u00a0 To achieve this aim, there is a focus on:<\/p>  <p>  - prioritising spending on flood relief measures by the Office of Public Works (OPW) and relevant local authorities,<\/p>  <p>  - development and implementation of plans by the OPW to implement flood relief schemes, and<\/p>  <p>  - improving channels of communication between the OPW and the insurance industry, in order to reach a better understanding about the provision of flood cover in marginal areas.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The above approach is complemented by a Memorandum of Understanding between the OPW and Insurance Ireland, which provides for the exchange of data in relation to completed flood defence schemes which should provide a basis for the increased provision of flood insurance in areas where works have been completed.  In this regard, the Insurance Ireland\/OPW working group, which the Department of Finance attends, now meets on a quarterly basis to support the information flow and improve the understanding of issues between both parties.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The core strategy for addressing areas at potentially significant risk from flooding is the OPW Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme.  The Programme, which is being undertaken by engineering consultants on behalf of the OPW working in partnership with the local authorities, involves the production of predictive flood mapping for each location, the development of preliminary flood risk management options and the production of Flood Risk Management Plans.<\/p>  <p>  I have been advised by the OPW that the majority of CFRAM Plans are now with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for its independent review of the environmental assessments.\u00a0 Once this is completed and observations addressed, the final Plans will be submitted to me for approval in my role as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the CFRAM flood maps are community based maps and while they provide a useful resource for planning and emergency responses, they cannot be used for commercial purposes.  Instead, the insurance industry uses its own flood modelling tools for assessing the level of risk to individual properties.<\/p>  <p>  While it is not possible for me to comment on individual cases, I have been advised by the OPW that \u00a0(i) the maps relating to Abberley, Killiney, Co.

They can elect to do so but the vast majority opt to remain unregistered.\u00a0 The flat-rate scheme was designed to compensate these unregistered farmers on an overall basis for the VAT charged to them on their purchases of goods and services relating to their activities.\u00a0 The flat-rate scheme sets out a percentage amount, known as the flat-rate addition (FRA), which unregistered farmers apply to their prices when selling to VAT-registered businesses (for example, co-operatives, meat factories, etc).\u00a0 The VAT-registered business treats the flat-rate amount as a normal business input in its periodic VAT return, claiming input credit for the flat-rate amount paid to the flat-rate farmer.  In this way, farmers are compensated for the VAT borne by them on their input costs, and this simplification reduces the administrative burden for them as there is no need to register for VAT to recover VAT borne on their inputs.<\/p>  <p>  A business model emerged in the poultry sector that exploits the interaction of the normal VAT system and the flat-rate scheme to engineer higher levels of flat-rate addition payments compared with the VAT borne on their input costs.  The model included the use of VAT-registered entities to recover VAT on costs borne on behalf of flat-rate farmers while those farmers continued to benefit from applying the flat-rate addition to their supplies.  In addition, the contra supply arrangements in relation to growing services and feedstuff that are widespread in the industry could be manipulated to increase the price of the growing service and hence the flat rate addition payment.<\/p>  <p>  However, it is important to recognise that businesses are free to organise their activities, within the law, to their economic advantage, including for the objective of minimising their tax liabilities or maximising the tax efficiency of their operations.  That essentially is what happened in this case; participants in the sector recognised and adopted structures and arrangements that had an obvious business rationale and which were also likely to increase the level of flat rate addition payments to unregistered growers in the sector. When this matter was brought to the attention of my Department, provision was made in Finance Act 2016 to enable the Minister for Finance to exclude sectors from the flat rate scheme where the business structures or models employed in that sector result in a systematic excess of flat-rate addition payments over input costs borne by flat-rate farmers within that sector.  This measure provides a means for dealing with any sector in which systematic over recovery of VAT is engineered through the adoption of lawful business arrangements and structures and Revenue will deal with such sectors through the use of this provision.<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0Following the introduction of this provision (by way of amendment to the VAT Consolidation Act 2010), Revenue undertook a detailed examination of the business structures, models and contractual arrangements in place between parties within the sector. As part of this review, Revenue met with all relevant parties including the Irish Farmers Association, poultry processors and representatives of co-operative societies operating in the sector during quarter 1 and quarter 2 of 2017.\u00a0 Following this engagement, co-operative societies undertook to recharge growers with all costs borne on their behalf plus VAT.\u00a0The undertakings given by the co-operative societies address one of the mechanisms likely to result in overcompensation for flat rate farmers in the sector and I welcome this progress.\u00a0 However, there is still scope for over-compensation through the use of contractual pricing arrangements and contra supplies between processors and growers.  I am advised by Revenue that they will shortly undertake a programme of audit type examinations of growers to establish if there is still a systematic excess of flat rate addition payments over VAT on input costs when account is taken of the recent changes implemented by cooperatives in the sector.<\/p>  <p>  I am pleased that the industry has abandoned some of the activities likely to give rise to overcompensation of growers for their VAT costs.  It would serve the industry well to examine if the pricing structures they operate currently could result in overcompensation of growers for their input VAT costs and to adjust them if this is the case.  If the industry could provide empirical evidence that overcompensation is not arising at current price levels or will not arise at new price levels to be implemented in the industry, it would remove the need for Revenue to proceed with its programme of interventions.  I am committed to making an order to exclude the sector from the flat rate scheme if it proves necessary to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102400061#WRC03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"European Banking Authority","counter":100,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102400061#WRC03200"},{"type":"question","counter":101,"qnumday":47,"qnumall":"[44897\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102400061#WRC03300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the position regarding Ireland&rsquo;s bid to host the European Banking Authority.","asker":"1436","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":102,"content":"<p>The European Banking Authority and the European Medicines Agency, which are currently located in London, have to move to another location within the EU when the UK leaves the Union. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland's formal offer to host the European Banking Authority (EBA) was submitted to the Commission by my Department on 31 July 2017. <\/p>  <p>  On 30th September 2017, the European Commission issued its evaluation of each of the eight bids to host the EBA.<\/p>  <p>  Along with Ireland&rsquo;s offer to locate the EBA in Dublin, offers were submitted for Brussels (Belgium), Frankfurt (Germany), Luxembourg, Paris (France), Prague (Czech Republic), Vienna (Austria), and Warsaw (Poland).\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  I welcome the Commission's assessment that Ireland meets all six of the selection criteria and the positive feedback given in relation to each of these.

The terms of reference for the review required that it also have regard to the overall yield from LPT and its contribution to total tax revenue on an ongoing basis and the desirability of achieving relative stability, both over the short and longer terms, in LPT payments of liable persons.  Dr Thornhill&rsquo;s review was informed by the outcomes of a public consultation which received 51 written submissions. <\/p>  <p>  Dr. Thornhill made a number of recommendations in his report on his review of the Local Property Tax.  His central recommendation was for a revised system whereby a minimum level of LPT revenues in each local authority area would be determined by Government, ideally having regard to the apportionment between local authority areas of the historic yield.  This in turn would allow for the estimation of LPT rates for each local authority area and the application of these by taxpayers and Revenue.  Local authorities could adjust this rate upwards by a factor of up to 15%.  This new system was recommended by Dr. Thornhill with a possible interim deferral of the next valuation date until November 2018 or November 2019.<\/p>  <p>My predecessor subsequently proposed to Government that the revaluation date for the LPT be postponed from 2016 to 2019.  This postponement meant that home owners were not faced with significant increases in their LPT in 2017 as a result of increased property values.\u00a0 The postponement also gives sufficient time for the other recommendations in Dr. Thornhill's report to be considered fully by the Government.  As I indicated during my appearance before the Budgetary Oversight Committee on 27 September\u00a0this work will be undertaken during 2018.  Naturally my\u00a0Department will be engaging closely with in particular the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government in this process.\u00a0 I can assure the Deputy that this work will be done in good time and that the Government will make its position clear so that households will know well advance what its plans are for LPT.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102400061#WRC04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of An Taoiseach","counter":116,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102400062#WRD00300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social and Affordable Housing Expenditure","counter":115,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102400062#WRD00200"},{"type":"question","counter":116,"qnumday":53,"qnumall":"[44374\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102400062#WRD00300","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if funding given to approved housing bodies for building social housing is counted towards general government fixed capital formation estimated by the CSO for EUROSTAT.","asker":"1217","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":117,"content":"<p>Approved housing bodies are classified in the non-profit sector.

This includes the amount of the arrears to date and the interest rate applicable to the arrears, details of any charges in relation to the arrears that may be applied and the importance of the personal consumer engaging with the regulated entity in order to address the arrears.This must be updated every three months, where the arrears persist. <\/p><p>Where a regulated entity reaches an agreement on a revised repayment arrangement with a personal consumer, the regulated entity must provide the personal consumer with a clear explanation of the revised repayment arrangement and clarification on what data relating to the consumer&rsquo;s arrears will be shared with the Irish Credit Bureau or any other relevant credit reference agency.<\/p><p>In relation to a self employed person's credit rating being adversely impacted with regard to mortgage arrears resulting from the accumulation of debt during the period of negotiation on warehousing between the person and the financial institution, and it's consequent affects, the Central Bank has advised me that\u00a0in December 2015, the Central Bank published new regulations for firms lending to small and medium enterprises (SME Regulations), with which regulated lenders (other than credit unions) have been required to comply with since 1 July 2016, and in the case of credit unions, from 1 January 2017.\u00a0 <\/p><p>The SME Regulations aim to strengthen protections for SMEs when borrowing from regulated lenders while also facilitating access to credit.They also set out a framework which regulated entities must comply with when dealing with SME borrowers in arrears and financial difficulties.The SME Regulations require regulated entities to establish and maintain in writing policies and procedures for dealing with borrowers in financial difficulties.Regulated entities must make available to borrowers an information booklet, to include: <\/p><p>- a statement emphasising that it is in the borrower&rsquo;s interest to engage with the regulated entity about arrears or financial difficulties; <\/p><p>- a statement that the financial difficulties may impact on the borrower&rsquo;s credit rating; <\/p><p>- the option of an immediate review of the borrower&rsquo;s credit facilities.<\/p><p>Within 10 working days of a borrower entering financial difficulties, a regulated entity must inform the borrower of, among other things:  <\/p><p>- the status of the account; <\/p><p>- the applicability of the SME Regulations; <\/p><p>- the availability of the information booklet referred to above; and<\/p><p>- that it is in the borrower&rsquo;s interest to engage with the regulated entity about arrears or financial difficulties<\/p><p>Where a regulated entity offers an alternative arrangement to an SME borrower, the regulated entity must provide certain information in writing to the borrower including how the alternative arrangement will be reported by the regulated entity to a relevant credit reference agency or credit register and that it may impact on the borrower&rsquo;s credit rating.\u00a0 The decision to grant credit is a commercial decision for lenders.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102400062#WRD03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Credit Unions","counter":145,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102400062#WRD03500"},{"type":"question","counter":146,"qnumday":65,"qnumall":"[44731\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102400062#WRD03600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the tax expenditures that exist to support credit unions, including those which the tax strategy group referenced in its 2009 recommendation that tax exemption for the income of credit unions should be continued (details supplied); if the tax expenditures recommended for continuance in that report are still in place; and the reason they are not enumerated in the Revenue Commissioners' published data on the cost of tax expenditures.","asker":"1291","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":147,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners\u00a0that the profits of Credit Unions have been exempt from tax since 1972.

This follows annual growth of 5.2 per cent in the first quarter.<\/p>  <p>  Strong GDP growth is being confirmed by developments in the labour market.  Employment growth remains strong with an annual rate of 2.4 per cent recorded in the second quarter of 2017, representing the creation of over 48,000 additional jobs over the year.  The increase in employment remains broad based with gains recorded in 11 of the 14 sectors reported by the CSO.  Since the low-point in 2012 there are now an additional 230,000 people in employment.<\/p>  <p>  The continued growth in employment has seen the unemployment rate fall from over 15 per cent in 2012 to 6.1 per cent in September 2017 which is close to the level considered to represent full employment in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The strong performance of the labour market is set to continue in the short term.  As part of Budget 2018, my Department is projecting that an additional 48,000 jobs will be created next year.<\/p>  <p>  However, there are a number of risks at present including the UK&rsquo;s decision to exit the EU, related to this the risk of a loss in competitiveness, and the possibility of significant tax reform in the US.<\/p>  <p>  Significant progress has been made in recent years in improving Ireland's competitiveness.  The latest figures from the Central Bank of Ireland show that Ireland's real harmonised competitiveness indicator (a widely used measure of competitiveness in Europe) has improved by over 19 per cent between its peak in 2008 and September 2017.  However, the sharp appreciation of the euro-sterling rate is posing significant challenges particularly for the traditional manufacturing sector, the tourism sector and areas sensitive to cross-border trade.<\/p>  <p>  These sources of uncertainty highlight the importance of prudent management of the public finances.  While Ireland&rsquo;s debt to GDP ratio has come down considerably in recent years, a significant factor in this has been GDP growth, which can be exaggerated in an Irish context.  In response to the well-known limitations with GDP and GNP figures, the CSO has published an alternative measure of economic activity titled modified Gross National Income or GNI*.  Using GNI* as the denominator highlights the still elevated levels of debt in the Irish economy, and the importance of sensible budgetary policies.  It is also important to focus on competitiveness-oriented policies that improve the resilience of the economy to ensure that we are in a better position to weather any global shocks which materialise.<\/p>  <p>  In summary, I am satisfied that the economic indicators remain stable and that our economic fundamentals are strong, although the level of uncertainty remains elevated.  In this regard, it is critical that appropriate polices are implemented and that is what the Government will continue to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102400063#WRE03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Help-To-Buy Scheme Data","counter":181,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102400063#WRE03300"},{"type":"question","counter":182,"qnumday":76,"qnumall":"[33438\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102400063#WRE03400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on whether the help-to-buy scheme is contributing to rising house prices (details supplied).","asker":"1355","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":183,"qnumday":90,"qnumall":"[44793\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102400063#WRE03500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the estimated cost to the Exchequer of the retention of the help-to-buy scheme; the anticipated affect this will have on house price inflation over 2018; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1253","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":184,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 76 and 90 together.<\/p><p>The Help to Buy incentive (HTB) is scheduled to end on\u00a031 December 2019.

This analysis of the Budget is undertaken and published every year by the ESRI. The article this year was headlined &ldquo;Budget 2018 leads to small losses in income at all levels&rdquo;. I believe that this headline &ndash; which I assume the Deputy is referring to in her question - is both incorrect in its own right and is unreflective of the full article written by the ESRI. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to clarify that the ESRI analysis reflects a specific modelling approach rather than the direct impact of tax and welfare measures on people&rsquo;s incomes, which is the basis on which Budgets are set. Their analysis relies on the SWITCH (Simulating Welfare and Income Tax Changes) model, a model also used by Government departments, to assess the distributional impact of the Budget. The SWITCH model is a tax-benefit micro-simulation model which allows users to analyse the impact of discretionary tax and social welfare policy in a way that is representative of the full population of households in Ireland. However, the methodology applied to the SWITCH model by the ESRI differs from the methodology used by Government departments.<\/p>  <p>  The ESRI analysis compares Budget 2018 to a hypothetical scenario where all tax bands, tax credits and welfare payments are increased by 3.1 percent, which is the ESRI&rsquo;s forecast of wage growth for 2018. They refer to this hypothetical scenario in the article as a &ldquo;neutral benchmark&rdquo;. By comparing Budget 2018 to this hypothetical scenario, they estimate that the Budget results in relative income losses. In other words, the ESRI did not say in their article that Budget 2018 directly imposes income losses on households, but rather that the Budget imposes losses relative to the ESRI&rsquo;s choice of benchmark.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to emphasise that their method does not result in a measure of the actual change in people&rsquo;s incomes by income group due to the budget. In contrast, my Department&rsquo;s methodology compares a situation where the existing 2017 tax and welfare parameters remain in place in 2018, to an alternative situation where the Budget 2018 tax and welfare parameters are applied. This method reflects the actual change in people&rsquo;s incomes resulting from the tax and welfare measures in Budget 2018, and I believe it is more informative than the ESRI approach when assessing the direct impact of the Budget on household incomes in 2018.<\/p>  <p>  I further note that in the main text of the article the ESRI acknowledge that the assumption of indexing tax and social welfare parameters to wage growth is costly; they estimate it would cost in the region of &euro;1.1 billion. The Budget Day Package, net of the &euro;180 million allocated to the Public Service Stability Agreement, is approximately &euro;1.2 billion. In line with the Programme for a Partnership Government and the Confidence and Supply arrangement, this is distributed on a 70:30 basis between expenditure and taxation measures, which exceeds the split outlined in the Programme for a Partnership Government. With this fiscal context in mind, the ESRI&rsquo;s hypothetical scenario of wage indexation is not affordable in 2018 given the other key priorities for Government expenditure such as housing and education.<\/p>  <p>  The elements of the Budget 2018 tax package relating to reductions to USC, increases to the income tax standard rate bands and increases to the Home Carer Tax Credit and the Earned Income Credit amount to a cost of &euro;333 million on a first year and &euro;397 million on a full-year basis.<\/p>  <p>  No Government has followed a policy of strict indexation of tax bands and\/or tax credits, as this does not allow flexibility to adapt spending as necessary to the level of resources available to the Government in any given Budget.  It would also restrict the ability of the Government to target resources where the need is greatest. <\/p>  <p>  The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection (DEASP) will produce and publish a Social Impact Assessment of Budget 2018 in the coming weeks. This will use the SWITCH model to consider the impact of the Budget on households across the income distribution. My Department provides inputs to DEASP when they are preparing the Social Impact Assessment. However, preliminary analysis carried out in advance of the Budget by my Department using the SWITCH model indicated that, in overall terms, households experience an average increase in the order of 1% in weekly disposable income as a result of Budget 2018. Gains are highest for the first (lowest income) quintile at over 2 per cent and lowest for the fifth (highest income) quintile at below 1 per cent, pointing to a progressive Budget package.

This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  Consequently, I am not in a position to review individual policies nor to direct insurance companies as to the pricing level or terms or conditions that they should apply in particular cases. <\/p><p>The Deputy should note that all insurers operating in the Irish market are regulated under conduct of business rules by the Central Bank of Ireland.

They have advised, however, that it is important for businesses to contact their insurance company or broker after the event and guidance will be provided on making a claim.  <\/p><p>With regard to household buildings and contents insurance, Insurance Ireland has also advised that policies will cover damage caused by storms.

Such a system limits the transferability of tax bands and credits from a non-earning spouse to the earning spouse, with the stated economic objectives of increasing labour force participation among secondary earners and reducing the numbers of workers paying the higher rates of income tax.<\/p>  <p>  In tandem with this move towards an individualised tax system, and in order to ensure a balance was maintained between those going out to work and families with caring responsibilities in the home, a Home Carer&rsquo;s tax allowance was introduced for married one-income families where one spouse works primarily in the home caring for children, the aged or incapacitated persons.<\/p>  <p>  This allowance was subsequently converted into the Home Carer Tax Credit (HCC), and the Deputy will be aware that, in Budget 2018, I announced that the HCC, which is of benefit to over 80,000 families annually, is being increased from &euro;1,100 to &euro;1,200 per annum.  This follows from an increase in last year&rsquo;s Budget from &euro;1,000 and an increase from &euro;810 in Budget 2016 giving a total increase in the credit over the last three Budgets of &euro;390.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the Deputy&rsquo;s proposal to extend the credit to all households, I note that the Deputy&rsquo;s question does not define household for this purpose &ndash; for example it is not clear if the Deputy envisages extending the credit to single person households, single parent households and\/or double income households.  In this regard, I would note that extending\u00a0the credit to households other than single-earner households with caring responsibilities in the home would run counter to the policy rationale underpinning the credit since its introduction.<\/p>  <p>  As with all tax credits, the HCC has the potential to be of benefit only to qualifying recipients with sufficient levels of taxable income to absorb the credit.  For example, a single-income, PAYE earner family will see a benefit from the HCC where household income exceeds &euro;24,750, as income of up to this amount can be sheltered from tax by the married personal tax credit of &euro;3,300 and the PAYE tax credit of &euro;1,650.

Credit Servicing Firms are typically firms that manage or administer credit agreements such as mortgages or other loans on behalf of unregulated entities.<\/p><p>Under the 2015 Act, if the firm who bought loans from the original lender is an unregulated firm, then the loans must be serviced by a &lsquo;credit servicing firm&rsquo;.  Loans can be sold by regulated entities to entities that are not regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland (the Central Bank).<\/p><p>Credit servicing firms must act in accordance with the requirements of Irish financial services law that applies to &lsquo;regulated financial service providers&rsquo;.  This ensures that consumers, whose loans are sold to another firm, maintain the same regulatory protections that they had prior to the sale, including under the various Statutory Codes of Conduct issued by the Central Bank.<\/p><p>The Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) is a key part of the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection framework.  It is a statutory Code first introduced by the Central Bank in February 2009, with the current CCMA becoming effective from 1 July 2013.  The CCMA provides a strong consumer protection framework, aimed specifically at the process to be followed by relevant firms with each borrower by reference to that borrower&rsquo;s individual circumstances, to ensure borrowers in arrears or pre-arrears in respect of a mortgage loan secured on a primary residence are treated in a timely, transparent and fair manner by reference to that&rsquo;s borrower&rsquo;s individual circumstances.<\/p><p>Regulated entities, including credit servicing firms servicing loans on behalf of unregulated loan owners, are all required to comply with the CCMA.  The overriding objective of the CCMA is to ensure the fair and transparent treatment of consumers in mortgage arrears or pre-arrears, and that due regard is had to the fact that each case of mortgage arrears is unique and needs to be considered on its own merits.  The CCMA recognises that it is in the interests of borrowers and regulated firms to address financial difficulties as speedily, effectively and sympathetically as circumstances allow.  It sets out the mortgage arrears resolution process (MARP), a four-step process that regulated entities must follow:<\/p><p>Step 1: Communicate with borrower;<\/p><p>Step 2: Gather financial information;<\/p><p>Step 3: Assess the borrower&rsquo;s circumstances; and<\/p><p>Step 4: Propose a resolution<\/p><p>Each regulated entity must consider the borrower&rsquo;s situation in the context of the solutions they provide, which may differ from firm to firm.  The CCMA includes requirements that arrangements be sustainable and based on a full assessment of the individual circumstances of the borrower and that repossession be used only as a last resort.  The CCMA does not prescribe the solution which must be offered.  A regulated entity may only commence legal proceedings for repossession where the firm has made every reasonable effort under the CCMA to agree an alternative repayment arrangement with the borrower or his\/her nominated representative, and the specific timeframes set out in the CCMA have been adhered to or the borrower has been classified as not co-operating.<\/p><p>Details on the protections and options available to a borrower under Irish personal insolvency legislation can be found at isi.gov.ie, should this be of relevance.  This aspect of the framework of protections for individuals (including mortgage borrowers) is overseen by the Insolvency Service of Ireland, not the Central Bank.<\/p><p>In relation to addressing the situation arising from potential large scale repossessions of family homes directly or indirectly through repossession of buy to let properties, the position is that I am\u00a0unable to interfere in the commercial decisions of any financial institution.  However, the Government attaches great importance to the resolution of mortgage arrears and wants to keep families in their homes and avoid repossessions insofar as possible.<\/p><p>Across state agencies, there are numerous bodies and processes in place to assist those in mortgage arrears in the hope of avoiding repossession.  Most recently, the Abhaile service has been established and\u00a0offers help to\u00a0borrowers in arrears to find the best solutions and keep them, if possible, in their own homes.  This is assisting borrowers, particularly those in longer term arrears.  A dedicated adviser will work with borrowers in arrears and their lender to find the best solution for them.  Borrowers can get free advice from an expert financial adviser who can help them to work through their financial situation.  An Expert adviser could be from MABS or a Personal Insolvency Practitioner (PIP) or an accountant.  Borrowers may also need legal advice and under Abhaile they can have a free meeting with a solicitor.  If called to court to face repossession proceedings on their home, they will be able to meet a Duty Solicitor at the court.  A MABS staff member will also be present at court to help them.<\/p><p>A Helpline\u00a0is available Monday to Friday and\u00a0a face-to-face service which is completely free, confidential and independent is also available in more than 60 MABS locations nationwide.<\/p><p>Finally, I\u00a0refer you to the latest Central Bank publication for Residential Mortgage Arrears and Repossessions Statistics: Q2 2017 which can be found at the following link: <\/p><p><i>.<\/i><\/p><p>This shows that further progress is being made in addressing the mortgage arrears issue.

More directly, credit and market conditions, mortgage default rates and the funding of mortgage credit will also be relevant factors.<\/p>  <p>  However, there have been some developments which seek to promote a more harmonised market for\u00a0credit across the EU.  In particular, the 2014 Mortgage Credit Directive, which has now been transposed into Irish law by the European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016, seeks to develop a more harmonised, efficient and competitive internal market for the provision of residential mortgages to consumer borrowers and this should help to promote the closer integration of EU mortgage markets over time.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the national context, the issue of the level of variable mortgage rates is an important one for this Government and it is committed to reducing the cost of secured mortgage lending and\u00a0promoting competition in the supply of mortgage finance.  To that end, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) has recently produced a report which sets out options for consideration to help improve the level of competition and general efficiency of the market.  Additionally, the Central Bank has recently carried out research which showed the scope for borrowers to save money by switching mortgages.<\/p>  <p>  Following on from this, and building on the 2016 addendum to the Consumer Protection Code in relation to standard variable rate mortgage holders, last August the Central Bank\u00a0 published a consultation paper\u00a0proposing new measures which would enhance the framework of protections for variable rate mortgage holders and in particular to require lenders to, inter alia, better inform consumers about other available mortgage options that could save them money, to help them compare their existing mortgage to other mortgage options and to provide consumers with standardised switching information.  A copy of the Consultation Paper is available on the Central Bank&rsquo;s website and the consultation process will be open for comment until 1 November 2017.<\/p>  <p>  In overall terms, the Government is of the opinion that the development of a\u00a0healthy banking system, which is one which delivers\u00a0increased competition, which is in a position to provide finance to credit worthy customers and which is also resilient to economic and financial market shocks, is the best way to ensure that retail lending rates are driven down in a sustainable way for the market as a whole but without giving rise to potentially undesirable consequences for the provision of new mortgage lending.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102400066#WRH01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":279,"content":"<p>Question No. 111 answered with Question No. 108.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","counter":281,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102400066#WRH02000"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Planning Framework","counter":280,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102400066#WRH01900"},{"type":"question","counter":281,"qnumday":112,"qnumall":"[44730\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102400066#WRH02000","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the consultations he plans for the national planning framework and the national investment plan.","asker":"1291","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":282,"content":"<p>In relation to the National Planning Framework (NPF), the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government undertook a broad public consultation earlier this year through a national campaign asking for views and opinions about making a plan for Ireland.

The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximise positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment.<\/p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention.<\/p>  <p>  If the parents of the child, the subject of this question, have specific concerns about his educational progress I would advise in the first instance that they speak to the Principal of the school with a view to raising these concerns with the assigned NEPS psychologist in regard to any direct intervention in the case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102400069#WRL00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"C&oacute;ir&iacute;ocht Scoile","counter":361,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102400069#WRL00500"},{"type":"question","counter":362,"qnumday":146,"qnumall":"[44776\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102400069#WRL00600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"c&eacute;n uair a dh&eacute;anfar cinneadh maidir le hiarratas ar sheomra acmhainn&iacute; (sonra&iacute; tugtha).","asker":"1312","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":363,"content":"<p>Is mian liom a chur in i&uacute;l don Teachta nach bhfuil aon iarratas faighte ag mo Roinn do ch&oacute;ir&iacute;ocht breise don scoil thuasluaite.

Furthermore, on 13 October the Security Council heard from Kofi Annan, Chair of the independent Advisory Commission on Rakhine State.<\/p>  <p>  Ultimately, longstanding drivers of tensions between the Buddhist majority and the Muslim Rohingya communities of Rakhine State must be addressed and resolved.  The report of the Annan-led Advisory Commission provides a roadmap to surmount the political, socio-economic and humanitarian challenges that currently face Rakhine State.  The Government of Myanmar has committed to implementing its recommendations, which include proposals to alleviate poverty for all communities in Rakhine State and the resolution of issues that predominantly affect the Rohingya, such as citizenship.  Ireland and the international community is calling for the recommendations to be comprehensively and swiftly implemented.<\/p>  <p>  In tandem with political engagement, the response to the crisis has also sought to alleviate suffering and meet the immediate humanitarian needs of people displaced by violence in Rakhine State, especially those now in Bangladesh. <\/p>  <p>  According to the UN, international humanitarian efforts have to date delivered emergency food assistance to nearly 490,000 people; water and sanitation support to 300,000 refugees and host communities; immunisation to 150,000 children; shelter kits to 150,000 people; and counselling and trauma support to over 50,000 people. <\/p>  <p>  Looking ahead, the UN&rsquo;s revised response plan for Bangladesh anticipates a humanitarian funding need of US$434 million over the next five months.

The latest actions taken by North Korea, particularly the nuclear test on 3 September, are a major challenge to international efforts to advance global nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.  This has been a longstanding goal of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy.  Our leadership on this critical global issue was given most recent expression when Ireland co-chaired the 31st Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) Plenary Meeting in Dublin last week.  The deeply worrying developments in North Korea&rsquo;s nuclear and missile programmes present a real threat to peace and security on the Korean Peninsula, the entire North East Asia region, and indeed beyond.  Such actions represent a flagrant and provocative violation of North Korea&rsquo;s international obligations not to conduct such tests.  I have unreservedly condemned such actions.  The government&rsquo;s concerns are shared by EU partners.  The Foreign Affairs Council adopted Council Conclusions on North Korea on 17 July this year.  The Council stressed that lasting peace and the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula must be achieved through peaceful means.  It highlighted the importance of the unity of the international community in addressing this challenge. <\/p>  <p>  At its most recent meeting on 16 October, the Foreign Affairs Council adopted new EU autonomous restrictive measures against North Korea to further increase pressure on the regime to comply with its obligations.  The measures complement and reinforce UN Security Council sanctions.  The Foreign Affairs Council also agreed to actively lobby for a robust implementation of all relevant UN Security Council resolutions on the part of all UN member states.<\/p>  <p>  The United Nations General Assembly in New York in September presented an opportunity for the international community to further demonstrate its resolve in this regard, and I conveyed Ireland&rsquo;s grave concern about ongoing developments.  I unreservedly condemned North Korea&rsquo;s programme of missile and nuclear weapon testing in my address to the United Nations General Assembly.<\/p>  <p>  Most recently this resolve to implement the sanctions regime was re-affirmed by the European Council on 19 October, and a commitment was made to consider further responses in close consultation with partners. <\/p>  <p>  Throughout, we have been very clear in stating that North Korea must cease the series of provocative acts that have contributed to growing instability in the region and further afield.  It must re-engage with discussions on the de-nuclearisation of the Korean peninsula, immediately and without pre-conditions.  It must abandon its programmes to develop ballistic missiles, nuclear capabilities and weapons of mass destruction.  It must carry out these processes in a manner that is complete, verifiable and irreversible.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland fully supports the international sanctions regime against North Korea, and emphasises that continued disregard of its international obligations will only lead to increased diplomatic isolation.  We believe greater emphasis should be placed on effective implementation of the sanctions regime, but further sanctions cannot be ruled out.<\/p>  <p>  The deteriorating situation on the Korean Peninsula can only be resolved by peaceful means, and we have repeatedly underscored the urgent need for dialogue between all stakeholders.  We will continue to be a strong voice for a peaceful outcome, and we will work closely with our international partners to this end.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102400070#WRM02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":422,"content":"<p>Question No. 166 answered with Question No. 162.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":423,"content":"<p>Question No. 167 answered with Question No. 163.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Middle East Issues","counter":424,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102400070#WRM03000"},{"type":"question","counter":425,"qnumday":168,"qnumall":"[44890\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102400070#WRM03100","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the recent efforts at Government, EU and international level to bring about a two-state solution between Israel and Palestine; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1228","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":426,"content":"<p>Ireland, along with our EU partners, supports the achievement of a two state solution to the Middle East conflict.

Work is ongoing on all the other issues set out in the previous Government&rsquo;s Roadmap for Ratification published in October 2015 and these will be progressed as Committee Stage amendments.\u00a0 The Bill will be progressed to enactment at an early date to facilitate ratification of the UN Convention as soon as possible.  <\/p>  <p>  The precise timing of ratification now depends on how long it will take for this Bill to progress through the enactment process and on issues in relation to commencement both of deprivation of liberty provisions, which will be included in the Bill at Committee Stage, and of the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act 2015.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I would like to take this opportunity to assure the Deputy that ratification of the UNCRPD remains a very high priority for me as Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102400072#WRO02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1359"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Refugee Data","counter":501,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102400072#WRO02700"},{"type":"question","counter":502,"qnumday":194,"qnumall":"[45053\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102400072#WRO02800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of refugees accepted here in 2016 under the Irish refugee protection programme; if this number is deemed adequate by his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1257","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":503,"content":"<p>The Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP) was established by Government Decision on 10 September 2015 as a direct response to the humanitarian crisis that developed in Southern Europe as a consequence of mass migration from areas of conflict in the Middle East and Africa.\u00a0 Under this programme, the Government has pledged to accept a total of 4,000 persons into the State.\u00a0\u00a0Of these, 2,622 are by means of\u00a0the EU relocation mechanism established by two EU Council Decisions in 2015 to assist Italy and Greece.\u00a0\u00a0A further\u00a01,040 are to be sourced under the UNHCR-led refugee resettlement programme currently focussed on resettling refugees from Lebanon, and the balance through a variety of mechanisms.\u00a0 Some elements of this intake, such as the relocation strand, come with a time limit of two years and other elements are not time limited.\u00a0  <\/p>  <p>  Under the\u00a0resettlement strand of the Programme, 357 persons arrived in Ireland during 2016.\u00a0 Taken together with the previous year's intake,\u00a0Ireland had taken in 519 of its\u00a0original commitment of 520 by the end of 2016, a year ahead of schedule.\u00a0 Last year, the Government doubled its commitment under resettlement to 1,040 and the total to have arrived from Lebanon under refugee resettlement now stands at 785.\u00a0 The remaining 255 persons to arrive under resettlement have been selected and assessed and are expected to arrive in early 2018 together with an additional 15 persons, composed of new born babies and additional family members, giving a total of 270.\u00a0  <\/p>  <p>  In terms of the relocation aspect of the IRPP, allocations under the relevant EU Council Decisions are composed of three elements:   <\/p>  <p>  - an intake from Greece of 1,089 asylum seekers  <\/p>  <p>  - an intake from Italy of 623 asylum seekers and <\/p>  <p>  - an allocation of 910 asylum seekers which has not yet been assigned to either Italy or Greece. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland will meet in full its commitment to Greece.\u00a0 621 of the allocation of 1,089 are already in the State.\u00a0 Of these, 381 arrived during 2016.\u00a0 A further 390 have been assessed and are awaiting travel to Ireland.\u00a0\u00a0All will arrive in 2017 or early 2018. <\/p>  <p>  However, Italy, unlike Greece, did\u00a0 not permit security assessments to be undertaken by other States on its territory. Accordingly, Ireland has been unable to undertake security assessments in Italy\u00a0of the asylum seeker cohort eligible for relocation to Ireland.\u00a0 It has therefore not been possible for Ireland to take asylum seekers from Italy despite the most intensive efforts by Ireland to resolve the impasse, both bilaterally with Italian counterparts at official, diplomatic and Ministerial level, and at EU level.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the unallocated portion contained in the two EU Council Decisions referred to above, which in the case of Ireland amounts to \u00a0910 persons,\u00a0 Ireland could not access this component until a decision was taken at EU level to allocate these numbers as between Greece and Italy.\u00a0\u00a0Given that it is now clear the numbers of persons covered by the two \u00a0Relocation Decisions do not actually exist on the ground in Greece or Italy, it is not foreseen that this number will ever be available\u00a0to Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland has worked actively to give effect to the EU relocation Decisions. But the relocation instruments are unlikely to deliver the numbers allocated to Ireland \u00a0for the reasons set out above.\u00a0 In all the circumstances I am satisfied that Ireland has made every possible effort to meet its commitments, that\u00a0the commitment by Ireland to accept 4,000 persons remains and that Ireland will fill any gaps arising from the relocation instruments using other mechanisms such as pledges for resettlement of\u00a0programme refugees. \u00a0This process is already underway and on 15 September 2017\u00a0a new pledge was made\u00a0to the European Commission to take a further 345 programme refugees in 2018.

This commitment is outlined in the Programme for Partnership Government, which is guided by two principles: equality of opportunity and improving the quality of life for people with disabilities. <\/p><p>The Programme for Partnership Government states that the Government wishes to provide more accessible respite care to facilitate full support for people with a disability. <\/p><p>The Health Service Executive, HSE,  report &ldquo;<i>Time to Move on from Congregated Settings &ndash; A Strategy for Community Inclusion&rdquo;,<\/i>(2011) proposes a new model of support in the community by moving people from institutional settings to the community.

The HSE's 2017 National Service Plan has set a target of 223 to move from institutions in 2017.  This will  ensure that people are able to move out of congregated settings, and into their own homes in the community.

However, in an effort to improve the accuracy of our information on maternal deaths in Ireland, a Confidential Maternal Death Enquiry (MDE) system was established in 2009, linking Ireland to the United Kingdom's Confidential MDE which is considered the gold standard for maternal death enquiries.  <\/p>  <p>  With regard to MDE Ireland, the information it collects includes maternal age and ethnicity\/nationality, body mass index and smoking status.  The Deputy will be aware that the statistics reported to MDE Ireland require anonymisation due to the small number of such incidents occurring across the country's maternity hospitals\/units.  Thus, naming the hospitals\/units where such events have occurred would not meet the data protection standards required for protection of otherwise identifiable patient information (Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003, Section 5(h)); such statistics are not, therefore, publicly available.  Submitting information to MBRRACE-UK allows Ireland to participate in reporting on maternal deaths while keeping anonymity in place. <\/p>  <p>  According to MDE Ireland, 38.7% of maternal deaths 2009-2012 (including direct and indirect causes) occurred in women born outside Ireland, who represented 24.2% of all maternities in Ireland for that time period.  This finding reflects those from successive UK MBRRACE reports which have found an increased risk of maternal deaths among migrant ethnic minorities.<\/p>  <p>  In conclusion, I would like to reiterate the Government's commitment to the progressive development of maternity services in Ireland.  2016 saw the publication of Ireland&rsquo;s first National Maternity Strategy, the HSE&rsquo;s National Standards for Bereavement Care following Pregnancy Loss and Perinatal Death and HIQA&rsquo;s National Standards for Safer Better Maternity Services.  In addition, each of our maternity hospitals\/units is now publishing monthly Maternity Patient Safety Statements.  In January 2017, the National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme was established to lead the management, organisation and delivery of maternity, gynaecological and neonatal services with the HSE, which includes ensuring that learning is disseminated to all hospitals\/units.  I have recently launched the Programme's Implementation Plan for the Strategy.  All these developments represent key building blocks to facilitate the provision of a consistently safe and high quality maternity service, including for women born outside of the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102400079#WRV01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Care of the Elderly Provision","counter":714,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102400079#WRV01600"},{"type":"question","counter":715,"qnumday":283,"qnumall":"[45080\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102400079#WRV01700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of beds in County Tipperary under headings (details supplied) that were available at all HSE facilities within the county for each of the years 2010 to 2016, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1350","askee":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":716,"qnumday":284,"qnumall":"[45081\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102400079#WRV01800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will address the growing number of persons on waiting lists for admission to the Hospital of the Assumption, Thurles, County Tipperary, for step-down care following care at an acute hospital; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1350","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":717,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 283 and 284 together.<\/p><p>As these are service matters I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102400079#WRV01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","counter":719,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102400079#WRV02200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Reports","counter":718,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102400079#WRV02100"},{"type":"question","counter":719,"qnumday":285,"qnumall":"[44588\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102400079#WRV02200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when a report (details supplied) into the harness racing sector will be published; the reason for the six-month delay in its publication; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1366","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":720,"content":"<p>The Indecon report, which\u00a0reviewed the Irish harness racing sector is currently being examined by officials within my Department and I intend publishing it shortly\u00a0once this review is complete.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102400079#WRV02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sports Funding","counter":721,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102400079#WRV02400"},{"type":"question","counter":722,"qnumday":286,"qnumall":"[44589\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102400079#WRV02500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if an organisation (details supplied) will receive financial support as part of budget 2018 given that Horse Racing Ireland will receive &euro;60 million while the Irish Greyhound Board will receive &euro;16 million; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1366","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":723,"content":"<p>The Irish Harness Racing Association was a beneficiary, for the first time in 2016, of an Equine Infrastructure grant scheme operated by my Department.

The PIP Portal is an IT system that enables communication with all 4500 services funded by DCYA.

This information was also included in the statement released from the National Emergency Coordinating Group on Sunday the 15th   of October.

Cr&egrave;ches and Montessori facilities should also remain closed tomorrow.\"<\/p>  <p>  As childcare facilities are independent, privately managed and governed entities it is not possible to issue a directive.  My Department and the National Emergency Coordinating Group advised as appropriate and I ensured that where services closed they would not see any loss of public funding.<\/p>  <p>  My Department again took steps to ensure that the same option remained open to providers on Tuesday when schools were closed.  This was to facilitate the appropriate safety checks by the cr&egrave;che owners.  It was a matter for the service providers themselves to decide, but again I ensured their funding would still be available.  As these childcare services range from very small to more substantial buildings, these checks would not in all instances be as onerous as a very large building like a school.

However it also finds that indexation of SPC in line with average earnings growth would be likely to result in a substantial and increasing shortfall in the Fund from 2020 onwards &ndash; amounting over time to over &euro;400Bn. <\/p><p>These data indicate that the selection of an indexing approach could result in widely varying levels of payment dependent on the approach taken and also that the selection of an indexation approach  would also have to have regard to the affordability and sustainability of the welfare system taking into account other demands on the public purse.<\/p><p>In addition any system of indexation would need to take account of the need to make structural changes from time to time in order to respond to emerging challenges and  to improve equity within the system.<\/p><p>For these reasons the approach in Ireland has, until now,  been to set welfare rates on an annual basis in the context of wider budgetary and economic policy.  <\/p><p>Nevertheless I do believe that there may be merit in indexing rates as is done in some other countries  and intend to consider the matter further in coming months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102400086#WRCC03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Services Funding","counter":994,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102400086#WRCC03700"},{"type":"question","counter":995,"qnumday":381,"qnumall":"[44963\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102400086#WRCC03800","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if funding will be allocated to programme (details supplied) in County Louth from the budget 2018 disabilities allocation; the amount of funding that will be allocated in this case; and if this scheme forms part of the stated commitment that all school leavers with disabilities should have access to supports and services which meet their needs as they make the transition from school to adult life","asker":"1330","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":996,"content":"<p>Engaging with young people with disabilities at a time when their disability threatens to keep them out of the workforce is critical if we are to create the best possible opportunities for people with disabilities to fulfil their potential.

I, and my predecessors, have already taken action in recent Budgets to improve the position of lone parents, for example by progressively increasing the income disregard for those on Jobseeker's Transition (JST) from a low of &euro;60 a week to &euro;110 euro a week, and by targeting improved, tailored activation measures towards this group, to assist them into training and employment.  <\/p>  <p>  Budget 2018 builds further on recent Budgets and the following measures will specifically benefit lone parents:<\/p>  <p>- Income disregard for parents getting OFP and JST to be increased from &euro;110 a week to &euro;130 a week with effect from 29 March 2018;<\/p>  <p>- The Increase for a Qualified Child (IQC) rate to be increased from &euro;29.80 a week to &euro;31.80 a week with effect from 29 March 2018;<\/p>  <p>  A number of other budgetary measures will also benefit lone parents, including the &euro;5 rate increase, the additional week to the fuel allowance and the Christmas bonus of 85% to be paid in early December.<\/p>  <p>  On foot of the measures for lone parents contained in Budget 2018, a lone parent on OFP or the JST working 15 hours at the national minimum wage will see an increase in their overall income of over &euro;19 per week (or &euro;1,000 per annum) from approximately &euro;347 in 2017 to &euro;366 in 2018.  <\/p>  <p>  A lone parent on OFP working 15 hours at the national minimum wage will see an increase in their overall income of &euro;19 per week (or &euro;1,000 per annum), or approximately 5 to 5.5%, based on a combination of the increase in the National Minimum Wage, the increase to the income disregards on OFP and JST, the rate increase of &euro;5 per week and the IQC increase of &euro;2 a week.  <\/p>  <p>  Lone parents who choose to participate in education can continue to receive support from the Department either through the retention of their primary payment or Family Income Supplement or they can transfer to the Back to Education Allowance.  Furthermore, to support lone parents participate in education, SUSI grants (both maintenance and fee grants) are payable concurrently with One-parent Family Payment and Jobseeker's Transition.  Therefore a lone parent can participate in education and receive the dual support of the One-parent Family Payment or Jobseeker's Transition and the SUSI maintenance grants.  Where the lone parent is on Jobseeker's Allowance they can, should they wish to participate in education, transfer to the Back to Education programme.  <\/p>  <p>  The additional childcare supports coming on-stream will also be of particular benefit to lone parents.<\/p>  <p>  I consider that these measures are a step in the right direction, and I am working to ensure that there is no loss in the momentum to enhance the support for lone parents.  The Review points to the need to intensify both the engagement with lone parents as they move off One-parent Family Payment, and the activation supports available, and I have requested my officials to prioritise this.<\/p>  <p>  The Department&rsquo;s employment services provide a case-managed approach to assist lone parents to avail of various opportunities within an ever-improving labour market.  This case-managed approach will be developed further, specifically to offer more tailored and holistic progression plans for lone parents that better reflect their individual circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  The move to more tailored progressions plans for lone parents will incorporate supports to access the child care, education and training and other appropriate supports that they require to, in turn, access the labour market.  These changes should help to improve the living standards of, and reduce the risk of poverty faced by, lone parents.<\/p>  <p>  I intend to continue to prioritise supports for lone parents, particularly those which incentivise work over welfare.  I intend also to provide for the further review of the scheme.  As there is a time lag before the benefits of labour market reforms appear I anticipate that this review will include data to the end of 2018.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102400087#WRDD02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Invalidity Pension Applications","counter":1025,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102400087#WRDD02900"},{"type":"question","counter":1026,"qnumday":391,"qnumall":"[44658\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102400087#WRDD03000","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"when a date will be assigned by a medical assessor to meet a person (details supplied) who applied for invalidity pension in May 2017; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1244","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1027,"content":"<p>Invalidity Pension applications are medically assessed at desk, and not in person, by one of the Department&rsquo;s team of Medical Assessors, based on medical reports\/medical evidence and in accordance with evidence-based protocols.  <\/p>  <p>  The customer&rsquo;s application for Invalidity Pension was medically assessed by a Medical Assessor in the Department on 19 October 2017.

The decision by the Board of CIB to restructure its delivery partners was done in three phases.  The first phase was when the Board decided in late 2014 that change was needed in the structure of delivery partner companies.  It did not, at that time, decide on the precise new structure.  Rather, it agreed that a Design Group be tasked with presenting options on new organisational models for its consideration.  When the former Secretary General met with the Committee of Public Accounts in May 2015, she advised it that the streamlining of governance arrangements was firmly on the agenda of the Board of CIB; that work was underway on identifying a new governance model; that options were identified in the Pathfinder report; and that more work needed to be done before a decision on the new structure would be made by the Board.  The second phase was when the Board of CIB decided in October 2016, following the work of the Design Group, to proceed to restructure its governance arrangements on a regional model basis.  Finally, the third phase was in February of this year when the Board decided that the regional company model should comprise 16 companies across eight regions, comprising eight CIS companies and eight MABS companies.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department was informed of incremental progression of the CIB process at relevant stages, but did not participate in the Board&rsquo;s deliberative process of selecting its preferred corporate governance model for CIS and MABS networks.  <\/p>  <p>  As a statutory body, the Board has the sole right to make decisions on its day to day operations as it sees fit.

There are currently more than 28,000 households having their housing needs met via HAP and some 20,000 separate landlords and agents in receipt of HAP payments.<\/p>  <p>  Recognising the pressures in the rental market, the Government increased the maximum rent limits available under the HAP scheme across the country with effect from 1 July 2016.  Furthermore, additional flexibility above the existing HAP rent limits was made available to all HAP local authorities from the same date.  Each local authority has statutory discretion to agree to a HAP payment up to 20% above the prescribed maximum rent limit in circumstances where it is necessary, because of local rental market conditions, to secure appropriate accommodation for a household that requires it.  It is a matter for the local authority to determine if the application of the flexibility is warranted on a case by case basis.<\/p>  <p>  The increased rent limits introduced by the Government last year, together with the additional discretion available to local authorities to exceed the maximum rent limit where necessary, are allowing\u00a0HAP households to find suitable accommodation and willing landlords.  On average in 2017,\u00a0348 additional tenancies are being supported by HAP each week.  Particular additional targeted supports are available to homeless households in the Dublin and Cork City regions to assist them in finding accommodation in the private rental market, with the support of HAP.  I recently confirmed that the Place Finder Service available in these local authorities will be rolled out to\u00a0all other\u00a0local authorities.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has provided &euro;152.7 million\u00a0to fund\u00a0the cost of HAP in 2017\u00a0and I am satisfied that\u00a0this is sufficient to meet the\u00a0targeted level of activity this year.  Increasing the HAP rent limits in particular local authority areas could have further inflationary effects on the private rented sector, which could have a detrimental impact on the wider rental market, including for those households who are not receiving HAP support.  From available data,\u00a0at\u00a0the end of Q2\u00a02017, and excluding the additional discretion available to homeless households in the Dublin Region, 12.6% of HAP households nationally were benefiting from the flexibility to exceed the rent limits.<\/p>  <p>  The data available to my Department at this time indicates that the current rent limits and the flexibility to exceed those rent limits provide local authorities with sufficient capacity to assist households in securing rented accommodation that meets their needs.  I am satisfied with how the scheme is currently operating and I consider it to be a key vehicle for meeting housing need and fulfilling the ambitious programme under Rebuilding Ireland.\u00a0 My Department will, of course,\u00a0continue to keep the operation of the HAP scheme under review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102400089#WRFF03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Housing Funding","counter":1107,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102400089#WRFF03400"},{"type":"question","counter":1108,"qnumday":419,"qnumall":"[44759\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102400089#WRFF03500","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the funds available to local authorities via the social housing investment programme, social housing current expenditure programme or other relevant programmes to fund the construction of social housing; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1433","askee":"1295"},{"type":"question","counter":1109,"qnumday":420,"qnumall":"[44760\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102400089#WRFF03600","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the process whereby the funds from the social housing investment programme, social housing current expenditure programme or other relevant programmes are allocated to local authorities to fund the construction of social housing; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1433","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1110,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 419 and 420 together.<\/p><p>In 2017, funding of almost &euro;1.3 billion is being made available to support\u00a0housing programmes, including the delivery of over 21,000 social housing supports.

The European Union Military Committee (EUMC) is the highest military body within the EU and was established by Council Decision 2001\/79\/CFSP of 22 January 2001. It is composed of the Chiefs of Defence (CHODs) of the Member States who, on a day to day basis, are represented in Brussels by the Military Representatives from the Permanent Representations of the member States. Ireland has participated in the EU Military Committee since its establishment.   <\/p>  <p>  Pursuant to Article 3(1) of Council Decision 2001\/79\/CFSP, setting up the Military Committee of the European Union  , the Chairman of the Military Committee of the European Union is appointed by the Council on the recommendation of the EU Military Committee meeting at the level of the Chiefs of Defence. Accordingly, the next Chair of the European Union Military Committee (EUMC) will be selected by secret vote by the Chiefs of Defence of the EU Member States, at a meeting scheduled to take place next month in Brussels. On the basis of that vote, the Chair is then appointed by the European Council for a fixed period of three years. <\/p>  <p>  The Defence (Amendment) Act, 2006, provides in section 3(1)(a) that, a contingent or member of the Permanent Defence Force may, with the prior approval of and on the authority of the Government, be despatched for service outside the State for the purposes of carrying out duties as a military representative or filling appointments or postings outside the State, including secondments to any international organisation. Pursuant to this provision, the Government, at its meeting of 19th   September, 2017, decided to nominate Vice Admiral Mark Mellett, as Chair of the EU Military Committee, consistent with the provisions of the Defence Acts. <\/p>  <p>  Following that approval, and on the authority of Government, Ireland&rsquo;s nomination of Vice Admiral Mellett for election to the position of Chair of the European Union Military Committee was formally communicated when nominations opened. The nomination for appointment as Chair of the EU Military Committee further demonstrates Ireland&rsquo;s ongoing commitment to remaining at the core of the EU&rsquo;s Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP).   <\/p>  <p>  Chairmanship of the EUMC has no implications for Ireland&rsquo;s traditional policy of military neutrality. Ireland already participates fully in the work of the Committee through our Military Representative in Brussels and the biannual meetings of EU Chiefs of Defence. The Deputy may wish to note that both Finland (2001-2004) and Sweden (2009-2012) have already held the position of Chair of the EUMC as neutral countries.   <\/p>  <p>  Ireland is one of the strongest contributors to CSDP operations and remains committed to all aspects of CSDP and to the role CSDP can play in UN mandated peacekeeping operations. It is the case that the UN has continually stressed the important role the EU can and does play in support of International Peace and Security. Should Vice Admiral Mellett be successful, it would help to reinforce the existing strategic relationship between the EU and the UN.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102400090#WRGG03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Remuneration","counter":1146,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102400091#WRHH00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1147,"qnumday":434,"qnumall":"[44933\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102400091#WRHH00300","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the steps his Department is taking to address significant pay issues arising in respect of Defence Forces personnel (details supplied); his views on the fact that many defence personnel have to rely upon family income supplement payments to make ends meet; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1370","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":1148,"content":"<p>The circumstances surrounding an application for Family Income Supplement, or indeed any other scheme operated by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, is a private matter between the applicant and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.
