I am convinced that the Agreement will give an impetus for political and economic reforms, bringing about modernisation, strengthening of the rule of law and economic growth.<\/p><p>Against the backdrop of an extremely serious security situation in eastern Ukraine where government forces have been clashing with pro-Russian separatists, President Poroshenko declared a unilateral seven-day ceasefire on 20 June, subsequently extended to 30 June. The ceasefire was announced alongside a 15-point peace plan which envisages action in a number of areas, including de-escalating the security situation, addressing the humanitarian situation and pursuing political reform. The plan offers an amnesty to separatists who disarm voluntarily as well as corridors to allow Russian and Ukrainian &lsquo;mercenaries&rsquo; to return to Russia. It also envisages changes to the Ukrainian constitution to enable the devolution of more power to the regions, as well as greater protection for Russian-language rights.<\/p><p>On 23 June, following talks facilitated by the OSCE, pro-separatist leaders in eastern Ukraine announced that they would adhere to a ceasefire. Although the OSCE reported that the security situation in eastern Ukraine improved following the announcement of the ceasefire, we remain very concerned about continued activity by armed separatists in the region which, tragically, has led to further casualties. The Ukrainian authorities have reported that the ceasefire had been violated 108 times and led to the deaths of 28 Ukrainian soldiers with 70 injured.<\/p><p>Ireland regrets all loss of life in the conflict and calls for urgent progress towards a peaceful solution to the crisis.  It is also of the utmost importance that   trilateral talks between Russia, Ukraine and the OSCE achieve tangible results soon, to prevent further loss of life. <\/p><p>Ukraine was discussed at the EU Foreign Affairs Council last week, which the T&aacute;naiste attended. Ministers were briefed on the current situation by the new Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, Pavel Klimkin, who presented the peace plan and called for our support. In its conclusions, the Council welcomed the peace plan as a major chance for de-escalation and commended President Poroshenko&rsquo;s determined actions towards peace and stability in Ukraine since his inauguration. Ministers also called on the Russian Federation to support the peace plan and adopt effective measures to stop the continued flow of illegal fighters, arms and equipment over the border into Ukraine. The Council conclusions also reaffirmed the EU&rsquo;s strong condemnation of the illegal annexation of Crimea and Sevastopol.  <i><\/i><\/p><p>Ukraine was also discussed at the European Council last Friday when President Poroshenko met with EU leaders. The HOSG subsequently called for several steps to be taken by Monday of this week, including agreement on a verification mechanism, monitored by the OSCE, for the ceasefire and for effective control of the border. After that, the European Council will assess the situation and reconvene if required to take what decisions may be necessary. For his part, President Poroshenko indicated that he would be prepared to further extend the ceasefire if there was compliance with the conditions set by the European Council. Regrettably, in the absence of such compliance over the weekend, President Poroshenko announced the resumption of military operations against the separatists yesterday. He made clear that he was willing to reinstate the ceasefire if it became clear that all sides were ready to carry out all aspects of the peace plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070200068#WRA00600","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Good Friday Agreement","counter":8,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070200068#WRA00700"},{"type":"question","counter":9,"qnumday":11,"qnumall":"[28249\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070200068#WRA00800","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the action that needs to be undertaken in order to implement all outstanding aspects of the Good Friday Agreement; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"945","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":10,"content":"<p>The principles and values of the Good Friday Agreement and the subsequent St. Andrew&rsquo;s Agreement are essential to peace and reconciliation in Ireland and across these islands.

The Brazilian Government&rsquo;s projections are that the 2014 World Cup will increase the country&rsquo;s GDP by almost 10 billion Euro and that, as well as investments in the match stadiums, the World Cup has led to an acceleration of investment in roads, airports and public transportation.<\/p><p>While staging international sporting events may provide enormous benefits, it is important that host countries respect human rights and ensure that fundamental freedoms are upheld in preparing for and hosting the events.<\/p><p>Staging large sporting events also brings with it worldwide scrutiny.   Audiences will tune in from around the world in their millions and the interest generated will go beyond just the games.   All aspects of the country will be scrutinised including the host nation&rsquo;s human rights record. <\/p><p>In this regard, I am currently very concerned about the reports of abuse of workers&rsquo; rights in Qatar, a country with the highest ratio of migrants to citizens in the world.  Nearly 88 per cent of the total population are foreign workers, employed largely in construction, services and domestic work. The presence of large numbers of migrant workers in the Gulf area, especially in construction, is of course a long-standing phenomenon and does not relate solely to the World Cup.<\/p><p>In November 2013, the UN Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants, Fran&ccedil;ois Cr&eacute;peau, urged the Qatari authorities to ensure that its labour laws are reformed to ensure that they adhere to international standards.  I fully support Mr. Cr&eacute;peau&rsquo;s findings and call on the Qatari Government to continue to cooperate with his office and the UN International Labour Organisation and to implement their recommendations in order to improve the situation of migrant workers and their families in the country.   <\/p><p>I believe it is critical that Qatar proves it is making real efforts to improve the protection of the rights of all workers, including construction workers, ahead of the FIFA World Cup scheduled for 2022.  In this regard, I welcome FIFA&rsquo;s promises to demand high standards in the area of workers&rsquo; rights, as well as FIFA&rsquo;s request that the Qatari authorities provide a report detailing improvements that have been made in terms of labour standards since the visit of its President, Mr. Sepp Blatter, to the Emirate in November 2013.  <\/p><p>I also would like to take this opportunity to reiterate the message delivered by Ireland during Qatar&rsquo;s Universal Periodic Review at the United Nations Human Rights Council on May 7 2014, in which we urged the Qatari authorities to undertake a thorough review of the regulatory regime for migrant workers in order to ensure that it adheres to international human rights and labour standards.<\/p><p>I led a trade mission to Qatar at the beginning of June and took the opportunity to privately raise with Qatari Government Ministers concerns regarding Human Rights particularly in relation to reports of violations of the rights of migrant workers and the denial of the right to the freedom of movement.  While the conversations were confidential, Qatari Ministers confirmed that they were aware of the issues related to the <i>Kafala<\/i>system of sponsorship and noted that they are working on legislation which would, among other things, address the &ldquo;exit visa&rdquo; system.  The <i>Kafala<\/i>system requires all unskilled labourers to have an in-country sponsor, usually their employer, who is responsible for their visa and legal status.  It has been criticised as many employers take away passports and abuse their workers with little risk of legal repercussions.<\/p><p>The human rights situation in the Russian Federation came under the spotlight in the lead-up to the Winter Olympic Games in Sochi in February 2014. The rights of migrant workers, as well as LGBTI rights and freedom of the press, were a particular focus of attention, and this is to be welcomed.<\/p><p>The EU was aware of reports that migrant workers were employed during preparations for the Games and I can confirm that the rights of such workers and ethnic minorities in the Russian Federation were discussed at the EU&rsquo;s structured human rights consultations with Russia which took place on 28 November 2013.<\/p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the decisions to award games to countries are not made by national governments but by Sports governing bodies &ndash; FIFA as the governing association of soccer in the case of the World Cup and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in the case of the Olympic games. <\/p><p>It has recently been reported that in apparent response to recent controversy over the rights of workers in Qatar, senior officials at FIFA, are for choosing future host countries.   I would very much welcome this in the awarding of such events. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070200068#WRA01200","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Good Friday Agreement","counter":14,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070200068#WRA01300"},{"type":"question","counter":15,"qnumday":13,"qnumall":"[28227\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070200068#WRA01400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the discussions, if any, he has had with the Northern Ireland Secretary of State or with members of the Northern Ireland Executive in relation to outstanding aspects of the Good Friday Agreement which need to be implemented; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":16,"content":"<p>Progress in implementing the Good Friday Agreement has benefited all of the people of this island.

This verdict represents an unacceptable restriction on freedom of expression and fundamentally undermines the credibility of the Egyptian judicial system.<\/p><p>  There has been widespread international criticism of the verdict in this latest case, including by UNSG Ban, who warned that they could undermine Egypt&rsquo;s stability. The UN Human Right Commissioner, Navi Pillay, expressed her shock and alarm at the verdicts which she pointed out were rife with procedural irregularities and in breach of international human rights law. <\/p><p>  The issue was also discussed briefly at the Foreign Affairs Council meeting in Luxembourg which I attended on 23 June. High Representative Ashton issued a statement after the meeting on behalf of the EU expressing the concern of the Council about the verdicts as well as about the death sentences imposed against more than 180 people following the recent well-publicised trial in Minya, Upper Egypt.  <\/p><p>  The Government has been active in conveying its concerns generally over the current trends in relation to observance of human rights in Egypt. I have made clear in reply to earlier questions in this House my strong concerns over the recent mass sentencing of individuals to the death penalty in two trials in Minya, Upper Egypt. These concerns have been conveyed directly to the Egyptian authorities, most recently by senior officials in my Department at a meeting with the Egyptian Embassy earlier this week which also relayed my concerns over the recent Al Jazeera verdicts as well as the continued detention of Ibrahim Halawa. Our Embassy in Cairo has also regularly raised these and other human rights issues with the Egyptian authorities .

We have repeatedly stressed to the Egyptian authorities that due process must be afforded to Mr. Halawa, and that they must ensure that his basic human right to a fair trial is upheld.   As I indicate above, further representations have been made since then.

The Al- Qaeda linked islamist militia known as ISIS, with allied Sunni groupings, have captured large parts of northern and western Iraq, including the major city of Mosul. It is also targeting key installations such as the country&rsquo;s largest oil refinery. <\/p><p>  The Government has previously warned of failings and inattention on the part of the current Iraqi Government in actively promoting reconciliation with the minority Sunni community. These concerns have now been shown to be wholly justified. The ISIS advance has been concentrated in Sunni-dominated areas and has only been possible because disaffected local Sunni forces, many of whom had earlier fought Al-Qaeda during the US-led surge in 2006, decided to joined forces with them. <\/p><p>  The T&aacute;naiste discussed the crisis in Iraq with EU colleagues at the Foreign Affairs Council on 23 June. The Council agreed Conclusions condemning the recent attacks by ISIS, and reports of horrific atrocities. The Council emphasised that a security solution alone cannot resolve the current crisis, but must be combined with a sustainable political solution through outreach by the Iraqi Government to local communities and Iraqi society as a whole. Following the elections on 30 April, the Council also called on Iraq&rsquo;s political leaders to negotiate as soon as possible the formation of a government representative of all Iraqi society. Similar messages were also set out in the Joint Declaration of EU and Arab League Foreign Ministers meeting in Athens on 11 June, which I attended.<\/p><p>  The Foreign Affairs Council on 23 June also expressed its serious concern at the humanitarian situation amid a further massive civilian displacement of some 500,000 people arising from the current emergency. The EU has increased its humanitarian assistance to Iraq to a total of &euro;12 million this year. Ireland, for its part, is sending an airlift, worth &euro;220,000, to be distributed by GOAL, which recently also received &euro;200,000 to support their emergency response in northern Iraq.

Nevertheless, as I noted earlier, we will continue our intensive efforts to persuade members of Congress to seize every opportunity to make immigration reform a reality. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070200068#WRA03000","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Egyptian Conflict","counter":32,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070200068#WRA03100"},{"type":"question","counter":33,"qnumday":19,"qnumall":"[28225\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070200068#WRA03200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the contact he has had with the Egyptian authorities to protest at the seven-year jail terms handed down in the case of the three Al-Jazeera journalists recently; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":34,"content":"<p>In my address to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade last week I condemned the severe sentences imposed by a court in Cairo on 23 June on a number of Al Jazeera journalists for essentially doing no more than their job.<\/p><p>I share the widespread international concern over this verdict, which amounts to the criminalisation of the legitimate activities of a free press.

The conflict has been characterised by ongoing and persistent violations, by all parties to the conflict, of international humanitarian and human rights law, including the denial of humanitarian access to those in need. UN Security Council Resolution 2139, adopted in February 2014, expressly demands that all parties &ndash; and, in particular, the Syrian authorities -  promptly allow rapid, safe and unhindered humanitarian access, including across conflict lines and across border, to ensure humanitarian assistance reaches people in need.<\/p><p>  In his fourth report on the implementation of this Resolution, presented to the Security Council on 20 June, the UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon highlighted the lack of progress and ongoing deterioration in the humanitarian situation, particularly around the issue of sustained humanitarian access to those in hard-to-reach areas. The current estimated population in areas that are difficult or impossible for humanitarian organisations to reach has risen to 4.7 million people. This includes at least 241,000 people who live in areas that are besieged by either Government or opposition forces. Only 33 of the 262 locations identified as being hard to reach or besieged were reached with food and nutrition assistance, and non-food items were provided for just 269,000 people in these areas. <\/p><p>  I am aware of the views expressed by the Executive Director of Human Rights Watch. I believe that negotiated access remains the most effective approach. Despite the challenging and dangerous operational environment on the ground, humanitarian agencies including the UN remain committed and prepared to scale up operations and provide life-saving assistance to men, women and children in need throughout the country. <\/p><p>  Emergency Relief Coordinator Valerie Amos has confirmed that nearly 3.3 million people received food assistance from the World Food Programme and partners in May; more than 16 million people were assisted with clean drinking water through the provision of chlorination tablets by UNICEF and partners; around 2.9 million children were vaccinated against polio in the latest round; 2.3 million people received critically needed non-food items from UNHCR and its partners; and 4 million people received medical assistance by WHO and partners in the first five months of 2014.  Regardless of these very considerable achievements, the fact remains that humanitarian access across Syria is exceptionally difficult as a result of increasing disregard by armed groups on both sides of the conflict of their obligations under International Humanitarian Law.<\/p><p>  Ireland has been to the fore in the international efforts to help alleviate the suffering of the Syrian people and is one of the most generous contributors to the humanitarian response on a per capita basis. Ireland has already exceeded our pledge of &euro;12 million in support throughout 2014 by &euro;2 million, bringing our overall funding commitment since the crisis began to &euro;28.011 million. Irish humanitarian assistance is provided not just through UN agencies but also through the Red Cross\/Red Crescent movement as well as trusted NGO partners operating in different parts of the country, including in opposition-held areas. Ireland has consistently matched our material humanitarian contribution with concrete support to international efforts to find a sustainable political solution to the crisis, and to advocate for safe and unimpeded humanitarian access,   as well as for respect by all parties of International Humanitarian Law. We are saving lives through our support to those most affected by the conflict.  Ireland will continue to use every opportunity to advocate for the full and immediate implementation by all parties to the conflict of UN Security Council Resolution 2139 on humanitarian assistance in Syria. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070200069#WRB00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1006"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Iraqi Conflict","counter":42,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070200069#WRB00500"},{"type":"question","counter":43,"qnumday":22,"qnumall":"[28186\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070200069#WRB00600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he is monitoring the deteriorating situation in Iraq; the growth of ISIS in the region; and if his Department have any plans to provide aid to the unfolding humanitarian crisis.","asker":"1037","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":44,"content":"<p>I refer the Deputy to my earlier reply to Question no. 9 concerning Iraq, which was as follows:&ldquo;The dramatically deteriorating situation in Iraq is a matter of very serious concern, both for the Iraqi people and for the international community as a whole. The Al- Qaeda linked islamist militia known as ISIS, with allied Sunni groupings, have captured large parts of northern and western Iraq, including the major city of Mosul. It is also targeting key installations such as the country&rsquo;s largest oil refinery.<\/p><p>  The Government has previously warned of failings and inattention on the part of the current Iraqi Government in actively promoting reconciliation with the minority Sunni community. These concerns have now been shown to be wholly justified. The ISIS advance has been concentrated in Sunni-dominated areas and has only been possible because disaffected local Sunni forces, many of whom had earlier fought Al-Qaeda during the US-led surge in 2006, decided to joined forces with them. <\/p><p>  The T&aacute;naiste discussed the crisis in Iraq with EU colleagues at the Foreign Affairs Council on 23 June. The Council agreed Conclusions condemning the recent attacks by ISIS, and reports of horrific atrocities. The Council emphasised that a security solution alone cannot resolve the current crisis, but must be combined with a sustainable political solution through outreach by the Iraqi Government to local communities and Iraqi society as a whole. Following the elections on 30 April, the Council also called on Iraq&rsquo;s political leaders to negotiate as soon as possible the formation of a government representative of all Iraqi society. Similar messages were also set out in the Joint Declaration of EU and Arab League Foreign Ministers meeting in Athens on 11 June, which I attended.<\/p><p>  The Foreign Affairs Council on 23 June also expressed its serious concern at the humanitarian situation amid a further massive civilian displacement of some 500,000 people arising from the current emergency.

The Al- Qaeda linked islamist militia known as ISIS, with allied Sunni groupings, have captured large parts of northern and western Iraq, including the major city of Mosul. It is also targeting key installations such as the country&rsquo;s largest oil refinery.<\/p><p>  The Government has previously warned of failings and inattention on the part of the current Iraqi Government in actively promoting reconciliation with the minority Sunni community. These concerns have now been shown to be wholly justified. The ISIS advance has been concentrated in Sunni-dominated areas and has only been possible because disaffected local Sunni forces, many of whom had earlier fought Al-Qaeda during the US-led surge in 2006, decided to joined forces with them. <\/p><p>  The T&aacute;naiste discussed the crisis in Iraq with EU colleagues at the Foreign Affairs Council on 23 June. The Council agreed Conclusions condemning the recent attacks by ISIS, and reports of horrific atrocities. The Council emphasised that a security solution alone cannot resolve the current crisis, but must be combined with a sustainable political solution through outreach by the Iraqi Government to local communities and Iraqi society as a whole. Following the elections on 30 April, the Council also called on Iraq&rsquo;s political leaders to negotiate as soon as possible the formation of a government representative of all Iraqi society. Similar messages were also set out in the Joint Declaration of EU and Arab League Foreign Ministers meeting in Athens on 11 June, which I attended.<\/p><p>  The Foreign Affairs Council on 23 June also expressed its serious concern at the humanitarian situation amid a further massive civilian displacement of some 500,000 people arising from the current emergency. The EU has increased its humanitarian assistance to Iraq to a total of &euro;12 million this year. Ireland, for its part, is sending an airlift, worth &euro;220,000, to be distributed by GOAL, which recently also received &euro;200,000 to support their emergency response in northern Iraq. A further allocation of &euro;75,000 to another Irish Aid NGO partner, Christian Aid Ireland, brings the Government&rsquo;s total humanitarian assistance to Iraq in 2014 to &euro;655,000. &ldquo;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070200069#WRB02800","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Undocumented Irish in the USA","counter":66,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070200069#WRB02900"},{"type":"question","counter":67,"qnumday":30,"qnumall":"[28191\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070200069#WRB03000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will report on his recent trip to the United States on which he raised issues including migration, US immigration reform and the estimated 50,000 undocumented Irish residing in the US; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1110","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":68,"content":"<p>I visited Washington D.C. over the period 17-19 June for various meetings in relation to U.S. immigration reform, which remains a key Government priority.<\/p><p>   My programme included separate discussions with Congressman Luis Gutierrez, Congressman Paul Ryan, Senator Pat Leahy, members of the Congressional Friends of Ireland Group, House Judiciary Committee Member Congressman Mark Amodei, Congressman Mario Diaz-Balart, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, House Democratic Caucus Chairman Congressman Xavier Becerra and White House Domestic Policy Council Director Ms. Cecilia Munoz. I also met with Irish-American community leaders, including from the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform, the Chicago Celts for Immigration Reform, Irish Apostolate USA and the Ancient Order of Hibernians, with whom the Government has worked closely on our shared U.S. immigration reform agenda.<\/p><p>  Each of my meetings proved very useful, offering different insights and analyses into the prospects for when progress towards legislation that would provide relief for currently undocumented Irish migrants and also a facility for additional future legal migration between Ireland and the U.S. There was widespread consensus that an already complex political landscape had become even more complicated by the electoral defeat earlier in the month of the Republican House Majority Leader. The general sense which I received from interlocutors was that further time would be needed to assess the full implications of this development for ongoing immigration reform efforts, particularly from the perspective of the upcoming Congressional mid-term elections. I found it encouraging that proponents of immigration reform in Congress appear determined to persist with their efforts and they hope that further progress may yet prove possible this year.<\/p><p>  As my visit took place, Mr. Kevin McCarthy was elected as the new Republican House Majority Leader. Through our Embassy in Washington and also directly, the Government looks forward to working further with Mr. McCarthy, House Speaker John Boehner and other key Congressional figures on both sides of the political aisle, and with the U.S. Administration, with a view  to advancing Ireland&rsquo;s immigration reform-related objectives.<\/p><p>  Since my return from Washington, I understand that there has been a further sharpening of the political engagement in the U.S. Congress in relation to the situation of unaccompanied migrant children who are seeking to enter the United States via its southern border. This may now impact negatively on the prospects for wider immigration reform progress being achieved over the immediate period ahead.  It would clearly be disappointing if this proves to be the case. Nevertheless, as I noted earlier, we will continue our intensive efforts to persuade members of Congress to seize every opportunity to make immigration reform a reality. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070200069#WRB03100","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Global Economic Forum","counter":69,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070200069#WRB03200"},{"type":"question","counter":70,"qnumday":31,"qnumall":"[23794\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070200069#WRB03300","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his views that the Global Irish Economic Forum is realising its full potential in terms of supporting employment growth in the economy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1071","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":71,"content":"<p>There have been three Global Irish Economic Forums to date; 2009, 2011 and 2013.<\/p><p>  The first Forum took place in 2009 as a response to the deepening economic crisis at the time.

This first Forum recommended the establishment of the Global Irish Network, which was set up in 2010.<\/p><p>   Subsequent Forums took place in 2011 and 2013 and built on the work of the first.   The focus of these was on generating ideas for economic renewal, restoring our reputation overseas and creating jobs across a range of sectors.  The themes for the 2013 Forum were based on the Action Plan for Jobs agenda and the outcomes, where possible, have been included in the 2014 Action Plan.  Recommendations such as the Year of Irish Design in 2015, the placement of Origin Green ambassadors, the development of an agency to market Irish agri-business expertise globally, increased on-line trading for SME&rsquo;s and initiatives around Smart Ageing, among others, will all be taken forward in this context.<\/p><p>  Other ideas arising from the Forum have been taken forward independently by members of the Global Irish Network.  An idea for a new third level institution for the arts came out of the first Forum in 2009, and earlier this year, Uversity, a recognised college of the National College of Ireland, launched an MA programme in Creative Process with a choice of modules from 24 partner institutions.  The various Forums have also provided launch pads for other initiatives such as the Gathering, Connect Ireland and Limerick City of Culture.   <\/p><p>  To date, over 100 Global Irish Network members have signed up to provide mentoring and advice to Irish SME&rsquo;s through the Global Irish Contacts Programme run by Enterprise Ireland.

Promoting and enhancing respect for human rights, together with core related principles such as freedom, equality, and the rule of law, form a very important part of the EU&rsquo;s dialogue and engagement with countries in the region. The right to religious freedom is an area of particular concern. Freedom of religion or belief is a fundamental human right and a prerequisite of any democratic state and I am greatly disturbed by the continuing, and indeed increasing, prevalence of persecution and attacks on people based on their religious beliefs, including in the Middle East region.<\/p><p>  Both Ireland and the EU attach great importance to combating such forms of discrimination or persecution based on religion or belief. In June 2013, under the Irish Presidency, the EU adopted Guidelines on the promotion and protection of freedom of religion or belief, which reaffirmed the EU&rsquo;s determination to promote, in its external human rights policy, freedom of religion or belief as a right to be exercised by everyone, everywhere. These Guidelines were a priority for the Irish Presidency and we engaged extensively in the drafting process. The EU has also taken a number of steps in recent years in support of freedom of religion or belief, including issuing Foreign Affairs Council Conclusions on the matter, for example in February 2011.<\/p><p>  Ireland raises regularly the issue of the safety of religious minorities through its official bilateral contacts with many countries in the region, stressing in particular the responsibility of any state or government to protect all its citizens and minorities. Of course, in situations of general instability and insecurity, such as in Iraq or Syria, this is especially difficult.  Ireland also works with our partners in the EU to raise the issue in multilateral fora such as the UN Human Rights Council, as part of the EU&rsquo;s human rights policy.  <\/p><p>  The issue of freedom of religion or belief is one of our priorities as a member of the UN Human Rights Council, and we have played a central role in the negotiation of two important resolutions on this issue in the past year. <\/p><p>  Officials from my Department also meet frequently with members of religious minorities from the Middle East region, to hear first hand their concerns and to discuss issues affecting their communities.

He stressed there, as I have stressed in my own meetings with EU colleagues, that our immediate focus must be on addressing the concerns raised by Europe&rsquo;s citizens and that this will best be achieved by prioritising measures to speed up economic recovery and spur job creation across the EU, including through the completion of Banking Union, deepening of the single market, and the negotiation of free trade agreements with external partners.<\/p><p>  I am pleased that these priorities were at the centre of the strategic agenda agreed at last week&rsquo;s European Council meeting.

Ireland&rsquo;s Policy for International Development, <i>One World, One Future<\/i>, which was launched just over a year ago, reaffirms our commitment to maximizing the impact and accountability of the aid programme.<\/p><p>To ensure that our assistance is effectively delivered to those most in need in developing countries, Irish Aid works in partnership with national and local Governments, local communities, NGOs, and key multilateral partners such as the United Nations, the European Union, and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.<\/p><p>Accountability and transparency is at the core of all we do.  All programmes considered for funding assistance are rigorously appraised by Irish Aid staff using clear criteria, including efficiency in the use of resources, cost effectiveness and sustainability of intended impact.  Programmes in receipt of funding are subject to regular internal and external monitoring to ensure that the intended objectives and goals are being achieved.  They are regularly monitored by Embassy-based internal auditors, independent experts, and the Evaluation and Audit Unit of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.   The Unit&rsquo;s work is regularly reviewed by the independent Audit Committee of my Department.  In addition, the Comptroller and Auditor General provides independent assurance that Overseas Development Assistance is provided in accordance with the law, is managed to good effect, and is properly accounted for.  Moreover, peer reviews by the OECD have clearly stated that Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme is of the highest quality, characterised by its focus on poverty reduction and building the capacities of poor communities and national institutions in some of the poorest countries in the world.<\/p><p>Strengthening institutions is a key element in maximising the impact of the aid programme.  Accordingly, in Key Partner Countries benefiting from our support, we provide assistance to national Government oversight institutions, such as the Auditor General&rsquo;s Offices and the Public Accounts Committees of National Parliaments, to ensure governments are held to account for the effective expenditure of public funds.<\/p><p>The Irish Aid programme, managed by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, proactively manages risks and has a strong focus on value for money, transparency, accountability and sustainable results.  In the event of any fraud such as happened in Uganda in 2012, it is policy to demand a full refund of monies misappropriated.

It is important to stress that once eligibility is correctly determined, that eligibility remains for the duration of the child's education in that school. In practice this means that there is not an annual application process but that the initial decision to grant eligibility remains in place.<\/p><p>  In the case in question, the child was eligible for school transport to the nearest school resourced to meet the educational needs of the child. The parents, as was their prerogative, opted to send the child to a more distant school.

This round covered extensive technical discussion on a broad range of issues including regulatory issues, sanitary and phytosanitary measures, government procurement, intellectual property rights, electronic commerce and telecommunications, environment, labour, small and medium-sized enterprises, and energy and raw materials. Some discussion has already started on the text of an agreement in relation to helping SMEs, technical barriers to trade and on competition.  <\/p><p>The sixth round is due to take place during the week beginning 14 July, 2014.  The EU Commission has indicated that the topics expected to be discussed during the next round include trade in goods and services, regulatory issues, government procurement, environmental protection and labour rights, energy and raw materials, and opportunities for small- and medium-sized enterprises.  The latter topic is important for Ireland because it will enable our SMEs to win more export business in the U.S., where Enterprise Ireland has invested considerable resources to support its clients in that market. The EU Commission has indicated that, as in previous rounds, EU and US negotiators will spend a day with representatives of industry, non-governmental organisations, consumer groups, trade unions, professional bodies, and other civil society groups.<\/p><p>Negotiations on TTIP can be summarised as covering three broad areas:<\/p><p>The first is market access, for goods, services, and public procurement. The first tariff offers, that is, the immediate or phased elimination of import tariffs on an extensive list of goods, were exchanged earlier this year, and I expect that, over the next few weeks there will be further work and negotiations to extend the range of tariff free trade that can take place once TTIP comes into effect. On services, I understand that the US tabled its first offer last week, and Member States will meet shortly to discuss what has been proposed by the U.S. The Commission expects that the EU&rsquo;s first offer on services will be ready soon. Naturally there is an important level of confidentiality about the detail of both sides&rsquo; negotiating position, but I am hopeful that the greatest level of market access can be achieved for our goods and services exporters and for those looking to extend access to the very large U.S. public procurement market.<\/p><p>The second area covered by the talks is &ldquo;rules&quot; , on trade facilitation (EU and US customs systems), state-owned enterprises (these should operate on commercial lines), on raw materials and energy (EU is looking for access to US oil\/gas exports that are currently restricted), and on labour and the environment issues (no weakening of the high standards\/protection applied by both parties). Coming to agreement on these will also serve to set the standards for other Free Trade Agreements with trading partners, reduce the complexity for small companies to comply with many different standards and market regulations, and to regulate markets in an open and transparent manner.<\/p><p>The third most difficult and complex, but most important aspect of the negotiations, is reducing regulatory burdens,<b><\/b>which will involve a multiplicity of sectoral regulations.  In areas of regulation covering important sectors such as financial services, environment, and health and public safety, there are legitimate but in many cases unfounded concerns about a possible lowering of regulatory standards.  In fact, both the EU and the US are equally committed to retaining existing high standards that protect consumers. The objective of TTIP is to address differences in standards between our two economies, that can give rise to heavy compliance costs, while at all times maintaining the high levels of health, safety, environmental and other protection that is reflected in EU legislation.   <\/p><p>Studies show that addressing regulatory burdens will yield the most net gains from the agreement. The Commission&rsquo;s impact assessment suggests that between two thirds and four fifths of the gains from TTIP would come from cutting red tape and having more coordination between regulators. Consequently, progress in respect of regulation, through harmonisation, mutual recognition or convergence, is the most important means of capturing the largest benefits from TTIP. <\/p><p>It is important to see this as a two part issue:  the process of how regulation is enacted, and the sector specific solutions being negotiated. How regulations are made needs to be more transparent, efficient and objective, with regulators deepening relationships in order to address emerging issues together, for example in setting standards for new technologies. Regulators are also discussing how to reduce the cost of meeting existing standards without affecting the levels of protection afforded by them. <\/p><p>Real progress on issues like car safety standards, ending double inspections at pharmaceutical and medical device plants, should, over time, reduce costs for business, regulators and consumers. It is important to note that while regulatory aspects are one of the main elements of the TTIP negotiations, there is nothing in the negotiations that should prevent or undermine the rights of both sides to regulate, and the level of regulatory protection on both sides, be it environment, food, consumer safety, will not be lessened. <\/p><p>As regards investment protection, the public consultation launched by the European Commission last March on the investment protection provisions of a future Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, is still underway and will run until 6 July.  All stakeholders have the opportunity to respond to this consultation, so that specific interests and concerns on investor protection and settlement of related disputes are well understood by the European Commission, and can be used to better define the EU&rsquo;s approach to investor protection in the TTIP negotiations.  The public consultation can be accessed at .<\/p><p>Further information on the negotiations, including background documents, are available on the European Commission&rsquo;s TTIP website. ]  <\/p><p>My Department recently engaged international expertise to examine the economic and other impacts TTIP and related potential opportunities. The focus of this study will be to identify key areas and sectors of the economy that will be impacted by TTIP. This work will help to inform our input to the European Union&rsquo;s negotiating position and to identify appropriate policy responses to be deployed, to maximise the potential of this historic agreement and provide an assessment of the longer term implications for enterprise policy. <\/p><p>I hosted a Conference in Dublin Castle on 20 June to look at the opportunities for Ireland from TTIP. This conference aimed at bringing together at political and senior executive level, Oireachtas members, representatives of various economic interests (including farmers and trade unions), Government Departments, Agencies and Regulators, in order to tease out the issues that lie ahead for Ireland. <\/p><p>At this stage it is too early to draw definitive conclusions about the impact of TTIP on our economy. However, initial assessments suggest that Ireland will benefit to a greater extent than the EU. Preliminary estimates point to a possible increase of 1.1% in GDP compared with a .5% GDP increase for the EU as a whole. This could give rise to an increase of 8,000 jobs over the implementation period of the Partnership. <\/p><p>As the negotiations advance, I will continue to look for an agreement that is comprehensive and balanced and one that delivers real trade and economic potential for our economy. In this context I recognise the need to minimise the impact of trade liberalisation and market opening on sensitive areas of the economy and will continue to express our position that any agreement would respect our broad trade interests and especially our interests in the agriculture sector. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070200072#WRE02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Agencies Staff Recruitment","counter":243,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070200072#WRE03000"},{"type":"question","counter":244,"qnumday":91,"qnumall":"[28676\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070200072#WRE03100","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"his plans to request or allocate funding for additional full-time forensic accountants for the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.","asker":"1190","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":245,"content":"<p>I am aware that the Office of the Director, in common with the other Divisions and Offices of my Department, participated in a Departmental Workforce Planning exercise in 2012 and again in 2013.

The overall aim is to provide short-term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer.

This will be achieved by providing:-<\/p><p>- a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment; and <\/p><p>- a State-led intervention for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.<\/p><p>Since publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway and in some instances have been accelerated in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services. Commercial operators combined have either invested, or committed to invest, over &euro;2 billion in their Irish networks, delivering high speed broadband to homes and businesses. <\/p><p>As a result of this accelerated investment the addressable area required by the State-led intervention has been reduced by 30% since the National Broadband Plan was launched. While the commercial developments are welcome the acceleration of investment is largely contained to cities and towns. Consequently, the speeds that are available in these areas are demonstrably better than those that are available in more rural areas. <\/p><p>On 25 April last, I signalled the Government's commitment to a major telecommunications network build-out to rural Ireland, with fibre as the foundation of its investment, as part of the State-led intervention under the National Broadband Plan. This commitment is a clear expression of Government&rsquo;s determination to address the connectivity challenge in rural Ireland in a meaningful and sustainable way. <\/p><p>Central to the strategy will be a fibre build-out to locations in every county in the State identified as having no existing or planned enabling fibre network. It is intended that the fibre will be delivered directly to access points for homes and businesses, where service providers can utilise the fibre to provide high speed services to end users. The fibre build out will be part of an end-to-end strategy that will address all parts of Ireland that cannot access commercial high speed broadband services.<\/p><p>A comprehensive mapping exercise is underway in my Department which will identify those areas that will require a State intervention. I have published a county-by-county list of towns and villages which have already been identified for a fibre build-out. This list is available on my Department's website, . Currently, a total of 38 areas in County Cavan including the area of Milltown have been identified as requiring an intervention. This is an indicative list and is subject to the completion of the mapping exercise. Further locations may be identified as this process continues. Similarly, it may be determined that some locations on the list will be addressed by the commercial sector and will therefore not require State intervention. I expect that this mapping exercise will be concluded in the autumn. <\/p><p>I would point out that the EU Commission&rsquo;s guidelines on State aid for high speed broadband infrastructure preclude Member States from intervening in regions in which private investors have demonstrated plans to roll out their own infrastructure within the following three years. In this regard, I understand that at least one network operator has published a programme to roll out 20 fibre-based broadband networks in County Cavan, including the area of Belturbet by July 2016.<\/p><p>In tandem with the completion of the mapping exercise, intensive design and planning work is ongoing in my Department with a view to producing a detailed end to end strategy for the State led intervention. It is my intention to conduct a full public consultation on the outcome of the mapping process and the proposed strategy. EU State aid clearance will also be required for the intervention once finalised. This will be followed by a detailed procurement process with a view to commencing construction of the fibre network and provision of services in identified areas as quickly as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070200073#WRF03400","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Appointments to State Boards","counter":304,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070200073#WRF03500"},{"type":"question","counter":305,"qnumday":114,"qnumall":"[28693\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070200073#WRF03600","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the way positions to the board of Bord na M&oacute;na are advertised and filled; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1083","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":306,"content":"<p>The Board of Bord na M&oacute;na plc was established under the Turf Development Act, 1998.

The Non- Principal Private Residence (NPPR) Charge is set at &euro;200 and liability for it falls, in the main, on owners of rental, holiday and vacant or additional properties that are not an individual&rsquo;s principal private residence. The NPPR Charge, which has since been discontinued, applied in the years 2009 to 2013 to any residential property in which the owner did not reside as their normal place of residence. It is a matter for an owner to determine if he or she has a liability and, if so, to declare that liability and pay the Charge and any late payment fees applicable.<\/p><p>  Under the 2009 Act &ldquo;residential property&rdquo; is defined as a &ldquo;&hellip;building that is situated in the State and that is occupied, or suitable for occupation, as a separate dwelling.&rdquo; There are a number of indicators as to what makes a property suitable for occupation for the purposes of determining liability to the Charge. The indicators include the structure of the property, whether or not it has a roof, whether or not it is so affected by dampness as to render it unsuitable for habitation, and whether or not it has sanitary facilities, including a water closet and water supply. Under the 2009 Act, there is no specific exemption for residential properties affected by pyrite.

However, a family may choose to refuse the offer of a transfer to another centre because either (a) it prefers the current arrangement or (b) it wants to await a better offer.

RIA has a fully staffed child and family service unit, the head of which is seconded from the HSE and whose role is to manage, deliver, coordinate, monitor and plan all matters relating to child and family services for all residents in the direct provision system.  The unit also acts as a conduit between RIA and Child and Family Agency (Tusla), the latter having statutory functions in this area.<\/p><p>RIA's Child Protection and Welfare Policy is based on the the Department of Children and Youth Affairs' &ldquo;Children First- National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children&rdquo;.  This guidance document was developed to assist people in identifying and reporting child abuse and welfare concerns.  The protection and welfare policy emphasises that the needs of children and families must be central to child care and child protection and welfare.  RIA's policy has been reviewed and updated and now contains a practice document to make it more user friendly. That draft document is now with Tusla for final feedback and it is anticipated that it will be published by the end of August, 2014 on RIA&rsquo;s website .<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070200074#WRG02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"question","counter":355,"qnumday":131,"qnumall":"[27902\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070200074#WRG03100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will provide an update on the 2012 report of the Special Rapporteur on Children in direct provision which highlighted the real risk of these children; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1017","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":356,"content":"<p>The Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) of my Department is responsible for the accommodation of protection applicants in accordance with the Government policy of direct provision and dispersal.  Direct provision provides for full board accommodation supports while a final decision is awaited by a person on their protection or any related leave to remain application. As at 8 June 2014 there were 4,353 persons availing of direct provision accommodation and supports in 34 accommodation centres in the State.<\/p><p>  The sixth report of the Special Rapporteur on Children relating to 2012 was published on the website of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in July 2013.  There is no specific reference to children in Direct Provision in that report.  Nonetheless,  I have recounted in detail in replies to previous D&aacute;il Questions how the Government affords the highest priority to the safeguarding and protection of children in that system.  In particular, I have pointed out that RIA operates a Child Protection Policy is based on the HSE's &quot;Children First - National Guidelines for the protection and welfare of children&quot; and that there is a specific unit in RIA called the Child and Family Services Unit, which is fully staffed and whose role is to manage, deliver, coordinate, monitor and plan all matters relating to child and family services for all asylum seekers residing in the direct provision system. <\/p><p>  More generally, I acknowledge that the length of time that residents spend in Direct Provision is an issue to be addressed.  My immediate priority is that the factors which lead to delays in the processing of cases are dealt with.  In this regard, legislative reform aimed at establishing a single application procedure for the investigation of all grounds for protection is a key priority for this Government. Such reform would substantially simplify and streamline the existing arrangements by removing the current multi-layered and sequential processes and provide applicants with a final decision on their application in a more straightforward and timely fashion.  In consultation with my officials, I am reviewing the work done to date in respect of the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill and will then decide on how best to progress the implementation of the Government's priorities, in particular to expedite those relating to the establishment of a single application procedure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070200074#WRG03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Stations Refurbishment","counter":357,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070200074#WRG03300"},{"type":"question","counter":358,"qnumday":132,"qnumall":"[28580\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070200074#WRG03400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the position regarding the proposed relocation of Clonmel Garda station to a new site; if the new site has been purchased; when she expects the relocation to take place; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1090","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":359,"content":"<p>The programme of refurbishment and replacement of Garda stations is based on accommodation priorities which are established by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

As part of that function, particularly under Part IV of the Solicitors (Amendment) Act 1994 dealing with the 'Protection of Clients', the Law Society is obliged to continue to maintain and administer the Solicitors Compensation Fund. Where it is proved to the satisfaction of the Law Society that any client of a solicitor has sustained loss in consequence of fraud or dishonesty on the part of that solicitor or any clerk or servant of that solicitor arising from that solicitor's practice as a solicitor within the jurisdiction of the State, then, subject to the relevant provisions, the Society is required to make a grant to that client out of the Compensation Fund. It is also provided that before a practising certificate can be issued to a solicitor, the solicitor in question must have paid the annual contribution to the Fund and the issuing of a practising certificate can be withheld until the payment has been made.<\/p><p>  As such, the Compensation Fund and its attendant inspection procedures provide an important protection against acts of fraud and dishonesty that may be perpetrated by solicitors in the handling of clients&rsquo; monies. As Deputies will be aware, the Fund has been relied upon in a number of high profile cases in recent times. In the five years of 2008 to 2012, I am advised  the Fund paid out a total of &euro;17.7 million in claims. The total in claims actually made for that same period was nearly &euro;48 million. There was a 9% increase in the 266 claims made against the Compensation Fund in 2012 over the previous year's 244 claims though this remains much less than the peak of 672 claims received in 2008. The net assets of the Solicitors Compensation Fund were valued at &euro;18 million as at 30th   June 2013. In the six months up to that date 165 claims on the Fund were received which, excluding invalid claims refused, amounted to &euro;1.16 million. The annual contribution to the Fund for 2013 is &euro;760 per solicitor. Annual insurance cover for &euro;50 million with an excess of &euro;5 million is also in place.<\/p><p>  Under the Compensation Fund structures provided for under the Solicitors Acts, the Law Society is, therefore, able to respond immediately to serious financial complaints and has the right to carry out investigations, without notification, where justified by the circumstances. The Society can also apply to the High Court for orders to protect clients' funds when serious irregularities arise. Pay-outs by the Compensation Fund have a serious impact, including in terms of ongoing costs, across its entire solicitor membership. To that extent, the Fund has a capacity to strongly incentivise financial compliance by solicitors in the public interest.

Every effort is made by prison staff and management to limit the scope of acts of violence.  However, no regime can completely eliminate the possibility of violent incidents happening in a prison setting where a large number of dangerous and violent offenders are being held. As the Deputy can see from the figures there were 758 incidents of violence recorded in prisons during 2013 and this includes very minor incidents. This amounts to an average of 2.1 incidents per day among a population of approximately 4,000.<\/p><p>The Irish Prison Service has successfully introduced a number of measures across the prison estate such as, hand-held metal detectors, netting over prison yards, boss chairs and security screening machines to detect and prevent weapons from entering the prison to limit the scope of acts of violence.<\/p><p>In addition, new prisoner programmes have been introduced such as the Incentivised Regimes policy which provides for a differentiation of privileges between prisoners according to their level of engagement with services and quality of behaviour. The objective is to provide tangible incentives to prisoners to participate in structured activities and to reinforce good behaviour, leading to a safer and more secure environment. As a result, I am pleased to advise the Deputy that the figures for 2013 represent an 8% decrease on the 2012 total of 822 (715 prisoner on prisoner and 107 prisoner on staff).<\/p><p>I can advise the deputy that the number of prisoner on prisoner assaults and the number of prisoners on staff assaults in each prison for January to June 2014 is not readily available and requires a manual examination of records.

Therefore, the Government has decided to develop a policy framework for providing eligibility for health services to take account of medical conditions, including new legislation as appropriate and a HSE clinical expert group is to examine the range of conditions that should be considered as part of this process. The group has been asked to make an early report to the Minister for Health in the autumn.<\/p><p>The Government was very concerned about the potential impacts on the health of persons with serious illnesses whose discretionary medical cards and GP visit cards were refused renewals since the centralisation of medical card assessment in 2011. Therefore, in the context of the above eligibility policy development, the Government decided that medical cards and GP visit cards are to be issued to persons with a serious medical condition (or disability) who had the renewal of their discretionary card refused by the HSE, having completed an eligibility review during the period from 1 July 2011 to 31 May 2014.<\/p><p>Under the Health Service Executive&rsquo;s (HSE) 2009 National Service Plan, it was agreed that the processing of medical card\/GP visit card applications &amp;amp; reviews would be centralised and would transfer to the Executive&rsquo;s Primary Care Reimbursement Service (PCRS) in Dublin.<\/p><p>The process commenced in January 2009 when the PCRS took over the processing of all medical card applications for persons aged 70 or over.  The second phase commenced in September 2009 with the transfer of the case load from two local health offices (LHOs) in Dublin.  In 2010, as part of the centralisation project, the HSE introduced a new website, , which enables people anywhere in the country to apply for or renew a medical card through a simple and efficient application process. <\/p><p>The final phase extended PCRS responsibility for processing all medical cards to the remainder of the country.  This meant that all new medical card applications and reviews made from 1 July 2011 were processed centrally by the PCRS Office in Finglas, Dublin. <\/p><p>Centralisation delivered a consistent and equitable application of eligibility and service provision and has provided clearer governance and accountability, as well as improved management information. It is in the context of the  finalisation of the centralisation project  - 1 July 2011 - that the Government decided that the HSE would issue cards to persons, with a serious illness, whose discretionary card was refused renewal in the period from 1 July 2011 to 31 May 2014.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070200076#WRJ01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Applications","counter":456,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070200076#WRJ01800"},{"type":"question","counter":457,"qnumday":167,"qnumall":"[28607\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070200076#WRJ01900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will urgently re-assess a medical card application in respect of a person (details suplied) in County Kerry; if he will take into consideration the exceptional medical circumstances of the case and immediately reinstate a full medical card","asker":"1050","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":458,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p><p>  The Health Service Executive operates the General Medical Services scheme, which includes medical cards and GP visit cards, under the Health Act 1970, as amended.

Under the legislation, determination of an individual&rsquo;s eligibility for a medical card is the responsibility of the HSE. The Act provides that persons who are unable, without undue hardship, having regard to their overall financial situation, to arrange GP services for themselves and family qualify for a medical card. The HSE awards medical cards in accordance with the Act.  The HSE gives effect to this legislation through its Medical Card National Assessment Guidelines.<\/p><p>  Once an application for a medical card incorporates certification from a medical consultant or a general practitioner that the applicant has a medical condition, which is categorised as terminal, and the applicant is nearing the end stage of life, the applicant will be granted eligibility to a medical card, without being subjected to a means assessment.  <\/p><p>  Medical cards issued, in such circumstances, will have a default eligibility period of 6 months, from the month of issue.  Mindful that no definitive prognosis can be provided on the life expectancy of a terminally ill person, the HSE takes a sensitive approach on the review of medical card eligibility, beyond the initial 6 months period.  A Medical Card Review notification is not issued and eligibility is extended to take account of the cardholder&rsquo;s on-going circumstances. <\/p><p>  With the exception of terminally ill patients in palliative care, the HSE issues all emergency cards on the basis that the patient is eligible for a medical card on the basis of means or undue hardship, and that the applicant will follow up with a full application within a number of weeks of receiving the emergency card. As a result, emergency medical cards are issued to a named individual, with a limited eligibility period of six months and the HSE reserves the right to review eligibility at any point in time to confirm that a person continues to meet the qualifying criteria required to continue holding eligibility. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070200077#WRK00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Nursing Homes Support Scheme Eligibility","counter":502,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070200077#WRK00500"},{"type":"question","counter":503,"qnumday":182,"qnumall":"[28710\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070200077#WRK00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding the fair deal scheme in respect of a person (details supplied) in Dublin 3.","asker":"1017","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":504,"content":"<p>A fundamental principle enshrined in the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009 is that of patient choice.

It involves 124 locally managed projects and related initiatives operating across 470 primary and 224 post-primary schools to provide targeted supports to approximately 36,000 children and young people.

As an initial step the Agency invited all School Completion Programme Projects to commence planning for the next cycle of the programme within the available funding parameters. The Agency has commenced the detailed process of evaluating and approving the 2014\/2015 school retention plans for individual projects. It is anticipated that the Agency will advise projects of the outcome of the process and of their allocations in time for the start of the new school year. The Agency will continue to work closely with Local Management Committees, schools and local School Completion Programme co-ordinators to assist projects through the process. <\/p><p>  The potential for any changes in the funding allocated to this programme in future years is a matter to be considered in the estimates and budgetary process having regard to the resources available to Government. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070200077#WRK04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"}]
