An information feature was published in the Metro Herald on 9 January. Coinciding with the visit of the College of the European Commission to Dublin, the feature marked the start of the Presidency, the 40th anniversary of Ireland joining the EEC and the European Year of Citizens. It also drew attention to the Presidency website  as a source of ongoing information for the public about the Presidency and about Ireland in Europe. This feature cost &euro;14,000 plus VAT.  Metro Herald was again used for an information feature on 2 July to outline the results of the Presidency as it came to an end. To provide information beyond Dublin and the surrounding counties, a further information feature was published with a national newspaper, the Irish Independent, on 5 July. Each of these features cost &euro;14,000 plus VAT. <\/p><p>  These features were placed through the advertising agency which holds a framework contract for print advertising with the government; the agency was consulted as to the reach achieved by such features, the optimum timing for publication, the availability of specific dates and of course maximising value for money given the limited budget available.  We secured 37 billboard posters for Dublin city centre from Dublin City Council as part of their scheme - there was no rental cost for these and minimal design cost as we reused the Presidency branding already developed.  There was no online or broadcast advertising undertaken and no further publications are planned.<\/p><p>  As is customary for an EU Presidency, a report outlining our legislative results over the six months was produced on 1 July. The cost incurred were &euro;6,236.10 for the design of the 100-page report in four language versions and &euro;3,891.96 for translation. This document, produced within a tight turnaround time, is available for download on the Presidency website at  in all four languages. There was also a limited print run of this report which was managed by the in-house printing capacity in the Department of Finance. <\/p><p>  These modest outlays will be covered from within the Presidency budget in the Department of the Taoiseach. As you may be aware, the overall budget for the 2013 Presidency was set at &euro;60 million, excluding security costs. This amounted to an overall figure in excess of 40% less than the cost of the 2004 Presidency.  With some costs still to be determined, it is now clear at this stage that projected Presidency spending will come under the original Presidency budget of &euro;60m. The revised projected Presidency spend is now &euro;51m, a saving of at least &euro;9m. As the Presidency concludes and as final payments are made, a full financial report will be published later this year setting out the final cost of the Presidency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071100070#WRA00700","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Advertising Campaigns","counter":10,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071100070#WRA00750"},{"type":"question","counter":11,"qnumday":66,"qnumall":"[33981\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071100070#WRA00800","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will list the national and local newspapers that his Department would have placed articles in on a commercial basis in the past six months; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"992","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":12,"content":"<p>My Department has not placed any articles on a commercial basis with any national or local newspapers in the past six months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071100070#WRA00900","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":13,"content":"<p>Question No. 67 answered with Question No. 64.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Emigrant Support Services","counter":14,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071100070#WRA01050"},{"type":"question","counter":15,"qnumday":68,"qnumall":"[34000\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071100070#WRA01100","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if there will be a further round of emigrant support programmes brought on stream later this year.","asker":"1020","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":16,"content":"<p>The 2013 grant round for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade&rsquo;s Emigrant Support Programme closed on 20 February 2013.

In particular, it is important that the events of 7 July which resulted in considerable loss of life at the Republican Guard HQ in Cairo should now be thoroughly and impartially investigated.  The situation in Egypt will be discussed at the Foreign Affairs Council due to take place in Brussels on 22 July which I will attend. Considerable discussion has already taken place at senior official level in recent days regarding the EU response to the crisis and how Europe can best contribute to bringing about a peaceful and democratic solution to the crisis.  High Representative Ashton has also issued a number of statements on the situation, most recently on 8 July. As in my own statement of 4 July, the High Representative has emphasised that the immediate priority is for all sides to refrain from any recourse to violence and show restraint. <\/p><p>  In common with other EU Partners, the Government strongly believes that the only solution to the situation with which we are now confronted in Egypt lies through promoting a fully inclusive process of political dialogue and reconciliation aimed at the swiftest possible restoration of democratic rule and civilian-led Government, following free and fair legislative and presidential elections. The interim President, Mr. Al-Mansour, has now proposed a road map for the restoration of the constitution and of normal democratic government which now needs to be discussed and agreed by all parties in Egypt. It also remains essential for all actors and those now in positions of responsibility in Egypt to commit to and ensure the full protection of basic human rights, fundamental freedoms and rule of law. <\/p><p>  It is imperative for the interim Presidency and those in position of influence to reach out to all political forces, without any exclusion, and ensure all strands of Egyptian society can truly contribute to the building of a genuine democracy and improved economic circumstances. Conciliatory moves to defuse the current crisis, including the release of those detained for political reasons, are also essential.  As I have stated previously, Egypt and its people are experiencing a difficult transition to democracy. Ireland and our EU partners, however, remain fully committed to providing whatever support it can to assist the Egyptian people along this path.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071100070#WRA01600","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Finance","counter":24,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071100070#WRA01700"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"VAT Rates Application","counter":23,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071100070#WRA01650"},{"type":"question","counter":24,"qnumday":71,"qnumall":"[33946\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071100070#WRA01700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will maintain the current rate of 9% VAT for the restaurant sector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"981","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":25,"content":"<p>Any proposals to maintain the 9% rate into 2014 will be considered in the context of Budget 2014.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071100070#WRA01800","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Directives","counter":26,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071100070#WRA01850"},{"type":"question","counter":27,"qnumday":72,"qnumall":"[33996\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071100070#WRA01900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 169 of 28 May 2013, if he will detail the representations received by him and his Department from industry stakeholders and organisation regarding the markets in financial instruments directive regarding the expansion or watering down of the directive; if he will provide a full list of the persons and organisations from whom these representations came; the number of meetings he and\/or his Department officials have had with stakeholders and interested parties regarding MiFID; with whom they were held and the date on which they took place; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Nos. 80 to 88, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>Profits or gains arising to an owner or part owner of a stallion from the sale of services of mares within the State by a stallion or from the sale of rights to such services have been taxable since 1 August 2008.  Previously, these profits were exempt from income and corporation tax.  Figures for the profits earned from the provision of stallion stud services were required to be returned in income tax and corporation tax returns from the year 2009 onwards. The figures thus entered are as set out in the following table for the tax years 2009 to 2011, the most recent available.<\/p><p><bu>Profits earned from the provision of stallion stud services<\/bu><\/p><p><table><tr><th>Tax Year<\/th><th>Income Tax Returns<br \/>&euro;m<\/th><th>Corporation Tax Returns<br \/>&euro;m<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2009<\/td><td>0.5<\/td><td>4.0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2010<\/td><td>0.7<\/td><td>2.3<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2011<\/td><td>0.7<\/td><td>2.2<\/td><\/tr><\/table><<\/p><p>In interpreting these figures it is important to bear in mind that they are profits as opposed to the total of the fees earned by an owner.  The fees represent turnover, as opposed to profits.  Income tax and corporation tax are charged, of course, on profits or gains rather than turnover.  In calculating the profits or gains, stallions are treated as stock in trade which means that income from stud fees and profits or gains on the sale of the stallions are fully taxable in the hands of both corporate and individual owners.<\/p><p>In computing profits, a write-off over 4 years of the &ldquo;initial value&rdquo; of the stallion is allowed as a deduction for tax purposes.  This reflects the fact that some stallions have a short nomination life and also takes into account that the majority of stallions are unsuccessful at stud. The impact of the deduction on taxable profits during the write-off period is directly related to the success, or otherwise, of the stallion. Without this provision the cost of a stallion would, under normal rules, be allowed as a deduction upon its disposal or death.<\/p><p>The &ldquo;initial value&rdquo; of a stallion is its market value on the later of 1 August 2008 (i.e. the date the profits became taxable) or when it is purchased for, or appropriated to, stud activities. For this purpose, &ldquo;market value&rdquo; is the price the stallion would fetch on the open market or, where the purchaser and vendor are not connected and the transaction is at arm&rsquo;s length, the price actually paid.<\/p><p>The Deputy has referred to the &ldquo;amount of tax revenue foregone as a result of the current scheme for the taxation of stallion profits&rdquo;.  However, as I have outlined, the profits or gains from this activity &ndash; as opposed to the turnover- are taxable in the same way as for other activities the profits or gains of which are liable to income tax or corporation tax.<\/p><p>The Deputy has also asked about the contribution to tax revenues arising from the taxation of these profits or gains. However, as I advised Deputy McGrath in my reply of 11 June last (PQ Ref No. 27413\/13), I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that as statistics on income tax and corporation tax receipts do not generally distinguish between the yields from different sources of income, the figures of tax yields from stallion stud profits are not separately identifiable. All taxpayers, both individual and corporate, can have a number of sources of income, and can avail of a variety of different deductions and reliefs, all of which affect the final tax liability. In addition the profit figures shown above may themselves be reduced by capital allowances or losses to which that taxpayer may be entitled. Therefore, it is not possible to infer from these figures the amount of tax that is generated solely from the taxation of these profits or gains.<\/p><p>Income tax and corporation tax are self-assessed taxes.  Full details of deductions claimed in calculating profits are not required when a return is being filed.  Should a taxpayer be selected for audit, then these details have to be provided.  It is not clear what purpose would be served by requiring a detailed analysis of the deductions made in arriving at the profits or gains from stallions.<\/p><p>Finally, I do not propose to ask the Revenue Commissioners to provide a report analysing the tax paid by corporate and individual stallion owners since August 2008. The Commissioners keep the general operation of the tax system under constant review using both statistical information and information gathered from audits and other interventions with taxpayers.  Horse breeding and stud farming are subject to a similiar system of income tax on profits as other sectors and are subject to the same compliance programmes by the Commissioners as any other sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071100070#WRA04400","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Education and Skills","counter":63,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071100071#WRB00200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Staffing","counter":62,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071100071#WRB00150"},{"type":"question","counter":63,"qnumday":89,"qnumall":"[33955\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071100071#WRB00200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he will review the employment conditions of a person (details supplied) in County Cork; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"990","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":64,"content":"<p>When the moratorium was introduced the Government exempted Principal and Deputy Principal posts in all primary and post-primary schools and these continue to be replaced in the normal manner.

The NCSE Policy Advice does not recommend a significant change to the manner of allocating SNAs to schools, but recommends clarification of the role of an SNA. The Deputy may also be aware that my Department has published a Value for Money (VFM) and Policy Analysis Review of the Special Needs Assistant scheme, which is available on my Departments website: www.education.gov.ie.<\/p><p>  The Review has shown that the SNA Scheme has been successful in supporting schools in meeting the needs of students with disabilities who also have significant care needs. However, the review also found that the allocation process is generally not well understood within schools and by parents nor is the purpose of the Scheme fully understood.  The review recommended that the SNA scheme should be restated to ensure an efficient allocation of SNA resources and to clarify the 'care' nature of the SNA role for parents, schools and professionals. My Department has established a working group which is presently implementing the recommendations of the SNA Value for Money report.<\/p><p>  The working week for full-time SNAs is defined in their contract (Department of Education and Skills Circulars 12\/05 and  15\/05). SNAs are required to work normal classroom hours including class break periods and in addition to attend before and after school in order to help with the preparation and tidying up of classrooms, reception and dispersal of children etc. The exact hours of work will normally be specified by the Board of Management in the SNAs contract of employment and may vary from school to school depending on the requirements of the school.  In addition the contract for Special Needs Assistants in the post primary sector specifies that SNAs are required to work the month of June.<\/p><p>  Furthermore, all SNAs were required to be available for a number of days at the start and finish of each school term not exceeding 12 in total.  Under the Croke Park Agreement it was agreed to introduce greater flexibility to the use of these 12 days.  These 12 days will now equate to 72 hours (pro-rata for part-time SNAs) to be used by schools as an additional bank of hours to be utilised and delivered outside of normal school opening hours and\/or the normal school year.  SNAs who are employed in a part-time capacity are obviously paid a pro-rata amount dependent upon their level of hours of employment.  Part-time SNAs are paid on the agreed divisor rate for pay purposes for part-time SNAs which is 32 hours.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071100071#WRB01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Third Level Facilities","counter":89,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071100071#WRB01950"},{"type":"question","counter":90,"qnumday":98,"qnumall":"[34056\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071100071#WRB02000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the statutory limitations on what he describes as the statutory autonomy of publicly-funded universities.","asker":"1049","askee":"1035"},{"type":"question","counter":91,"qnumday":99,"qnumall":"[34057\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071100071#WRB02100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the exclusion of the public from the libraries of publicly-funded universities.","asker":"1049","askee":"1035"},{"type":"question","counter":92,"qnumday":100,"qnumall":"[34058\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071100071#WRB02200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if there are reasonable grounds for contending that the functions of a university were being performed in a manner which prima facie constitutes a breach of the laws, statutes, or ordinances applicable to the university; if he has ever been of that opinion; the university or universities on which he has had that opinion.

The current average time taken to process carer's benefit appeals decided by summary decision is 24 weeks and 28 weeks for those requiring an oral hearing.   <\/p><p>  These processing times are calculated from the registration date of the appeal to the date of its finalisation.  They include all activities during this period including time spent awaiting any clarification from the appellant, time in the Department for comments by the Deciding Officer on the grounds of appeal put forward by the appellant, and any further investigation, examination or assessment by the Department&rsquo;s Inspectors and Medical Assessors that is deemed necessary.  A considerable period of time is added to the process when an oral hearing is required because of the logistics involved in this process. While this process carries an inherent delay in terms of finalising an appeal, it also crystallises the flexibility and accessibility of the appeals system.<\/p><p>  There has been a rapid and sustained increase in the number of appeals received in the Social Welfare Appeals Office since 2009 which has placed extraordinary pressure on the office.  Up to 2009, the average number of appeals received was 15,000 per annum whereas in 2012, the office received 35,484 appeals.  In order to manage this increasing workload, significant resources and efforts have been put into reducing backlogs and improving appeals processing times for appellants, including the assignment of 15 additional Appeals Officers, in addition to 10 former Community Welfare Service Appeals Officers who joined the appeals office in 2011, bringing the total number of serving Appeals Officers to 41; reviewing and improving business processes; and implementing a new operating model within the appeals office. <\/p><p>  In addition, a major programme of process redesign and modernisation is currently underway in the Department in relation to many of its scheme areas, aimed at reducing backlogs and reducing the time taken by the Department to respond to requests from the appeals office for submissions in relation to appeals.<\/p><p>  These measures have led to improvements in processing times and a significant increase in the number of appeals finalised from 17,787 in 2009 to 32,558 in 2012.  The Chief Appeals Officer expects to finalise 6,000 more cases in 2013 than in 2012.  Good progress is also now being made in reducing the number of appeals on hand from 20,414 at 1 January 2013 to 16,542 at 1 July 2013.  <\/p><p>  The average waiting time for appeals peaked in 2011 when the average time for an oral hearing was 52.5 weeks and for a summary decision was 25.1 weeks.  In 2012 these times improved by 10.3 weeks when the average time for an oral hearing dropped to 39.5 weeks while the time for a summary decision increased slightly to 27.8 weeks.  This improvement has continued with the average processing time up to June 2013 reducing to 36.2 weeks for an oral hearing and 27.6 weeks for a summary decision.  By its nature and because it is a quasi-judicial function, the processing of appeals takes time and reflects the fact that, by definition, the appeal process cannot be a quick one.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071100072#WRC01900","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Offices","counter":144,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071100072#WRC01950"},{"type":"question","counter":145,"qnumday":118,"qnumall":"[33985\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071100072#WRC02000","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the position regarding the continuation of Granard social welfare office, County Longford; if figures are available on the number of persons attending the office's Monday information and claim taking service; if the office will continue to operate; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

In 2013, my Department will spend an estimated &euro;284 million on this scheme, providing some 410,000 customers with a package worth almost &euro;700 per year.  Under my Department&rsquo;s supplementary welfare allowance scheme, a special heating supplement may be paid to assist people who have special heating needs.  A person may qualify for a heating supplement, if they can show that they have extra heating needs and increased energy costs because of their age, medical condition or disability, are living alone or only with a dependent adult or dependent children  and satisfy a means test.  Approximately 3,200 people are currently in receipt of this supplement.  <\/p><p>  In addition, exceptional needs payments (ENP) may be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost which an applicant is unable to meet out of his or her own resources. There is no automatic entitlement to this payment.  Each application is decided on the particular circumstances of the case.  The provision for exceptional needs payments in 2013 is &euro;47.6 million, with an additional &euro;11.4 million for supplements.<\/p><p>  Other than that already outlined above, the Department of Social Protection is not in a position to provide any additional supports, including through increases in existing social welfare schemes.<\/p><p>  The telephone allowance is a component of the household benefits package.  The allocation for the telephone allowance scheme has been reduced in 2013 as a cost saving measure. The estimated expenditure outturn on the telephone allowance in 2012 is &euro;113 million compared with projected expenditure for 2013 of &euro;48 million. As a result the monthly allowance was reduced from &euro;22.60 to &euro;9.50.  In response to the reduction to the telephone allowance Eircom have launched a voice product aimed at Department of Social Protection (DSP) customers only. This package, called Talktime Control, gives eligible welfare customers the option of retaining their fixed line for &euro;19.50 per month (before DSP credit). The plan includes line rental and a &euro;5 call allowance for this price.   <\/p><p>  The introduction of a household broadcasting charge in place of the current television licence funding regime is being considered by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.

With the reinstatement of the Funding Standard, approximately 300 schemes were due to send in funding proposals by the 30th June 2013.  212 of these schemes did not submit funding proposals.   <\/p><p>  The Pensions Board has, by now, formally written to the schemes that have not submitted funding proposals to ascertain their particular circumstances.  The Board will decide what steps to take scheme by scheme on a measured basis and taking account of the individual scheme circumstances. <\/p><p>  The reason for the delay in trustees responding will become clearer as the Pensions Board engages with schemes individually.  The Funding Standard had been suspended since 2008 with the date extended on a number of occasions, and trustees need to adjust to the fact that the regulatory structure has been reinstated.  A number of schemes have already confirmed to the Board that submission of their funding standard is imminent.  There also appeared to be an unfounded expectation that the date would be extended again and this contributed to the number that missed the deadline.   <\/p><p>  Following receipt of proposals, it will be possible to get a more accurate indication of the level of under-funding in DB pension schemes.  It will also allow for the impact of the many measures already introduced to assist DB schemes to be assessed, including the potential benefits to schemes of the use of sovereign annuities\/bonds.  Trustees must meet their legal obligations, and ultimately the Pensions Board will use its regulatory powers where benefit underfunding is not properly addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071100073#WRD01400","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Overpayments","counter":194,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071100073#WRD01450"},{"type":"question","counter":195,"qnumday":137,"qnumall":"[34155\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071100073#WRD01500","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 97 of 13 June 2013, wherein it stated that the person had engaged in an apprenticeship whilst claiming jobseeker's allowance as a means of attributing an overpayment to them, if her Department is aware of the fact that they received no payment for any training\/apprenticeship in the case of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":196,"content":"<p>In addition to a number of other qualifying criteria, a person must be available for full-time employment in order to be eligible for a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment.

The National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department has been working with the Northern Ireland Environment Agency to fund and manage the <i>Invasive Species Ireland Project <\/i>  since 2006.

The Act gives primary responsibility to planning authorities to identify and protect the architectural heritage by including them on the Record of Protected Structures.  Inclusion on the Record of Protected Structures places a duty of care on the owners and occupiers of protected structures and also gives planning authorities powers to deal with development proposals affecting them and to seek to safeguard their future.  Recognising this duty of care placed on owners of protected structures, a number of State financial supports provide for the conservation and restoration of heritage structures in both private and public ownership. As the Deputy can appreciate however, the scope for funding for the conservation of the built heritage is currently constrained by the significant reduction in the public finances. <\/p><p>  I recently announced grant funding to thirty-four local authorities under the Department&rsquo;s Structures at Risk Fund 2013 to enable conservation works to forty-five heritage structures in both private and public ownership deemed to be at significant risk of deterioration and which are protected under the Planning and Development Acts 2000, as amended. The Structures at Risk Fund is set up to assist with urgent works to safeguard such structures, in private and civic ownership, and in certain cases works to structures within Architectural Conservation Areas. Typical works funded under the fund include roof repairs, structural consolidation and measures to halt water ingress. This scheme, which is administered by the local authorities, has been in operation since 2011 and has encouraged regeneration and reuse of heritage properties and helped to secure the preservation of protected structures which may otherwise have been lost.

In County Cavan, the NBS covers 45 of its 93 EDs, including the EDs of Canningstown, Cootehill Rural and Corraneary.  Details of the NBS EDs within the County are shown in the table.

During the preparation of Ireland&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, the commercial market operators indicated that they expect to provide 70Mbps to 100Mbps services to 50% of the population by 2015.  Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway in both fixed line and mobile high speed broadband services, particularly in urban and semi-urban areas.<\/p><p>In tandem with these commercial developments, intensive work is underway in my Department to progress a State-led investment to secure the countrywide introduction of next generation broadband access.  In order to progress the State-led investment, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained.

Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations including stakeholder engagement will be ongoing throughout 2013 with a view to the launch of a procurement process in 2014.

It also identifies approved housing bodies (AHBs) as key partners in the delivery of social housing recognising both the constrained funding levels available for local authority construction programmes and the capacity and track-record of the voluntary and cooperative housing sector. I am determined to ensure that the social housing programme optimises the delivery of social housing and the return for the resources invested. To achieve this, it is essential that we tailor the use of available Exchequer supports to prevailing conditions and explore the full range of solutions to address housing needs. <\/p><p>  The financial parameters within which we will be operating for the coming years rule out a return to large capital funded construction programmes. The Government is committed to responding more quickly and on a larger scale to social housing support needs through a variety of mechanisms, including through increased provision of social housing. <\/p><p>  In July 2012 I announced details of a three-year funding programme of &euro;100 million to deliver some 800 new units of voluntary and local authority owned social housing. Through active management of my Department's housing programme for 2013, I am now in a position to approve a limited programme of house purchases for both the local authority and voluntary housing sectors. In the case of CAS funded projects, my Department requested local authorities to give priority consideration to proposals which will provide accommodation for persons with a disability. I intend to announce details of the\u00a0approved projects over the summer period.<\/p><p>  Delivery of social housing will be significantly facilitated through more flexible funding models such as the Rental Accommodation Scheme and leasing but the Government is also committed to developing other funding mechanisms that will increase the supply of permanent new social housing. Such mechanisms will include options to purchase, build to lease and the sourcing of loan finance by approved housing bodies for construction and acquisition.<\/p><p>  Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) have a proven track record in managing and maintaining housing estates and flat complexes and in the provision of services and supports to tenants with specific categories of need. AHBs currently play a key role in the management of properties and the delivery of a wide range of services to households and communities within the regeneration areas. AHBs are also directly involved\u00a0in the planning and construction of new housing projects to provide replacement housing for families where existing poor quality housing is being demolished. It is also intended that AHBs will have a direct involvement in the refurbishment of houses and the provision of replacement housing in certain estates within regeneration areas.<\/p><p>  There is also obvious potential, across a range of housing programmes, for the Government's objective of sourcing and providing suitable residential units for use as social housing to be aligned with the commercial objectives of the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA). In this regard, NAMA is working closely with my Department, the Housing Agency and with local authorities and AHBs in relation to the delivery of social housing and all parties are committed to the maximum possible delivery of residential properties under this important initiative.\u00a0   <\/p><p>  At the end of Quarter 2 2013, 296 properties have been delivered for social housing to date from NAMA's portfolio, with contracts signed in respect of a further 101 properties.\u00a0 This brings the overall total number of residential properties completed or committed to social housing under this initiative to date to just under 400 properties. <\/p><p>  While these properties did not form part of any specific Regeneration programme, they include some properties where the approved housing body has substantial works to complete to make them suitable for occupation. \u00a0NAMA has invested some &euro;6m to date in the works required to complete properties.

The ban was subsequently extended in several phases.<\/p><p>  The EPA published its <i>Review of Ambient Air Quality Monitoring in Ireland<\/i> in December 2010 , which examined the effectiveness of the smoky coal ban . The Review found that t he ban on the sale of smoky coal has reduced levels of particulate matter in those areas where it applies by 15-20%.   However,  levels of particulate matter remain a concern where there is widespread reliance on solid fuel for residential heating, particularly in towns where the ban on smoky coal does not apply, with the result that air quality in some smaller towns is worse than in larger cities. The EPA recommended that the ban be further extended to all urban areas.   <\/p><p>  The smoky coal ban has since been further extended:<\/p><p>- from August 2011 to Athlone, Carlow, Clonmel and Ennis; and<\/p><p>- from May 2013 to Greystones, Letterkenny, Mullingar, Navan, Newbridge, Portlaoise and Wicklow.<\/p><p>  In addition, the boundaries of most existing smoky coal ban areas were revised with effect from September 2012 to take account of more recent urban development. A ban on the burning of smoky coal inside ban areas was also introduced to complement the established ban on its marketing, sale and distribution. The ban now applies in 27 cities and towns, including all urban areas with a population greater than 15,000 people.<\/p><p>  Air quality monitoring undertaken by the EPA has shown improvements in air quality in towns added to the ban in 2011. The results and analysis of EPA monitoring data will be made available in the next EPA annual air quality monitoring report, which is expected to be published in September.

Taking the energy efficiency requirements established in 2005 as the benchmark, the Building Regulations (Part L Amendment) Regulations 2007 set the requirements necessary to achieve a 40% improvement (over the 2005 standards) in the energy and carbon performance of new dwellings. The requirements were subsequently upgraded under the Building Regulations (Part L Amendment) Regulations 2011 which has delivered a 60% aggregate improvement (relative to 2005 standards) in both the energy and carbon performance of new dwellings.<\/p><p>  Part L 2011 marks an important step on the road to carbon neutrality and puts Ireland at the forefront of EU Member States in terms of energy efficiency standards for new dwellings. All the signs indicate that Irish builders and manufacturers continue to innovate and adapt their approaches and products to meet new standards as they continue to evolve progressively over time. This is important in terms of continuing the development of the market for energy efficient buildings and products domestically while also increasing the considerable potential that exists for high energy efficiency products in export markets. <\/p><p>  My Department has recently prepared a nearly zero energy plan for buildings that will enable us to meet our obligations under Directive 2010\/31\/EU within the prescribed timeframe. In relation to buildings other than dwellings, this will involve amending the Part L requirement in two phases between now and 2020 in order to deliver a 60% aggregate improvement (relative to 2005 standards) in both the energy and carbon performance of new buildings in that category. In relation to dwellings one further upgrade of the Part L requirement is envisaged.

These figures fluctuate as households are allocated housing and new households apply for support.<\/p><p>  In accordance with Section 21 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, I directed all housing authorities to prepare a summary of social housing assessments carried out in their areas on 7 May 2013. A report on the results will be published in the autumn and this will provide an important insight into the level and type of need for social housing support across the country. The results of the assessment carried out in 2011 are available on my Department's website  and the Housing Agency's website .   <\/p><p>  The Government's housing policy statement, published in June 2011, clearly identifies that the priority for Government will be to meet the most acute needs of households applying for social housing support. I am determined to ensure that the social housing programme optimises the delivery of social housing and the return for the resources invested. To achieve this, it is essential that we tailor the use of available Exchequer supports to prevailing conditions and explore the full range of solutions to address housing needs.<\/p><p>  The financial parameters within which we will be operating for the coming years rule out a return to large capital funded construction programmes. The Government is committed to responding more quickly and on a larger scale to social housing support needs through a variety of mechanisms, including through increased provision of social housing. In July 2012 I announced details of a three-year funding programme of &euro;100 million to deliver some 800 new units of voluntary and local authority owned social housing. This includes a construction programme for 185 local authority houses and 111 houses for special needs accommodation, for the Approved Housing Bodies. Delivery of social housing will be significantly facilitated through more flexible funding models such as the Rental Accommodation Scheme and leasing but the Government is also committed to developing other funding mechanisms that will increase the supply of permanent new social housing. Such mechanisms will include options to purchase, build to lease and the sourcing of loan finance by approved housing bodies for construction and acquisition. There is also obvious potential, across a range of housing programmes, for the Government's objective of sourcing and providing suitable residential units for use as social housing to be aligned with the commercial objectives of the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA). My Department and the Housing Agency are engaged with NAMA to ensure the identification of suitable housing units for social purposes and this process is on-going. <\/p><p>  In spite of the challenging circumstances within which local authorities must operate it is provisionally estimated that in the region of 5,000 units will be provided for social housing in 2013.   <\/p><p>  The payment of rent supplement is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Social Protection.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071100074#WRE02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Management Companies","counter":270,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071100074#WRE02750"},{"type":"question","counter":271,"qnumday":164,"qnumall":"[34108\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071100074#WRE02800","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the total number of housing associations nationwide that have benefitted from the capital allowance housing scheme; the number of such bodies that have malfunctioned or have failed to meet their statutory obligations or the company legislation; the procedure to restore such housing schemes to local authority management in the short and medium term; the nature of legislation required, if any, to effect such transfer in view of the fact that the entirety of the cost was borne by the Exchequer in the first instance; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":272,"content":"<p>A total of 704 housing associations were granted approved status by my Department under Section 6 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1992 for the provision and management of housing.

The funding schemes are administered by the local authorities and it is a matter for the relevant housing authority to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the schemes, and to have appropriate oversight and liaison arrangements in place for their effective administration and for ensuring that the substantial investment in voluntary housing is safeguarded.

The Directive requires that certain minimum levels of monitoring are conducted for the purpose of assessment and management of air quality. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has responsibility for the monitoring of air quality in Ireland, and monitors a range of atmospheric pollutants based on data obtained from the 30 monitoring stations that form the national ambient air quality network.<\/p><p>  The EPA publishes also an annual report on air quality, based primarily on the monitoring requirements of the CAF&Eacute; Directive.

Having different standards applying to coal between larger urban and smaller urban\/rural locations is not ideal, as it results in different levels of environmental protection and clean air benefits for people across these different locations. For this reason, on 6 May 2013, I announced a joint North-South study on all-island air quality to examine air pollution from residential solid fuel, in particular 'smoky' coal, to consider the potential policy options to reduce such emissions with consequential environmental and human health benefits. <\/p><p>  Air quality monitoring results have also shown that nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2<\/sub>) levels in larger urban areas, derived mainly from road traffic, have remained relatively static since 2002, with signs of a slight increasing trend in the years 2008-2010.

Such an examination would require a disproportionate and inordinate amount of staff time and effort and could not be justified in current circumstances where there are other significant demands on resources.<\/p><p>  The discretionary granting of additional remission, as opposed to the standard rate of one quarter, will be considered where a prisoner has shown the following:<\/p><p>  (i)  to have displayed good industry in prison and continue to be of good conduct<\/p><p>  (ii) to display willingness to seek employment through education\/course work whilst in prison to enhance their chances of gaining employment upon release;<\/p><p>  (iii) through engagement in authorised structured activity and where, as a result, the prisoner is less likely to re-offend and will be better able to reintegrate into the community.<\/p><p>An essential part of the criteria for rewarding one third remission is that applicants engage in offence focused work which in turn should lead to a reduced risk of re-offending.<b><\/b><\/p><p>  In September, 2012 I appointed a group to carry out a Strategic Review of Penal Policy. This group are currently examining all aspects of penal policy including prevention, sentencing policies, alternatives to custody, accommodation and regimes, support for reintegration and rehabilitation and the issue of female prisoners. The general issue of remission, including its use in the context of sexual and violent offenders, will fall within the remit of that review and I will await their recommendations before making any decision on this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071100075#WRF01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Prisoner Releases","counter":307,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071100075#WRF01650"},{"type":"question","counter":308,"qnumday":178,"qnumall":"[34007\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071100075#WRF01700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of prisoners who have participated in community return schemes from each institution; the number of prisoners from each institution who have successfully completed community return schemes; the number of prisoners from each institution who failed to complete community return schemes and were returned to prison; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1005","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":309,"content":"<p>The information requested by the Deputy is set out in the table and is accurate as of 9 July 2013.<\/p><p><table><tr><th>Institution<\/th><th>Participants<\/th><th>Completions<\/th><th>Breaches <\/th><th>Did not complete for medical reasons<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Castlerea<\/td><td>7<\/td><td>6<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork<\/td><td>39<\/td><td>24<\/td><td>9<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dochas<\/td><td>21<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Limerick<\/td><td>50<\/td><td>27<\/td><td>7<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Loughan House<\/td><td>76<\/td><td>45<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>4<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Midlands<\/td><td>51<\/td><td>35<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Mountjoy<\/td><td>68<\/td><td>47<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Portlaoise<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Shelton Abbey<\/td><td>135<\/td><td>102<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>St Patrick's<\/td><td>28<\/td><td>13<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Training Unit<\/td><td>54<\/td><td>41<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wheatfield<\/td><td>37<\/td><td>22<\/td><td>7<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total<\/td><td>574<\/td><td>377<\/td><td>66<\/td><td>11<\/td><\/tr><\/table><<\/p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the Irish Prison Service Three Year Strategic Plan 2012-2015 and the recently published Joint Prison Service\/Probation Service Strategic Plan 2013-2015 includes commitments to ensure that all prisoners released early from custody are placed on appropriate structured programme of temporary release.

The Irish Prison Service developed a set of Healthcare Standards which were published in June 2004, setting out the standards expected under each of the seven main areas of care. These standards were externally audited by KPMG in 2008. At that time compliance with standards varied significantly across prisons (38% - 61%). Issues relating to awareness of the standards, healthcare facilities, utilisation of healthcare staff, absence of a local healthcare management grade, availability of drug treatment, record keeping and absence of administrative support were highlighted.<\/p><p>  Since this audit there has been a significant improvement in many areas of care. An awareness campaign regarding the content of healthcare standards has been undertaken. All healthcare care staff receive training on the standards at induction. Each closed prison now has a local healthcare nursing management structure in place, which has improved the management of healthcare staff and the coordination of healthcare inputs.  Healthcare facilities in Arbour Hill, Cork, Limerick, Castlerea, Midlands, Mountjoy , Portlaoise and Wheatfield have been significantly upgraded. Loughan House healthcare facilities are currently under construction. Healthcare records are now fully computerised and one single healthcare record is maintained for each prisoner, with all healthcare professionals contributing to the single patient record.<\/p><p>  The Irish Prison Service is in the process of carrying out a pilot audit with a view to informing a review of the current standards, to meet the changing healthcare needs of prisoners.  The Irish Prison Service has commenced discussions with the Irish College of General Practitioners to seek to identify and implement primary care standards for prison medical services and to devise a suitable audit methodology. A collaborative approach between the Irish College of General Practitioners and the Irish Prison Service will ensure that a robust tool is developed which can be consistently applied. Conclusions arising from such audits can be implemented to ensure that the standard of care delivered to prisoners is equivalent to that which is available in the community. It is intended that a phased audit of prison healthcare will commence in the autumn.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071100075#WRF02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Treaties","counter":313,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071100075#WRF02050"},{"type":"question","counter":314,"qnumday":180,"qnumall":"[34075\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071100075#WRF02100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if he will outline the implications for Ireland as a result of the decision by the British Home Secretary, Rt.

In this context, it should be noted that ICS research indicates that the percentage of those who use a sunbed has reduced from 9% in 2003 to 4% in 2010. <\/p><p>  In 2009, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), which is an expert body under the World Health Organisation, reclassified sunbed use as a group 1 carcinogen. This higher risk classification now places sunbed use on a par with cigarette smoking. The World Health Organisation, the Irish Cancer Society and the Environmental Health Officers' Association amongst others have expressed growing concern about the use of sunbeds. The Department has taken these developments fully into account in its consideration of the measures in the proposed legislation.<\/p><p>  In addition to this prohibition on sunbed businesses from permitting persons under 18 years of age from using or hiring a sunbed, the legislation will also set out a comprehensive range of measures to promote a greater public awareness across all age groups of the dangers of developing skin cancer, premature ageing and eye damage from exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR).  Key provisions in the Bill will include:-<\/p><p>  (i) a prohibition on anyone under 18 years of age using a sunbed on a sunbed premises;<\/p><p>  (ii) a prohibition on the sale to or hire of sunbeds to anyone under 18 years of age;<\/p><p>  (iii) a prohibition on the unsupervised  use of sunbeds in a sunbed premises;<\/p><p>  (iv) an exemption for medical purposes;<\/p><p>  (v) control on the remote sale or hire of sunbeds (internet  transactions); <\/p><p>  (vi) sunbed operators, sellers and hirers will be required to notify the HSE;<\/p><p>  (vii) a requirement that sunbed operators provide training for staff; <\/p><p>  (viii) an enforcement regime and the imposition of penalties for non-compliance; <\/p><p>  (ix) an obligation on all sunbed operators to provide protective eyewear to users;<\/p><p>  (x) a requirement that warning signs be displayed in all sunbed premises;<\/p><p>  (xi) a prohibition on certain promotional marketing practices;<\/p><p>  (xii) a requirement on operators to ensure that sunbed users are made fully aware of the potential dangers of sunbed use; and a related provision whereby sunbed users are required to sign to confirm that they have been made so aware. <\/p><p>  I am delighted to be in a position to confirm that my Department expects to complete the drafting of this legislation within the next 6-8 weeks.
