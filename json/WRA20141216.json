Public Service Reform will also continue to play an important role in our recovery.<\/font><br\/><br\/><font color=\"#181818\">As the Deputy will be aware, we published our first Public Service Reform Plan in November 2011.  A Progress Report published in January this year sets out the considerable progress we have made.  Also in January, I published the Government's second Public Service Reform Plan 2014-2016, with over 230 specific actions to deliver reform and service improvements across the Public Service.<\/font><br\/><br\/><font color=\"#181818\">In addition, the Taoiseach and I launched the Civil Service Renewal Plan in October.  This plan outlines the practical changes that will create a more unified, professional, responsive, open and accountable Civil Service.  We are also enhancing openness and transparency through our extensive programme of political and legislative reforms.<\/font><br\/><br\/><font color=\"#181818\">With regard to State Board appointments, while new arrangements introduced in 2011 were successful in opening up the appointments process, further steps have recently been taken, as the Deputy will be aware. The new guidelines provide good practice rules with the core principles of: promoting wider access to opportunities on State Boards; putting in place detailed and comprehensive criteria for those roles; and introducing transparent and rigorous assessment of candidates against these criteria.  To facilitate this, a new website was created stateboards.ie on which members of the public can apply for such vacancies.<\/font><br\/><br\/><font color=\"#181818\">Overall, I am satisfied that we have made strong progress on the delivery of Public Service Reform.  Our plans are in line with, and frequently exceed, best practice across Europe and our progress is well regarded internationally.  The levels of reform we have delivered could not have happened without the efforts and commitment of our public servants and I commend them for their contribution to date.<\/font><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121600064#WRA00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":11,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 91 to 95, inclusive, answered orally.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Flood Risk Insurance Cover","counter":12,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121600064#WRA00950"},{"type":"question","counter":13,"qnumday":96,"qnumall":"[47801\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121600064#WRA01000","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the implementation measures in place in respect of the protocol between the Office of Public Works and insurance firms in respect of exchange of information on flood defences; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1100","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":14,"content":"<p>In March 2014, a Memorandum of Understanding was signed between Insurance Ireland, the representative body for the insurance industry in Ireland, and the Office of Public Works.

For example, this year the Office of Government Procurement supported two &quot;Meet the Buyer&quot; events in Belfast and Dublin which were attended by approximately 1,600 suppliers. The Office of Government Procurement also supported the 'Go 2 Tender' programme run by InterTrade Ireland which was attended by approximately 400 SME's.This year InterTrade Ireland also delivered a programme on consortia building to assist SME's to jointly bid for state contracts.  <\/font><br\/><br\/><font color=\"#181818\">The OGP will continue to work with suppliers to ensure that winning government business is done in a fair, transparent and accessible way and to ensure that Government procurement policies are business friendly.<\/font><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121600064#WRA02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pension Provisions","counter":33,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121600064#WRA02350"},{"type":"question","counter":34,"qnumday":103,"qnumall":"[47805\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121600064#WRA02400","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the role his Department has had in respect of dealing with the insolvency of a company's pension scheme (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1100","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":35,"content":"<p><font color=\"#181818\">The proposals emanating from the mediation process in relation to the Waterford Crystal pension schemes involve a settlement of a legal action initiated by representatives of workers in Waterford Crystal against the Minister of Social Protection.

The Minister for Social Protection has since enacted the Social Welfare and Pensions (No.2) Act 2013 which makes statutory provision for protection of workers where cases of double insolvency arise.

Those on lower incomes we<\/font><font color=\"#222222\">re least affected, with the highest reductions imposed on the highest paid. The most recent pay reduction effected by the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2013, was confined to those public servants on annual salaries of &euro;65,000 or more only; the core pay of almost 87% of public servants at  low and midranking pay levels was not impacted by this pay reduction.<\/font><br\/><br\/><font color=\"#222222\">  In seeking the most recent savings and reductions from the public service pay and pensions' bill, public service employers and trade unions entered into negotiations and concluded a collective agreement, the Haddington Road Agreement (HRA). This three year Agreement, effective from July 2013, built upon and reaffirmed the existing overall commitments in the Public Service Agreement (Croke Park Agreement) including those in relation to lower paid public servants and sets the terms of pay in the public service until 2016. As the public service unions have indicated they intend to submit a pay claim in the new year for all public servants, any such pay claim in respect of public servants will have to be considered in the context of both the emergency legislation and the HRA. I have stated that if such a pay claim is submitted the Government will be required to consider it.  <\/font><font color=\"#222222\"> <\/font><br\/><br\/><font color=\"#222222\">It should also be noted that under the Haddington Road Agreement, and subsequently legislated for in the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2013, the rate of PRD on the &euro;15,000 to &euro;20,000 band of pay received in a year was reduced from 5% to 2.5% on 1 January 2014. This rate cut is worth &euro;125 annually in gross terms to most public servants, with those taxed at the standard rate enjoying the greater gain in terms of take-home pay boost.<\/font><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121600064#WRA02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Monuments","counter":39,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121600064#WRA02750"},{"type":"question","counter":40,"qnumday":105,"qnumall":"[47802\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121600064#WRA02800","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he has a strategy in place for the care and maintenance of national monuments; the way this is integrated with the centenary celebrations of the 1916 Rising; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1100","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":41,"content":"<p>The Commissioners of Public Works have a statutory responsibility under the various National Monuments Acts 1930 - 2004 to undertake the care and maintenance of National Monuments in State care.Additionally, there are a number of Historic Properties under their care which are not designated National Monuments but which are important in a National context for various reasons.<br\/><br\/>Some National Monuments in the care of the Commissioners are uniquely designated because of their importance in terms of the story of Ireland's struggle for Independence.Sites such as Kilmainham Gaol for example hold a special place in our history and are regarded as key locations where seminal events took place.There are a number of such locations with connotations to the Independence story in the care of the Commissioners.Some of these are formal, National sites, while others are more domestic and personal in character, relating to specific high profile individuals.They include for example:<br\/><br\/>-Kilmainham Gaol<br\/><br\/>-Arbour Hill<br\/><br\/>-The Garden of Remembrance<br\/><br\/>-The Pearse Cottage, Co.

This legislation was enacted as part of the Social Welfare Bill over the summer.  Two schemes in particular, the Youth Guarantee developmental internship programme and the JobsPlus variant for young people (supporting young unemployed at risk of becoming long-term unemployed who have been signing on the Live Register for 4 months), were dependent on this legislation being passed.  These schemes were announced in November and will be implemented in full during 2015.  The legislation also permits the introduction of earlier and more intensive engagement by INTREO with the young unemployed that should also translate increased placement on schemes covered by the Youth Guarantee.

Individuals who qualify for the JA transitional arrangement are exempt from having to be available for, and genuinely seeking, full-time employment and can avail of this arrangement until their youngest child reaches 14 years of age.<\/p><p>  The JA transitional arrangement thus enables these parents to balance their caring responsibilities with work and significantly reduces their requirement for child care.

There are approximately 71,800 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;344 million for 2014.<\/p><p>  I am acutely aware of the difficulties people are experiencing in maintaining affordable rented accommodation in areas of high demand in the current market in line with the findings by the Private Residential Tenancies Board. I am keeping the matter regarding rent limits under consideration and the review being undertaken by the Department will be finalised shortly. However, the Department is in a position of both significant influence in the private rented market and responsibility and there is a real concern that increased rent limits may add to further rental inflation and impact, not alone on rent supplement recipients, but also on many lower income workers, their families and students.<\/p><p>  Emergency actions are being undertaken within the administration of the rent supplement scheme through the increased use of flexibility in relation to rent limits, including under the Interim Tenancy Sustainment Protocol operating in Dublin. A notice reminding all Community Welfare Service staff of their statutory discretionary power to award a supplement for rental purposes, for example, when dealing with applicants who are at risk of losing their tenancy was circulated in July 2014 and a further instruction issued last week.<\/p><p>  Staff are increasing rental payments as necessary and are actively engaging with the various local authorities and organisations involved in homelessness. The Department is reviewing the local arrangements in place throughout the country to strengthen the existing framework to ensure that the necessary supports continue to be provided in a consistent manner. <\/p><p>  I advise that where a person in receipt of rent supplement is at risk of losing their tenancy they should make contact with the Tenancy Protection Service provided by Threshold in Dublin at 1800 454 454 or their local Community Welfare Service throughout the country.<\/p><p>  Rent supplement is not generally payable where a person or their spouse\/partner is in full time employment i.e. 30 hours or more per week.  However, a person on rent supplement who is deemed by a local authority to be eligible to participate in the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) scheme may engage in full-time employment and retain entitlement.  Payment is subject to the standard means test and may continue while the local authority is making arrangements to transfer the tenant to RAS.<\/p><p>  The Department&rsquo;s strategic policy direction is to return rent supplement to its original purpose of a short-term income support scheme. Under the new Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) responsibility for recipients of rent supplement with a long-term housing need will transfer to local authorities.  To date, over 390 persons have transferred to HAP in the selected local authorities. HAP will provide a more integrated system of housing supports and has been designed to allow any households that find full-time employment to remain in the scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121600067#WRD03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1033"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Farm Assist Scheme Appeals","counter":162,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121600067#WRD03200"},{"type":"question","counter":163,"qnumday":170,"qnumall":"[48263\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121600067#WRD03300","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if a decision has been made on a farm assist appeal in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":164,"content":"<p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that an appeal by the person concerned was referred to an Appeals Officer on 04th November 2014 who will make a summary decision on the appeal based on the documentary evidence presented or, if required, hold an oral hearing.<\/p><p>  The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions in relation to social welfare entitlements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121600067#WRD03400","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Back to Work Allowance Eligibility","counter":166,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121600068#WRE00200"},{"type":"question","counter":167,"qnumday":171,"qnumall":"[48267\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121600068#WRE00300","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the position regarding persons who are self-employed participating in the back to work scheme; the position regarding eligibility to switch to jobseeker's allowance during slack periods of self employment under the scheme; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

The 2013 survey indicated that some 11% of cigarettes consumed were illicit.  This represents a loss of some &euro;212 million\u00a0to the exchequer in excise duty and VAT, assuming that the illegal cigarettes consumed displaced the equivalent full tax paid quantities of cigarettes.  A further survey in respect of 2014 is underway and it is expected that the results will be available towards the end of the first quarter of 2015. <br\/><br\/>A separate and smaller-scale survey on &quot;roll your own&quot; tobacco conducted by Ipsos MRBI last year found that 15% of tobacco packets held by the smokers surveyed were illegal.  On that basis, it is estimated that the loss to the exchequer would be in the order of some &euro;17 million.<br\/><br\/>The penalties for smuggling tobacco products are laid down in section 119 of the Finance Act 2001.Section 78 of the Finance Act 2005 provides for penalties for the illegal sale of unstamped tobacco products while section 78A of that Act contains penalties in relation to the illicit production of tobacco products.On conviction following summary prosecution for any of these offences, a court may impose a fine of &euro;5,000 or a term of imprisonment not exceeding 12 months, or both a fine and imprisonment.  A fine of up to &euro;126,970 or a term of imprisonment not exceeding 5 years, or both a fine and imprisonment, may be imposed on conviction following a prosecution on indictment.  Section 119 of the Finance Act 2001 provides also that, where the value of the goods concerned (inclusive of any tax or duty payable on them) is greater than &euro;250,000, a fine of an amount not exceeding three times their value may be imposed. <br\/><br\/>The specific penalty to be imposed in any particular case is a matter for the courts.Section 130(2) of the Finance Act 2001 permits a trial judge, in his or her discretion, to mitigate a fine or penalty incurred for an offence under excise law, provided that the amount mitigated is not greater than 50 per cent of the amount of the fine or penalty.<br\/><br\/>The penalties for summary and indictable offences in relation to tobacco smuggling and illegal selling were increased significantly in 2008 and 2010 respectively.Fines for summary offences are set at the maximum level that may be applied by the District Court.There are no proposals for further penalty increases at present, but the position is kept under review.<br\/><br\/>I wish to inform the Deputy also that a number of legal provisions have been introduced in recent years to further strengthen Revenue's response to the illegal tobacco trade.<br\/><br\/>The Finance Act 2012 clarified the legal basis for Revenue officers to open and examine the contents of postal and courier packets that are reasonably believed to contain untaxed excise products.  The Finance Act 2013 introduced new offences and forfeiture measures relating to the illicit production of tobacco, including offences for involvement with illicit tobacco production, knowingly dealing in or delivering any illicit tobacco product and keeping materials and equipment for the purposes of illicit production.Provision was made also for the forfeiture of any equipment or materials, including unmanufactured tobacco, used for illicit production.  That Act also strengthened the offence provisions relating to the sale or delivery of unstamped tobacco products.  The Finance (No. 2) Act 2013 provided that a person suspected of an offence of dealing in, or with, unstamped tobacco products must provide information to a Revenue Officer or a Garda and may be required to present any tobacco product concerned for examination, and makes provision for search by a Revenue officer or a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of any bag or other receptacle that he or she reasonably believes to contain tobacco products that are concerned in the offence.<br\/><br\/>As well as those changes to primary law, I introduced a quantitative restriction, with effect from 1 January 2014, on the number of cigarettes that may be brought into the State for personal use by individuals travelling from Bulgaria, Croatia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania and Romania.  The Excise Duty on Cigarettes (Quantitative Restrictions) Order 2013 (S.I. No. 553 of 2013) provides that the number of tax-paid cigarettes that may be brought into Ireland for personal use by individuals travelling from those Member States, without payment of further excise duty in Ireland, is restricted to 300.  Anyone with cigarettes in excess of that quantity must declare them to a Revenue Officer and pay the appropriate excise duty.  This restriction will remain in place until 31 December 2017 or until such time as the particular Member State has achieved the required EU minimum tax levels, whichever is the earlier. <br\/><br\/>I am satisfied that the legislative framework as it now stands, and the penalties that apply in respect of tobacco related offences, provide an effective basis for action\u00a0 by Revenue against the illegal tobacco trade.  Nonetheless, the position will be kept under review and I am committed to responding positively to any proposals for additional measures that might assist the Revenue Commissioners in that regard.<br\/><br\/>Revenue relies on the tobacco tax stamp to identify tax-paid tobacco products and this will continue following the introduction of standardised packaging.  The standardised packaging legislation will accommodate the tax stamp and Revenue expects that the new packaging rules will ensure effective security features to make counterfeiting very difficult.\u00a0 The tobacco tax stamp has, itself, a range of sophisticated security features to minimise the risk of counterfeiting.\u00a0 I am advised that Revenue's view is that the introduction of standardised packaging will not affect their work against the illicit trade in tobacco products.\u00a0 <br\/><br\/>Revenue currently has three mobile scanner systems.  Two of these are mobile x-ray container scanning systems that are based at Dublin Port and Rosslare Ferry Port respectively.  Both of these scanners are available for deployment at other ports, and at other locations such as warehouses, as required, and Revenue uses them, on a risk assessment basis, at various locations throughout the country.  The other mobile scanning system is a scanner van, a specialist vehicle incorporating an x-ray facility and radiation detection facilities.  It is used for monitoring baggage and cargo at airports for narcotics, tobacco products, radioactive materials and other contraband.  It also allows Revenue officers to carry out control actions at other locations such as warehouses and courier depots.<br\/><br\/>The mobile scanner systems are complemented by static baggage and parcel scanners at all major ports, airports and postal depots.<br\/><br\/>Revenue continuously reviews its detection technology requirements, taking account of developments in those technologies, and has availed of part-funding under the European Union's Hercule programme to acquire new or replacement equipment of this kind.  I understand that Revenue is generally satisfied with the current scanning capabilities and consider that the container ports are adequately serviced by the two mobile x-ray container scanning systems.

Although this represents a slowdown on the exceptionally strong first half of the year, GDP still grew by close to 5 per cent year-on-year in the first half of this year.<\/p><p>  On a full-year basis, the increase in economic activity is broadly-based with both domestic sectors and exporting sectors performing strongly.  Importantly, domestic demand is continuing to grow, with consumption and investment up in the first three quarters of the year.  Exports continued their strong performance up 15.5 per cent year-on-year, the strongest growth since 2001.<\/p><p>  Recovery is perhaps most clearly evident in the labour market, with employment having increased in each of the last eight quarters, representing a net increase of nearly 85,000 jobs since the low-point in mid-2012.  It is expected that\u00a0employment will continue to\u00a0increase and that unemployment will continue to fall steadily, to an average of 10.2 per cent next year.<\/p><p>  Growth in the euro area is essential for sustained growth in Ireland.  The sluggish growth being recorded in the euro area at the moment remains of concern.  Notwithstanding that, Ireland has out-performed other EU Member States in recent quarters due in part to the competitiveness improvements achieved in recent years, as well as to Ireland's economy being more closely linked than those of other euro area countries\u00a0to the UK and US economies.  The Department of Finance is forecasting GDP growth of 4.7 per cent this year and 3.9 per cent in 2015.  According to recent forecasts by the European Commission, Ireland\u00a0is set to record the fastest rate of GDP growth in\u00a0the EU\u00a0this year and in 2015.<\/p><p>  In terms of the public finances, policy measures implemented by the Government have resulted in a decline in Ireland's deficit in recent years.  This decline has been managed in\u00a0a phased manner, consistent with the dual needs of supporting domestic activity as well as repairing the public finances.  All of Ireland's interim deficit ceilings under the Excessive Deficit Procedure have been met and, as a result,\u00a0Ireland is firmly on track to achieve a deficit of below 3 per cent in 2015.

Employees are exempt from the charge to PRSI if their income does not exceed &euro;18,304.  However, once PAYE income exceeds this threshold they are liable to pay PRSI on the full amount at 4%, thus equalising the\u00a0treatment of personal PRSI contributions, on all of the income,\u00a0for PAYE and self-assessed workers on incomes above that level. <\/p><p>  Self-assessed individuals are required to pay the greater of\u00a0&euro;500 per annum, or 4% of their\u00a0income, whichever is higher,\u00a0and do not benefit from the exemption threshold.  However, in the case of employees, their employers are required to pay a PRSI charge in respect of each employee.  Thus the contribution made to the Social Insurance Fund in respect of employees is usually higher than that made by a self-assessed individual.  For instance, at the\u00a0specified income level of &euro;15,000, an employer would typically\u00a0be required to pay\u00a0PRSI of &euro;1,275 in respect of the employee.  PRSI of &euro;600 is payable in respect of\u00a0a self-employed individual with the same income.  Entitlement to social welfare benefits is primarily a matter for the Minister for Social Protection.  However, it is worth pointing out that for individuals with incomes in excess of &euro;18,304 the total PRSI payable in respect of an employee is 14.75% of salary, while the total payable by a self-employed individual is 4%.<\/p><p>  Employees in the PAYE system benefit from a PAYE income tax credit worth &euro;1,650 per annum, to which the self-assessed are not entitled.  The PAYE allowance, as it was then, was introduced in 1980 to improve the tax progression of PAYE taxpayers and to take account of the fact that the self-employed generally then had the advantage of paying tax on a preceding year basis.  The argument was also made at the time that the general scheme of allowances for expenses discriminated against employees and in favour of other taxpayers. <\/p><p>  There have been some changes since 1980.  For example, the self-employed now pay tax on a current year basis.  In addition, the PAYE allowance has become a tax credit.  However, there are other aspects to how the self-assessed are taxed which can be beneficial to them.  For instance, there are significant timing benefits, depending on the accounting period used by the taxpayer, which are available to the self-assessed but which are not available to PAYE workers.  In addition, the expenses regime for self-assessed taxpayers remains somewhat more liberal than that afforded to employees and therefore the self-employed can actually pay less tax when compared to a PAYE worker on the same income.<\/p><p>  It is important to note that\u00a0the changes to the Income Tax system introduced in Budget 2015 will benefit all those who pay income tax and or USC equally, regardless of whether they are PAYE or self-assessed taxpayers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121600069#WRF03500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Network","counter":271,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121600070#WRG00150"},{"type":"question","counter":272,"qnumday":213,"qnumall":"[47943\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121600070#WRG00200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will include the Adare Bypass, County Limerick on the Government's list for European Investment Bank funding.","asker":"1056","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":273,"content":"<p>In September the Ecofin Council\u00a0requested that a Task Force be established to develop an EU investment project pipeline.

However, Ireland applies the 13.5% reduced rate of VAT to construction services under a derogation from the EU VAT Directive, because Ireland applied a reduced rate to such services on 1 January 1991.  However, this derogation is only permissible where the VAT rate applying is 12% or greater.

However, the Deputy will be aware\u00a0that the Home Renovation Incentive, which came into operation on 25 October 2013 and will run until 31 December 2015, provides tax relief by way of a tax credit at 13.5% of qualifying expenditure incurred on repair, renovation or improvement work carried out on a principal private residence.\u00a0<\/p><p>  The Home Renovation Incentive has been very successful to date with works on just under 12,100 homes notified to the Revenue online system as of 14 November 2014.

The Incentive is generating significant employment in the tax compliant construction sector and increasing sales in building supplies, hardware and related businesses.\u00a0 <\/p><p>  I announced in the Budget that I am extending the Home Renovation Incentive to rental properties whose owners are liable to income tax.

It was a necessary measure to widen the tax base, remove poverty traps and raise revenue to reduce the budget deficit.  It is a more sustainable charge than those it replaced.  It is applied at a low rate on a wide base.  I should point out that it was never intended that the USC would be a temporary measure.  The USC was designed and incorporated in to the Irish taxation system as part of its permanent structure and the revenues collected play a vital part in meeting the many expenditure demands placed on the Exchequer. <\/p><p>  It is estimated that the income tax and USC measures introduced in Budget 2015 will cost &euro;478 million in 2015.  Although this is a sizeable amount of money it is only about one tenth of the estimated yield from USC next year.  Thus any plan to abolish USC would need to be implemented over a long period and would be subject to the fiscal space available in each year.  In addition, Government priorities need to be considered on an annual basis, particularly regarding tax and expenditure measures, and the annual Budget process allows Government to consider all of these aspects in the round.  Therefore, I would not be in favour of tying the Government to multi-annual specific changes to only one aspect of the tax system in isolation.<\/p><p>  The Deputy should note that the amounts raised by the new USC in 2011 were of the same magnitude as that raised from the levies that it replaced.  It is estimated that USC receipts for 2014 will amount to around &euro;4 billion, or approximately one quarter of total income tax receipts. Any scheme to abolish the USC would have to contain a credible road map as to how this revenue would be replaced, in order that vital services can continue to be funded. <\/p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that in fulfilment of a Programme for Government commitment my Department conducted a review of the USC in 2011.  As a result, I decided to raise the USC exemption threshold from &euro;4,004 to &euro;10,036 in Budget 2012, removing 330,000 individuals from liability to the charge entirely.<\/p><p>  Furthermore, in Budget 2015 I extended the USC exemption threshold to &euro;12,012, taking another 87,000 out of the charge.  Budget 2015 also included a reduction in the two lower rates of USC and an extension of the threshold before which an individual is liable to the 7% rate, thereby exempting all those on the standard minimum wage from liability to the higher rates of USC entirely.  Collectively the budgetary income tax and USC measures ensure that all those who pay income tax and or USC will see a reduction in their tax bill from next year.<\/p><p>  A fair, efficient and competitive income tax system is essential for economic growth and job creation.  I have long said that the burden of the income tax system in Ireland is too high and that I would seek to reduce it when the public finances would allow me to do so.  The income tax measures in the Bill are the first stage of a three-year plan to\u00a0reduce the marginal tax rate on low and middle income earners in a manner that maintains the highly progressive nature of the Irish tax system.  However, it is not possible to be specific about the individual components of the plan for subsequent years, as each component will need\u00a0to be considered in terms of its overall contribution to the total tax package delivered in\u00a0each year's Budget.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121600070#WRG02100","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":301,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121600070#WRG02150"},{"type":"question","counter":302,"qnumday":223,"qnumall":"[48180\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121600070#WRG02200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the increase in VRT and VAT on new car sales to date in 2014 compared to 2013; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":303,"content":"<p>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the provisional increase in VRT and VAT on new registrations from January to November 2014, compared to the same period in 2013, is &euro;104m (+24.4% ) and &euro;83m (+31%) respectively.\u00a0\u00a0<br\/><br\/>It should be noted that the VAT figure is partially estimated and that all 2014 receipts are provisional at this time and may be subject to revision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121600070#WRG02300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Bank Debt Restructuring","counter":304,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121600070#WRG02350"},{"type":"question","counter":305,"qnumday":224,"qnumall":"[48187\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121600070#WRG02400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"in view of Ireland&rsquo;s challenging debt levels and further to the June 2012 agreement, if he will renew and intensify Ireland&rsquo;s efforts for a deal on retrospective banking debt; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":306,"content":"<p>The Euro-area Heads of State or Government (HoSG) agreed in June 2012 that \"it is imperative to break the vicious circle between banks and sovereigns\" and that when a Single Supervisory Mechanism, involving the ECB, is in place and operational, the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) could recapitalize banks directly.<\/p><p>  Last week, on the 8th December, the ESM Board of Governors approved the creation of a new Direct Recapitalisation Instrument (DRI) in accordance with Article 19 of the ESM.  The operational framework for the DRI, approved on the same date, includes a specific provision in relation to the retroactive application of the instrument.  The guideline states that the potential application of the instrument for this purpose should be decided on a case-by-case basis and by mutual agreement.<\/p><p>  However, I would remind the Deputy that unlike back in 2012, the ESM is no longer the only option open to us to recover the money provided to recapitalise our banks.  Investors are now willing to support Irish banks again and the market value of our investments has improved accordingly.<\/p><p>  With respect to the State's shareholdings or ownership in the banks, Government policy remains unchanged that we do not wish to hold these investments in the banks over the long term.  Subject to market conditions therefore we are willing to exit in a manner that maximises value for the taxpayer.<\/p><p>  In the last 18 months the State has exited successfully from some debt investments with the sale of our &quot;Cocos&quot; and Preference Shares in Bank of Ireland in addition to the sale of Irish Life.  Given the significant cash resources we hold, we are not under any immediate pressure to exit our remaining investments.  However given where our national debt is, neither do we have the luxury of holding on indefinitely.<\/p><p>  In relation to AIB, which is our largest remaining investment, we have important work and decisions to make around the bank's capital structure and how we should best reconfigure our various holdings in a way that benefits both the bank and the taxpayer.  Hence we are not making any decisions around reducing our ownership of the bank now.  If we can deliver on this work programme next year and everything else develops as we would like, then we may be at the point where we can consider selling some of our shares.<\/p><p>  In relation to retrospective recapitalisation via the ESM, I would reiterate what I've said previously, that in Europe a strategic approach tends to deliver the best results and that it serves our interest to keep this on the table.<\/p><p>  However I see no benefit in making an application to the ESM now.

As part of the process, the person makes a declaration on the form DE1 that their income is less than the exemption limit and that they will notify the financial institution if this changes.<br\/><br\/>In the absence of this declaration, a financial institution must deduct DIRT at the appropriate rate from the interest income.  However, in any case where tax was so deducted from interest income of an individual who otherwise qualifies for the exemption, he or she will be entitled to a refund of that tax.<br\/><br\/>Permanently Incapacitated Individuals:<br\/><br\/>Since the enactment of the Finance Act, 2007, an exemption from DIRT also applies where an individual, his or her spouse or civil partner:<br\/><br\/>I. is permanently incapacitated by reason of physical or mental infirmity from maintaining himself or herself and<br\/><br\/>II. is not liable to pay income tax because of the level of his or her income. <br\/><br\/>In order to claim the exemption, the individual must make a declaration to the Revenue Commissioners, on form (DE 2) to the effect that they or their spouse or civil partner are permanently incapacitated.

The section applies where the return on such investment (both income and gains) is greater than 50 percent of the individual's total income and gains. <br\/><br\/>In relation to Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT), Finance Act 2007 introduced new arrangements that allow a person to have any interest earned on money on deposit credited to their savings account by their Financial Institution without deduction of DIRT where they satisfy certain conditions.  If a person meets these conditions, they can apply to Revenue to have the interest paid without deduction of DIRT.  The conditions involved are that either the person or their Spouse or Civil Partner (if appropriate) are permanently incapacitated by physical or mental infirmity from maintaining themselves, and would be entitled to a refund of the entire amount of DIRT deducted by a Financial Institution.  A trustee of a Special Trust under Section 189A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, can apply for exemption from DIRT, in respect of an account held by them, where the trust was set up exclusively for the benefit of one or more specified permanently incapacitated individuals and the funds of such a trust were obtained by subscriptions from the general public.

In addition the Courts Service will not be subject to exit tax in respect of a transfer of units resulting solely from the changing of investment managers.  However, the Courts Service will be required to operate the exit tax when they allocate those payments to the beneficial owners.<br\/><br\/>The following persons may be entitled to repayment of exit tax provided the conditions outlined in the following sections of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, are satisfied<br\/><br\/>- a permanently incapacitated individual who is exempt from income tax under section 189 in respect of income arising from the investment of compensation payments in respect of personal injury claims;<br\/><br\/>- the trustees of a 'qualifying trust' within section 189A where the life policy is held as part of the trust fund (funds raised for the benefit of incapacitated individual(s) through public subscriptions) of the qualifying trust, provided that income from the trust or investment returns from investment of the trust funds is the sole or main income of the incapacitated individual;<br\/><br\/>- a thalidomide victim who is exempt from income tax under section 192 in respect of income arising from the investment of compensation payments made by the Minister for Health and Children or by the foundation Hilfswerk f&uuml;r behinderte Kinder.<br\/><br\/>The investment undertaking or Courts Service must deduct the exit tax in the normal manner, but the individual or trust may be entitled to a repayment of the exit tax.

Section 19(1) of the said Act empowers the Commissioner to make a Valuation Order specifying a rating authority area over which a revaluation is to be conducted, after consultation with the Minister for the Environment, Community\u00a0and Local Government and the rating authority concerned. I, therefore, have no role in\u00a0selection of the order of counties for revaluation.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p><p>  The Valuation Office is currently undertaking a systematic programme of revaluing, for rates purposes, all industrial and commercial properties in the State. The immediate objective of the national revaluation programme is to ensure that the first revaluation of all rating authority areas is conducted as soon as possible. Revaluation is conducted across all relevant properties in one or more rating authority areas at the same time. However, implementation of the national programme cannot occur across the entire country simultaneously and the programme must, accordingly, be operated on a phased basis. Following the first revaluation, subsequent revaluations of each rating authority area will then be carried out on a cyclical basis no sooner than five years and no later than ten years after the first revaluation (Section 25 of the Valuation Act 2001).<\/p><p>  The purpose of revaluation is to bring more equity, fairness and transparency into the local authority rating system and to distribute the commercial rates liability more equitably between ratepayers. Following revaluation there generally will be a much closer and uniform relationship between rental values of property and their commercial rates liability.\u00a0 In essence, the exercise aims to ensure that each ratepayer bears a fair share of the rates burden relative to the value of the property that they occupy.\u00a0 I should emphasise that while the list of rateable valuations produced and maintained by the Valuation Office is the basis on which rates are levied, the amount of rates to be collected is ultimately a matter for each local authority to decide.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121600071#WRH01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Housing Provision","counter":353,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121600071#WRH02000"},{"type":"question","counter":354,"qnumday":240,"qnumall":"[47888\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121600071#WRH02100","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the delay in enacting legislation on including social clauses in major State-local authority construction contracts.

The awarding of individual contracts is a matter for each contracting authority. Therefore the onus is on the contracting authority to ensure that their public procurement complies with national and EU rules.<\/p><p>  Whilst the rules for procuring such services are more flexible, national guidelines require that best value for money must be obtained by State bodies in all procurements. Therefore public bodies should procure such services by way of a transparent and objective tendering process. In this regard, my Department issued guidance (Circular 5\/13) instructing public bodies of the need to carry out a competitive process for engagement of general legal advisory services to ensure value for money. <\/p><p>  The Office of Government Procurement (OGP) is in the process of assessing how such legal services are procured by public bodies with the aim of delivering savings in this area. To this end, OGP will take responsibility for the procurement of Professional Services within which Legal Services falls. The OGP has already established a procurement sourcing team specific to the legal services requirements of Local Authorities. This team is comprised of representatives from a number of Local Authorities and their function is to design a procurement strategy that suits the needs of all Local Authorities while at the same time matching the capacity and capability in the marketplace. <\/p><p>  On completion of the procurement strategy design stage, it is anticipated that OGP will (on behalf of all Local Authorities) approach the marketplace by way of a formal tender process in the first half of 2015.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121600071#WRH05000","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Procurement Contracts","counter":384,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121600071#WRH05100"},{"type":"question","counter":385,"qnumday":250,"qnumall":"[48059\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121600071#WRH05200","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the fact that some public bodies insert conditions into invitations to tender that favour existing providers of goods and services and that these conditions are often unreasonable and designed to attract a preferred provider; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1073","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":386,"content":"<p>The assessment of a tenderer's financial and economic standing is a key part of any procurement process. Establishing the appropriate suitability criteria that are relevant and appropriate to a particular contract is, of course, a matter for the contracting authority concerned. This is because the contracting authority is in the best position to gauge the appropriate levels of financial capacity that are appropriate to the needs of that specific contract. Such requirements would logically be developed on a case by case basis with reference to the specific needs of the contract.<br\/><br\/>Notwithstanding the above the Government recognizes that it is vital that all suppliers engaging with contracting authorities are treated in a fair, transparent and professional manner. The Office of Government Procurement (OGP) has engaged with SME stakeholders who have raised concerns in relation to possible barriers for SMEs in competing for tender opportunities. In order to address these concerns, the OGP has developed a pilot programme designed to give an informal outlet for potential suppliers to raise concerns in relation to a particular live tender process. The objectives of the initiative are to improve communications with suppliers and increase professionalism and consistency in how procurement processes are carried out across the public service. <br\/><br\/>The new Tender Advisory Service (TAS) will liaise with potential suppliers and contracting authorities to clarify or query tender documentation and, where necessary, will make suggestions to contracting authorities aimed at resolving the concerns that have been raised. \u00a0As a matter of course TAS will communicate, to all parties, the informal nature of this service and that they do not have any legal authority to overturn any decision that has already been taken by the responsible contracting authority. As tendering of public service contracts must be carried out in an open and transparent manner, any information arising from this service will be communicated to all suppliers that have registered an interest in the tender process by the contracting authority. <br\/><br\/>This new service will contribute to an improved public procurement landscape for both suppliers and contracting authorities and to maximise all avenues for dealing with issues arising.

Ireland will continue to pursue this strategy through representation at ESA Ministerial Council, Council at Delegate level and at relevant Programme Boards and through engagement with other ESA member States in order to maximise the opportunities for Ireland.<br\/><br\/>Ireland&rsquo;s Space Strategy is focused on strengthening the competitiveness of Irish industry in the global space market through supporting product development and qualification for the space market, building supply team relations and supporting access to new geographic and sectoral markets.  A key element of the strategy is to focus on technologies that can be qualified for space use, but also adapted for and commercialised in a range of other markets such as the broader space and aerospace market, biomedical, energy and telecommunications.  ESA is also providing increasing levels of support for Irish 3rd level research and increased support for 3rd level industrial collaboration.  Irish companies have developed a specific reputation for introducing innovative and disruptive technologies to the space programme, in a number of cases leveraging the R&amp;amp;D investment supported through SFI and EI. <br\/><br\/>The engineering expertise developed in ESA programmes has been applied by many Irish companies to develop products in a range of non-space market sectors for which performance-critical technologies are required.<font color=\"#FF0000\">  <\/font>Irish companies have used ESA to develop new intellectual property and develop new geographic markets.

Data management and analytics is a key enabler of business across all areas of economic activity, for example, in the food, manufacturing and financial services sectors.  <\/p><p>  The Irish government identified Big Data and Analytics as one of its 9 Disruptive Reforms in the Action Plan for Jobs (APJ), with an overall ambition to &quot;build on existing enterprise strengths to make Ireland a leading country in Europe in the area of Big Data and Data Analytics&quot;.  As part of this disruptive reform the Government has taken a number of key steps such as the establishment of the Taskforce on Big Data, the launch of Insight, a Science Foundation Ireland-supported research centre for data analytics, and the launch of CeADAR, the IDA Ireland\/Enterprise Ireland-supported data analytics technology centre.<\/p><p>  The Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN) has recently completed a report assessing the demand for big data and data analytics skills.  While there are no exact figures known, the EGFSN estimated that there were 35,000 persons employed in big data\/analytic roles within Irish enterprises in 2013. <\/p><p>  The EGFSN report estimates that employment in big data and analytics roles could grow by up to 27,000 by 2020 (to a total of 62,000 ) both as a result  of expansion growth within the existing enterprise base and  through inward investment, as well as through the upskilling of persons already in employment.<\/p><p>  There are a number of multinational enterprises that are providers of services and solutions for analytics and big data and whose business are built in whole or in part on the application of analytics and big data technologies, such as IBM, Aon, Groupon and EMC amongst others.

Account must also be taken of the interests of Iceland (not been party to recent agreements, although a Coastal State) as well as Russia and Greenland.  Ireland is the second largest mackerel quota holder within the EU (after the UK) and, as a result of this year&rsquo;s negotiations, in which we played an active part, the mackerel quota for Irish fishermen for 2015 will be 89,222 tonnes.  With the exception of the 2014 quota the quota agreed for 2015 is the highest mackerel quota available to Irish fishermen for very many years.<\/p><p>  The 2014 quota was set at an artificially high level, above scientific advice, due to the extraordinary circumstances of the March 2014 agreement which lead to a partial resolution of the international mackerel sharing dispute which had been ongoing for some years.<\/p><p>  Mackerel is of course our single most valuable fishery and the agreement provides a high quota, stability and certainty for the Irish pelagic fishing Industry.<\/p><p>  However, I remain unhappy with the overall sharing arrangement agreed in March and I do not agree with the amount set aside for other parties such as Iceland.

Price volatility is a continuing feature of dairy commodity markets, and it is clear that managing the price peaks and troughs in a way that allows farmers and others to plan ahead is a significant challenge for the sector.  After two years of extremely high prices, the combination of strong production in key dairy producing countries, including the USA, New Zealand, Australia and the European Union, driven by good weather, increased cow numbers in the US and strong cereal harvests, has seen the emergence of a surplus in dairy products on international markets coming into 2015.  Furthermore, with Russia and China accounting for 27% of the traded world market in the dairy sector, the effect of surplus stocks in the Chinese market along with the displacement effect of the Russian ban can be seen as critical factors in setting the context for price evolution in the sector.<\/p><p>  The anticipated decline in 2015 largely reflects the impact of the aforementioned developments on global dairy markets.  Teagasc, in their recent 2015 Outlook Conference, relayed an expectation that average Irish milk prices in 2015 will fall to 27 cent per litre, a reduction of over 10 cent per litre on the average for 2014.  However it should be noted that this follows several years of very good incomes on dairy farms.  Furthermore, Teagasc are clear that these negative effects are expected to be temporary in nature.<\/p><p>  Under the new Common Agriculture Policy there is a range of tools available to mitigate the worst impact of downward price volatility, including Aids to Private Storage, Intervention and Export Refunds and I have called on the EU Commission to deploy these tools as appropriate.  The Single Farm Payment will also provide a measure of income stability during this difficult period.  I have also asked the banking sector to tailor their financial products to take account of the kind of price volatility that will be a feature of international dairy markets, and of course co-ops have a role to play in ensuring that their contractual arrangements with suppliers provide a requisite measure of stability.

The report, which was completed in the light of detailed research, found AD to be one of the most expensive mitigation strategies. <br\/><br\/>In terms of overall EU policy, <i>t<\/i>he Commission has proposed limiting the amount of food-based biofuels that can be counted towards the EU's target of reaching a 10% share of renewable energy in the transport sector by 2020.This limit will allow non-food based biofuels to make a greater contribution to meeting the 10% target. The proposal seeks to shift the focus away from first generation biofuels and encourage future investment in advanced biofuels such as municipal waste and agricultural residues that do not compete directly with food and feed crops. <br\/><br\/>The draft Bioenergy Plan provides for further analysis to be carried out on the costs and benefits of biogas and biomethane.

Details in respect of each category are outlined below.<br\/><br\/><b><i>Criminal Legal Aid<\/i><\/b><br\/><br\/>Under the Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act 1962, the courts, through the judiciary, are responsible for the granting of legal aid. An applicant for legal aid must establish to the satisfaction of the court that his\/her means are insufficient to enable him\/her to pay for legal representation him\/herself. The assignment of lawyers or the granting of aid are matters for the Court and, as such, are handled by the judiciary on the applicant's appearance in court.  Unfortunately figures are not kept in such a way as to be able to provide a breakdown by county of the number of certificates granted for criminal legal aid.<br\/><br\/><b><i>Civil Legal Aid<\/i><\/b><br\/><br\/>In respect of civil legal aid, this is provided by the Legal Aid Board, an independent State agency. At the outset, it should be clarified that with the exception of a very small number of cases, civil legal aid is not free nor is the word &lsquo;free&rsquo; part of the Board&rsquo;s title. Clients pay a contribution for legal advice and a further contribution if they require representation in court. This is important as many applicants to the Board query why they are being asked to make a payment as they have heard reference to &lsquo;free legal aid&rsquo; or the &lsquo;Free Legal Aid Board&rsquo;.<br\/><br\/>In relation to civil legal aid, the Legal Aid Board operates 30 general full-time law centres in twenty-three different counties. Attached below is the number of applicants in each of the last five years at the law centre(s) in each of the counties in which the Board has a full time presence. (The Board has six general law centres in Dublin and two general law centres in both Cork and Galway).Only applicants that have been financially assessed are placed on an applications record and financial eligibility is usually determined  by law centre staff within 48 hours of receipt of the application. Therefore, the figures below represent financially eligible applications that fall within the scope of the Act.<br\/><br\/>Persons seeking legal services can apply at any law centre and are not required to apply within the county in which they reside. The Board also operates part-time law centres in the counties where it does not have a full-time presence. Each of these centres is operated by a full-time centre and the numbers getting services at these centres are included in the applications figure for the full-time centre. One other point to note is that the Board operates a part-time centre in Drogheda which is operated by its law centre in Monaghan (rather than its law centre in Dundalk). Thus the figures are not reflective of the addresses by county of the applicants. This particular information is not readily available.<table><tr><th>County<\/th><th><div>2013<\/div><\/th><th><div>2012<\/div><\/th><th><div>2011<\/div><\/th><th><div>2010<\/div><\/th><th><div>2009<\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Cavan<\/td><td><div>193<\/div><\/td><td><div>279<\/div><\/td><td><div>281<\/div><\/td><td><div>233<\/div><\/td><td><div>257<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Clare<\/td><td><div>472<\/div><\/td><td><div>582<\/div><\/td><td><div>739<\/div><\/td><td><div>675<\/div><\/td><td><div>638<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork<\/td><td><div>1,809<\/div><\/td><td><div>2,208<\/div><\/td><td><div>2,357<\/div><\/td><td><div>2,060<\/div><\/td><td><div>2,029<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Donegal<\/td><td><div>643<\/div><\/td><td><div>636<\/div><\/td><td><div>670<\/div><\/td><td><div>592<\/div><\/td><td><div>475<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin <\/td><td><div>4,532<\/div><\/td><td><div>5,600<\/div><\/td><td><div>4,821<\/div><\/td><td><div>4,499<\/div><\/td><td><div>3,863<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Galway<\/td><td><div>871<\/div><\/td><td><div>939<\/div><\/td><td><div>603<\/div><\/td><td><div>611<\/div><\/td><td><div>482<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kerry<\/td><td><div>610<\/div><\/td><td><div>609<\/div><\/td><td><div>611<\/div><\/td><td><div>598<\/div><\/td><td><div>546<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kildare<\/td><td><div>858<\/div><\/td><td><div>884<\/div><\/td><td><div>1,027<\/div><\/td><td><div>1,067<\/div><\/td><td><div>981<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kilkenny<\/td><td><div>784<\/div><\/td><td><div>747<\/div><\/td><td><div>836<\/div><\/td><td><div>711<\/div><\/td><td><div>728<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Laois<\/td><td><div>406<\/div><\/td><td><div>523<\/div><\/td><td><div>622<\/div><\/td><td><div>561<\/div><\/td><td><div>448<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Limerick<\/td><td><div>707<\/div><\/td><td><div>853<\/div><\/td><td><div>732<\/div><\/td><td><div>697<\/div><\/td><td><div>598<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Longford<\/td><td><div>444<\/div><\/td><td><div>378<\/div><\/td><td><div>383<\/div><\/td><td><div>336<\/div><\/td><td><div>362<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Louth<\/td><td><div>320<\/div><\/td><td><div>381<\/div><\/td><td><div>379<\/div><\/td><td><div>327<\/div><\/td><td><div>290<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Mayo<\/td><td><div>371<\/div><\/td><td><div>393<\/div><\/td><td><div>398<\/div><\/td><td><div>398<\/div><\/td><td><div>333<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Meath<\/td><td><div>785<\/div><\/td><td><div>574<\/div><\/td><td><div>560<\/div><\/td><td><div>487<\/div><\/td><td><div>471<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Monaghan<\/td><td><div>371<\/div><\/td><td><div>469<\/div><\/td><td><div>389<\/div><\/td><td><div>334<\/div><\/td><td><div>325<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Offaly<\/td><td><div>349<\/div><\/td><td><div>423<\/div><\/td><td><div>408<\/div><\/td><td><div>429<\/div><\/td><td><div>401<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Sligo<\/td><td><div>319<\/div><\/td><td><div>459<\/div><\/td><td><div>319<\/div><\/td><td><div>522<\/div><\/td><td><div>510<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Tipperary<\/td><td><div>632<\/div><\/td><td><div>503<\/div><\/td><td><div>636<\/div><\/td><td><div>597<\/div><\/td><td><div>562<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Waterford<\/td><td><div>505<\/div><\/td><td><div>562<\/div><\/td><td><div>580<\/div><\/td><td><div>519<\/div><\/td><td><div>524<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Westmeath<\/td><td><div>511<\/div><\/td><td><div>557<\/div><\/td><td><div>550<\/div><\/td><td><div>555<\/div><\/td><td><div>501<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wexford<\/td><td><div>498<\/div><\/td><td><div>590<\/div><\/td><td><div>589<\/div><\/td><td><div>541<\/div><\/td><td><div>587<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wicklow<\/td><td><div>557<\/div><\/td><td><div>696<\/div><\/td><td><div>797<\/div><\/td><td><div>973<\/div><\/td><td><div>1,006<\/div><\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121600077#WRO01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Traffic Management","counter":716,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121600077#WRO01600"},{"type":"question","counter":717,"qnumday":366,"qnumall":"[47980\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121600077#WRO01700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will request that extra attention be provided to a shopping centre (details supplied) in Dublin 13; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1021","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":718,"content":"<p>The Deputy will appreciate that I have no direct role in day to day traffic management or related enforcement activity by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

The approach of the Oireachtas has generally been to specify in law a maximum penalty for an offence, so that a court, having considered all the circumstances of a case, may impose an appropriate penalty up to that maximum.  The court is required to impose a sentence which is proportionate not only to the crime but to the individual offender, in that process identifying where on the sentencing range the particular case should lie and then applying any mitigating factors which may be present.  An important safeguard rests in the power of the Director of Public Prosecutions who may apply to have a sentence reviewed if she regards it as unduly lenient.<\/p><p>  The Superior Courts have developed a substantial body of case law setting out general principles of sentencing.  Sentencing practice is also being developed by a steering committee of the judiciary which developed the Irish Sentencing Information System (ISIS) website, a pilot initiative designed to gather information about the range of sentences and other penalties that have been imposed for particular types of offences across court jurisdictions.  ISIS is being developed as a valuable tool not only for members of the judiciary but also for lawyers, researchers and those concerned with the needs of victims and their families, the initiative which is being led by the Judiciary through the Judicial Research Office in undertaking the detailed work of gathering and providing information via the website.<\/p><p>  I recently published the report of the Penal Policy Review Group which was tasked with carrying out a strategic review of penal policy.

The relevant extracts are set out beneath:<blockquote>&quot;Many District Court Judges who have overturned the decisions of Chief Superintendents have consistently stated the current legislative provisions need to be addressed. <br \/><br \/>In Limerick District Court, an appeal hearing was heard in August 2013 with regard to two semi automatic, restricted rifles (rifles resembling assault rifles) and two centre fire handguns.  This was an appeal against the decision of the Chief Superintendent not to grant licences for these firearms.  It is reported that the Judge stated that the Chief Superintendent is being placed in an invidious position, with his concern being the public who he must protect and the possibility that the firearms may fall into the wrong hands.  The Judge commented that the legislation has not grappled with the kernel of the issue; are these firearms lawful or not.  The decision in this case was that the licences should be granted. <br \/><br \/>An appeal was heard in the Dublin District Court in October 2013 against the refusal to grant restricted licences for two centre-fire handguns (Thomas Mansfield V Chief Superintendent Coburn &amp;amp; the Commissioner of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na).<br \/><br \/>The Judge issued a ten page written judgment in December 2013, allowing the appeal, stating the following: &ldquo;The Court is satisfied that he has a good and sufficient reason and that the guns are appropriate for the purpose for which they are required. The Court is satisfied that he doesn&rsquo;t take part in practical or dynamic shooting. I am further satisfied that the concerns expressed by the Chief Superintendent on public safety are not enough to deprive the Appellant of his licence, particularly in view of the unexplained 90% who subsequently got their licences on reconsideration&rdquo;. <br \/><br \/>The Judge also states: &ldquo;Arguments about the availability of guns to civilians is a wider political question for the Legislature to address.  This is not a question for the Courts; we can only deal with the law as it is&rdquo;.  <br \/><br \/>&quot;In February 2014,  in Bray District Court, the District Justice granted firearms licensing appeals and directed the relevant Chief Superintendent to issue nine restricted firearm certificates for centre fire handguns. The Judge commented that it was open to the legislature to ban these weapons but in the absence of that, he was allowing all of the appeals.&quot;<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121600078#WRP01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Residency Permits","counter":779,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121600078#WRP01450"},{"type":"question","counter":780,"qnumday":388,"qnumall":"[48412\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121600078#WRP01500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the position regarding residency in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Cork; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":781,"content":"<p>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 283 of 25 November, 2014 (beneath) in respect of the person concerned.

A key element of the Agenda is to strengthen the national pre-school inspection system. This will result in a change of practice in a number of areas relating to pre-school inspections.<br\/><br\/>A number of changes have been made to the Child Care Act 1991 to underpin these reforms. The amended legislation strengthens the current inspection regime and provides a statutory basis for the registration of early years services. The new registration system, which was introduced by the Child and Family Agency on foot of the Child and Family Agency Act, requires that anyone seeking to open an early years service will be required to register with the Agency prior to the facility being opened. The proposed facility will then be inspected to ensure that it meets all the necessary criteria before registration is granted. A similar inspection will be carried out at three year intervals thereafter to ensure continued compliance.<br\/><br\/>The second and separate phase of inspection, which will monitor the child care-related criteria, will be carried out after the service has become operational and children are attending.<br\/><br\/>In addition to the above inspections, the Inspectorate of the Department of Education and Skills has been asked to lead and organise focused inspections of the quality of education provision in the 4,200 early childhood education settings participating in the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme. Early childhood education is a crucial period in the development of young children and a key focus for Government is to promote best outcomes for children participating in the free pre-school programme. These inspections therefore will have a developmental focus looking in particular at the quality of children&rsquo;s learning experiences. <br\/><br\/>To support the childcare sector in improving quality, the National Early Years Quality Support Service - <i>Better Start<\/i>- is being introduced as part of the Early Years Quality Agenda.The <i>Better Start <\/i>programme is a national approach to quality improvement supports.  One element of this, the Early Years Specialist Service, is employing 30 graduates in early childhood care and education who will work directly with services to improve quality, including assisting services in the implementation of the S&iacute;olta Framework and the Aistear Curriculum. <br\/><br\/>It is considered that these initiatives, together with the reforms being implemented under the Early Years Quality Agenda, will provide for a more robust and consistent inspection regime that will address the future needs of the childcare sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121600078#WRP03700","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":814,"qnumday":399,"qnumall":"[47719\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121600078#WRP03800","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"his plans for investing in the early childhood care and education sector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"989","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":815,"content":"<p>Approximately &euro;260m is invested annually by the Government to support the provision of early childhood care and education through three childcare support programmes, the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme, the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme and the Training and Employment Childcare (TEC) programmes.

There are in the region of 4,200 child care providers participating in the programme, providing the free preschool provision to approximately 68,000 children each year.  The programme represents an annual investment of nearly &euro;175m.<\/p><p>  It is currently a requirement of the programme that all the preschool leaders in participating child care services must hold, as a minimum, a qualification at Level 5 on the National Framework of Qualifications of Ireland (NFQ).  A standard weekly capitation fee of &euro;62.50 is paid for each eligible child participating in the ECCE programme in these services.<\/p><p>  A higher capitation fee of &euro;73 for each eligible child is payable to preschool service providers where all the preschool leaders delivering the ECCE programme hold a bachelor degree in childhood\/early education (minimum of Level 7 on the National Framework for Qualifications (NFQ) or equivalent) and have 3 years experience working in the sector, and where all the preschool assistants in the service hold a relevant major award in child care\/early education at Level 5 on the NFQ or its equivalent.<\/p><p>  When a service provider applies for the higher capitation rate, the relevant qualifications are checked in my Department to confirm eligibility.  The ratios and sessions operated within the service must also be checked to ensure that all the ECCE children in the service are benefiting from the higher qualified staff.<\/p><p>  In the academic year 2013\/2014, 1,402 child care services who provided evidence of the qualifications of their staff and who received sanction from this Department were paid the higher capitation rate in accordance with the terms and conditions of the ECCE programme.  Applications for the higher capitation rate for 2014\/2015 are currently being examined by my officials and the numbers sanctioned for the higher payment are expected to be available early next year.<\/p><p>  The higher capitation rate is not payable to services where staff delivering the ECCE programme hold qualifications lower than Level 7 on the NFQ or where the preschool leader holds the Level 7 qualification but the preschool assistant does not hold a Level 5 or higher qualification.<\/p><p>  I wish to advise the Deputy that new qualification requirements are being introduced as part of the ongoing progression of the Early Years Quality Agenda.  This will mean that a minimum Level 5 award on the NFQ in early childhood care and education will be necessary for all staff working in early years services (no requirement currently exists).  It is expected that this requirement will apply from September 2015 in the case of existing services.  In addition, the minimum qualification requirement for preschool leaders delivering the ECCE programme will be increased from a Level 5 award to a Level 6, from the same date.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121600079#WRQ01300","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Youth Services Funding","counter":838,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121600079#WRQ01350"},{"type":"question","counter":839,"qnumday":407,"qnumall":"[47964\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121600079#WRQ01400","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if he will provide a breakdown by county of the funding provided to For&oacute;ige projects; and the amounts allocated to each group in receipt of such funding, in each of the past five years.","asker":"1091","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":840,"content":"<p>My Department administers a range of funding schemes and programmes to support the provision of youth services to young people throughout the country including those from disadvantaged communities.

","asker":"1069","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1064,"content":"<p>I am shocked and distressed by the revelations of extremely poor and unacceptable standards of care and mistreatment of vulnerable residents in &Aacute;ras Attracta. Every person who uses disability services is entitled to expect and receive supports of the highest standard and to live in an atmosphere of safety and care. This is particularly important for vulnerable people in residential care whose families have entrusted them to the care of professional staff. <\/p><p>  The allegations of mistreatment in the Prime Time programme are very disturbing and need to be fully investigated. In that regard, I welcome the immediate response of the HSE, following receipt of these serious allegations, to alert the Garda&iacute; and HIQA and for the protection of both residents and staff themselves, to put a number of staff &lsquo;off-duty&rsquo; while the allegations are being investigated. I am assured that staffing levels are being appropriately maintained to deliver safe care to all residents. <\/p><p>  I also welcome and support the HSE&rsquo;s initiation of both an expert investigation into these serious allegations chaired by Mr Christy Lynch and an independently chaired review of the services provided at this facility, led by Dr Kevin McCoy. <\/p><p>  Mr. Lynch's investigation will examine in particular the practices, behaviours and attitudes of the staff of Unit 3 and will form an important input into the disciplinary process which must be undertaken by the HSE.   <\/p><p>  Dr. McCoy's review will focus on assuring the quality and safety of care of residents in &Aacute;ras Attracta.  This will be informed by earlier work done by both the HSE and HIQA and will seek to identify any gaps and any contributory and\/or causal factors.  It will make recommendations so as to eliminate, in any way it is possible to do so, any risk of harm occurring in the future. <\/p><p>  I understand that the Director General of the HSE has written to all staff informing them that the onus is on them to take personal responsibility to ensure that the individuals supported by the HSE in any setting are treated with dignity and respect. <\/p><p>  The HSE&rsquo;s new National Policy and Procedures for Safeguarding Vulnerable Persons at Risk of Abuse, which I launched with the HSE on 5th December 2014, clears the way for staff members in HSE and non-HSE facilities, and members of the public, to refer allegations of abuse to designated reporting individuals. <\/p><p>  This new policy, places an onus on providers of services to vulnerable people to appoint a Designated Officer to both receive and follow up on concerns and reports of abuse. Under the new policy it is the responsibility of all staff and service providers to ensure the protection and welfare of vulnerable people. In each Community Healthcare Organisation, a Safeguarding and Protection Team will work in partnership with all relevant service providers to ensure that concerns and complaints are addressed. <\/p><p>  This policy complements the statutory inspection by HIQA of nursing homes and residential centres  for people with a disability and is very welcome. I also welcome the public appeal made by the Chief Executive of HIQA to encourage any persons who have concerns about the treatment of vulnerable persons in our disability services to contact HIQA. He has emphasised that the matter will be taken very seriously and looked at in the context of HIQA&rsquo;s very significant regulatory powers of inspection of residential facilities. <\/p><p>  A system wide process is now commencing, with the establishment of a National Implementation Taskforce.

","asker":"1071","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1101,"content":"<p>I am shocked and distressed by the revelations of extremely poor and unacceptable standards of care and mistreatment of vulnerable residents in &Aacute;ras Attracta. Every person who uses disability services is entitled to expect and receive supports of the highest standard and to live in an atmosphere of safety and care. This is particularly important for vulnerable people in residential care whose families have entrusted them to the care of professional staff. <\/p><p>  The allegations of mistreatment in the Prime Time programme are very disturbing and need to be fully investigated. In that regard, I welcome the immediate response of the HSE, following receipt of these serious allegations, to alert the Garda&iacute; and HIQA and for the protection of both residents and staff themselves, to put a number of staff &lsquo;off-duty&rsquo; while the allegations are being investigated. I am assured that staffing levels are being appropriately maintained to deliver safe care to all residents. <\/p><p>  I also welcome and support the HSE&rsquo;s initiation of both an expert investigation into these  serious allegations chaired by Mr Christy Lynch and an independently chaired review of the services provided at this facility, led by Dr Kevin McCoy. <\/p><p>  Mr. Lynch's investigation will examine in particular the practices, behaviours and attitudes of the staff of Unit 3 and will form an important input into the disciplinary process which must be undertaken by the HSE.  <\/p><p>  Dr. McCoy's review will focus on assuring the quality and safety of care of residents in &Aacute;ras Attracta.  This will be informed by earlier work done by both the HSE and HIQA and will seek to identify any gaps and any contributory and\/or causal factors.  It will make recommendations so as to eliminate, in any way it is possible to do so, any risk of harm occurring in the future.  <\/p><p>  I understand that the Director General of the HSE has written to all staff informing them that the onus is on them to take personal responsibility for their actions to ensure that the individuals supported by the HSE in any setting are treated with dignity and respect. <\/p><p>  The HSE&rsquo;s new National Policy and Procedures for Safeguarding Vulnerable Persons at Risk of Abuse, which I launched with the HSE on 5 December 2014, clears the way for staff members in HSE and non-HSE facilities, and members of the public, to refer allegations of abuse to designated reporting individuals. <\/p><p>  This new policy, places an onus on providers of services to vulnerable people to appoint a Designated Officer to both receive and follow up on concerns and reports of abuse. Under the new policy it is the responsibility of all staff and service providers to ensure the protection and welfare of vulnerable people. In each Community Health care Organisation, a Safeguarding and Protection Team will work in partnership with all relevant service providers to ensure that concerns and complaints are addressed. <\/p><p>  This policy complements the statutory inspection by HIQA of nursing homes and residential centres  for people with a disability and is very welcome. I also welcome the public appeal made by the Chief Executive of HIQA to encourage any persons who have concerns about the treatment of vulnerable persons in our disability services to contact HIQA. He has emphasised that the matter will be taken very seriously and looked at in the context of HIQA&rsquo;s very significant regulatory powers of inspection of residential facilities. <\/p><p>  A system wide process is now commencing, with the establishment of a National Implementation Taskforce. A 6 step programme will be implemented and monitored and will focus on implementation of Safeguarding Vulnerable Persons at Risk of Abuse; National  Policy &amp;amp; Procedures; Advocacy; Evaluation and Practice Improvement; National Summit (Tuesday 16 December) to improve Client Safety, Dignity, Respect &amp;amp; Culture Change; implementation plan for any recommendations arising from the assurance review of residential services in &Aacute;ras Attracta when complete; development of long term sustainable &amp;amp; evidence based safeguarding practices and training programmes specific to residential settings; implementation of Safeguarding Vulnerable Persons at Risk of Abuse; national policy &amp;amp; procedures.<\/p><p>  I am not in a position at this early stage to indicate when the HSE will have completed its enquiries into the allegations of mistreatment in &Aacute;ras Attracta.

Every person who uses disability services is entitled to expect and receive supports of the highest standard and to live in an atmosphere of safety and care. This is particularly important for vulnerable people in residential care whose families have entrusted them to the care of professional staff. <br\/><br\/>The allegations of mistreatment in the Prime Time programme are very disturbing and need to be fully investigated. In that regard, I welcome the immediate response of the HSE, following receipt of these serious allegations, to alert the Garda and HIQA and for the protection of both residents and staff themselves, to put a number of staff &lsquo;off-duty&rsquo; while the allegations are being investigated. I am assured that staffing levels are being appropriately maintained to deliver safe care to all residents. <br\/><br\/>I also welcome and support the HSE&rsquo;s initiation of both an expert investigation into these serious allegations chaired by Mr Christy Lynch and an independently chaired review of the services provided at this facility, led by Dr Kevin McCoy. <br\/><br\/>Mr. Lynch's investigation will examine in particular the practices, behaviours and attitudes of the staff of Unit 3 and will form an important input into the disciplinary process which must be undertaken by the HSE.<br\/><br\/>Dr. McCoy's review will focus on assuring the quality and safety of care of residents in &Aacute;ras Attracta.  This will be informed by earlier work done by both the HSE and HIQA and will seek to identify any gaps and any contributory and\/or causal factors.  It will make recommendations so as to eliminate, in any way it is possible to do so, any risk of harm occurring in the future. <br\/><br\/>I understand that the Director General of the HSE has written to all staff informing them that the onus is on them to take personal responsibility to ensure that the individuals supported by the HSE in any setting are treated with dignity and respect. <br\/><br\/>The HSE&rsquo;s new National Policy and Procedures for Safeguarding Vulnerable Persons at Risk of Abuse, which I launched with the HSE on 5th December 2014, clears the way for staff members in HSE and non-HSE facilities, and members of the public, to refer allegations of abuse to designated reporting individuals. <br\/><br\/>This new policy, places an onus on providers of services to vulnerable people to appoint a Designated Officer to both receive and follow up on concerns and reports of abuse. Under the new policy it is the responsibility of all staff and service providers to ensure the protection and welfare of vulnerable people. In each Community Healthcare Organisation, a Safeguarding and Protection Team will work in partnership with all relevant service providers to ensure that concerns and complaints are addressed. <br\/><br\/>This policy complements the statutory inspection by HIQA of nursing homes and residential centres  for people with a disability and is very welcome. I also welcome the public appeal made by the Chief Executive of HIQA to encourage any persons who have concerns about the treatment of vulnerable persons in our disability services to contact HIQA. He has emphasised that the matter will be taken very seriously and looked at in the context of HIQA&rsquo;s very significant regulatory powers of inspection of residential facilities. <br\/><br\/>A system wide process is now commencing, with the establishment of a National Implementation Taskforce.  A 6 step programme will be implemented and monitored and will focus on :<br\/><br\/>- Implementation of Safeguarding Vulnerable Persons at Risk of Abuse  - National  Policy &amp;amp; Procedures<br\/><br\/>- Advocacy<br\/><br\/>- Evaluation and Practice Improvement<br\/><br\/>- National Summit (Tuesday 16 December) - to improve Client Safety, Dignity, Respect &amp;amp; Culture Change<br\/><br\/>- Implementation plan for any recommendations arising from the assurance review of residential services in Aras Attracta when complete<br\/><br\/>- Development of long term sustainable &amp;amp; evidence based safeguarding practices and training programmes specific to residential settings<br\/><br\/>- Implementation of Safeguarding Vulnerable Persons at Risk of Abuse  - NationalPolicy &amp;amp; Procedures <br\/><br\/>I have been fully briefed by the HSE since they became aware of these allegations and I have asked it to ensure that all appropriate resources are put in place to ensure that the safety and care of residents at &Aacute;ras Attracta is maintained at the highest possible standard. I have also asked the HSE to brief me on the outcome of these investigations as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121600084#WRV01000","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Primary Medical Certificates Applications","counter":1146,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121600084#WRV01050"},{"type":"question","counter":1147,"qnumday":512,"qnumall":"[48364\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121600084#WRV01100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of persons who failed the application for the primary medical certificate for each of the past ten years.

The reduction in staff numbers since the start of this Government's term is 9,225 WTEs or 8.7% of the HSE workforce. <br\/><br\/>In order to mitigate the impact on frontline services of the reduction in employment numbers, the priority is to reform how health services are delivered in order to ensure a more productive and cost effective health system.  The revised working arrangements provided for in the Haddington Road Agreement are a pivotal element in this regard. Subject to approval by senior managers, arrangements are in place in the HSE to allow the recruitment of staff where it has been established that there is an urgent service requirement. This has facilitated the recruitment of key grades, allowing a focus on enhanced services in older persons, mental health and disabilities services as well as on primary care. <br\/><br\/>It is important to note on the figures issued that there has been a 9.4% increase in Medical\/Dental numbers and an 8.6% decrease in Management\/Admin numbers.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform announced in the budget that he intended to delegate greater autonomy to Departments and Agencies to manage their own staffing levels.  From 2015 Departments and Agencies will have discretion over staffing levels within the overall framework of their pay budget.  This policy change will give HSE management greater autonomy to manage their own staffing profile.  The change from a rigid employment control framework with a moratorium on recruitment to a focus on achieving the most cost-effective staffing profile within an allocated pay framework will allow for recruitment where it is determined that this can achieve more economical service delivery, such as through the replacement of agency staff by staff on fixed term contracts of employment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121600084#WRV03700","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Residential Institutions","counter":1185,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121600084#WRV03750"},{"type":"question","counter":1186,"qnumday":527,"qnumall":"[48445\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121600084#WRV03800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if it is Government policy that any written allegation of psychological and-or financial abuse of a resident in a Health Service Executive residential unit for persons with disabilities should be recorded and reported as a statistic on Health Information and Quality Authority report arising from the next HIQA inspection following the making of the written allegation.

This is particularly important for vulnerable people in residential care whose families have entrusted them to the care of professional staff.<br\/><br\/>The allegations of mistreatment in the Prime Time programme are very disturbing and need to be fully investigated. In that regard, I welcome the immediate response of the HSE, following receipt of these serious allegations, to alert the Garda&iacute; and HIQA and for the protection of both residents and staff themselves, to put a number of staff &lsquo;off-duty&rsquo; while the allegations are being investigated. I am assured that staffing levels are being appropriately maintained to deliver safe care to all residents.<br\/><br\/>I also welcome and support the HSE&rsquo;s initiation of both an expert investigation into these serious allegations chaired by Mr Christy Lynch and an independently chaired review of the services provided at this facility, led by Dr Kevin McCoy.<br\/><br\/>Mr. Lynch's investigation will examine in particular the practices, behaviours and attitudes of the staff of Unit 3 and will form an important input into the disciplinary process which must be undertaken by the HSE.<br\/><br\/>Dr. McCoy's review will focus on assuring the quality and safety of care of residents in &Aacute;ras Attracta.

Under the new policy it is the responsibility of all staff and service providers to ensure the protection and welfare of vulnerable people. In each Community Healthcare Organisation, a Safeguarding and Protection Team will work in partnership with all relevant service providers to ensure that concerns and complaints are addressed.<br\/><br\/>This policy complements the statutory inspection by HIQA of nursing homes and residential centres  for people with a disability and is very welcome. I also welcome the public appeal made by the Chief Executive of HIQA to encourage any persons who have concerns about the treatment of vulnerable persons in our disability services to contact HIQA. He has emphasised that the matter will be taken very seriously and looked at in the context of HIQA&rsquo;s very significant regulatory powers of inspection of residential facilities.<br\/><br\/>A system wide process is now commencing, with the establishment of a National Implementation Taskforce.

These tasks require extensive engagement with our international partners, including through face-to-face Ministerial meetings.Trade promotion and economic messaging are key elements in all visits abroad undertaken by Government Ministers. Every effort is made to ensure that, as far as is practicable, opportunities are taken for a substantive economic and promotional dimension to all official visits.  An intensive programme of Ministerial-led trade missions is a key commitment in the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Jobs in 2014.  Planning is underway for the programme of trade missions in 2015. It should be noted also that a substantial programme of Ministerial visits will be planned to coincide with St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day celebrations around the world.Between 14 and 19 December, Minister of State Murphy, who has responsibility for European Affairs, will attend the Foreign Affairs, General Affairs and European Councils in Brussels.<br\/><br\/>Next year's plans for all Ministers at my Department are still under development but I expect to travel to New York in late September 2015 to participate in the General Assembly of the United Nations and to address that body on Irish foreign policy priorities.

However, Ireland has a long-standing policy, under successive Governments, of not supporting boycotts or sanctions against Israel, for a number of reasons.   Firstly, we do not believe such measures are likely to prove effective and would only lessen any influence either Ireland or the EU could exert on Israel to alter its policies in relation to the continuing occupation. It would also marginalise Ireland&rsquo;s voice in discussing Middle East policy within the EU and elsewhere, which is one of the main ways in which we can seek to help the Palestinian people.<\/p><p>  Secondly, Ireland exists within a large free trade area in the EU. It would not be possible for us to exclude products legally available in the EU, and it is clear that there is no possibility whatever of obtaining agreement at EU level on a trade ban. Finally, although this is a minor point, it is worth noting that trade between Ireland and Israel is very much in our favour, so any disruption of this would impact largely on Irish employers, workers and consumers, rather than Israeli.<\/p><p>  Ireland therefore supports normal trade access for Israeli goods and services to the EU single market, consistent with the treatment of other countries with which the EU has trade and political agreements (many of whom are also the subject of serious human rights concerns). However, Ireland has argued successfully that any rights granted to Israel under these agreements cannot be applied to Israeli settlements in Palestinian territory, and in response the EU has acted in a number of ways to give effect to its disapproval of, and long standing position of opposition to, illegal Israeli settlements:<\/p><p>Goods from settlements are excluded from the low tariff rates applied to Israeli goods.<\/p><p>EU funding may not be disbursed to Israeli entities based in settlements.<\/p><p>  Ireland and a number of EU Member States have recently published advice to citizens and businesses against investing in, or engaging in any form of economic activity with, settlements.<\/p><p>  Ireland is pressing for the adoption of EU-wide guidelines on labelling of settlement products, which will enable consumers to identify settlement goods and make their own decision about whether they wish to purchase them. If preparation of EU guidelines becomes stalled, then we will actively look at issuing our own national guidelines.<\/p><p>  Ireland remains a strong and consistent critic of Israeli policies relating to the occupation, and in particular those connected with the construction of settlements on Palestinian land. We have stated repeatedly that we do not consider that the international community has been sufficiently active in combating these policies. We are a consistent voice within the EU in particular calling for stronger action.<\/p><p>  In regards your constituent&rsquo;s view that we should expel the Israeli Ambassador, every Irish Foreign Minister is regularly called upon to expel the Israeli Ambassador, although such a suggestion is almost never made in relation to other representatives. There are many states around the world in relation to which Ireland has serious human rights concerns.  Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy has always been based above all on the resolution of conflict by dialogue. We do not therefore respond to crises by expelling the interlocutor, except in very exceptional circumstances. In diplomatic language, expelling an Ambassador essentially means you are no longer interested, at least for the moment, in dialogue.<\/p><p>  Ambassadors exist to allow clear communication between Governments, and are more necessary in bad times than in good. The Government have continually conveyed our views to the Israeli Government through the Ambassador here, or the Irish Ambassador in Tel Aviv. The corollary of course would be the recall or expulsion of our Ambassador in Israel, and the crippling of our own Embassy. Our Ambassador in Israel, as well as communicating our views to the Israeli government, reported regularly to me on the Israeli view of and politics relating to the crisis, and was also personally engaged in the evacuation of Irish citizens and their families from Gaza.  For all of these reasons, no Irish Government has felt it would be a helpful response to act in this manner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121600085#WRW02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"An Fhoireann Rannach","counter":1226,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121600085#WRW02650"},{"type":"question","counter":1227,"qnumday":541,"qnumall":"[48375\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121600085#WRW02700","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"an bhfuil ini&uacute;chadh d&eacute;anta f&oacute;s ar na poist agus na r&eacute;ims&iacute; oibre ina mbeidh st&aacute;tseirbh&iacute;sigh at&aacute; inni&uacute;il sa Bh&eacute;arla agus sa Ghaeilge ag teast&aacute;il, de r&eacute;ir mar a thug an Roinn Caiteachais Phoibl&iacute; agus Athch&oacute;irithe treoir don Roinn a dh&eacute;anamh; m&aacute; t&aacute; an t-ini&uacute;chadh d&eacute;anta, cad &eacute; l&iacute;on agus cad iad c&eacute;imeanna na bpost at&aacute; i gceist; c&eacute;n l&iacute;on de na poist sin a bhfuil duine leis an gcumas cu&iacute; Gaeilge agus B&eacute;arla ann cheana f&eacute;in; c&eacute;n plean at&aacute; ann chun na poist eile a l&iacute;onadh le daoine a bhfuil na c&aacute;il&iacute;ochta&iacute; cu&iacute; acu; c&eacute;n ch&aacute;il&iacute;ocht Gaeilge at&aacute; riachtanach do na poist sin; agus an nd&eacute;anfaidh s&eacute; r&aacute;iteas ina thaobh.

Our programme and our development policy are centrally based on our commitment to the Millennium Development Goals, which were adopted by world leaders at the UN in 2000 and which set out clear targets in the fight to end poverty and hunger in the world.  Our commitment has been recognised internationally, and Ireland has been asked by the UN to co-facilitate the negotiations next year on the new framework for global development to succeed the MDGs after 2015. The OECD has recognised in recent weeks in the peer review of Ireland's aid programme that &quot;Ireland continues to excel in the delivery of effective aid&quot;.  Our commitment to development cooperation is clear in the Programme for Government and was further enhanced by the launch of our policy for international development - <i>One World One Future.  <\/i>The policy sets out our vision for a sustainable and just world in which people are empowered to overcome poverty and hunger and to fully realise their rights and potential.  <i>One World One Future<\/i>has a clear focus on the poorest countries and communities in sub-Saharan Africa and sets out three goals: reduced hunger and stronger resilience; sustainable development and inclusive economic growth; and better governance, human rights and accountability.  It provides a clear framework for the prioritisation of activities and for the allocation of resources across six priority areas for action deriving from those goals.  These areas are closely aligned with the objectives of the Millennium Development Goals.<br\/><br\/>In the context of the very difficult economic circumstances facing the country, the Government has successfully managed to stabilise allocations to Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme.  For Budget 2015, we were again determined to protect the aid programme, and we have provided a total allocation of just over &euro;600 million for next year.  This clearly demonstrates our commitment to the aid programme and represents a very significant and generous contribution on behalf of the people of Ireland to assist those less fortunate than ourselves.

Section 49 of the Education and Training Boards Act 2013 sets out the procedures to be followed, which are summarised as follows:<br\/><br\/>1. The Chief Executive prepares and submits a proposal in writing to the Board that the Board should borrow for the purposes of carrying out the board&rsquo;s functions.<br\/><br\/>2. The Board considers the proposal and then, if it is decided in principle that the proposal should be accepted, seeks the consent of the Minister for Education and Skills.<br\/><br\/>3.

Responses to a survey conducted in 2012 was disappointing and does not lend itself to comparisons with the returns received in respect of 2013.<br\/><br\/>My Department will continue to request information on book rental schemes from first and second level schools annually. The information requested by the Deputy in respect of the 2014\/2015 school year is not yet available. However, the information will be available in the first quarter of 2015.<br\/><br\/>As the Deputy is aware Budget 2014 provided funding of &euro;5 million for three years to support the establishment of book rental schemes in primary schools that did not operate such schemes. DEIS schools will receive &euro;150 per child and non-DEIS schools will receive &euro;100 per child in seed capital to establish book rental schemes.<br\/><br\/>This will cost approximately &euro;6.7million of the &euro;15 million secured over the three year period, the balance of &euro;8.3 million will be divided in 2015 and 2016 among primary schools that currently operate book rental schemes. Every primary school has now been given the opportunity to benefit from the funding secured for the School Book Rental Scheme.<br\/><br\/>The existing &euro;15million already provided in book grants to all primary and post-primary in the Free Education Scheme will continue to be paid in 2015.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121600086#WRX03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Travel","counter":1302,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121600086#WRX03650"},{"type":"question","counter":1303,"qnumday":567,"qnumall":"[48030\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121600086#WRX03700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if she will provide details of all official foreign trips she and Ministers of State in her Department plan to take before the end of 2015; if she will provide the persons she and Ministers of State in her Department will meet on these trips; the purpose of the trip; the duration of the trip; if there are plans to use all of these trips to promote Ireland as a good place for doing business and as a destination for foreign direct investment; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":1304,"content":"<p>At this stage, there are currently no overseas trips planned between now and the end of 2015 for either myself or Minister of State, Damien English T.D.<br\/><br\/>However during the course of the year there will be three meetings of the Education Council which will require Ministerial attendance.

The objective of the Regulations is to protect ground and surface waters, including drinking water sources, primarily through the management of livestock manures and other fertilisers. <\/p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s Nitrates Action Programme (NAP) was extensively reviewed in 2013\u00a0by an expert group, jointly chaired by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  The expert group also reviewed the submissions received under the public consultation component of the review process.  The expert group also considered the EPA's review of the NAP and the scientific findings of Teagasc's Agricultural Catchments Programme.  The expert group made recommendations to the Minister for\u00a0the Environment, Community and Local Government and suggested measures to be included in Ireland&rsquo;s third Nitrates Action Programme. <\/p><p>  As recommended by the expert review group, the Nitrates Regulations were amended to require that new storage facilities for soiled water being provided on a holding on or after 1 January 2015 shall equal or exceed the capacity required to store all soiled water likely to arise on the holding during a period of 15 days.  The period since the making of the regulations in February 2014 allowed for the completion of storage facilities in the planning process or in the course of construction.  There are currently no plans to extend this requirement to existing storage facilities. <\/p><p>  In relation to the review group's recommendation regarding bovine access to waters, the EPA has approved funding under their STRIVE research programme for an extensive study assessing the impact of measures that prevent cattle access to watercourses.  This research is due to commence in 2015 and will inform the next review of the NAP. <\/p><p>  Specified closed periods for the spreading of fertilisers, including slurry, are a key aspect of the Nitrates Regulations.  They are a requirement of the Nitrates Directive and mandatory in every Member State.\u00a0 The purpose of closed periods is to protect ground and surface water bodies, including drinking water sources, by prohibiting the application of fertilisers when such application poses an unacceptable risk to waters. <\/p><p>  The closed periods in Ireland were decided following an extensive consultation and were discussed with farming bodies and the European Commission at the time.  The findings of Teagasc's Agricultural Catchments Programme support the efficacy of the closed season.  As recommended by the expert review group, there have been no changes to the prohibition on the application of fertilisers during the closed winter months. <\/p><p>  The Nitrates Action Programme will be reviewed again in 2017.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121600088#WRZ01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Leader Programmes Administration","counter":1388,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121600088#WRZ01050"},{"type":"question","counter":1389,"qnumday":596,"qnumall":"[47700\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121600088#WRZ01100","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will confirm that the local community development committees are legally obliged, under the Local Government Reform Act 2014, to submit an expression of interest to prepare a local development strategy and to become a local action group for Leader 2014-2020.

Earl ier this year, my Department also met with a number of private homeowners whose homes are similarly affected by cracking in the blockwork.

My Department has not been made aware of other dwellings affected by structural problems in the blockwork in County Mayo.   <\/p><p>  While I fully appreciate and acknowledge the extremely difficult and distressing situations that householders have to deal with when faced with the consequences of the use of defective materials or poor workmanship, building defects are, in general, matters for resolution between the contracting parties involved, i.e. the owner, the builder, the manufacturer, supplier, quarry owner and\/or their respective insurers.  In the event that the contracting parties cannot reach a settlement by negotiation the option of seeking redress in the Courts can be considered.

However, the provisions of the Act apply only to dwellings affected by significant damage attributable to pyritic heave consequent on the presence of reactive pyrite in the subfloor hardcore material and not to damage arising in any other circumstance.  The Pyrite Resolution Board has no powers to investigate the alleged use of defective blocks in the construction of the houses in County Mayo and I have no proposals to amend the Act in this regard.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121600088#WRZ01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1092"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Assistance Payments Administration","counter":1401,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121600088#WRZ01950"},{"type":"question","counter":1402,"qnumday":601,"qnumall":"[47096\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121600088#WRZ02000","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"when he envisages the housing assistance payment scheme being extended nationwide; the progress made to date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1001","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":1403,"content":"<p>The implementation of the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) is a key Government priority and a major pillar of the <i>Social Housing Strategy 2020<\/i>, which I published on the 26 November last.

This builds on practical experience , over many years, in the local government sector of local authorities co-operating in the performance of functions and the delivery of services, including on a regional basis.  To drive the reform agenda, and in particular shared service initiatives, in the local government sector, a dedicated Programme Management Office (PMO) has been established which reports to a high-level Oversight Group. The roll out of shared services and process improvements across the sector is supported by the use of shared expertise, a shared technical infrastrucutre supported by the Local Government Management Agency and a singular local government web portal. <br\/><br\/>Overall, 31 operational areas have been identified for examination for potential as a shared service or other collaborative approach that may provide efficiencies. The PMO has adopted a comprehensive methodology for the development and evaluation of projects including gathering and analysing baseline data, business case preparation and peer review of business cases. <br\/><br\/>Payroll\/Superannuation, Building Control, Treasury Management, Procurement and Accounts Payable have been prioritised in the shared services programme in the short to medium term and the programme is being progressed using a lead authority model.

As a State we have ambitious targets for 16% of our energy from renewable sources by 2020 through meeting 40% of electricity demand from renewable sources, with 10% renewables in transport and 12% in heat. The National Competitiveness Council report correctly states that in the event of a shortfall against our 2020 targets, the Exchequer would incur significant costs in order to comply with our obligations under EU law.    Analysis undertaken by my Department, the SEAI, EirGrid and the Commission for Energy Regulation assessed the costs and value of choosing the path towards 40% renewable electricity generation in 2020, compared to a scenario where renewable electricity remained at 2013 levels. This analysis informed a report which is expected to be published shortly. <\/p><p>  The REFIT schemes underpin the development of a range of renewable electricity technologies. The current REFIT 2 and 3 schemes remain open for applications until the end of 2015. To date, onshore wind energy has been the most cost effective renewable technology in the Irish electricity market, contributing most towards the achievement of the 2020 target. My response to Question No. 7 on 23 October 2014 further reinforces the value of wind energy to our economy.<\/p><p>  The cost effectiveness of support for renewables is a central concern in the work now underway in my Department to consider the appropriateness and design of a new support scheme for renewable electricity, to be available from 2016. Any scheme would be subject to the new EU rules on State Aid adopted by the European Commission earlier this year. The commercial success of onshore wind means that we are now at the point where a gradual move to a more market based support for the technology is appropriate. Taking account of developments in EU electricity market integration, my Department will be engaging with stakeholders in this work, a key component of which will be consideration of the available technologies, their cost effectiveness and the level of any support required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121600089#WRAA02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Meetings","counter":1469,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121600089#WRAA02550"},{"type":"question","counter":1470,"qnumday":624,"qnumall":"[47855\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121600089#WRAA02600","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 570 of 26 November 2014, the reason his Department failed to mention Management Advisory Council meetings held on a weekly basis with him; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

I have no statutory function in the setting or review of electricity prices. Responsibility for electricity and gas market regulation is a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), which is an independent statutory body.  Comprehensive data on fossil fuel prices is available in the recently published <i>Energy in Ireland 1990-2013 <\/i>report. This is published by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) and is available on their website.<br\/><br\/>At a national level, electricity and gas prices are no longer regulated by CER. The competitive energy market results in choices for consumers and businesses in terms of suppliers, products and prices and exerts downward pressure on prices.<br\/><br\/>The reduction in wholesale gas prices since the beginning of 2014 has led to reductions in the wholesale electricity price. These reductions should have a knock on impact on retail prices and are reflected in the latest Eurostat figures, published by the SEAI on the 9<sup><\/sup>December 2014 in their report <i>Electricity and Gas Prices in Ireland<\/i>. The report shows that all business consumption bands in both electricity and gas experienced reductions in average prices in the first half of 2014, ranging from 0.7% to 4% in electricity and 6.7% to 12.9% in gas. <br\/><br\/>Similarly, Eurostat figures show a reduction of 5.7% in the average price of gas in the residential consumption band with the largest share of the market, while the average price of electricity in the residential consumption band with the largest share experienced a reduction of 1.3%.<br\/><br\/>Consumers can try to mitigate electricity and gas prices by shopping around to get the best possible price and service deal from suppliers and I would encourage them to do so. Measures such as comparison websites, approved by the CER, exist to assist them in this endeavour.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121600090#WRBB00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Wind Energy Generation","counter":1496,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121600090#WRBB00350"},{"type":"question","counter":1497,"qnumday":634,"qnumall":"[48446\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121600090#WRBB00400","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if he will reconsider his Department's approach to a wind energy project (details supplied) and its application for entry to the REFIT scheme in view of the necessity of the scheme's support for the project's viability; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"999","askee":"1024"},{"type":"speech","counter":1498,"content":"<p>The proposal referenced by the Deputy is for a project with wind turbines physically located in Ireland but connecting to the electricity grid in Northern Ireland.<\/p><p>  The objective of the REFIT 2 scheme in Ireland is to incentivise the development of renewable electricity generation for connection to the electricity grid in Ireland.

Prior to the recent change, this offence involved a direct summons to court and the assignment of 5 penalty points on conviction. The provisions in the 2014 Act brought this offence within the fixed charge notice system. An alleged offender will now be issued with a fixed charge notice and, on payment of the &euro;60 charge, will have 3 penalty points assigned to their licence. The driver will, of course, continue to have the option of going to court where 5 points will still apply on conviction.<\/p><p>  Enforcement of the relevant legislation is a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.\u00a0If a person&rsquo;s NCT test date is imminent, it will be a matter for the Garda to use their discretion. However, responsibility rests with owners and users of vehicles to ensure their vehicles are in compliance with the law.<\/p><p>  I understand from the Road Safety Authority that, last week, the NCTS experienced its highest demand ever for tests with the call centre answering over 63,000 calls.

If\u00a0a person is in need of an early test\u00a0they should follow the advice on the\u00a0NCTS website which clearly advises customers, if they cannot obtain a suitable slot online, to contact the NCTS call centre directly on (01) 413 5992.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121600090#WRBB03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1007"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sports Capital Programme Eligibility","counter":1545,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121600090#WRBB03650"},{"type":"question","counter":1546,"qnumday":649,"qnumall":"[47955\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121600090#WRBB03700","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 575 of 18 November 2014, if he will provide the detailed rationale for categorising a club (details supplied) in County Wicklow as one of the 11 organisations deemed invalid for the sports capital programme funding by virtue of being a private and\/or commercial organisation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1107","askee":"1007"},{"type":"speech","counter":1547,"content":"<p>The application from the club referred to by the Deputy was deemed to be invalid on the grounds that it was considered to be a private club.\u00a0\u00a0The club\u00a0had restrictions on membership as outlined on their website\u00a0and these were deemed to make the club a private club.<br\/><br\/>All aspects of the operation of the Sports Capital Programme are currently being reviewed in preparation for the 2015 round of the Programme.\u00a0 If the club have any suggestions on the operation of the\u00a0Programme or any queries on how their application under the 2014 Programme was assessed they can of course\u00a0contact the Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121600090#WRBB03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1074"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1548,"content":"<p>Question No. 650 answered with Question No. 648.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Tolls","counter":1549,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121600090#WRBB04050"},{"type":"question","counter":1550,"qnumday":651,"qnumall":"[47979\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121600090#WRBB04100","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the annual levels of commuter and commercial traffic that have used the N25 Waterford city bypass toll bridge since it opened in 2009 to date in 2014; and the total revenue raised by these tolls each year over that period.","asker":"1091","askee":"1007"},{"type":"speech","counter":1551,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, as Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport,\u00a0I have overall responsibility for\u00a0 policy and funding in relation to the national roads programme.
