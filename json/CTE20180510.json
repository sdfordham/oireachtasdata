We will proceed to correspondence.  There are three categories of correspondence.  The first is briefing documents and opening statements.<\/p><p>No. 1271A is correspondence received from Mr. Robert Watt, Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, dated 10 May, providing briefing for the meeting which was scheduled for today but has been postponed until a later date.  We note that.  No. 1288A is from Mr. Kieran Breen, director of the State Claims Agency, enclosing his opening statement for today's meeting.  That is noted.  No. 1290A is from Mr. Jim Breslin, Secretary General of the Department of Health, enclosing his opening statement for today's meeting.  That is noted.<\/p><p> Category B is correspondence from Accounting Officers and-or Ministers and follow up to Committee of Public Accounts meetings and other items for publishing.  No. 1266B is correspondence received from Mr. Niall Cody, chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, dated 1 May 2018, providing a note on non-resident high wealth cases and how the Revenue Commissioners monitor their compliance with residency rules.  We note that.  No. 1268B is from Mr. John O'Sullivan, Commissioner of Valuation, dated 2 May 2018, providing information on the failed tender process to procure external services for the proposed independent review of the Reval 2017 projects.  That is noted.  No. 1272B is from Mr. Derek Moran, Secretary General of the Department of Finance, dated 3 May 2018, providing additional information as requested at the meeting of 19 April 2018, including an explanatory note on the different models for measuring of national output and income, that is, gross domestic product, GDP, gross national product, GNP, gross national income, GNI and modified gross national interest, GNI*, an update on the Apple escrow fund, Ireland's contribution to the EU budget and components of the national debt figure.  That is noted.  No. 1273 is from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, dated 3 May 2018, providing information on funding and governance models of Benefacts.  It was very interesting and I noted that.<\/p><p> Category C is correspondence from and relating to private individuals and any other correspondence.  Nos. 1265 and 1274C, are correspondence received from an individual regarding allegations against Novartis.  We dealt with this matter last year and wrote to the Department of Health on the matter.  A reply from the Secretary General stated that the information had been forwarded to the Health Products Regulatory Authority, the Medical Council and the HSE.  I suggest that we write back to the Department for an update.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  Nos. 1279C and 1282C are from Mr. Ray Mitchell, assistant national director at the HSE, dated 9 May.  In the first item he states that Mr. Tony O'Brien, director general of the HSE is not in a position to attend today&rsquo;s meeting.  Obviously, this has been superseded so we will move on.  No. 1280C is from Deputy Cullinane in regard to Mr. Tony O'Brien.  Again that has been superseded.<\/p><p> No. 1281C is from Deputy MacSharry, dated 2 May 2018, in regard to a case against Department of Finance on liquidation of Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC.  We discussed this briefly last week and are formally noting it now.  We will discuss it in private later.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p><p> No. 1283C, dated 9 May 2018, is from Ms Geraldine Finn of the National Cancer Registry stating that the director, Professor Kerri Clough-Gorr, is not in a position to attend today&rsquo;s meeting as requested as she is out of the country.  Can we note this item?  It is noted.  I spoke with the National Cancer Registry and was told she was out of the country.  I asked if there was anyone else it could put forward and it said there was no one else and that if we wanted to correspond with it, we could do so.  I explained that being present today would be far more beneficial, given the dynamic of the situation and the topic but the organisation is not in a position to send somebody.  The director general is away, which is noted and is of concern.  I note that we have now made the decision to bring the National Cancer Register in next week, so it has enough notice to send somebody forward.<\/p><p> Item No. 4 is statements and accounts received since the last meeting.  One account and statement has been received from the Irish Film Board and it has a clear audit opinion.  Can we note this?  It is noted.<\/p><p> We will move on to the work programme.  The secretariat circulated a note regard to our upcoming meeting with the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, and a copy of the committee's draft discussion document on corporation tax.  The committee will have to agree on the report and I propose we meet in private session to finalise the report the week after next.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018051000002#B01500","speaker":"1349","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525939200,"counter":21,"content":"<p>On the work programme, we agreed to have a session with Cork Institute of Technology, University College Cork and the Higher Education Authority.

That was a systemic decision taken by the HSE.  Mr. O'Brien is responsible for systemic decisions taken within his organisation.  The real scandal here was the response to that systemic failure and that women were not told.  Mr. O'Brien has heard that Ms Mhic Mhath&uacute;na was on \"Morning Ireland\" this morning.  It was very harrowing interview.  This is a woman who had to tell her five children that she is going to die.  Obviously she is very emotional.  She told Teachta Mary Lou McDonald, who raised this issue in the D&aacute;il yesterday, that she is more angry than she is worried about her death.  It is a very personal tragedy for her.<\/p> <p>  Ms Mhic Mhath&uacute;na was told in 2013 that her smear test was normal.  Three years later, following a routine smear test, she was diagnosed with cervical cancer.  The audit of the 2013 result showed that, in Ms Mhic Mhath&uacute;na's case, the first indications of cancer were already there.  She was never told.  It was the same for Vicky Phelan and Irene Teap.  We also heard from Stephen Teap.  I would imagine it was the same for many more women.  Ms Mhic Mhath&uacute;na, Ms Phelan and Mr. Teap have all asked Mr. O'Brien to resign because, unlike him, they understand accountability and that this was a systemic failure.<\/p> <p>  The reason Mr. O'Brien is paid the salary he is paid is because the buck stops with him.  He is responsible for systemic failures.  That is why he is in this position, why the post carries a heavy responsibility and why he is on the salary he is on.  He is responsible for the actions of the corporate body of the HSE.  I will say one more thing and then I will let Mr. O'Brien come back in.<\/p><p>Mr. O'Brien yesterday described the director general as the one person who must be personally accountable for every failure or mistake of 140,000 individuals who work in the health service and stated that that is not the basis for accountability.  Nobody is asking Mr. O'Brien to be personally accountable for the actions of 140,000 individuals.  We ask him to be accountable for a clear and systemic failure in the HSE not to communicate that information to 208 women who today are very angry.  The failure to communicate is not the only matter that is causing hysteria.  The hysteria has been caused by the systemic failures in Mr. O'Brien's organisation.  The fact that, even today, Mr. O'Brien does not recognise that there were systemic failures and that he should take responsibility for that rings alarm bells for me.  There is no doubt that Vicky Phelan, Emma Mhic Mhath&uacute;na and Stephen Teap are correct that Mr. O'Brien should step down.  That would be the first step in he and the HSE taking accountability for systemic failures, although not responsibility for the actions of individuals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018051000002#G04200","speaker":"1258","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525939200,"counter":108,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Cullinane for correctly identifying that the central issue is the process of audit and the failure to communicate the outcomes of those audits to the individuals in whose cases it was found that, in retrospect, a different test result should have been given.

We understand that screening gives indications.  When one gets an indication of something that requires further scrutiny, one is referred on.

The failure to communicate only arose after the diagnosis of cancer because it was that diagnosis which triggered the review that was subsequently not communicated.<\/p> <p>  I am advised by treating clinicians that receiving knowledge of a prior false negative after a person has been diagnosed and is in treatment would not change the course of that treatment.

As part of the review by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, we will get details of what has transpired in respect of this other cohort of women.  Over a number of years, CervicalCheck attempted to ensure these figures were consistent and correlated.  Obviously, it failed.  In what aspect did it fail?

Okay.  Nobody is being held accountable.  This is a problem for me.  I will finish on this thread if I can.  I want to put on the record a communication that was received by Dr. Keith Swanick, who is also a Member of the Oireachtas, from one of his colleagues.  It reads:<\/p><blockquote>How can you and your colleagues stand over the cervical controversy?  We [a GP surgery] are inundated with requests for smears, with no formal guidance even how to process them, how to claim remuneration.  We cannot offer any form of reassurance to any patient, so all smears need to be repeated.  Can we trust the results of the repeated smears?  What labs will they be sent to?<\/blockquote> <p>I think this captures for me the reality here.  Mr. O'Brien has taken no action against any member of staff.  He has admitted he was not told things when he should have been.  We know there were system failures.  In calling for Mr. O'Brien's resignation, I have to say it may well go to Ministers, taoisigh and the head of the State Claims Agency for further calls of resignation.  Mr. O'Brien and the Ministers are commentators on a national crisis.  We have no leaders.  That is crystal clear.  Mr. O'Brien has admitted that no action has been taken against anybody.  There is nobody accountable.  Three weeks into the crisis, Mr. O'Brien is not even in a position to tell us who was supposed to tell him but did not do so.  There is a policy of sitting back and letting everything take its course.  The people and accountability come last.<\/p><p>The problem is that all of those here, most of the political establishment and it seems the Government served the system, not the people.

Where is the process between the HSE and the States Claims Agency in that regard?  I do not see it.  It is as if there are two parallel universes.

What is that based on?  Is it based on clinical knowledge?  Without knowing what the actual rate should be, how can he read a memo in his position and make that assumption?<\/p> <p>  In the data reconciliation process, the two-way data does not seem to have been transferred from the National Cancer Registry, in this case to the CervicalCheck people.  It seems that when the audit process started, for the first two years the audit data were used for education and training purposes and they were only used for patient purposes subsequently.  There is a definite swing to a focus on academia, education and data, rather than the patient.  We spoke last week on this.  There is an issue when one does not have clinicians in positions of management.  If a clinician was in charge, I firmly believe patients' needs would have been to the fore.<\/p> <p>  Mr. O'Brien talked about there not being a joined-up process when the systems kicked in.  That is a very serious admission to make because it says that the process did not work when it kicked off.  If Mr. O'Brien is admitting that the HSE cannot even communicate in a joined-up way to serve a population the equivalent to that of Manchester, he is admitting that it is not fit for purpose.  Mr. O'Brien also spoke about the corporate knowledge of the team.  I agree that just firing everybody who was in charge would get us nowhere but the way the corporate management team did its business does not seem to be the gold standard.  I am not sure how much value its corporate knowledge is; can Mr. O'Brien elaborate on this?<\/p> <p>  It is extremely strange that it is not as simple as putting a reference number into a sheet and pulling up a memo or a circular.  If the memo is not to hand, it appears as though no one can get it for Mr. O'Brien.  As for Mr. Breslin not knowing whether he got the memo, how does the Department get memos?  Where does it put them?  Does it put them in a box in a corner?  What way is it to run a business when it is not known how to find a memo or who definitively crafted a circular?  Surely, if someone writes a circular there is a reference number showing who did it.  I cannot understand this.<\/p> <p>  One reason for not having a statutory inquiry immediately was to avoid a pause in delving into things but Mr. O'Brien told me on a couple of occasions that a matter was for the scoping inquiry.  That, however, is exactly what this committee, as well as members of Opposition parties who met the Minister, did not want.  We did not want the answer to be that you could not talk about it because there was going to be a scoping inquiry or a statutory inquiry.<\/p> <p>  I ask Mr. O'Brien to say how he deemed himself qualified to read a memo and make an assessment that it was reassuring and did not raise alarm bells.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018051000002#Q02500","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525939200,"counter":560,"content":"<p>The memo was the product of work that was done in the CervicalCheck programme, which has an external quality assurance, QA, committee, with significant international representation.

In 2007, having previously been director of BreastCheck, I became the first chief executive of the National Cancer Screening Service board.  That board was created to continue with BreastCheck, to seek to roll out what had been a fledgling, regionally-based Irish cervical cancer screening programme from about 1996, which had not rolled out at that point, and to begin the investigative process around the development of BowelScreen.  At the time I was very pleased to be given that opportunity because as early as 1993, when I was chief executive of the Irish Family Planning Association, I had participated in a lobbying exercise to seek to win Government policy.  I hope I played some small part in the development of the pilot programme in Limerick.  That programme in Limerick, 12 years on, had not achieved all that it could.  We were having as many smear tests taken in this country without a cervical programme, probably more than we do now with an organised programme, and it had made absolutely no difference to the incidence of cervical cancer.  Women were waiting up to a year in some instances for results.  One could not roll out a screening programme on that basis.  Some of those tests were being done on kitchen tables at home on overtime in non-quality assured circumstances.<\/p> <p>  The priority was to ensure that this country got a cervical screening programme to minimise the incidence of, and reduce deaths from, cervical cancer.  This programme has brought down the incidence by 7% per year.  There have been 50,000 high grade detections of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, CIN, which is a pre-cancerous abnormality of the cervix, and I am absolutely certain that one of the best day's work I ever did was to ensure that this county had a national cervical screening programme that is currently called CervicalCheck.

I will quote Mr. Breen.  He said: <\/p><blockquote>I personally sat on the medical negligence working group in 2010.  We advocated PPOs, periodic payment orders, legislation.  We advocated pre-action protocol.  If we had the pre-action protocol tomorrow, I know that myself and my colleague [Jenny, who was with Mr. Breen at the time] would say it would transform the behaviour and way we would handle these cases.  It has been in the UK for a very long time and what it does is it stops the adversarial element.  People do not have to issue proceedings, simply a letter of claim.  We then issue a letter in response to that and the idea is that you narrow down the issues to the issues that are real between you and that you mediate them.<\/blockquote> <p>I can tell the Chairman that I have advocated this position for a very long time.  Despite the fact the Legal Services Regulation Act has brought that into place, subject to the making of the regulations, we do not have it even now.  It would be of considerable assistance to us if we had it tomorrow.  We still do not have it because that section of the Act has not been commenced or implemented.

The main issue is that there does not appear to be a process within the HSE, or one that Oireachtas Members have been made aware of through the various avenues open to us, including parliamentary questions, to determine whether there is some form of sanction, retraining or at least awareness building in respect of these issues within the medical profession, including for doctors, nurses and care staff.

Should the committee consider writing to the Medical Council to seek a direct example of the processes it goes through to deal with medical personnel who are the subject to medical negligence cases and an outline of its role and follow-up activity with them?

From what I am hearing, some general information would be enormously helpful as to what women should do and what advice doctors should give them.

If that advice is out there, it may not be as prominent as it should be.  Women have asked me who they should talk to and if they should have another smear test.

This is based on our knowledge of what that particular case involves, whether there are issues regarding liability, for example, and what we think is the most likely outcome in the case.  Sometimes in any individual case, it can be an incremental process.  In other words, as we gather more information and we get more expert reports, it then might become clearer to us as to what the injuries and losses are.  One problem we sometimes face is that when we are well developed in a case, on the day before trial we might be furnished with a schedule of special damages in respect of something we did not anticipate.

Perhaps ten years ago, we had case after case involving parents who went to the courts because they could not get appropriate education for their children.  In response to a parliamentary question, I was advised that over a period of three years &euro;20 million was spent on legal fees, effectively fighting parents in the courts.  Systems were subsequently put in place to make provision in schools for education, whether it was mainstream, special needs or whatever.  At that point, we stopped seeing so many cases going through the courts.  There was some degree of learning, albeit after parents had gone through quite a torrid time.<\/p> <p>  Every week now, we see people coming out of court.  Parents make the point that although the money will look after the child for the rest of his or her life, nothing will repair the damage.  It strikes me that the lack of services - not just open disclosure - prompts some of the cases because people feel that the services will not provide for their needs.  Has any evaluation done as to what might be the best outcome for people in circumstances where a failure occurs?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018051000002#GG00200","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525939200,"counter":865,"content":"<p>I might answer in the context of the litigation we have.  I agree with the Deputy.  I say at the outset, quite genuinely, that we do not pursue anybody through the courts.  We try, wherever possible, to settle these cases by way of mediation to avoid that court process.  Going back to the pre-action protocol, it would be a considerable advantage if we had that to avoid all of this.<\/p> <p>  To come back to a catastrophically injured victim, whether it is a child or adult, there is little doubt that when we are evaluating the overall cost of that, the largest item is the cost of future care - for example, aids, appliances, assistive technology and things like that.  The allegation that will always be made by the plaintiffs in those actions is that the current level of services will not support the kind of care that they need.  We have had some very fruitful discussions - they are ongoing - with the HSE on this particular issue about catastrophic injury cases and putting in place some kind of care packages more quickly outside the litigation process, which would be of assistance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018051000002#GG00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Breen"},{"type":"speech","time":1525939200,"counter":866,"content":"<p>Right-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018051000002#GG00400","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1525939200,"counter":867,"content":"<p>Sorry, Dr. Crowley wishes to answer the question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018051000002#GG00500","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525939200,"counter":868,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for the question on why it has taken so long.  It is a reasonable question.  The policy that was produced in 2013 was based on the pilot in the two hospitals, Cork University Hospital and the Mater.  The idea was that when bringing something new in, there would be some resistance to it.  Potentially, people would have to change their practices.  We want people to openly disclose.  We have evidence that it was not happening.  The pilots were to prove to people that we could do it, that there was no threat in it and that it was something which people involved welcomed once they had done it.<\/p> <p>  We based the policy on that experience.  We then disseminated the policy and guidelines widely, once they were written, in 2013.  So they were then available.  However, because this is such an important policy, we committed, with the State Claims Agency - because we did this work together - to undertake a training programme as extensive as we had the resources to do.  The reason it took so long was because of the initial format of the training.  The training is very high quality and has been assessed by external evaluators and by the participants.  It is very much welcomed and people find it effective.  The people involved - the one or two individuals doing the training - were training everybody.  So, taking into account the basis of the Deputy's question, we moved from training everybody to training trainers who would, in turn, train other people so that we could at least multiply it.  Our next stage now is to develop an e-learning module so that everybody can train on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018051000002#GG00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Philip Crowley"},{"type":"speech","time":1525939200,"counter":869,"content":"<p>When can we expect to see training complete and open disclosure fully operational within in the HSE in order that we might see a change in the culture?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018051000002#GG00700","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525939200,"counter":870,"content":"<p>That is a very difficult question to answer with exactitude, but I will answer it.

What we do is put policy out there.  We train people on it.  We try to de-stress it.  We try to ensure management supports people in something because one has to support staff when things go wrong as well; otherwise they will not necessarily do the right thing.

Looking specifically at claims previously reported as incidents is not terribly helpful.  This year we have revised the process.

This is not an impediment to moving forward with formal communication of audit outcomes.<\/blockquote> <p>It then sets out the next steps - this is frightening stuff - which are as follows: &quot;await advice of solicitors&quot;; &quot;Decide on the order and volume of dispatch to mitigate any potential risks&quot;; and - here we go - &quot;Continue to prepare reactive communications response for a media headline that 'screening did not diagnose my cancer'.&quot;  CervicalCheck was concerned about media reaction rather than individuals who had been falsely informed they were healthy when they could have taken remedial steps such as those we have heard about in recent weeks.  The director general stated earlier he found the memorandum reassuring.  If that is reassuring, it is the clearest indictment the committee and perhaps the House more generally has heard of the culture of containment, bury, suppress and protect ourselves at all costs.<\/p><p>I did not bother to read the two follow-up memorandums but I scanned them.  The memorandum issued in March 2016 and, according to his own testimony, the director general did nothing about it from that date until he heard about it on the news.  The policy of continuing &quot;to prepare reactive communications response for a media headline that 'screening did not diagnose my cancer'&quot; was very successful for two years because everybody, including the media, were kept in the dark for two years until the director general heard it on the news.  Frankly, this is an indictment of the Minister, the Taoiseach, the Secretary General, the HSE director general and everyone else associated with this issue and are taking wages paid by the income tax from the people.  The absence of humanity, compassion and accountability is a disgrace and I hope Mr. O'Brien, wherever he is <i>en route <\/i>to meetings in Limerick today, hears loud and clear that he should resign and allow us to reflect on whether the Minister, the Secretary General, I am afraid to say, and others also have to go.  This memorandum, which has been in circulation for two years, indicts many more people than its author.  I am disgusted.  I have no further questions because what we need now are actions from so-called leaders who, in reality, are nothing more than commentators.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018051000002#NN02900","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speech","time":1525939200,"counter":1206,"content":"<p>I am due to speak next but I will ask Deputy Cullinane to contribute now to allow me to take a note of some questions I wish to ask.

It strikes me that if I were one of the women reading the memo prepared for the director general and read by him, I would be absolutely livid.  What jumps from the pages is that the authors of the memo were basically saying to the director general that he needed to be concerned about the media reaction; not about patients or the women, but about the media reaction.  Even in terms of the next steps, nowhere does it say all women should be informed, nowhere does it say anything about open disclosure, and nowhere does it express concern for the welfare of women and patients.  Next steps include to pause all letters, await advice from solicitors and decide on the order and volume of dispatch to mitigate any potential risks.  I imagine, given the next line, that the potential risks are not risks to individuals but risks to the corporate body which is the HSE.  The next step is to continue to prepare a reactive communications response for a media headline that \"screening did not diagnose my cancer\".  It is profoundly shocking that this was the issue which was uppermost in the minds of the people who wrote that memo.

I will not be long.  I appreciate that HSE colleagues here have only just seen this and we do not know if the Department of Health had a copy of this at the time, albeit we will find out in the coming days.  There are three versions.  Without putting words in his mouth, the Secretary General said it was likely it was sent on.  What jumps out most to me from what we have just read is on page 2 of the memo.  It continued on the previous version.  It refers, using inverted commas, to \"a communications protocol\" prepared for consulting clinicians to address their questions.  It says the spokesman on matters related to this audit was Dr. Gr&aacute;inne Flannelly, clinical director of the CervicalCheck programme, who we know has now moved on.<\/p> <p>  Unless I was chairing a different meeting, I understood earlier from the director general of the HSE that the communications he took to be in the memo and the programme of communications work was obviously with the patients first through the clinicians.  This is not how that reads.  Anybody reading that can see it does not use the word \"patient\" anywhere.  It says a communications protocol has been prepared for consultant clinicians to address their questions.  What about the questions of the women?<\/p> <p>  The spokesperson on matters related to the audit was named as Dr. Gr&aacute;inne Flannelly, clinical director of the CervicalCheck programme.  I say to all of those here that this should not give comfort that there is a communications process in place with the people that matter the most, namely, the women.  It does not.  It says, more or less, that there will be a protocol in place to ensure the clinicians are being told.<\/p> <p>  This is almost as if within the politics of health, it was intended to ensure that there was a protocol to tell the clinicians what was going on here and to name the spokesperson.  If that is the memo written by John Gleeson on behalf of Stephanie O'Keeffe and sent to the director general, is it any wonder that the women affected were not told for years in some cases?  Is it any wonder?  This memo has nothing to do with communications to the patients.  It only goes down as far as the clinicians.  That is the most devastating part of this.  It actualises what we have all been thinking and talking about for the last week and a half.  That one paragraph is a communications process being put in place from the HSE through the screening programme for clinicians, not the affected women.  It sums up where we are today.  That is at the bedrock of where this issue lies.<\/p> <p>  The women were not being thought of.  Nowhere in this memo does it say it is necessary to put in place a programme to communicate with all of the women and to ensure that they are all communicated with properly and dealt with in a compassionate way.  It does not say that.  It says there is a protocol in place for consulting clinicians and it names the spokesperson.  Does that not say a great deal about the politics of health in Ireland and the way in which the ultimate end users, the patients affected and the women whose lives have been destroyed, were treated?  It is a devastating paragraph in the letter and it is not a paragraph anybody could read to give comfort that the communications process down to the patients was going to happen.<\/p> <p>  On page 1, it states that all international screening programmes will have encountered a media headline that \"screening did not diagnose my cancer\".  It states that the CervicalCheck programme has prepared communications material to ensure transparent, effective and robust communications processes are in place to provide clear information for the media and the public, where appropriate, on the CervicalCheck clinical audit process and results.  A small issue jumps out again; the patient.  It says \"all international screening programmes will have encountered a media headline that \"screening did not diagnose my cancer\".  It says the CervicalCheck programme has prepared communications material to ensure transparent, effective and robust communications processes are in place to provide clear information.  To whom?  Not the women affected, but to the media and the public.  Transparent, effective and robust communications processes are referred to, not for the women affected but for the media and the public.<\/p><p>That says it all and it is quite damning.

This is not what I expected to read.  When Mr. O'Brien was talking to us this morning, he was very much focused on the communications strategy and how it was not carried out.  He went further, however, and said that when he reread it, it did not cause him any serious concern.  He also talked about the requirement to manage the situation when something like this occurs in order to ensure that widespread concerns about something like the cervical screening programme are not exacerbated, which is exactly what has happened.  Given the notice on this matter, which he must have read, it is very difficult to figure out why a different type of action was not taken.<\/p> <p>  The final four bullet points on the last page of the first memo include the phrase \"Pause all letters\", which is the converse of what we have been told in respect of the communications strategy.  Obviously, legal advice was then sought.  Was that legal advice received?  What was that legal advice?  Was that legal advice to the effect that people should not be told?  Can Ms Lennon confirm that?  The memo also includes the phrase \"Decide on the order and volume of dispatch to mitigate any potential risks\".  I presume that refers to the order and volume of the letters that were to be sent to clinicians in respect of making contact with the patients who had received false negatives.  It is, therefore, about who would be told first and in what order people would be told in order to mitigate risk to the organisation and the programme.  On what is termed the \"reactive communications response\", I presume there is correspondence or a body of documentation in respect of that response.  It would be useful for us to see that because clearly it will have been worked through.  The witnesses might tell us what kind of working through would have been done and who it would have been done with.<\/p> <p>  I would particularly like to know what constitutes a patient safety issue?

The July memo states that the national screening service \"met with one of the laboratories in May 2016 and legal correspondence has ceased since that meeting.\"  The question I would have to ask is, what was said at that meeting to reassure the laboratories?  I am presuming and I do not want to be presuming.  That is why I am asking the question.  There must have been something said at that meeting between the national screening service and the laboratories in May 2016 which allayed their fears and the laboratory in question then decided not to pursue any further legal correspondence.  That is one question and I do not know whether anyone in this room has the answer to it.  What was said at that meeting?  Were assurances given to the laboratories?  Was the open disclosure protocol or policy which was to be rolled out, that we discussed earlier, relayed to the laboratories?  I do not know the answer to that and maybe somebody here might.<\/p> <p>  The other point I want to clarify is the numbers.  The two July memos or briefing notes that we got contain two different figures.  That may be because one dates from the start of July and the other dates from the end of July.  We do not know because they are not dated.  It only states \"July\".  One is for 256 and the other is for 286.  I am just looking for some information on this.  We now are dealing with 209 women.  What happened to the other letters?  Who were they being sent to?  If the HSE is saying we have 209 women who needed to be informed, either through their clinician or directly, where are the figures of 286 and 256 coming from and how did we get from those figures down to 209?  That is my second question.<\/p> <p>  My third question relates to a paragraph in the July memo on the amount of correspondence which will have to be sent out.<\/p><p>It says that from September 2016, letters communicating the cytology review findings are likely to issue at a rate of four to six per month.  There was either 256 or 286 letters, but in both memos it says there are approximately 200 letters left to be issued, at a rate of four to six per month.

I would say the difference between the 256 and the 286 or 288 is a seven and a half year period and an eight year period.  My interpretation on the volume of correspondence is that they were recognising a backlog that had to be cleared in July-August 2016 and that once it was through that it would be in a steady-state of notifying four to six women per month, into the future, as false negative cases would have arisen.

When pressed, he said that if the process had been carried through there would be no woman who was not informed.  I do not know how that can be taken from that memo because nowhere in the memo does it say it will inform women.  It says it will inform clinicians.  The memo says the volume of letters increases the risk of an individual reacting to the content if or when shared by the attending clinician.

The number that is here is the number that is flagged for review.  The 209 that is circulating at the moment relates to those that have been reviewed in terms of their cytology and what is called a discordance - in other words, the difference in what we say now looking backwards and what was said then has been identified.  That is what that number of 209 relates to and it relates to the cohort of years.  It is not just the eight years but it is all the way up to the end of last year, in effect, because there were effectively two more years worth of the screening programme operating and contributing to that number.  Those numbers get done by starting with all of the incident cases it knows about.  We now know it did not know about the ones the registry had or did not include those.  It worked those down.  The question it is effectively asking is where a person who has cervical cancer, was there some failure in the chain of screening that failed to take the opportunity to prevent this cancer from occurring?  That could be because an appointment was not sent out.  It could be because the person did not respond to an appointment.  It could be the screening.  It could be the GP service not taking an adequate smear.  It could the cytology or colposcopy service after the full chain is looked at.  Only those where there is a reasonable suspicion that it is the smear that needs to be looked at are flagged for review and then a subset of those are identified where there is that discordance or difference between what it said back then in the report and what it now appears to be saying.

Before I do that, I believe I can speak on behalf of all members on this issue.  Today started for me with the \"Morning Ireland\" interview with Emma Mhic Mhath&uacute;na.  Since then, I have spent hours at this meeting and I have found this to be one of the most depressing exchanges the committee has had because of the absolute lack of information forthcoming.  There is still serious confusion and nobody wants to take responsibility for anything.  This is a source of great irritation to me and I am deeply shocked.<\/p> <p>  I will make a final point on the first briefing note of March 2016 and the statement in that note that there \"is always the risk that in communicating individual case reports to clinicians of an individual patient reacting by contacting the media\".  The concern was that the women might go to the media and that women should not be trusted.  That is the message I get from the briefing note.  This is beyond shocking when one considers how this day started for most of the people in the room.<\/p> <p>  To take up the point made by Teachta MacSharry, it is important that the director general of the HSE appears before the committee again next week.  Dr. Holohan tried to do his best to interpret elements of these briefing notes but we have only an interpretation.  We need to hear from the people who wrote the notes and the HSE director general who is responsible for overseeing all of this.  The correct course of action, therefore, would be to invite Mr. O'Brien to appear again and if he cannot attend, the person who is next in charge, whoever that may be.  Mr. O'Brien should, however, make himself available.  The Department also needs to be represented and I hope Mr. Breslin, when he returns next week, will have found the correspondence he indicated he started to look for today.  It would be great if he had that material next week in order that members could discuss it.  He can send it on to the committee at any time.  If he does not have it, that would indicate to me that it was never sent.  We will find out next week.<\/p> <p>  The other witnesses we hope to have before the committee next week are Mr. John Gleeson, Dr. Stephanie O'Keeffe, representatives of the National Cancer Registry who, I understand, have confirmed they will attend, the national director of human resources in the HSE and a representative of the Medical Council.  All the relevant invitations will issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018051000002#UU01300","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1525939200,"counter":1442,"content":"<p>A representative from the National Cancer Screening Service should also attend.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018051000002#UU01400","speaker":"1280"},{"type":"speech","time":1525939200,"counter":1443,"content":"<p>Yes.
