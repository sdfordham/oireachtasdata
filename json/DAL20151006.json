I asked him to contact directly the developer of the complex, Mr. Bernard McNamara, to ensure that he and those responsible for the lack of adequate fire safety at the apartments footed the bill.  The Taoiseach indicated that he needed some time to acquaint himself with the facts of the case.  He has now had a week to do so.  Since last week, the position of the 900 residents of Longboat Quay has become worse.  They now have 25 days to start remediation works or they will be evacuated.  They have also been told by Dublin City Council management that the council will not be in a position to house them if they are evacuated.  The derisory offer of additional funding from the Dublin Docklands Development Authority has been rightly rejected as unacceptable by residents.  They have, therefore, 25 days to produce millions of euro.  The Taoiseach and I both know that is neither possible nor fair that they do so.<\/p>  <p>  Bernard McNamara and the people he employed are responsible for the apartments in Longboat Quay.  It is not acceptable that residents spend night after night living in fear of fire or evacuation while Mr. McNamara goes about his business rebuilding his development empire.  The solution to the problem at Longboat Quay can only be found if those responsible for the fire safety breaches are brought around the table and told to pay up.  <\/p>  <p>  I ask the Taoiseach again if he will pick up the telephone, call Bernard McNamara, demand to know what role he will play in resolving this problem and convene the meeting I described to bring all responsible parties around the table to foot the bill?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100600019#R00100","speaker":"1008"},{"type":"speech","time":1444144800,"counter":189,"content":"<p>This is another example of the poor standards that existed during the so-called Celtic tiger years for buildings and apartment blocks such as Longboat Quay.  Deputy McDonald is aware that the Building Control Act 1990 placed responsibility for compliance with building regulations on the owner of the building concerned, its designer and the builder-developer who carried out the works - in this case, the person named by the Deputy.  Enforcement of these regulations and responsibility for their enforcement are matters for local authorities which have extensive powers of inspection and enforcement under the Building Control Acts and Fire Safety Act 1981.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware of the reports of fire certificates being issued and not being acted on in a particular time.  The Planning and Development Acts and Housing Acts may also be relevant to fire safety, which has been the cause of the extreme and stressful position in which the residents of Longboat Quay find themselves.  Remediation of defects - renovation works to deal with them - is a matter for the parties concerned, namely, the current owners and the builder-developer and his or her agents and insurers.  If a satisfactory resolution cannot be found or achieved through dialogue or negotiation, the option of seeking a legal remedy is always available.  <\/p>  <p>  The issues that emerged during this debacle are a matter for the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, the receiver to the developer, the residents of Longboat Quay and their management company and Dublin Fire Brigade to resolve collaboratively.

Since 1 March 2015, greatly strengthened arrangements have been in place for the control of building activity.  These require greater accountability in respect of the conditions that apply and are awarded for planning in the first place.  I am not aware of the detail of the outcome of the meeting between the Minister and representatives of the management company in the past hour.

I heard on Euronews last night that at one time there were 4 million farmers in France, but now there are 1 million ranchers.  The same appears to be happening in this country.  The Government and previous Governments through the years have neglected family farms.  Family farms are responsible for holding a great many local communities together in terms of their schools and shops.  The Minister has created a bubble in the dairy industry, which is now turning sour.  I grant that &euro;13 million has been given to the dairy sector, but a bubble has been created in which 60,000 more calves will turn into cattle and hit the beef sector within the next 12 months.  Promises the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the cartels in the factories agreed last January are now being broken and prices are dropping.  Those promises are being broken without the Minister doing anything about it.  Prices in the sheep sector seem to be falling the whole time.  Young farmers trying to get out there, even though some of them went into it before 2008, have been forgotten.  CAP funding is not for the family farm, with 80% of it going to the 20% of ranchers around the country.  GLAS was put into Pillar 2 for the so-called family farm.  In May last year, GLAS came out and 25,000 people went into it.  Sadly, while it is a good thing that it is opening again, GLAS has been changed around completely.  The family farm is being driven out of it.<\/p>  <p>  I was at a meeting the other night about the beef genomics scheme.  The statistics tell one that they are relying on 40% accurate information to tell farmers what to do.  One cannot run a business on 40% accurate information.

He ranged over three different areas: GLAS, the beef genomics scheme and GMOs.  He has also raised the issue of the decline in the number of farmers at European level, although he did not define what he considers to be a rancher in Irish terms.  He made the point about rural development programmes.  The enthusiasm and energy that was evident at the recent National Ploughing Championship from people all over the country, most of whom were small farmers, was self-evident.  Every agricultural course in every agricultural college is booked out because young people now see the agri sector as central to their future ambitions and careers.  GLAS will see the participation of 50,000 farmers, all of whom are small to medium-size farmers and not ranchers by Irish standards.  The Common Agricultural Policy, with the extra &euro;100 million thrown in for the rural development programme, the recent allocation in respect of the programme for the next number of years dealing with CEDRA, and the putting in place of a national strategy to allow communities, including family farms, to draw and avail of assistance are there for all to see.<\/p>  <p>  I do not accept the Deputy's assertion at all that the Irish agri sector is in any way in decline.  Of course, the lifting of milk quotas is not responsible in itself for the decline in milk prices.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney, fought a good battle at European level to get an extra &euro;13 million, which will be distributed based on the recommendations of the dairy forum, an important institution for dairy farmers - who are all, by the way, carbon-footprinted and contributing greatly to the future economic development of the country.  Clearly, the beef trade can fluctuate, and factories have always had their influence in terms of setting prices.  That is why we have managed to get access to the American market, the Japanese market for specialised cuts and the Chinese market.  These are opportunities that must be worked on over the next period.<\/p>  <p>  There is no commercial cultivation of GMO crops in Ireland, as the Deputy is aware.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the different agencies continue to discuss and consider the revised legislation on genetically modified cultivation and what, if any, are the practical and legal implications for the future.  It is considered that acting to restrict cultivation where no cultivation would occur is unnecessary.  Irish GMO policy, including in relation to the opt-out clause, which Ireland supported when first proposed, is continuously kept under review on the basis of experience and the approaches across member states.  Ireland can still opt out of GM cultivation beyond the deadline of 3 October.  None of the currently authorised GM crops will be cultivated in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  As such, while the Deputy paints a depressing picture of the agri sector, it is fundamentally central to the development of the economy for the next ten, 15 and 20 years.<\/p><p>There are challenges in there, but will dealing with this issue in a carefully structured way not lead to the futures and the ambitions and the livelihoods of thousands of family farms in the country?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100600020#S02400","speaker":"1072","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1444146000,"counter":234,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach referred to youngsters attending colleges and things being booked out.

This issue must be addressed.<\/p>  <p>  I will pin it down to one important scheme for the Taoiseach, the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS.  For small farmers in Mayo and across the country, will the Taoiseach give an undertaking that the same terms and conditions will apply in two weeks' time as when GLAS opened to farmers last May or will he introduce separate schemes for two neighbours with the same acreage that will create a difference of &euro;1,500?  The hedgerows aspect, which was worth &euro;1,000, will not be allowed.  There is also a change in terms of old, rich meadows and pastures.  I have pinned this down to one scheme because it gets complicated in the D&aacute;il if one discusses too many.

My principal focus was to highlight Ireland's economic recovery and to enhance our bilateral trade and investment links in order to boost job creation in Ireland.  I also took every opportunity to press publicly and privately the case for immigration reform and to advocate for the undocumented Irish not just in meetings with the Administration and the congressional leadership, but with political figures at all levels throughout my visit.  On this occasion, my programme did not permit meetings with the groups which lobby incessantly on behalf of the undocumented, although the Government remains in ongoing close contact with them through our embassy and through our consulates in the US.<\/p>  <p>  My programme began in Atlanta, Georgia, where my engagements included a number of business-focused events, including at the Irish chamber of commerce in Atlanta, where I delivered a keynote address on Ireland's economic recovery, and a round-table engagement with IDA Ireland client companies and potential investors from the Atlanta region.  I also held meetings with companies, including Coca-Cola, which is a major investor throughout Ireland, and Oldcastle, which is the largest Irish-owned company in the United States.<\/p>  <p>  I had a range of engagements with senior political figures, including the Governor of Georgia, Mr. Nathan Deal, and the mayor of Atlanta, Mr. Kasim Reed.  I also had the opportunity to engage with both Senators from the state of Georgia, Mr. Johnny Isakson and Mr. David Perdue.  Our discussions covered business links between Georgia and Ireland, immigration reform and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP.  I might say that the appointment of a consulate there was really worthwhile in the sense of making arrangements for contacts, with political personnel from here meeting business personnel and politicians from that area.<\/p>  <p>  I had the opportunity to engage with the wider Irish community as well as a number of influential friends of Ireland at a range of other events.  These included the St. Patrick's Day dignitaries breakfast, which took place before the Atlanta parade which I attended as grand marshal, the Irish consul general's St. Patrick's Day reception, a meeting with the Atlanta-based members of the Global Irish Network and a traditional Irish community event at Atlanta City Hall dedicated to Fr. O'Reilly, an Irish priest who was responsible for saving city hall, five churches and 400 homes from being burned down during the American Civil War.  I also undertook a number of US and international media engagements, including with CNN International, to highlight the message of Ireland's economic recovery.<\/p>  <p>  I travelled from there to Austin, Texas, where my engagements included officially opening the new Ireland house in Austin, which will house our new Consulate General in the city, as well as the Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland offices.  Ireland is the first European country to open a consulate in the city, which is America's fastest growing city and has become a major technology hub.  I participated in a range of events at South by Southwest Interactive, which has become one of the world's largest technology festivals.  I visited the Enterprise Ireland stand, where I met with a number of innovative Irish technology companies, and also spoke at an Enterprise Ireland event focused on enhancing links between the Irish startups and venture capital funds.  I participated in a keynote public interview focused on Ireland's strengths as a global technology hub.  I also addressed an audience of current and potential investors in Ireland at an event organised by IDA Ireland and I met with senior executives of Dell, which is based in Texas.  At political level, I met with the Governor of Texas, Mr. Greg Abbott, where our discussions focused on enhancing the trade and investment relationship between Ireland and Texas as well as immigration reform.<\/p>  <p>  My programme in Washington was primarily focused on high level political engagement and business promotion.  My bilateral meeting with President Obama at the White House was positive and wide ranging.<\/p><p>We discussed Ireland's economic recovery and developments within the European Union and the eurozone.  We had a useful exchange on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership and agreed on the benefits of concluding an ambitious agreement as soon as possible.  While we did not discuss any specific cases, we did discuss the situation in Northern Ireland at that time and the implementation of the Stormont House Agreement.  The US Administration continues to be a crucial partner in the peace process and is fully familiar with the key issues.  I thanked President Obama and Vice President Biden for their personal engagement and for the work of Senator Gary Hart in Northern Ireland.  I thanked the President for his efforts on immigration reform and stressed our continued determination to make progress on behalf of the undocumented Irish.  We discussed a range of international issues including the Ukraine crisis, the Ebola outbreak, the threat posed by ISIS and the prospects for both the Middle East peace process and the non-proliferation treaty.  On this occasion, we did not specifically discuss the issue of refugees displaced by conflicts in the Middle East.<\/p> <p> I attended the traditional breakfast hosted by the Vice President, Joe Biden, and the lunch hosted by the Speaker, Mr. John Boehner.  I also held meetings with a number of other congressional leaders including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Minority Leader Harry Reid, Senator Pat Leahy and a number of other senior figures including the Congressional Friends of Ireland group.  In each of these engagements I emphasised the importance we attach to addressing the plight of the undocumented Irish and I urged all sides to work towards achieving immigration reform.  I also raised this issue with the Speaker of the House of Representatives, John Boehner, during his visit to Ireland on 2 July.  As recently as last week, the Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, engaged with congressional contacts on these issues during his visit to Washington DC.<\/p> <p> I had a number of business-focused engagements, including a high level roundtable organised by the US Chamber of Commerce and a business leaders lunch organised by our enterprise promotion agencies.  I addressed a Science Foundation Ireland event to announce new industry-academic partnerships and to honour prominent Irish and Irish-American scientists.  I addressed the American Ireland Fund gala dinner, which gathered contributors to the fund and key members of the Irish-American community.  In addition to talking about Ireland's economic recovery, I paid tribute to the important work of the fund in contributing to peace and reconciliation on this island.  I was pleased to have the opportunity to launch the Celebrating a Century of Irish Arts and Culture event, which will take place next year at the Kennedy Center in Washington DC, and will form a centrepiece of our global commemorations of the 1916 Rising.<\/p> <p> Overall, my visit to the United States in March was extremely positive.  There was an extraordinary level of interest in Ireland's improving economic recovery, as well as tremendous confidence and optimism about the potential for further job creation and for further trade, investment and tourism.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100600021#T07500","answer":true,"speaker":"1072","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1444146600,"counter":309,"content":"<p>While I thank the Taoiseach for his reply, before proceeding any further Members should note some of these questions have been awaiting a reply for at least six months.  There have been ongoing cancellations for various reasons of the weekly Taoiseach's questions and they never have been rescheduled.  It is a demonstration of the Government's ongoing disdain for this House and for accountability to the House.<\/p>  <p>  All Members welcome the recent executive action by President Obama regarding the undocumented and migration in general.  It has removed some of the most immediate pressure from undocumented people in the United States but as Members are aware, it only goes as far as presidential control of the Executive branch extends and the substantive issue of providing long-term security to the undocumented has not been addressed.  In his reply, the Taoiseach mentioned meeting various members of Congress and I am worried by what appears to be an increasing trend.  Certainly, the current anti-immigrant tone of some of the statements made by presidential candidates, for example, is not something that would give one hope that the Republican Party will end its blocking of comprehensive immigration reform any time soon and that has been one of the major blockages to immigration reform.  We should join in the condemnation of statements that demonise and vilify economic migrants, from wherever they are, and I ask the Taoiseach to agree to this request.  Some highly inflammatory comments have been made in the context of the presidential election in the United States by certain candidates regarding economic migrants, which is unacceptable and we should be forthright in our views in this regard.  The plight of the undocumented is a matter on which work should continue.  The Taoiseach has had a series of meetings but stated he did not meet the lobby groups on that occasion.  I am not sure whether the ebb and flow of elections will make a deal possible but lobbying does matter.  What has been prepared in respect of lobbying the new leadership of the House of Representatives?  As the Taoiseach is aware, there has been a change recently and he might indicate to Members whether the Government has fresh plans to lobby on behalf of the undocumented.<\/p>  <p>  In his reply, the Taoiseach also mentioned a meeting that involved a number of key scientists and this is a good opportunity to comment on the awarding of the Nobel Prize for medicine to County Donegal native, Professor Bill Campbell, who is one of a significant number of Irish research scientists working in American universities and research facilities.  Professor Campbell's work is benefiting millions and the warm congratulations of the House are due to him.  The Taoiseach may be unaware he did not receive acknowledgement in the Government's St. Patrick's Day science event and perhaps this will be remedied or addressed next year.  He deserves some acknowledgement by the State for his achievements, at least an acknowledgement on St. Patrick's Day, which he did not receive this year.  From 1997 onwards, a major policy shift was made in attracting home Irish researchers but this has gone directly into reverse over the past three years.  There has been a significant change in science and research policy in Ireland by the Government.  As a petition signed by more than 800 internationally recognised competitive and leading researchers in Irish universities stated earlier this year, Government policy is pushing them directly out of the country.  I reiterate that 800 people signed that petition.  The problem is that basic research, exactly the kind of research undertaken by Professor Campbell, has been downgraded for funding and the area of non-commercially linked basic research in medicine has been removed from funding schemes.  Ireland's most internationally successful research group, the immunology research centre in Trinity College, was unable to secure funding from the main Science Foundation Ireland scheme despite being the facility ranked number one in the world.  It has had that leading position because of its publications and so on for quite some time now.  Consequently, I put it to the Taoiseach that when he meets American leaders and when he travels to the United States, it is time to stop the speeches and telling people about our commitment to basic research and pure science but he should do something to keep research scientists in Ireland.  This is a significant issue for the future of the country and is one on which the Taoiseach has fallen down.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100600022#U00200","speaker":"992"},{"type":"speech","time":1444146600,"counter":310,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Martin.  I realise these questions are relevant to a period from quite a number of months ago but I believe the offer always was there to have a written reply granted immediately.  While that was not requested, it applies in all cases.  As I stated, I congratulated the President on his executive action on immigration and met Senators Reid, McConnell and Leahy, as well as the Friends of Ireland.  I do not think much will happen now in respect of long-term immigration reform in the United States, given the run-in to the difficulties the parties are having and the preparations for the beginning of primaries and so on for the presidential election later next year.  I hope that would not be right and in speaking to the ambassador to the United States in New York at the United Nations last week, she made the point that she continues to work diligently with the Representatives on the Hill about this matter and a number of other opportunities that may arise in respect of surplus quotas granted to other nations which may be considered important, as well as to speak to Speaker Boehner before he retires officially from the role of Speaker as to requests he may wish to make in that regard.  I agree with the Deputy; inflammatory comments by candidates are not warranted, particularly with regard to immigrant people.  Do we ourselves not know about that more than anybody?<\/p><p>I happened to be in Strokestown Park House in Roscommon yesterday.  More than 3,000 people were evicted from that estate and 1,400 had to walk to Dublin, take the boat to Liverpool and take their chances on coffin ships to Canada and the United States.  If the Deputy has the chance some time, he should visit the museum there and see the pictures from Eritrea and the pictures from Ireland of 1843 and 1845.  There is very little difference between them.<\/p> <p> The comments being made by some candidates in respect of immigrant people are to be condemned.  I opened a facility here in Dublin recently, the chief financial executive of which is an immigrant person who came here with parents who acquired refugee status.  That contributes greatly to the running of our economy, and we should be very proud of that mix.  I agree with the Deputy that comments being made by candidates in these elections are not warranted and should be condemned.<\/p> <p> I agree with Deputy Martin on the question of the Nobel prize in terms of complimenting Professor Campbell for his works.<\/p> <p> Speaking to Science Foundation Ireland and the Institute for Research and Innovation, I am aware this is an area that is increasing in importance.  Given the limited financial resources available over recent years, perhaps the focus was not as strong as it should have been, but it has been stronger than it was and I would like to see that continue.  When Prime Minister Modi was here in the past fortnight, we spoke about this, and the research going on in Ireland in terms of polluted water and all the advantages Ireland is showing in that kind of research and development is of interest to a country the scale of India with its huge numbers.<\/p> <p> In terms of the United States, we do not have the same bursary facilities that apply in universities there.  Clearly, it is an advantage for major universities in the US to be able to offer serious endowments and financial inducements to international people of that calibre to work in their institutions.<\/p> <p> The Health Research Board funds a good deal of research.  The demonstration hub it set up in Cork, in Deputy Martin's own place, for research and innovation specialises in having IT scientists and specialists in that area.  If we are heading towards serious changes in the frontiers ahead, science, research and innovation will be of more importance.  The science, technology, engineering and mathematics, STEM, subjects in their own way are attracting more young people to do mathematics, physics, technology and science.  We hope that continues and whatever encouragement has to be given will be given.<\/p> <p> I take the Deputy's point about keeping qualified scientific people in this country.  We have many of them but maybe it is not all that it should be in terms of what the State offers.  We will try to begin addressing that in Tuesday's budget by again reducing the overall level of taxation that applies here because that has become an issue for people who want to work in a country like Ireland where the top rate of tax is seen as too heavy.  Government will make a decision on that next week.  I thank the Deputy for those comments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100600022#U00300","speaker":"1072","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1444147200,"counter":312,"content":"<p>Can I pick up on the Taoiseach's comment that there is unlikely to be progress on comprehensive immigration reform this side of the US presidential election, particularly with regard to some of the commentary we have seen from candidates?  We all want to acknowledge the executive action that has been taken by President Obama, but is there an opportunity for some form of an immigration Bill to be introduced before John Boehner departs as Speaker of the House in the next month?  Has the Taoiseach any indication on that?  I know the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, met Congressman Sensenbrenner and he intends to bring forward legislation on E3 visas which would allow people to emigrate from Ireland to live and work in the United States and access visas, amounting to approximately 10,000 per annum.  Can progress be made on that?  I ask that question because if we cannot make progress on a comprehensive solution in the United States, can we look at specific solutions, such as the E3 visa, that can address specific problems faced by the Irish?  To make it a success, however, we need to be able to ensure young people who are stuck in the United States can come back to Ireland, avail of that E3 visa, and return to the US.<\/p>  <p>  Is the Taoiseach aware that the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform is saying that while about one third of people undocumented in the US could avail of existing visas available through the Irish embassy here, because of the three and ten-year bars that are in place for someone resident and undocumented in the United States, they cannot come back to Ireland to avail of that?  Mexico, Venezuela and the Dominican Republic have been very successful in using that as a mechanism to deal with their undocumented issue.<\/p>  <p>  The issue is being raised consistently and I received a leaflet again today to the effect that the Irish Government has not sought that visa from Ambassador O'Malley in the Phoenix Park.  While a request has been written by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, there has not been a formal request from the Taoiseach or the Minister for Foreign Affairs for the introduction of this executive waiver which would unlock a problem for about one third of the undocumented in the United States.<\/p>  <p>  I do not know the ins and outs of this but I would like the Taoiseach to clarify that for me because it is being circulated widely that the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs are not prepared personally to seek this executive waiver.  If they did, it would be made available to undocumented Irish in the United States and could allow a significant number of those to come back to Ireland to avail of a visa to go back into the US.  Clarity on that issue is needed.  I hope we will see some progress by John Boehner on the issue, even in the current short window, because every opportunity needs to be taken to see if we can push that along.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100600023#V00200","speaker":"1177"},{"type":"speech","time":1444147200,"counter":313,"content":"<p>Deputy Naughten will be aware from his experience of how this operates in the United States in terms of having two Houses that function, both Senate and Congress.

I might be wrong and I hope I am.<\/p><p>President Obama made his executive decision, which is quite limited.  It was blocked in the Houses afterwards.  I met Speaker Boehner, Representative McConnell, Representative Reid, Representative Leahy, the Friends of Ireland and so on and made this case very strongly.  Some of the politicians would say they would see an opportunity to tag one element of a bill onto another, which could go through the House but then they may not have the votes, and it is a question of whether they could get a certain number of Democrats or Republicans.  It has not worked with Speaker Boehner <i>in situ<\/i>and, with respect to them all, I do not see it moving along now.<\/p><p>The Minister, Deputy Flanagan, met Representative Jim Sensenbrenner in another attempt to get E3s.  I hope that yields some progress.  There is the facility that Australia never used up all its visas, and perhaps these might be transferable to another country.  That might not be possible.  It might be taken as a poor signal from one country that has not used up all the visas allocated to it, but we have personnel who could do that.<\/p><p> I will tell Deputy Naughten something else.  I am very concerned now at what is purported to be happening in respect of J1 visas.  Deputy Naughten will be aware that approximately 7,500 of our young people go to America every year on a J1 visa.  This represents an extraordinary opportunity for young people to experience American life, the personality of America, the experience of working in America and to make new contacts.  Obviously, this brought its own tragedy in Berkeley earlier this year.  Anyway, because of a series of issues that have arisen, the authorities that issue J1 visas seem to be bent on introducing a requirement for pre-employment for young people before they go.  I am unaware of the extent of the paperwork and administration that may be involved, but if that were to happen it could lead to two things.  First, a serious reduction in the number of J1 visas granted to Ireland; it could perhaps be down by as much as 60% or 80%.  Second, people who travel out on holiday visas may then decide to work illegally, which would only cause trouble for themselves and everyone else afterwards.  A number of areas require political clarity about what is required.  When I met the US Senator, Mr. McCain, about this matter he said that thousands of workers who come from Mexico might be better having a short-term working visa because many go home to their families when the crops are all in and the harvest is gathered, as the song goes.  I think it was a Woody Guthrie song - I am showing my age.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100600023#V00300","speaker":"1072","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1444147800,"counter":315,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach may need to explain that to Deputy Kevin Humphreys.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100600024#W00200","speaker":"992"},{"type":"speech","time":1444147800,"counter":316,"content":"<p>In any event, I believe this is going to be problematic, particularly for a country like Ireland.  The nature of our traditional connection 50 or 60 years ago and before was that people left and never came back.  This has changed now.  I firmly believe that the J1 system has been important in keeping that connection alive in the modern sense with young people in university and throughout the country working in America for the summer and so on.  It keeps the connections between our countries very much alive currently and for the future.  If that is going to be reduced seriously then it could cause real problems for relationships in the time ahead.<\/p>  <p>  I believe everyone in the House has the same view on the matter.  We are keen to have a streamlined, effective strategy.  However, this requires political will and acceptance.  Unfortunately, because of the situation that applies between the US Congress and Senate, these are not in place at the moment.  Some members of the US Republican and Democratic parties are willing to work on these things to try to get the numbers and tag the facility on to an existing Bill that will go through towards the end of this session.  That is what is needed.<\/p>  <p>  When I was out there last year, the idea was being put forward very strongly that the best time to introduce either an Irish immigration element or major immigration reform would be at the start of the approaching session, that is to say, in September or October last year, but that did not happen.  Now, things are moving on in the United States and they are campaigning with different party credentials for candidacy and I imagine it will be difficult.  Anyway, I will certainly work with all Members and through our ambassador and consulates in constantly contacting the personnel there about E3 visas and an element of immigration reform in the absence of overall immigration reform.  Certainly I am not keen on a situation where there would be an abrupt ending to the J1 system as we know it through the dramatic introduction of a requirement for pre-employment.  Independent authorities grant these visas.  If that is being considered by them, and it is, then there should be a transition period during which young Irish people would be able to go to many different places in the United States and not only be congregated in one or two locations, which has its own implications.<\/p>  <p>  This is a serious matter and something I am prepared to talk to the US ambassador about.  I have discussed with him previously the three-year bar and ten-year bar and I will follow up on the point Deputy Naughten raised.  Through the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and everyone else, we should keep in contact with the ambassador, the consulates and American political representatives.  Unfortunately, I believe deep down that we are not going to have major immigration reform now.  If the Sensenbrenner initiative works or the efforts being made now by our ambassador, H.E. Ms Anderson, come to fruition and give a few extra visas that are in the system but not allocated to Ireland, that may be of interest to us as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100600024#W00300","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1444147800,"counter":317,"content":"<p>Deputy McDonald, on behalf of Deputy Adams, is next.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100600024#W00400","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1444147800,"counter":318,"content":"<p>Ten of the 20 questions to which the Taoiseach is responding are in the name of Deputy Adams, so please bear with me.<\/p><p>Not many harvests are being gathered in Ringsend or Pearse Street.

Will the Taoiseach set out exactly what he has done about it so far by way of engagement or representation?  Although that is concerning, it is secondary to the longer-standing and deeper concern for the undocumented or those who have overstayed various visas in the United States.  I know this is a matter on which the House is united in looking for a resolution.  However, what I am not clear on, outside of the Taoiseach's visits to the United States, especially on the occasion of St. Patrick's Day, is the rhythm of the Taoiseach's engagement on this issue.  How regularly does the Taoiseach, personally, or his Department intervene and interface with members of the US Congress or the US ambassador in Dublin?  I am keen to get a sense of how that works.  Can the Taoiseach set out the supports afforded by the Taoiseach's Administration to those groups which, as he has said, work incessantly or tirelessly on behalf of the undocumented stateside?<\/p>  <p>  I warmly welcome the remarks the Taoiseach has made in respect of the rather vile commentary in respect of immigrants to the United States.  It is not only ourselves as an emigrant nation who understand that phenomenon.  The United States is built on the immigrant experience, not only from our shores but from further afield.  I very much welcome the Taoiseach's comments.<\/p>  <p>  When the Taoiseach met President Obama, did he discuss the current refugee crisis, the Syrian crisis?  What was the content of that exchange?  What discussions has the Taoiseach had in respect of the Stormont House Agreement?  As we know, the negotiations are under way.  The Taoiseach has acknowledged that the North is a special case in many respects since it is coming out of a period of protracted conflict.  All of us support and understand the concept of not only peace but a peace dividend in economic terms.  Will the Taoiseach press for the restoration of the block grant budget that has been stripped of &pound;1.5 billion?  This looms large in the current negotiations.  Has the Taoiseach pressed for a workable budget for the institutions?  Will the Taoiseach honour his commitments in respect of the construction of the A5 motorway?  Did any of these matters form part of the discussion the Taoiseach had with the President of the United States?<\/p>  <p>  Question No. 29 relates to human rights lawyer Pat Finucane.

The trauma and stress they have experienced has been made all the greater because of the intransigence of the British Government to honour a freely made commitment at Weston Park to hold a public inquiry.  In 2001, as the Taoiseach knows, the British Government agreed, along with the Irish Government, to invite Mr. Justice Peter Cory to determine the need for an inquiry.  He concluded that there ought to be one, and yet the British Government has refused to implement the Weston Park Agreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100600024#W00900","speaker":"1008","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1444148400,"counter":324,"content":"<p>What question are you on about?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100600025#X00200","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1444148400,"counter":325,"content":"<p>Question No. 29.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100600025#X00300","speaker":"1008"},{"type":"speech","time":1444148400,"counter":326,"content":"<p>We are on Questions Nos. 1 to 19, inclusive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100600025#X00400","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1444148400,"counter":327,"content":"<p>My apologies.

As I said, I expressed a view that the potential diminution in J1 visas would be a serious blow to connections between Ireland and the United States and to the opportunity for so many young people to work legitimately in the US and avail of a wonderful experience.  We have regular reports from the consulates in the US and the ambassador.  Ambassador Anderson is a very dedicated official who is in constant contact with different political personnel on Capitol Hill.<\/p>  <p>  I meet the US ambassador, Mr. O'Malley, on regular occasions at different events.  This has to be done on the far side and requires the politics of the United States to deal with comprehensive immigration reform.  There are 15 million people or more in the United State illegally.  Some candidates said they will send them all away, but that cannot happen.  Those people's lives would be far more beneficial to the US and its economy in the future if they were legitimised, had legal status and were able to contribute to their lives and the business of the United States.<\/p>  <p>  In Congress, the current consensus on Capitol Hill appears to be that the next opportunity for a push on comprehensive legislative reform on immigration is not likely to arise until 2017, which is after the presidential election.  The use of immigration as a negative and emotive issue in the Republican presidential nominee race only adds to that particular message being reinforced, which I regret.  In the interim, the Irish embassy in Washington is pursuing a strategy for E3 visas for Ireland with the intention of taking advantages of any opportunity to move forward on immigration legislation that might present itself.  I cannot say that it will.<\/p>  <p>  As I said to Deputy Naughten, the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, was in Washington last week and met Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner.  It was announced that a Bill had been tabled by him which could provide for the reallocation of thousands of E3 visas for Irish participants.  However, it has to be said that it is only the first step in a long, difficult and complex process which will have to be navigated if the Bill to be become law.<\/p>  <p>  I spoke to President Obama about this matter and obviously he has been limited in what he can do and has done what he can do.  The Minister, Deputy Flanagan, met Vice President Biden on 30 March at the opening of the Edward Kennedy Institute.  He emphasised Ireland's continuing concerns regarding immigration reform and, in particular, the importance of the travel issue for the undocumented Irish.  We are all aware that people cannot come back for family events or tragedies, an issue which is of serious concern to us.  The Minister also had, as I had, meetings with the Speaker of the House, John Boehner, who reiterated on 2 July that this was a matter he had worked on for several years and that while it was difficult to secure progress, he would keep trying.  He spoke at the American Chamber of the need to make progress on immigration reform, and I addressed it the following day and spoke on the same issue.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy Flanagan, met all the people I mentioned, namely, Paul Ryan, Richard Neal, Jim Sensenbrenner, Joseph Kennedy III and so on.  A sizeable number of visas - 15,000 - are allocated to Australia under the E3 system.  It is less favourable than a stand-alone provision for Ireland.  The issue is being pursued but I am not sure how the connections between Australia and the US would view a situation like that.<\/p>  <p>  At his meeting with the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, Congressman Sensenbrenner said it would be necessary to have a Bill of that sort passed by the Senate before one could be passed in the House of Representatives.  He explained that many Republicans, including Bob Goodlatte, Chairman of the House Committee on the Judiciary, would be concerned that such a Bill might be added to in the Senate by those wishing to broaden its focus to more than general immigration reform issues and that it was necessary to deal with those fears first if the Bill was to get anywhere.  He indicated, however, that he was ready to table the Bill in the House of Representatives immediately, which he did the following day, while making it clear that action to move it forward would have to wait on progress in the Senate.  One can see the complications.  Congressman Sensenbrenner is a very experienced operator and is well regarded on the immigration issue in Republican circles.  The sponsorship of the Bill is positive and a great deal of work now has to be undertaken.  His Bill will remain on the books until the end of the legislative session when, if not acted upon, it will fall, which is a possibility.<\/p>  <p>  The E3 visa has been available to Australian citizens since 2005.  It allows for 10,500 Australians to travel to and work in the US for a year, up to two years or indefinitely as long as the individuals concerned have met the eligibility criteria and have valid job offers.  Spouses and children of visa holders can also travel.  On the basis of reciprocity, Australia offers a similar scheme to US citizens.<\/p>  <p>  There is the whole question of visa waivers.  On 24 February, on instruction from the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, a letter was issued from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to the US ambassador, Mr. O'Malley, on the wider issue of US immigration reform as well as on the question of waivers.  This letter inquired whether it would be possible to create a predictable and positive pattern for waiver approval within existing US regulations.  The Minister subsequently met the ambassador and discussed the issue with him on several occasions.  I raised this myself during my visit to Washington on St. Patrick's Day.<\/p>  <p>  The US embassy has indicated that the waiver system is applied in strict accordance with US laws and regulations and is operated uniformly worldwide, including here.  An application for a waiver on the grounds of inadmissibility, as it is known, is an application for legal entry to the US made by an individual who is otherwise inadmissible on one or more grounds.  Such a waiver can be applied for in the case of a three or ten-year ban having been imposed for overstaying a visa in the US in the first place.  The US embassy has underlined that applications are assessed individually case by case, with final decisions on each being a matter for the US authorities in Washington and that, accordingly, an applicant would not be able to predict with any degree of certainty whether he or she would be successful.  While this response is very disappointing, ultimately it is a matter for the US Government and embassy to interpret and implement their immigration laws.<\/p><p>I mentioned to President Obama the situation that applied in Northern Ireland.  I did not actually discuss with him the A5, the Narrow Water bridge, the Ulster Canal or a number of other issues, but I did say to him that obviously we would continue to support, where that is possible, these pieces of infrastructure.  We have had money in place for the A5 for quite a number of years, but it has not moved to a point where it has been drawn down because of legal problems and court cases.  It is important to determine what is actually required and how much is involved.  There has been &pound;50 million available for a couple of years but it has not actually moved.<\/p> <p> If I recall correctly, we discussed the implications of Stormont.  I have always defended the Finucane family, and Geraldine Finucane in particular, in respect of backing a call for a public sworn inquiry in this case.  I might just add, for the Deputy's information, that today the Government approved the retrieval of information facility which is part of the Stormont House Agreement.  This, in theory at least, would lead to information relevant to an issue, incident or event in Northern Ireland being made available to a person looking for it.  It remains to be seen whether it will actually apply in practice.  The theory is that irrespective of where the blockage was in the past that an independent person would make the information sought available to the person seeking it, if it directly pertained to the person or his or her family.  This will require heads of legislation coming through from Britain and here, and the intention is both Governments will sign this element of the Stormont House Agreement into effect on the same date.  It will take some time for the two Parliaments to deal with it and it needs to be compatible, so if there is a request either way it will be made available in respect of Northern Ireland.<\/p> <p> We did not discuss the question of the extent of migration, except to say the situation in the greater Middle East was extremely fragile and very sensitive.  The literal flood of migrants across the Mediterranean and through Eastern European countries was not evident at that stage to the extent it became evident afterwards.  The United States has made comments and taken some action on this.  Clearly the current situation in so far as Syria is concerned, with Russia and the United States in there, is causing confusion and has led to a tragedy at a M&eacute;decins sans Fronti&egrave;res, MSF, hospital, with conflicting reports of how it came about.<\/p> <p> On the question about block grants, we are precluded under the strands of the agreement from involving ourselves in this.  We did go to Stormont prior to Christmas and eventually there was agreement on the agreement, including responsibility being accepted by the politicians in regard to welfare reform and the elements of money involved.  Prime Minister Cameron responded to this in his own way.  Obviously the situation drifted downwards afterwards and I am glad that at least there is now focus again by the political representatives on moving it forward, and I hope it does.<\/p> <p> I met former President Clinton in New York when I was there for the United Nations.  I had a very good meeting with him.  Obviously he is well aware of Senator Hart being appointed as envoy to Northern Ireland.  He has a passionate interest in Northern Ireland given his many years experience here.  While not wishing to become centrally involved, he has said that in anyway he can assist or offer advice it is available as a general element of the process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100600025#X00600","speaker":"1072","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1444149000,"counter":330,"content":"<p>Earlier the Taoiseach used words such as unhelpful or uncomfortable to describe some of the language used by presidential candidates during the election campaign in terms of immigrants in the United States.  Do we need to be a little bit more forthright in roundly condemning the language of one particular candidate, Mr. Donald Trump, who has been condemned by governments, civil rights organisations and human rights organisations for using what can only be described as utterly despicable and racist language?  He accused Mexico of exporting its rapists and criminals to the United States.  What is very relevant to the undocumented Irish is that he has called for the expulsion of all 11.3 million undocumented workers in the United States.  This is the same Donald Trump whom the Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan, met in Shannon Airport in May 2014 with a red carpet, harps and people in traditional Irish dress in what was frankly even at the time quite a ludicrous show of deference to this multibillionaire.  This same person now turns out to be somebody who is literally whipping up an outrageous and dangerous hysteria against the undocumented, who include the Irish undocumented.  Do we regret rolling out the red carpet for a man who would say this about immigrants in the United States?  Will we condemn what he is saying?  He will hear those words given his investment in this country.  It will be something he will hear if the Irish Taoiseach and political system condemn him utterly for the words he has used to describe undocumented immigrants in the United States from wherever they may come.  I ask the Taoiseach to respond to this and make this forthright condemnation when somebody is being racist, and that is what he is.  He is whipping up dangerous hysteria, whereby there are serious reports of immigrants actually suffering heightened levels of violence, threats and racist stereotyping specifically because of the language and rhetoric Donald Trump has used.  It is emboldening the worst and most racist elements in the United States to attack, physically in some cases, target, vilify and demonise undocumented immigrants.  This is mostly directed at Mexicans, but he has said he wants to expel all undocumented workers from the United States.<\/p>  <p>  In the context of the refugee crisis, and particularly the situation in Syria and how it has been one of the major centres from which these refugees are fleeing, did the Taoiseach, as we asked him to on a number of occasions earlier this year, raise criticism, questions and concerns about the role of the United States in creating the conditions for this refugee crisis through its actions in Iraq, support for Saudi Arabia and arming of these regimes which have then gone on in turn to finance, support, give succour and create the conditions for the rise of ISIS?  Somebody has to start saying this stuff because the consequences have been so devastating.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach mentioned his attendance at the UN meeting in New York.  I have heard an unconfirmed report, and I would like a straight and direct answer.  Did the Taoiseach meet, or have any engagement with, General al-Sisi, the president and dictator - there is no other word to use for this man - of Egypt?<\/p><p>Did the Taoiseach or any of his officials or representatives of the Irish State or political system meet President el-Sisi, the man who is engaging in mass executions and mass trials of his own citizens, as well as Ibrahim Halawa?  If they did, was the Halawa case raised?

We have discussed this before and everybody is of the view that the Assad regime should go.  The latest intervention, involving the US Secretary of State, John Kerry, and Mr. Lavrov from Russia, on how ISIS is to be dealt with in Syria is an obvious case in point.  The hundreds of thousands of people displaced and living in camps in both Jordan and south Lebanon, trekking across into Turkey and from there to Europe, speak for themselves on this absolutely devastating issue.  We spoke of the European position and the need for action to be taken to end this war.  There is another issue in Libya, which has no government either, and there is open season in terms of people from the Horn of Africa moving through to Europe.<\/p>  <p>  I met the Egyptian President for 30 or 40 minutes with the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, and officials.  We spoke to him about Ibrahim Halawa and made very clear, without any equivocation, our desire for this young man to be able to return home to Ireland.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, has had detailed discussions on this in the past week.  I also made it clear, however, that we cannot change the judicial court system in any other country, and I discussed very clearly with the President the question of eligibility, once the system had been gone through, for a presidential pardon for Ibrahim Halawa.  I left the President in no doubt of our request that a presidential pardon should be considered and granted so this young man can come home.  In speaking to the President, I was not aware at the time that the trial would again be postponed because of the illness of two of the people on trial.  I can confirm to the Deputy that I, along with the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, and officials, did meet the Egyptian President formally, with minutes taken.  We also discussed the quality of the developmental programmes that Ireland operates in sub-Saharan Africa, and he expressed an interest in learning more about those in view of the number of immigrant people and refugees taken into Egypt in the last period.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100600027#Z01500","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1444149600,"counter":346,"content":"<p>It would have been helpful if the Taoiseach had reported that meeting to the family.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100600027#Z01600","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1444149600,"counter":347,"content":"<p>I will send the Deputy a report of the meeting that is very clear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100600027#Z01700","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1444149600,"counter":348,"content":"<p>That completes questions to the Taoiseach.

Given the Taoiseach's lack of comment yesterday, I ask him to tell us.<br\/><br\/>Under the social welfare (miscellaneous provisions) Bill, will the Taoiseach ensure a report commissioned by the T&aacute;naiste on the impact of the cuts to the lone parent allowance will be published as a matter or urgency?  The report was done in July by the National University of Ireland, Galway, and the findings about supports for lone parents are stark and shocking.  The report is with the Department of Social Protection, but has not been published.  Can the Taoiseach explain why and ensure it is published?<br\/><br\/>The Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, told the annual conference of the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, that we would publish legislation to establish the first hospital trust, the children's hospital trust, on a statutory basis before the end of the year.  Does the Taoiseach expect the Minister to honour his promise, or is he setting a new 18-month waiting time target for legislation?<br\/><br\/>The programme for Government is one of the greatest documents that has been written in a long time.  There is great stuff in it.  In the public service reform section, there is a section called &quot; 'Choice and Voice' for service users&quot;.  It states: &quot;Rather than giving fixed budgets to traditional public service providers like the HSE, VECs and F&Aacute;S, we will put resources into the hands of citizens to acquire services that are tailored to better suit their needs and less expensive for the taxpayer.&quot;  Could the Taoiseach indicate when we can expect this to happen and when the legislation will be brought forward?  The programme for Government also states, &quot;In local services, we will establish a website - <i>www.fixmystreet.ie<\/i>- to assist residents in reporting problems with street lighting, drainage, graffiti ... with a guarantee that a local official will respond within 2 working days.&quot;  It is not happening in my area.  The programme for Government also states, &quot;We will give schools, hospitals and other public service bodies new freedoms - within strict budgets and new accountability systems - to set their own staffing needs, automate routine processes and adapt work practices to local staff and customer needs.&quot;  When can we expect legislation to inform this?  There is much more.  I will keep my questions short.  The programme also states, &quot;We will bring to an end the unacceptable executive practice where no record is kept of ministerial involvement with an issue and resulting decisions.&quot;  Anybody who has read the Fennelly report will know the Government has not brought an end to what it called &quot;the unacceptable executive practice where no record is kept of ministerial involvement with an issue and resulting decisions.&quot;  I would appreciate if the Taoiseach could indicate the processes in his Department to ensure that very significant decisions that have been taken - such as the sending out of a Secretary General to a Garda Commissioner's house close to midnight - are recorded.  Can the Taoiseach indicate why no record was kept on that occasion and why the processes the Government committed to in the programme for Government did not click in for the events of that evening, involving the Taoiseach, the then Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, three Secretaries General and an Attorney General, of which no record at all was kept and for which there is no documentation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100600029#BB00200","speaker":"992","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1444151100,"counter":419,"content":"<p>The Deputy is wrong, in that a record of decisions taken was kept.

Legionnaire's disease is a potentially fatal form of pneumonia which can affect anybody but which principally affects those who are susceptible because of age, illness, immunosuppression or smoking.  Legionella bacteria are found in many types of water systems.  They multiply in warm and stagnant water such as that found in air conditioning cooling towers and certain plumbing systems, especially showers.  Approximately ten cases are reported in Ireland each year on average.  This HIQA report is very worrying for the patients and staff at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to take this opportunity to ask the Minister of State a number of questions.  How often are the water systems at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital and other hospitals in the country checked in order that the threat of Legionnaire's disease can be prevented?  What immediate action is the Minister taking in relation to the Legionnaire's disease outbreak at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital?  On a national level, how does this country deal with an outbreak of Legionnaire's disease?  What are the contingency plans?  What are the roles of hospital management and the Department of Health?  What are the protocols for dealing with Legionnaire's disease?  How do we deal with problems facing Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital?  Where is the Minister's five-point plan for hospitals generally?<\/p>  <p>  I am aware that we have a general election coming up.  I do not doubt that promises will be made.  I urge the Minister of State to find a workable solution to the problems at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital.  It is basic common sense.  The HIQA report states that shower heads were removed from patient bathrooms 18 months ago and not replaced.  This is simply not good enough.  I concur wholeheartedly with the statement in the HIQA report that it is \"essential that management of legionella risk at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital Drogheda is effectively managed, with a particular focus placed upon protecting patients who may be especially vulnerable to infection\".  There is a need for further care for the patients of Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital.  Just last week, I spoke in the Chamber about the crisis in the hospital's emergency area.  This week the issue is different.  The hospital seems to be continually in the news for one reason or another.<\/p>  <p>  I put it to the Minister of State, Deputy English, that we need an action plan for Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda.  We cannot continue to play politics with people&rsquo;s lives.  The Minister of State is well aware that the total population of the two counties served by this major hospital - my county and his county - is approximately 300,000.  In addition, many people from north County Dublin and counties Monaghan and Cavan come to Drogheda in emergency circumstances.  We need action in this regard.  I am sure capital expenditure is required with regard to the plumbing system.  I recognise that some money has been spent on it over a period of time.  It is quite clear that more money needs to be spent.  It is unsatisfactory that the shower units do not have a proper dispersal system at the end.  It is certainly not suitable for the people in the hospital who are using it.  This sends out the wrong message and needs to be addressed.  If additional capital is required to address the issue, the Government should provide it immediately.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100600031#DD00300","speaker":"945"},{"type":"speech","time":1444151700,"counter":441,"content":"<p>I am responding to this Topical Issue matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar.  I thank Deputy Kirk for giving me an opportunity to address the House on the important issue of the HIQA report on the threat of Legionnaire's disease at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda.  I would like to apologise on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, who generally tries to be present to respond to Topical Issue debates that relate to his area of responsibility.  I hope the Deputy understands that he is unable to be present today.  The Minister will communicate that to the Deputy as well.<\/p>  <p>  HIQA identified a number of issues during an unannounced inspection of Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda on 11 June last.  A reinspection was carried out on 16 July.  The hospital has acknowledged the issues raised in the HIQA report relating to the national standards for the prevention and control of health care associated infections following inspections of the hospital in June and July 2015.  The Minister is pleased to note that the hospital management team and the staff of the hospital have made a number of improvements and a great deal of progress in respect of all issues raised during HIQA's initial visit.  The hospital has a robust governance structure in place for the management of all aspects of the national standards for the prevention and control of healthcare-associated infections.  It has developed a quality improvement plan to address the remaining outstanding issues raised in the HIQA report.  I understand the hospital has a system in place to manage actively all the processes that minimise the likelihood of Legionella bacteria being in the water supply.  This is to ensure a high level of protection for all patients and staff.  I am also informed that the hospital is compliant with the Legionella L8 approved code of practice.  It is worth noting that there have been no hospital-acquired infections associated with Legionella bacteria at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to mention some of the measures that are in place at the hospital to ensure the quality of water supply.  Water quality at the hospital is managed and governed by a multidisciplinary group that includes a consultant microbiologist.  Copper-silver treatment of water is undertaken to eliminate Legionella bacteria.  The flushing of all low-use outlets is in place on a daily basis.  The efficiency of treatment processes is subject to ongoing measurement, with monthly sampling of water.  The Deputy asked how often it is sampled.  Additional external independent sampling of the water supply for Legionella takes place in accordance with the national standard.  Monthly random testing is done at the point of water supply.  I understand that in the past year, three samples have returned with a bacterial level that is higher than accepted norms.  In all cases, the reasons for this have been identified and remedial action has been taken.  The hospital has taken other steps to address issues arising from the HIQA report, including completing minor maintenance works, undertaking risk assessment in relation to access to sinks and making improvements with regard to staff training, audit and information display to ensure compliance with hygiene standards.<\/p>  <p>  I assure the House that the senior management team at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital has an internal audit programme to assess compliance with the standards.  The hospital is committed to providing health care services in an environment that maximises safety, quality and accountability and drives a culture of responsibility and accountability among all staff involved.  The Deputy raised a number of additional questions that were not necessarily outlined in his initial submission for this Topical Issue debate.  I will try to get all those answers for the Deputy over the next day or two and I will bring back his requests to the Minister, Deputy Varadkar.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100600031#DD00400","speaker":"1078"},{"type":"speech","time":1444151700,"counter":442,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response.

I fully accept that Ministers and Ministers of State can be drawn away somewhere else.  Their non-attendance can pose a problem, however, when we are discussing important issues.  There is no point in minimising this one.<\/p>  <p>  The subliminal message from the phrasing of the text of the reply read by the Minister of State is that we should move on because there is nothing to worry about or see here.  The reality is that there is.  The HIQA report identified issues that need to be addressed urgently.  I am sure it involves the expenditure of money on the plumbing and water supply and distribution systems within the hospital network.  I ask the Minister of State to convey to the Minister the sentiment of the House that this matter needs to be addressed urgently.  Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital is one of the busiest hospitals in the country.  It caters for a huge population in its catchment area.

I do not mean any disrespect to the Minister of State, Deputy English, when I say that.  It was rather difficult to find a relevant Minister this week.  Given that next week is budget week, I did not want to take the chance of losing this Topical Issue matter completely by deferring this debate.<\/p><p> While this is certainly a health issue, it is much more than that and it requires co-operation between the Departments of Health, Justice and Equality and Social Protection.  I know this is not confined to Dublin but that is what I will speak about because that is what I know.  The reality in Dublin is that communities are flooded with what are known as Z-drugs.  These tablets are being used with other drugs and with alcohol and are causing havoc and distress.  They are pushing people further into addiction and causing an awful lot of distress and pain for families and the wider community.  They contribute in a major way to anti-social behaviour and criminality.<\/p> <p> Communities are looking at young men - and it is mainly men, some of whom are only in their late teens - openly selling these Z tablets.  I could bring the Minister of State right now to a number of places in the north inner city where this open dealing is going on and he could buy whatever number of Z tablets he wanted.  I could also bring him to the people who are living beside this open dealing who will tell him about the nightmare of living beside it.  A very fine report was published some time ago, which all of the stakeholders in the various communities bought into, called A Better City for All.  While it makes wonderful suggestions and recommendations, glaring gaps persist, such as this one regarding tablets.  There is a lot of talking but no action on this matter.<\/p> <p> The Minister of State might say that this is a matter for the Garda, and it is, but its hands are completely tied because of the lack of appropriate legislation.  Garda&iacute; are being asked by the communities why they are allowing this drug dealing to continue.  The answer is that they are powerless to do anything.  Emergency legislation is needed, and I am reliably informed that if legislation were enacted to deal with Z-drugs, places could be cleaned up in a week.  We would all like to see more garda&iacute; on our streets, but in this case more garda&iacute; is not the answer unless legislation is enacted which will enable them to do their work.  Unfortunately, it would appear that these working class communities that are devastated by drugs are not high on the priority list.<\/p> <p> The difficulty is that there are two relevant Acts here, one being the Irish Medicines Board Act, which was amended in 2006, and the other being the Misuse of Drugs Act, but they contain loopholes.  Neither Act is appropriate to deal with tablets because tablets are not controlled drugs.  At the moment, if a garda has a reasonable suspicion that somebody is engaging in drug dealing, he or she can search that person.  However, if tablets are found, the garda must give one third back to the person so that he or she can do his or her own individual testing.  The issue of tablets has never been addressed and in the meantime it continues.  It is causing havoc in communities.  People are looking at this open drug dealing going on in their areas but they are not overly concerned as to whether it is heroin, ecstasy, cocaine or cannabis.  They are concerned about the actual dealing, which is all part of that same milieu or world of drugs.  It is open and blatant, but the hands of garda&iacute; are tied.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100600031#DD00800","speaker":"1005","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1444152300,"counter":447,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy O'Sullivan for raising this issue.  She will be aware that the Minister of State with responsibility for the national drugs strategy, Deputy Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, is out of the country and unable to respond personally.  The Government's response to the problem of drug misuse in our society is set out in the National Drugs Strategy 2009-16.  The Minister of State is aware that in recent years the nature and scale of drug misuse has changed, with an increased prevalence of polydrug use and the use of Z-drugs, benzodiazepines and other prescription or non-prescription tablets, as Deputy O'Sullivan has just outlined.  Treatment figures for 2013 indicate an increase in the number of people seeking treatment for benzodiazepine use.<\/p>  <p>  Z-drugs are prescription medicines and, as such, may be supplied by a registered pharmacist only on foot of a prescription.  It is an offence to supply them by mail order.  While it is not an offence to receive them, recipients are not entitled to possess them, and this provision is availed of by customs officers and the Health Products Regulatory Authority to confiscate such medicines.  Some medicines, including Z-drug Zipeprol, are subject to stricter controls under the misuse of drugs regulations because of their high potential for abuse and misuse.<\/p>  <p>  A substantial amendment to the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 1988 to introduce additional controls on benzodiazepines and Z-drugs was the subject of a consultation process.  It included the introduction of import and export controls and tighter prescribing and dispensing rules.  While substantial work was done on drafting these amended regulations, departmental resources had to be reallocated to deal with a challenge to the constitutionality of section 2(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977, under which the Government declares substances to be controlled under the Act.  The Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Act 2015 was enacted in March 2015 following an adverse finding by the Court of Appeal.<\/p>  <p>  The 2015 Act also reconfirmed existing ministerial regulations and orders made under the 1977 Act, including the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 1988.  This means that amendments are required to the Misuse of Drugs Act before any new regulations can be made.  Work is under way on drafting a second Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Bill to amend sections of the 1977 Act.  The Bill is listed in the Government's legislative programme for publication in 2016.<\/p>  <p>  Of course, it is important to point out that the problem of abuse of Z-drugs will not be solved by regulations alone and that prescribers need to ensure that these controlled substances are only prescribed as appropriate and for a very limited time.  Clinical guidelines are set out in the Department of Health's document, Good Practice Guidelines for Clinicians, for the prescribing of benzodiazepines.  The HSE's addiction services provide a comprehensive substance treatment service orientated towards those with polydrug issues.  Consequently, problem drug users attending such services who are dependent on benzodiazepines or Z-drugs have this addressed as part of their treatment.  Clinical protocols for benzodiazepine treatment are currently under consideration by the national clinical effectiveness committee, and some HSE addiction services are piloting these protocols.  The Department of Health is beginning work on the development of a new national drugs strategy.  The process will include a comprehensive consultation with key stakeholders and the public on the current national drugs policy and future priorities, including treatment.  Along with my colleague, the Minister of State Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, I would urge all interested parties to engage in the process.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy O'Sullivan is right that there is no one solution to this problem.  It will require a combination of efforts from several Departments.  It is not just a question of more garda&iacute; or more legislation.  A co-ordinated effort is required to tackle this problem.

That was the gist of the answer I received.  I was also told that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to work closely with all of the relevant State agencies, but I have just outlined what garda&iacute; are saying to me.

This problem has come out of the blue.  Supervisors of community employment schemes are discovering when renewing insurance premiums that the cost of insurance has increased by exorbitant sums.  Some have been quoted a threefold increase in the cost of insurance, which is unprecedented.  In addition, no indication is being given for the reasons these increases are being introduced at this time.<\/p><p>Community employment schemes employ approximately 23,000 people nationwide.  Increases in insurance premiums have become a feature of community employment schemes in the north inner city of Dublin.  These increases are of major concern to stand-alone community employment schemes which do not have the wherewithal to pay them, whereas other schemes engaged in a broad area of activity may be able to soak up the increase.<\/p><p>The materials grant provides the funding used to pay insurance premiums.

Allianz is the predominant company engaged in quoting insurance for community employment schemes, at least in the area I represent.  This means competition is limited.  The insurance industry should be consulted on this matter with a view to ensuring there is greater competition in this area.  The Department must engage with the insurance companies to determine the grounds on which a threefold increase in premiums is being sought.  To cite one example, the cost of insurance for the Dublin Adult Learning Centre, of which I am a director, has increased from &euro;1,250 to &euro;3,750 per annum.  This quote came completely out of the blue.  The centre provides schemes which have never lodged claims against the insurance industry.  It is not a question of some bad claims being made and the company seeking to recoup some of the expenditure it has made.  For this reason, it will be necessary to determine from Allianz the reason for the sudden increase in insurance premiums.<\/p><p>Will it be possible in the short term for the Department to meet some of the additional insurance costs being incurred by community employment schemes?

I understand the reason the Deputy, as a director of the centre, community activist and public representative for Dublin, is concerned about the issue.<\/p>  <p>  Community employment schemes are required to procure annual liability insurance to cover their schemes.  In recent months, sponsors have been advising the Department of increases in insurance premiums for schemes.  The main reasons for these increases advised to the Department when this was queried with the insurance companies were claims cost inflation, an increase in claims frequency in recent years, changes in the courts' jurisdiction, and a reduction in income from insurers' investments. <\/p>  <p>  The Department has been in consultation with the main insurers of community employment schemes about the increases with a view to ameliorating them and seeking to limit the incidence of future claims.  The Department recommends, in the first instance, that scheme sponsors seek alternative quotes to ensure they obtain value for money.<\/p>  <p>  Insurance premium costs continue to be reimbursed from the community employment materials grants.

The industry provided four reasons for the increase in the cost of insurance premiums, namely, claims cost inflation, an increase in claims frequency in recent years, changes in the courts' jurisdiction, and reductions in income from insurers' investments.  It would be interesting to have these factors quantified by the insurance companies.  The reasons given appear impressive and suggest that there has been a significant increase in the number of claims before the courts and so forth.<\/p>  <p>  Will the Department request a breakdown of the factors allegedly behind the increase in premiums?  If it is the case that the cost of claims has increased, why have premiums suddenly increased threefold when one would expect them to increase on a phased basis?  Did the increase in claims take place last year?  Surely it occurred over a period of years, which would result in a gradual increase in premiums.<\/p>  <p>  The insurance companies involved are trying to put community employment schemes out of business.  If a standalone scheme whose only source of income is the moneys allocated under the materials budget is unable to secure an increase in the materials grant to cover the cost of an increase in insurance premiums, it will find itself in difficulty.  It will certainly be in a negative position with its bank and the materials grant it receives in 2016 may not cover outgoings it makes in 2015.<\/p>  <p>  This is a serious problem.  It would be worthwhile inviting the industry to a meeting and encouraging it to engage more competitively in this area.  A number of companies should quote rather than the limited number which quote currently.  We must ensure the viability of any community employment scheme is not threatened by increases in insurance premiums.  As the Minister of State noted, these schemes provide significant employment, support and experience for approximately 23,000 people.  Moreover, participants change every couple of years.  Community employment is at the cutting edge in terms of offering people who are unemployed an opportunity to re-engage with employment.  Every effort must be made to ensure nothing undermines these schemes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100600033#FF00400","speaker":"1006"},{"type":"speech","time":1444152900,"counter":454,"content":"<p>It would be interesting and helpful to seek a breakdown of the factors cited by the insurance industry, although obtaining such a breakdown may be another matter.

I have no doubt that she has a list the length of her arm of people who want new schools and new school buildings and I imagine the pressure on her at the moment is severe.  However, it would be wrong to fail to raise the issue of Athenry vocational school with the Minister today.  The school has been promised a new school building for many years.  While the Minister will probably tell me in her reply how much the process has moved on with the location of a site and work to purchase it, the matter has been going on for so long that there is great frustration among parents, students and many others in the Athenry hinterland.  We have heard for so long how close we were to getting a new school.  At one stage, it was believed that parents, pupils and teachers would walk through the front door of a brand new school on 1 September 2014.  That certainly did not happen.<\/p>  <p>  A great deal of good work has been done in the background, and I pay special tribute to Councillor Peter Feeney, who spent so much time trying to find the site for the new vocational school, but there is a great deal of frustration out there that this is not moving as quickly as it should.  We are getting a lot of people saying it is very close or nearly there, but no one is willing to say what the timeline is, when the land will be purchased, when building will commence and when the school will move in.  After meeting two weeks ago with the principal and some of the teachers, I note that what we really want today are answers.  A further consideration is that in a town the size of Athenry, the Presentation school and the gaelscoil are also looking for new buildings.  The CSO figures show that Athenry is a booming town, the population of which continues to grow.  Apple is going to make a massive investment in the next year.  This is an area that is going places, but Athenry is short of the new schools it desperately needs.  We must start to set out a very clear plan for the town of Athenry's building programmes and when they will start.  We must move away from hearsay and maybes.  The site is there and we need it to be purchased.  We need to know when it will be purchased and when building will start.

The Deputy is aware of the demographic challenge facing the education system in the coming years.  Funding under my Department's five-year construction plan is focused on meeting demographic demands to ensure that every child has access to a physical school place and that our school system is in a position to accommodate increasing pupil numbers.  This involves prioritising school building projects in areas where demographic demand is projected to exceed the level of accommodation available.<\/p>  <p>  Athenry has been identified as an area of demographic growth.  In that regard, a major project to provide a new school building for Gairmscoil Mhuire, Athenry, to cater for 1,000 pupils has been included in the current five-year construction plan announced in 2012.  A new site is required to accommodate this new school building.  The Deputy will be aware that I signed a memorandum of understanding between my Department and the County and City Managers' Association in 2012.  The memorandum of understanding fosters increased levels of co-operation and formalises the role of local authorities in identifying and securing sites for educational use.  In general, the first step in a site acquisition process is the identification of a number of suitable sites by the relevant local authority.  The identified sites are then technically assessed on a joint basis by officials from the local authority and my Department.  Subsequently, a valuation of the preferred site is procured and negotiations with the landowner are opened.  Such negotiations may encompass the resolution of complex technical issues and, in that context, can be lengthy.  Once agreement in principle with the landowner has been reached, the legal conveyancing process commences.<\/p>  <p>  In this instance, my Department has worked closely with Galway County Council towards acquiring a permanent site to meet the needs of the school.  In the course of the site acquisition process, some matters arose which required further technical assessment and consideration.  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that all of these technical matters have now been addressed to the extent that the site acquisition can proceed.  I have been informed by my officials that, subject to no issues arising, it is expected that contracts can be signed shortly.  I am afraid I have to use the word \"shortly,\" even though the Deputy wants something more specific.  It will then be possible for the project to proceed to architectural planning.  I assure the Deputy that the project to provide a new permanent building for Gairmscoil Mhuire, Athenry, will be progressed as soon as possible.  Officials from my Department will be in contact with Galway and Roscommon Education and Training Board in that regard as soon as the site acquisition is completed.  I thank the Deputy again for giving me the opportunity to outline to the Dail the current position regarding the site, although I am not sure I have told him anything he did not already know.

It describes the force size rather than its role and is a standard technical military term for a battalion-sized force with support elements comprising 1,500 personnel.  Their role is to provide an initial entry force in a crisis management or humanitarian situation or to reinforce an existing mission.  They would be better described as a rapid response group or a peace management force.  EU battle groups have a readiness to deploy within five to ten days on a range of possible missions, sustainable for 30 days and extendable to 120 days.<br\/><br\/>I will briefly outline the background to Ireland's participation in the German battle group.  The ambition of the EU is to be able to respond rapidly to emerging crises.  This is a key objective in the continued development of the EU's Common Security and Defence Policy, CDSP.  The purpose of the battle groups is to undertake operations known as the Petersberg Tasks.  These include, <i>inter alia<\/i>, humanitarian and rescue tasks, peacekeeping tasks, joint disarmament operations, military advice, conflict prevention and post-conflict stabilisation.<br\/><br\/>A central tenet of Irish foreign policy is support for the multilateral system of collective security represented by the United Nations.  In this regard, Ireland has worked to uphold the primary role of the Security Council in the maintenance of international peace and security.  Our commitment has found expression in Ireland's long-standing tradition of participating in UN peacekeeping operations.  Participation in EU battle groups represents another means for Ireland to express our commitment to the UN and the maintenance of international peace and security.<br\/><br\/>Concerns are sometimes expressed that our participation in battle groups may pose a threat to our military neutrality.  This, of course, is not the case.  Ireland's traditional policy of military neutrality is unaffected by our participation.  The guarantees under the Lisbon treaty and Ireland's declaration make this clear.  We are not and will not become part of any military alliance or permanent military formation.  We will not enter into any mutual defence arrangement.  That position remains unchanged.  In the case of battle groups, each participant retains the right to deploy or not to deploy its forces irrespective of an EU decision to launch a battle group operation.  Equally, each battle group participant retains the sovereign right to withdraw its contingent at any time.  As such, any deployment of the Irish contribution as part of the German battle group will be subject to the triple lock, which Deputies understand.  It is also worth recalling the strong support of the UN for the EU's efforts in this regard.  During his visit to Ireland in May, the UN Secretary General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, commented positively on the EU-UN relationship and the importance of having a rapid reaction capacity.<br\/><br\/>While no battle group has deployed to date, which is much to the frustration of some nations, the EU battle group concept has yielded many benefits to developing improved interoperability between the Defence Forces and the forces of other EU member states.  Ireland's active engagement in battle groups and across the range of activity under the Union's CDSP enhances our capacity to influence the ongoing development and evolution of the rapid response capacity of the EU and helps to shape policy in a manner that is consistent with our values and our support of multilateralism and for the UN.<br\/><br\/>The Defence Forces' contribution to this battle group will only arise should the battle group be deployed to undertake an operation and should Ireland agree to participate.  The Defence Forces' commitment will involve a reconnaissance and intelligence company, together with staff posts at the operational and force headquarters.  The total number of Defence Forces personnel involved will be approximately 175.  Their role will be to generate and deliver specific information and intelligence to decision makers in support of the planning and conduct of operations.  Eight officers and two NCOs are deployed to the battle group headquarters in Strasbourg and engage in training and planning activities.<br\/><br\/>In summary, Ireland's participation in the battle group will continue to support the development of rapid deployment skills and capabilities within the Defence Forces, together with improved interoperability.  It will enhance Ireland's credibility as a provider of professional and effective military forces for crisis management operations and reinforce our standing and ability to influence the ongoing development of the CDSP in support of international peace and security and the EU's relationship with the UN.

In 2010, the most recent Fianna F&aacute;il defence Minister, Mr. Tony Killeen, stated: &quot;Ireland's participation in EU Battlegroups is a tangible means of showing our support for the EU as a provider of high quality peacekeepers to United Nations mandated operations.&quot;  We as a party reject any assertion that taking part in battle groups undermines our neutrality.  Rather, it is a way of bolstering our commitment to the United Nations.  The UN is the third strand of the triple lock, to which we remain committed.  We are strong and committed supporters of collective security through the UN.  In 1945, when we first applied to join it, &Eacute;amon de Valera observed:<\/p><blockquote>It is the small nations particularly that should welcome an organisation which is intended to give collective security.  But the small nations, just like the big ones, will, if they become members of such an organisation, have to be really loyal members of it.  They will have to make up their minds that the obligations which are necessary, if the organisation is to be successful, will be fulfilled and carried out.<\/blockquote><p>The EU battle group is a way of fulfilling that commitment.<\/p><p>Our Defence Forces are keen to participate in battle groups.  Ireland has a long tradition of overseas service in support of UN or UN-mandated deployments in pursuit of international peace and security since the first Defence Forces deployment abroad in 1958.  We are all aware of the high level of pride in and public recognition of the work that our Defences Forces do.  It is no harm to mention the work that our naval forces are currently engaged in in the Mediterranean.  The Defence Forces also provide personnel to the EU stand-by battle group rapid response brigades, even though no EU battle group has to date deployed into a mandated mission.<\/p><p>Overseas service deployments by the Defence Forces are a pivotal element of Irish foreign policy and for the attainment of Defence Forces operational capability across a wide spectrum of challenging military, geopolitical and geostrategic environments.  Defence Forces personnel of all ranks have and continue to excel in overseas deployments, be they at strategic, operational or tactical level.  The continued participation of Defence Forces units, contingents and individual members is essential for individual and unit professional development, unit operational viability and cohesion.<\/p><p>When contingents deploy, they must be in formations of sufficient strength and composition that the leadership functions of all ranks and military specialisations are fully maximised.  Deploying numbers of small units in different missions concurrently is not consistent with optimum operational capacity advancement or outputs once deployed.  A mix over time of &quot;ground holding&quot; and &quot;mission rapid reaction&quot; unit operational postures is the most beneficial strategically to the Defence Forces and the missions on which they operate.  The deployment of personnel from the Air Corps and the Naval Service in cohesive unit strength, along with their aircraft and ships as required, must be progressively and positively pursued as a means of contributing specialist unit capability to UN, UN-mandated or Chapter VIII missions.<\/p><p>Ongoing Defence Forces deployments in the Middle East, the Balkans and recently in Africa have increased linkages to Ireland's international wish to reinforce its political and diplomatic platforms and visibility, together with its concurrent economic and business connectivity and trade ambitions.  This ambition and action is consistent with Ireland's place in the world as a valued and trusted United Nations and European Union member.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100600035#HH00400","speaker":"1054","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1444154700,"counter":468,"content":"<p>I wish to formally oppose this motion and this deployment, which undermine Irish neutrality.

Our interpretation of sovereignty of the people and national self-determination includes the freedom to determine one's relationships with other nations.  This motion pertains to Ireland's participation in a EU battle group from July to December 2016 with Germany, Austria, Belgium, Luxembourg and Croatia.  Each of the 18 battle groups consists of a battalion-sized force of 1,500 troops reinforced with combat support elements.  The formation of battle groups allows the European Union to deploy troops and military equipment quickly to regions as far as 6,000 km from Brussels for a minimum of 30 days, which can be extended to 120 days if they are resupplied.  They are designed as a rapid reaction force that can deploy anywhere within that range, supposedly within six days.

To ensure we live in a safer and more equal world, increased military expenditure certainly is not a solution.  It is necessary to challenge structures that cause poverty and insecurity.  Many have tried to make a false distinction between neutrality and non-neutrality.  If a country is neutral, that does not mean it does nothing to help innocent civilians who are affected by war or does not try to tackle poverty, inequality and social injustice, which are the primary triggers for war.  A policy of positive neutrality would ensure this State would not increase its military spending, take part in the arms trade or profit from conflicts or wars.  Our focus should be on guaranteeing the economic, social, political and cultural rights of people worldwide while aiming to assist people to lift themselves out of poverty and hunger.

The issue is that in other European countries, the establishments need not pretend to be in favour of neutrality in the manner of Fine Gael, which occasionally doffs the hat towards neutrality while at the same time agitating against the policy of neutrality.

The key objective is not a secret at all, in that EU battle groups were set up to provide a military force directly under the control of the EU political elite and the EU structures that are dominant there.  It is part of an increased militarisation across Europe, and I must note that the Minister is in the camp of the hawks in this regard, very much accelerating the process.  The Minister is correct that it is not just a case of having the battle groups present; there is currently an acute drive to have them deployed against the backdrop of the drive towards increased EU military expenditure.  As Deputy Crowe noted, this is precisely at a time when austerity is raining on the heads of ordinary citizens.  If one takes the recent example of the Russian war planes accused of incursions over Turkey and the Baltic states, such events could spark an incident in which the German battle groups would be deployed, and Irish soldiers would be participating.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100600036#JJ01300","speaker":"1192"},{"type":"speech","time":1444154700,"counter":480,"content":"<p>They would not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100600036#JJ01400","speaker":"991"},{"type":"speech","time":1444154700,"counter":481,"content":"<p>I will cite Romano Prodi when he spoke of these issues and stated:<\/p><blockquote>When I was talking about [a] European Army [or a battle group], I was not joking.

The Bill will provide for the dissolution of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority and the transfer of its function to Dublin City Council, which will guide the future development of the area in partnership and collaboration with local stakeholders.  The Bill also provides for the establishment of a consultative forum to ensure that the views of interested parties in the docklands areas, including local communities, businesses and key local actors, will be recognised and considered in any future development of the area.  If you will indulge me for a few moments, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I will spend a little time reflecting on the growth, demise and restoration of the docklands area to what it is at present.<\/p>  <p>  From the preceding two centuries up to the 1960s, the docklands area was a vibrant port area for Dublin, servicing the import and export functions of the capital and, more widely, the country.  As a thriving port, it engendered the usual port-related industries such as boat-building, chandlery, rope-making and other ancillary trades.  It also contributed to the establishment of other industries, such as grain milling and storage, coal and fuel distribution, metal foundries and warehousing.  This gave rise to inner city employment and the establishment of an indigenous community servicing the needs of the enterprises located there.  Regrettably, in those times the standard of housing and accommodation for the residents of the docklands reflected the generally poor conditions that prevailed among the working classes in the city.  Notwithstanding this, the area had a rich cultural tradition which contributed to the unique character of Dublin, as reflected in the music, literature and other art forms from those times.<\/p>  <p>  The decline in docklands generally in the 1960s can be attributed mainly to two factors.  Freight containerisation led to a reduction in the need for manpower at the quayside, as well as the need for greater deep-water facilities to service the increasing tonnage of the vessels designed for this purpose.  Moreover, the demand for improved living standards for all our citizens in a modern economy led to the provision of better housing and a migration from the inner city to the new suburbs on the outskirts of the city.  Through this population shift, the inner city population in the 20th century shrank by over 50%, and most of the indigenous industries also relocated, mainly for reasons of access to the outskirts as well.  The Dublin docklands area went into decline, and by the 1980s many parts had become run down and abandoned.<\/p>  <p>  The first agency established to start redressing this situation was the Custom House Docks Development Authority, set up in 1986 to stimulate development on the north side of the docklands area.  It utilised a range of financial incentives to lure investment to the area.  Over the course of its ten-year existence it facilitated considerable office and residential development in the Custom House Quay area, most notably the establishment of the International Financial Services Centre, better known as the IFSC, which now comprises 111,500 sq. m and employs close to 5,000 people.<\/p><p> In order to widen the scope of the development of the entire docklands area, the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, DDDA, was established under the Dublin Docklands Development Authority Act 1997.  Covering a much larger area extending to both sides of the River Liffey, the DDDA was responsible for the sustainable social, economic and physical regeneration of the docklands, in addition to the continued development of the financial sector of the economy, and was required to prepare a master plan for achieving these objectives.  Central to this strategy was the use of fast-track planning under section 25 of the Act, which allowed for a shortening of the timeframes for approval of developments as long as proposals were aligned with the master plan and local planning schemes.  The master plan for the docklands allowed for the integrated and sustainable development of a once-neglected area of the city, with appropriate levels of community input and, as a consequence, substantial community gain. <\/p> <p> The input of various elements of the residential and business communities, as well as State entities with an interest in the docklands, was facilitated through their membership of the Docklands Council, which considered matters pertaining to the development of the docklands and the relationships that existed between them.  Through the nomination of community representatives and local elected officials, together with representatives from business, education, and other bodies, the voices of all were heard and heeded.  Further evidence of the commitment to local communities can be seen in the establishment of the Docklands Housing Trust, which was set up to administer social housing provision for the indigenous docklands population and has 72 housing units which it allocates within its remit.  I am pleased to confirm that the housing trust will continue this worthwhile endeavour under the new arrangements, with support from the housing division of Dublin City Council.<\/p> <p> Additionally, the Docklands Community Trust was established and was allocated funds on an incremental basis to invest in initiatives, supports and schemes to the benefit of the community.  Currently, that fund stands at &euro;1.3 million, and over the years the trust has used interest and earnings from its investments to finance community initiatives, most notably in the area of higher education grants for local students.  Again, I am pleased to say that the trust will continue to play this vital support role, albeit redirecting its benefits through the new docklands consultative forum, which will come into being under this dissolution Bill.<\/p> <p> The DDDA has contributed greatly to the redevelopment of the docklands environment over the years, and it is appropriate to reflect on its achievements.  Since its inception in 1997, what was once a derelict part of the city has been transformed into a vibrant neighbourhood and progressive economic area, housing some of the most prestigious international and domestic companies.  Of the original 89 ha encompassed by the IFSC, North Lotts and Grand Canal Dock areas, 67 ha have been redeveloped, with the 22 ha remaining now subject to the successor to the fast-track planning mechanism of the DDDA Act, the recently approved strategic development zone, SDZ, administered by Dublin City Council, which came in force in May 2014.  Most of the indigenous port-related industries have been replaced and the area is now a hive of activity, mainly involving international finance, thanks to the establishment and evolution of the IFSC and major international IT companies.  There has been significant social regeneration of the area and the vibrant local community is central to its continuing development.  Under the projections for its development, the population is expected to swell by almost 6,000 in the coming years.  The interests of the residents are central to the integrated and sustainable growth of that community.  Through the involvement of representatives on the docklands community forum, as well as of local public representatives on Dublin City Council, those interests will continue to be recognised and nurtured.  The area has also become a hub for the entertainment sector, with a number of spectacular venues playing host to domestic and international talent.  In general, it can be said that what was once a run-down area of Dublin has been transformed into a modern and remodelled living environment.<\/p> <p> The economic crash that hit our economy in 2008 was chiefly generated by an overheated building and property sector.  This Administration, since coming into office, has strived to redress the inadequacies in financial, planning and building regulation while simultaneously pursuing policies to kick-start a moribund building industry.  Just as a rising tide lifts all boats, so too does an ebbing tide see them all lower again, and the DDDA was no exception to this rule.  The misfortune that befell the sector also saw it suffer significant losses on projects that had seemed like blue ribbon investments back in the heady days of the development boom. <\/p> <p> Following consideration of a special report on the DDDA prepared by the Comptroller and Auditor General and the authority&rsquo;s own 2011 annual report and financial statements, the Government made the difficult but correct decision that the authority should be wound up and that the future responsibility and co-ordination of activity in the area should revert to Dublin City Council, ensuring that we keep the best of what has worked and plan a new approach and strategy for the further development and enhancement of the docklands.<\/p> <p> Elements of the Comptroller and Auditor General's special report made for grim reading, particularly those relating to the authority&rsquo;s assessment and decision-making processes surrounding its decision in 2006 to become involved in the purchase of the former Irish Glass Bottle site, an episode which has cost the authority &euro;52 million, not to mention the associated reputational damage.  In regard to the 2011 annual report and financial statements, while it was of course welcome to see the authority having recorded a small surplus, its first for several years, the future financial outlook for the authority presented a very different picture.  Indeed, the reality emerging from the 2011 financial statements and the special report was that the authority&rsquo;s financial position was inevitably going to remain very challenging in the short to medium term, given the economic downturn and the stressed state of the property market, from which the DDDA has historically derived its main revenues.<\/p> <p> Taking all of these factors into account, the inescapable conclusion was that a standalone DDDA was no longer viable, financially or otherwise.  It is for these reasons that the Government decided on 29 May 2012 that the authority should be wound up.  In taking this decision, the Government was acutely aware of the need to maintain and build on the good work of the authority.  The Government remains fully committed to the continued regeneration of the Dublin docklands as an ambitious and visionary project.<\/p> <p> A number of key objectives were central to the process of finalising appropriate arrangements for ensuring a continued, concerted focus on the docklands regeneration initiatives.  They were: maintaining and enhancing the docklands brand and international marketability as an attractive and prime location for investment and high-value development; providing for an appropriate set of fast-track planning procedures; continuing to involve the local community and the business sector in the regeneration project; and facilitating job creation.  The Government decided that Dublin City Council is best placed to continue the visionary docklands project.  The development of docklands in the future will, therefore, be part of the integrated forward planning section of Dublin city as a whole within the remit of the city council.<\/p> <p> Let me now turn to the Bill before this House and its key provisions.  As the wind-up process of the DDDA took effect, it became clear that significant primary legislation would be needed to resolve many of the outstanding issues and ensure the continued development of the docklands area.  This is, in effect, what this Bill is providing for. <\/p> <p> The Bill is divided into five Parts.  Part 1 deals standard legislative provisions, including citation, commencement, definitions, regulations and expenses of the Minister.  Part 2 deals with the dissolution of the authority.  Part 3 deals with the matters that will apply following the dissolution of the DDDA and the transfer of its functions to Dublin City Council.  Part 4 deals with planning and development matters.  Part 5 deals with the establishment of the docklands consultative forum.  The Bill went through a very thorough pre-legislative scrutiny process by the Joint Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  This was a very useful process and I have endeavoured to incorporate many of their recommendations into the Bill.<\/p> <p> In Part 1 of the Bill, section 1 contains the usual provisions of a general nature dealing with such matters as the Short Title, collective citation and commencement.  Section 2 provides the definitions used throughout the Act and deals with matters such as defining the Dublin docklands area, the master plan, the docklands planning schemes and public authority, among others.  Sections 3 and 4 contain standard legislative provisions regarding such matters as regulations and expenses of the Minister.<\/p> <p> Part 2 of the Bill provides, in sections 5 and 6, for the dissolution of the authority on a day to be appointed by the Minister and provides that the authority shall stand dissolved on the appointed dissolution day.<\/p> <p> Part 3 of the Bill - sections 7 to 15, inclusive - provides for the seamless transition of functions and transfer of certain liabilities and assets to Dublin City Council.  It is important that the development and oversight of the docklands area continues uninterrupted and that the momentum that has come back into the economy in recent years is harnessed to deliver impetus to the area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100600038#LL00600","speaker":"1092","continuing":true}]
