A new energy White Paper, which my Department is currently in the process of finalising, will set out Ireland&rsquo;s energy policy up to 2030, framed in the context of broader EU energy policy as articulated in both the energy union strategy and the EU's Framework 2030 for coherent climate and energy policies.  The overall objective of the Energy White Paper is to provide a coherent, joined-up policy statement aimed at ensuring that Ireland has an energy system that will support the transition to a low-carbon society and economy by 2050.  While a range of measures will be needed to support this transition, including the increased use of renewable energy, we have already made significant progress, with an estimated 22.7% of electricity generated from renewable sources in 2014.  The Government remains committed to implementing measures to achieve Ireland's 2020 renewable energy targets.<\/p>  <p>  The White Paper process started with a Green Paper on energy policy in Ireland, published in May 2014.  An extensive consultation process was undertaken on this Green Paper, including a ten-week written consultation process, resulting in 1,240 submissions, and 11 focused seminars nationwide.  This provided significant opportunity for the public, business and industry to have an input into the policy development process.<\/p>  <p>  This consultation was augmented by discussions between my Department and other Government Departments aimed at ensuring a whole-of-Government approach to the development of the energy White Paper.

In July of this year, I published a detailed draft intervention strategy for public consultation.  That strategy proposes that the State-funded network must be capable of delivering high-quality, high-speed broadband with a minimum download speed of at least 30 Mbps and a minimum upload speed of at least 6 Mbps.  It must be capable of catering for higher performance in the future to keep pace with consumer demand.  This will be a specific requirement of the tender.

We will allow bidders to show how they propose to meet these contractual requirements.  Given the quality of the services we wish to see delivered and based on the current absence of significant fibre networks in many parts of Ireland, it is likely that fibre will play a major role in any proposed solution.

The Government is determined to ensure the network is built as quickly as possible.  Engagement with industry stakeholders has indicated that this could be achieved within three to five years of the award of the contract.

In Mr. Delaney's view, smaller companies were grossly discriminated against in the tendering process.  For example, bidding companies were required to have an annual turnover of &euro;40 million.  I am aware of similar requirements in other areas of Government procurement.  Why was Mr. Delaney's innovative and free postcode system not considered?  Why did we end up with such an expense?

The 2009 EU renewable energy directive set Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our energy requirements from renewable sources by 2020.  In order to do that, Ireland is committed to meeting 40% of electricity demand from renewables, 12% renewables in the heating sector and 10% in transport.  While we have made good progress with regard to renewable energy deployment, significant challenges remain, particularly in the heat and transport sectors.  Provisional figures provided by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, for 2014 show that 8.6% of Ireland's overall energy requirement was met by renewable energy.  In addition, the SEAI has calculated that, in 2014, some 22.7% of electricity, 6.6% of heat and 5.2% of transport were met from renewable sources.  Less than 0.1% of electricity is generated from solar photovoltaic, PV, installations.<\/p>  <p>  In setting an overall target for electricity from renewable sources, the Government has not set specific targets for given renewable technologies.  To date, wind energy, as the most cost-effective technology available to Ireland, has been the largest driver of growth in renewable electricity generation.  The Government recognises, however, that wind must be complemented by other policies to meet our renewable energy ambitions.  In addition to our onshore wind resource, bioenergy, solar and other technologies may play a critical role in diversifying our renewable generation portfolio over the period to 2030.<\/p>  <p>  To support the use of renewable electricity and heat further, my Department launched two consultations on 31 July on proposed support schemes, one for renewable electricity and one for a renewable heat incentive.

Our success in regard to onshore wind energy is clear.  We just have to be careful.  Solar energy is certainly becoming much cheaper.  The Deputy is absolutely correct that prices are tumbling all over the world, with China leading the fray in regard to the manufacturing of solar technology.  The questions to be asked are whether we should intervene with a subsidy and how best we can protect the consumer.  Obviously, we do not want to hold back too long because the technology can get ahead of us.

The issues are very serious, and the Taoiseach will recall the background to them.  The sale of Siteserv to a Denis O'Brien-owned company at a loss of &euro;119 million to the taxpayer was the prime catalyst for the initiation of the inquiry into that deal and other deals about which it subsequently emerged senior civil servants in the Department of Finance had concerns.  It is fair to say the Government was dragged kicking and screaming to the stage of establishing an inquiry.  There was reluctance and, indeed, a refusal to answer parliamentary questions.

The doggedness and tenacity of Deputy Catherine Murphy are to be commended in that regard.  All along, there was reluctance.<\/p><p>KPMG, the company that advised on the sale of Siteserv originally, was asked by the Minister for Finance to conduct the inquiry, incredible as that now seems.  Eventually, with all the opposition, he capitulated and handed it over to the Taoiseach who appointed Mr. Justice Daniel O'Keeffe.  A month later, Mr. Justice O'Keeffe had to withdraw for personal reasons and Mr. Justice Brian Cregan was appointed to the chair.

That is my opening position.  The Department of the Taoiseach is the receiving Department for reports from Mr. Justice Cregan in respect of this matter.  Discussions would have taken place when Mr. Justice O'Keeffe was dealing with this because he was beginning to handle it at that stage.  He then had to retire because of personal reasons and, as Deputy Martin pointed out, Mr. Justice Cregan has taken over.<\/p>  <p>  For the information of the House, at its Cabinet meeting today, the Government reaffirmed its commitment to ensuring that there be a full and independent investigation of the issues that were raised in relation to the IBRC matter and the transactions therein.  The Attorney General briefed the Government on a number of legal issues and potential options that are open to ensure this can be achieved.  The Government noted that a number of significant legal issues arise which need consideration.<\/p>  <p>  I will briefly set out for Members of the House the sequence of events.  On 9 June, following consultation by the Minister for Finance with the Opposition parties, the Government approved the draft order establishing the commission of investigation into certain matters concerning transactions entered into by IBRC.  The draft order was then laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and approved, following debate in both Houses.  Subsequently, on 15 June, the Government established the commission.  Following the resignation of Mr. Justice O'Keeffe for personal reasons, Mr. Justice Cregan was appointed as chair of the commission on 9 July.  I was designated as the responsible Minister under the Act so the judge sends his formal reports to me and his work is funded through the Vote of my Department.  He is completely independent in the conduct of his investigation.<\/p>  <p>  Last Thursday, 5 November, Mr. Justice Cregan and his legal team met, at his request, with officials from my Department and the Office of the Attorney General.  At that meeting he outlined legal issues he had considered in relation to the use of documents which were either confidential or subject to legal privilege and stated that he had made a determination in this regard.  The official asked that his position be outlined urgently in writing to me as the responsible Minister under the Commissions of Investigation Act.  The determination by the judge was not given to my Department at that meeting although it was sent by Mr. Justice Cregan to the Department of Finance later that day and therefore has been available to the Attorney General for her consideration of the matter.<\/p>  <p>  I received a letter from Mr. Justice Cregan the following day, last Friday, 6 November.  This letter referred to the determination of the judge and the commission on issues of confidentiality and privilege, which means that, in the words of the letter, \"it is not in a position to proceed with this investigation into any of the relevant write-off transactions\".  The letter also stated that the commission is in the process of preparing an interim report to me, as the specified Minister, which will outline the work of the commission to date and the issues which have arisen.  It will also seek an extension of time for the completion of the work of the commission.  The interim report can be finalised only after the commission has consulted any person who is identified in or identifiable from the draft report.<\/p>  <p>  On receipt of that letter from Mr. Justice Cregan, I immediately requested advice from the Attorney General on the implications of this determination and the legal options that are open to ensure the House can have an investigation which is fully transparent and accountable and that can be completed in an effective and timely manner.  I will arrange to have the judge's letter published today.<\/p>  <p>  The Government was informed this morning that Mr. Justice Cregan has decided to publish his determination both in respect of the issue of confidentiality in regard to the special liquidator and the Department of Finance.  I understand this has been done and I welcome the judge's decision to publish in order that all concerned can debate in a transparent fashion the issues involved.<\/p>  <p>  The Government was also informed this morning of a request from Mr. Justice Cregan that it would be preferable for the Government to receive his interim report before deciding on the course of action it should take.  This is also the view of the Attorney General who cannot, in fairness, give formal legal advice to the Cabinet in the absence of the judge's interim report.  I understand that the report should be available shortly as the consultations were under way and dealt with on Friday last.<\/p>  <p>  The importance of the issue - the question of confidentiality and legal professional privilege - raises extensive legal issues which have been considered in detail by the commission over recent months.  Given that importance, that the terms of reference for the commission were prepared following consultation with the Opposition parties, and that the order establishing the commission was approved by the Houses of the Oireachtas, I believe the questions that have arisen should be considered by all the parties and the Members of the House before a decision is made on the best way to proceed.<\/p>  <p>  I also hope Mr. Justice Cregan will be in a position to submit his interim report to me formally, as the receiving Minister, at the earliest possible date.  I will then commit to publishing that in accordance with the law and also to discussing it with Opposition Members and in the House in order that we can identify what needs to be done following the judicial determination and move on to achieve the ambition of accountable, transparent analysis of all the transactions in what was in excess of a &euro;10 million write-off.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111000018#Q00800","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1447170900,"counter":148,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach did not answer any of the questions I asked.

Will the Taoiseach please explain why the Department of Finance is doing that?  It was confirmed by its officials yesterday.  In that very decision, clearly being aware that this was an issue for some time, the former IBRC chairman, Alan Dukes, is confirming he discussed it with the chairman of the investigation two months ago.<\/p><p>On 22 August, an article<i><\/i>on these issues was published in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>.  Did the Attorney General, in her advice to Government, flag this issue with the Taoiseach at any stage prior to the establishment of the commission of investigation?<\/p><p>There must have been advice at that stage, so will the Taoiseach now publish it?  It seems incredible - it does not seem credible - that these substantive issues were not raised with the Government and the Taoiseach in advance of the setting up of the commission of investigation.

Can the Taoiseach clarify that?<\/p> <p> Why has the Department of Finance refused to waive its rights?  We have an extraordinary situation, it seems, from the evidence of Mr. Dukes, whereby KPMG, a State-appointed liquidator to the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, is claiming privilege over these documents, as is the Department of Finance.  This relates to the activities of a State bank handling assets belonging to the people and involving write-offs concerning the people.<\/p> <p> The public generally will be looking at this with the view that when it comes to the powerful and wealthy the Government never really goes too far with the inquiries.  That is a problem in terms of the public's perception of how obstacle after obstacle can be put in the way of getting to some truths about basic issues raised.  These issues were first seriously alerted to the public, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance by senior civil servants in the Department of Finance.  It was not media hype, as some would suggest.  It was done by senior civil servants in the Department of Finance.  They flagged real concerns to the Minister, Deputy Noonan, some time back on the sale of Siteserv and the sale of other assets.  However, the Government chose to do nothing about those concerns until it was forced into the open through freedom of information requests.  That is the sad reality.  The Government was dragged kicking and screaming to where we are today.  Again, we are empty-handed in terms of any succour for the general public and their wish to know what went on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111000018#Q01100","speaker":"992","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1447171500,"counter":152,"content":"<p>I wish to make the point to Deputy Martin, as I did before, that Fianna F&aacute;il was forthright in welcoming the setting up of the commission of investigation into certain matters relating to IBRC.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111000019#R00200","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1447171500,"counter":153,"content":"<p>Answer the question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111000019#R00300","speaker":"1071"},{"type":"speech","time":1447171500,"counter":154,"content":"<p>I made the point that the establishment of the statutory investigation was a rare victory for our parliamentary democracy.

The reason it does not have any credibility is that every time issues have been raised about IBRC the Taoiseach has done what he did today: he has stonewalled.<\/p>  <p>  In 2012 Deputy Pearse Doherty and I submitted a range of parliamentary questions about IBRC.  The responses from the Government, including the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance, were obstructive and unhelpful.  That is despite the fact, as it later emerged, that the Minister for Finance was briefed by his own officials on their concerns about this deal and other deals involving IBRC.  It is despite IBRC's having sold Siteserv to a Denis O'Brien company at a loss to taxpayers of at least &euro;105 million.  It was only as a result of An Teachta Catherine Murphy's efforts that we found out the O'Brien company was not the highest bidder.  The Government would not tell us that.  The Government also resisted the calls for a commission.  Then, when the Government eventually published the terms of reference for the commission, I wrote to the Taoiseach on 4 June pointing out that the terms of reference did not deal comprehensively with all the issues the commission would need to examine.  An Teachta Mary Lou McDonald met the Minister for Finance and made the same case.  The Taoiseach was well warned that the scope of the investigation was not wide enough to carry out the necessary examinations.<\/p>  <p>  What advice did the Taoiseach receive from the Attorney General in respect of the commission's ability to examine confidential or privileged documents?  Did this include documents from the Department of Finance?  I am keen for the Taoiseach to repeat what he said in his statement a moment ago, because I do not want to make a mistake about it.  He said that the commission had made a judicial determination on the admissibility of documents from the special liquidator.  I heard that much.  I think the Taoiseach went on to say \"and the Department of Finance\".

As the months progressed the questions extended into the wider issues surrounding IBRC and how it handled certain transactions.  Ultimately, the questions moved to the dysfunctional relationship between IBRC and the Department of Finance.<\/p>  <p>  IBRC had one remit, namely, to ensure that citizens got the maximum return possible for the &euro;35 billion they were forced to pump into banks, primarily the failed Anglo Irish Bank.  We want assurances, for example, as to whether the &euro;119 million written off when Siteserv was sold to Denis O'Brien was in fact the best decision for Irish citizens.  Some five months on from the establishment of the commission, we are at a stalemate.<\/p>  <p>  Ironically, the special liquid liquidator, Kieran Wallace, the person whom the Department originally wanted to conduct a review into the Siteserv issue, is now claiming privilege and refusing to co-operate fully.  Over the past 24 hours the public interest director of IBRC has taken to the airwaves to express concern about the injustice that will be perpetrated on the board of IBRC and its reputation if the commission collapses.  What about the injustice perpetrated against Irish citizens, in a situation where the public bailed out the bank but cannot know how the assets were disposed of?  That is the real injustice.<\/p>  <p>  It appears that the balance of law falls on protecting individuals rather than the common good.  How can that be right or even constitutional?  Was that even considered when the inquiry was established?  The Minister, Deputy Noonan, can claim that his Department has provided unredacted documents, but he is providing them inside a circle of confidentiality.  If he is providing documents, but placing significant restrictions on them, how can he claim that he is co-operating fully?<\/p>  <p>  Can the Taoiseach confirm whether any debtor involved in any of the transactions has threatened legal action if the commission proceeds?  Can he confirm if the Minister, Deputy Noonan, is co-operating fully in a way that will allow the findings to be available for full public consumption?  When did the Taoiseach first know of the problems with the commission?  Apparently letters have been flying around for the past few months between the parties concerned.  Articles in newspapers have been written by Cliff Taylor and John Walsh.  Alan Dukes has known about it since August.<\/p><p>Does the Taoiseach's Department read these newspapers?  Would that have been discussed?  Would the Taoiseach have been kept in the loop on this issue?  Will he tell us what he means by \"as soon as possible\"?  The 2004 Act allowed for the setting up of these inquiries to replace very time-consuming and expensive tribunals.  Does the Taoiseach agree that if he wanted to shut down debate on a particular topic the best way to do so would be to set up a commission of inquiry, because there can be no parliamentary questions, no freedom of information requests, no questions to the Taoiseach and no press inquiries?  Unfortunately, in this case it appears that we do not even have an inquiry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111000020#S01000","speaker":"1202","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1447172700,"counter":201,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Murphy.

I am quite sure everybody supports a facility for absolute transparency, accountability and so on in the public interest.

Nobody - with one exception, I think - referred to the word \"confidentiality\" during the discussions that took place on the terms of reference for this inquiry and nobody pointed out what all Deputies now know to a great extent and are very knowledgeable about.

In that letter he pointed to the fact that a body of work had been done by the commission of investigation in respect of the special liquidators, that he had received their assertion of confidentiality over all the documents they had submitted, that a similar claim of confidentiality and privilege was made by the Department of Finance over some of the documentation received from it, and that the commission was proposing to have a similar determination drafted as it did for the special liquidator.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111000021#T00200","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1447172700,"counter":202,"content":"<p>This is outrageous.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111000021#T00300","speaker":"992"},{"type":"speech","time":1447172700,"counter":203,"content":"<p>They are published on the website for the Deputies' perusal.

He pointed out that the interim report would outline in detail the work of the commission to date and would also deal with issues that have arisen.  I assume that Mr. Justice Cregan, in the interest of carrying out his business in a transparent and accountable fashion, will point out the recommendations he sees as appropriate for the Oireachtas or the Legislature, in whatever fashion, to allow him continue to do that.

Can the Taoiseach show goodwill in at least holding an aspect of that inquiry, particularly in regard to Siteserv, in terms of the response that will be forthcoming from him to the judge in question?  We all know that Anglo Irish Bank is no ordinary bank.  The information, we are informed, is confidential to the borrowers.  That is one of the impediments.

Mr. Justice Cregan has pointed out in his determination the reasons for saying to me formally in a letter that he is unable to continue processing the case given the circumstances that now apply, so how can we make adjustments, legislatively or in any other fashion, to allow him to continue to do that?  From that point of view, Mr. Justice Cregan has requested that I wait until I receive the interim report.  Obviously, he is working on that.  In the meantime, the Office of the Attorney General is looking at a range of options that have been referred to in the determination of Mr. Justice Cregan in respect of both the special liquidator and the documentation received from the Department of Finance.  As I said, in answer to an earlier question, I do not think anybody wants to go down the route of a tribunal of inquiry.  We have had experience of inquiries lasting ten years and costing in excess of &euro;100 million.  The issue here, which Deputy Catherine Murphy rightly raised - it was in order for her to do so - is to find out in the public interest whether there was favouritism or whether any undue decision was taken, not in the public interest, in regard to any of these transactions to which a write-off in excess of &euro;10 million applied.  My understanding is that there are 37 cases involving 200,000 pages of documentation, and the intention of the Government in setting up the commission was to be able get to the bottom of that.  If there is an issue that needs to be addressed in a fair and accountable fashion, then so be it; the commission of investigation should be able to do that.  Mr. Justice Cregan has pointed out how, in his decision and his judgment, he is unable to go further.  We as the Oireachtas have a duty, in the public interest and for public information, to deal with that issue.  In order to be able to deal with it, I need to have Mr. Justice Cregan's interim report.  He has requested we wait until we receive that report before proceeding.

The concern with <i>www.merrionstreet.ie<\/i>is how it has gone from being quite a broad service to one which is increasingly political.

Mr. Ban was in Ireland to receive the Tipperary International Peace Award.  I was delighted that his visit took place in the year that we mark the 60th anniversary of Ireland's membership of the United Nations, as well as the 70th anniversary of the UN's establishment.  The Secretary General and I had wide-ranging discussions in which we discussed some of the key issues facing the United Nations and the role that Ireland is playing to support UN initiatives.  The Secretary General paid tribute to Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to the UN and he praised, in particular, our long-standing participation in UN peacekeeping operations.  We spoke of Ireland's continued engagement on global hunger issues, including with the Zero Hunger initiative.  I raised with the Secretary General the enhanced contribution which Ireland and Irish agribusiness could make in the field of milk processing technology to address food insecurity and malnutrition.<\/p>  <p>  We discussed the role that Ireland was playing at the time of the meeting as co-facilitator of the post-2015 development agenda negotiations.  As the House is aware, the product of these negotiations were the new UN sustainable development goals.<\/p><p>These were launched at the UN sustainable development summit in New York in September 2015, the largest gathering of world leaders in the history of the United Nations.  The drafting of this document, accepted by many nations, was in the main the work of Ambassador Donoghue, the Irish ambassador to the UN, together with his Kenyan counterpart, and we owe them our congratulations.  Secretary General Ban and I also discussed the need for UN member states to continue to provide appropriate levels of overseas development aid.  This issue was subsequently addressed at July&rsquo;s Addis Ababa conference on financing for development, at which Ireland was represented by the Minister of State, Deputy Sean Sherlock.<\/p> <p> My meeting with the Secretary General took place shortly after the historic vote in the same-sex marriage referendum and we discussed the importance of supporting LGBT rights in the domestic and international context.  On this point, the Secretary General and I were in agreement that prejudice and discrimination against the LGBT community must be tackled at every opportunity and that Ireland would continue to support the work of the UN Human Rights Council and other fora to combat homophobia.<\/p> <p> On Syria, we spoke of the ongoing migration crisis and of the need to find an agreed approach at EU level to address the problem effectively.  The Secretary General was complimentary of the compassionate approach that Ireland has taken towards resettling refugees.  As we all know, the situation within Syria and with regard to migration has deteriorated since May, but our commitment to finding a suitable resolution and providing support to those affected by the crisis has not diminished.<\/p> <p> With regard to climate change, the Secretary General expressed his appreciation for the position taken by the EU in the negotiations which, it is hoped, will lead to a global agreement at the forthcoming COP21 conference in Paris in December.  I underlined Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to an ambitious and legally binding agreement.  Overall, this was a very useful opportunity to engage with the Secretary General on a range of issues of mutual concern.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111000022#U02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1072","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1447173900,"counter":237,"content":"<p>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply.  He will agree that the UN Secretary General has rightly expressed his urgent concern regarding the escalation of events in Syria and the failure to put the interests of refugees first.  When the Taoiseach met Ban Ki-moon, I am sure the fact Syria represents the largest humanitarian disaster for decades must have weighed on their minds.  It is the direct result of a brutal regime which would not let its own people have even very basic freedoms.  Unfortunately, some countries that see the spread of democracy as a threat have worked to prop up the regime and the situation has radicalised.  As they face into the winter, the position of the refugees is desperate.  We have to respond generously to those who have fled to Europe seeking safety and shelter.<\/p>  <p>  It seems the scale of the response is underwhelming.  Even in Ireland we are looking, at best, at 200 before the end of the year; 100 at the very beginning of the year and 100 at the end of the year, despite all the hype about thousands and so on.  People much prefer more precise figures and the real story as opposed to headlines that scream out 3,000 and 4,000, when there does not appear to be any prospect of that, regardless of whether one agrees with it.  There is no scheduling and no plan has been published regarding how set numbers will be achieved.<\/p>  <p>  The bottom line is whether, in the Taoiseach's discussions with Ban Ki-moon, the more important issue of addressing the needs of the millions in camps in the region was raised.  The failure to address these needs is one of the reasons so many people risk so much in undertaking the dangerous journey to Europe.  They would not be coming to Europe if the situation were made more habitable in the camps themselves in terms of education, work, quality of life, and so on.  Would the Taoiseach accept that the response supporting displaced people in and around Syria has failed and that we now need something far more ambitious from Europe in that regard?  The recent decision of the European Council gives humanitarian support in the region only a fraction of the amount being spent on trying to contain the issue in Europe.  Would the Taoiseach agree that is reflective of perverse priorities?  The bulk of Europe's resources should go to improving the situation in the camps in order that the motivation to leave them and migrate to Europe would not be as strong as it is.  Were there any discussions about the United States playing a role by taking some people from this war-torn region?<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach knows my second question deals with the new wave of repression being directed by some countries in Africa against their lesbian and gay citizens.  I refer to Uganda in particular and its intolerance of homosexuality and ask that the Taoiseach raise that issue with Ban Ki-moon.  It is the nature of extreme populists that they will seek to find enemies within and try to get some moral hysteria going.  The dangers faced by gay and lesbian people in many African countries have become significantly worse in recent years.  Would the Taoiseach agree that the United Nations should take a lead role in combatting this discrimination and repression?<\/p>  <p>  Would the Taoiseach also agree with the action of some donors in insisting that no funding can go to any organisation that supports the repression of lesbian and gay people?  This is an issue we should also consider.  Like many donor countries, we do put even very basic conditions pertaining to democracy and governance issues on aid and seek to bring about change for the better in this respect.  This issue is one where it is legitimate and moral to leverage something from the governments in terms of their approach and particularly the repressive attitude towards the gay and lesbian community in African countries.  We donate quite a significant sum of money from our Irish Aid programme to Africa, especially to Uganda, and some of the programmes are very good, especially in education.  We do a hell of a lot in terms of primary school participation in Uganda.  I have been there in that context.  However, we cannot run parallel silos in terms of supporting those programmes while turning a blind eye to the unacceptable repression, discrimination and almost state oppression faced by the gay community in Uganda and across Africa generally.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of climate change, would the Taoiseach accept that the Government is being quite tardy and lacking in ambition in respect of our contribution to the wider debate on this?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111000023#V00200","speaker":"992"},{"type":"speech","time":1447173900,"counter":238,"content":"<p>I will deal with the question of gay and lesbian rights in the first instance.  An anti-homosexuality Bill was passed by the Ugandan Parliament in 2013.  That Bill was signed into law by President Museveni in February 2014.  The Act further criminalised homosexuality and imposed even harsher penalties.  In a welcome move in August last year, the law was struck down by the Constitutional Court of Uganda as the President lacked a quorum when the Parliament passed the Bill.  Uganda's President Museveni has indicated that he will not pursue new anti-homosexuality legislation as current legislation, that is, the law prior to the one that went through without a quorum, is sufficient.  The Ugandan President has also acknowledged the extent to which the legislation has damaged Uganda's reputation which he sees as important for investment in the hospitality sector and so on.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland, along with other donors, engaged intensively on this issue behind the scenes and at the highest level with the Ugandan Government and continues to do so.  Some aid donors instituted aid cuts to the Ugandan Government when the anti-homosexuality law was enacted.  As Ireland had not provided funding through the Ugandan Government since 2013, prior to the enactment of that Bill, this question did not arise in respect of funding from Ireland.  Nevertheless, there continues to be discrimination against LGBTI communities in Uganda and elsewhere in the region, including reports, as Deputy Martin pointed out, of violent attacks against some people.  We strongly condemn discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation or gender identity and support the promotion and protection of the human rights of all persons, irrespective of their sexual orientation or their gender identity.  We are working with the authorities and the human rights organisations in Uganda to address the safety concerns of the LGBTI community.<\/p><p>In the context of our membership of the UN and, in particular, as a member of the UN Human Rights Council, Ireland is strongly committed to combatting discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation or gender identity, and supports the promotion and the protection of the human rights of all persons irrespective of their sexual orientation and gender identity.  In fact, the Government's review of foreign policy, <i>The Global Island: Ireland's Foreign Policy for a Changing World<\/i>, which was published in January 2015, reaffirms our country's commitment to promoting the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex individuals, who continue to suffer disproportionate levels of violence and face systemic discrimination in many countries.  During the 2013 Irish Presidency of the Council of the European Union, we facilitated and made substantial input into the EU guidelines on LGBTI issues, which were adopted during Ireland's Presidency.  We are currently participating in EU discussions on the implementation of these guidelines as part of the European Union Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy 2015-2019.  In addition, our diplomatic network has been active in its advocacy of LGBTI rights, including on issues relating to the decriminalisation of homosexuality and by supporting civil society organisations that are active in the field, many of which operate in difficult environments.<br\/><br\/>I agree with Deputy Martin; nobody could disagree.  The exodus from Syria is unprecedented.  Over 1 million people have been assimilated into south Lebanon, many in poor conditions.  I understand the camp in Jordan is well run, but it is in the desert and a long way from anywhere.  The refugees, many of whom are middle-class and educated, with their families, who were the first to leave Syria, have a sense of frustration at what is not happening for them because they see others being adopted by other countries, in some cases in considerable numbers, and this is a cause for concern.  The European Council has discussed this on a number of occasions and we have received reports from the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Federica Mogherini, about the problems arising due to the reduction in the amount and quality of food given to many of the camp residents.  I might say it has been brought to my attention that the camps in the Horn of Africa are simply appalling.  Clearly, the news today from Ethiopia of a severe drought that may lead to serious problems next year is not encouraging.<br\/><br\/>Deputy Martin will be aware that in Turkey there are a further 2 million Syrian refugees, the vast majority of whom would like to stay in their own country if the situation were normalised.  For the first time, Iran was involved in discussions.  This cannot and will not be sorted until Iran, Russia, Syria and the United States are able to hammer out a solution.  Otherwise, the exodus from Syria will continue.  I have spoken to people who worked in Syria a number of years ago when that country was making great progress, but it is now in a desperate situation whereby Assad has been responsible for the vast majority of deaths that have occurred there.  It is a really difficult situation that is taking up quite a deal of time at the European Council.  The consequence of not being able to deal with it are these significant numbers of refugees moving through the Balkan countries to Austria, Germany and some of the Nordic countries.  This will get much more difficult in the next two or three months with the coming of winter.  In eastern Europe, winter can be exceptionally harsh and very different from what refugees from more southerly countries have been used to.<br\/><br\/>On the question of the free movement of people as a cornerstone and principle of the European Union, either one has external borders that one is able to deal with and has internal freedom of movement, or one does not.  A case in point is Greece, where there are significant difficulties; this is now at last being focused upon by the European Council.  Meetings held recently mean that there are negotiations and discussions with the Turkish authorities on the opening of pre-accession chapters for consideration for the European Union. and also on requests for funding to deal with the scale of the influx into Turkey and, obviously, the other problems arising from that.<br\/><br\/>I take Deputy Martin's point that organisations that do not support the rights of LGBTI persons should not be in receipt of funding from any country, and in so far as any aid from Ireland to such organisations is concerned, I will have that checked with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111000023#V00300","speaker":"1072","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1447174500,"counter":240,"content":"<p>I will start with the issue of global warming and climate change.  NASA recently revealed that the world's sea levels have risen by nearly 8 cm since 1992, and the UN has estimated that sea levels will rise by 1 metre or more by the end of the century.  Of course, that has significant implications everywhere.  In some parts of the world, it means hurricanes, cyclones and storms in greater ferocity than ever witnessed previously.  When I visited Cuba recently, Ministers spoke of their concern about the problem of drought arising from climate change, particularly in that island.  Returning to our own island, under the European Commission's energy and climate package of 2008, we are required to deliver a 20% reduction in non-emissions trading scheme, non-ETS, greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 relative to the levels that existed ten years ago.  This is not an ambitious target but it is crucially important.  It seems we will not meet our 20% reduction target by 2020 and we will actually be lucky to achieve half of this.  Strong growth in emissions from transport, agriculture and other areas are key factors.  Non-compliance with the targets carries a fine of &euro;600 million in 2021.  That should be a secondary consideration.  Is the Taoiseach concerned that we will not reach our target reduction, and what steps have been taken to reverse this trend?<\/p><p>On the issue of the UN forces, the Taoiseach will be aware better than I am that 500 Defence Forces personnel are committed to 12 different international missions, such as UNIFIL and UNDOF in Syria.  Famously, we also have the 60 naval personnel on the <i>LE Samuel Beckett<\/i>saving thousands of lives in the Mediterranean.  All of these men and women are performing their duties with distinction and they deserve our support and commendation.  Has there been any additional request from the UN for Irish troops or personnel to serve in other trouble spots?<\/p><p>I have raised this issue with the Taoiseach on a few occasions.  Has the Government resolved to the satisfaction of the naval personnel engaged in the maritime humanitarian search and rescue operation in the Mediterranean the amount paid to them for the stressful and hazardous work that they are engaged in?  The Minister for Defence stated a month ago that the Naval Service personnel were not involved in an armed mission, but the fact is that they must be armed because some of those with whom they are dealing are dangerous smugglers.  I am sure our hearts go out to those refugees, but they also go out to the naval personnel who have to retrieve the drowned remains of women, men and children from the sea.  These personnel certainly deserve to be financially recognised for their efforts.  We were told that the issue of payments was under review.  Can the Taoiseach give us a progress report on this?<\/p><p>On the issue of refugees, we are a people who have our own memories, both folk and historical, of coffin ships, and we now watch on our television screens as refugees make the considerable trek of hundreds of kilometres across the European mainland.<\/p><p>Every week brings a different element of it.  Did the Taoiseach have the opportunity to talk to the UN Secretary General about any of the detail of Ireland's contribution to resolving or trying to relieve the problem with our refugee protection scheme?  Will we accept the 4,000 refugees anticipated?  How quickly can it proceed?  The number we are to take between now and Christmas is pitifully small.  Does the Taoiseach have other information on the progress of the programme, such as the numbers anticipated, when they will arrive and the provision of accommodation and services for them?  Given the way we treat people in direct provision centres and the way we treat members of the Traveller community, we must be sure we are not creating more difficulties for these people when they reach our shores.<\/p> <p> Did the Taoiseach have the opportunity to discuss the Palestinian situation?  When I raised the issue with the Taoiseach last week, he did not answer me but said he would get back to me.  I received a letter from the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, which was totally unsatisfactory and fudged the issue.  It failed to acknowledge the expressed support of the Oireachtas for a Palestinian state.  It is all about ongoing discussions and assessments.  We need to show leadership.  In these issues, as I have said many times here, Ireland has a certain global reputation, given our colonial past and the success of our peace process, imperfect though it may be.  When we speak on these issues, we speak not least to the people in the region in a way they would understand and respect.  What do Palestinian children do, being treated as they are, if nobody outside the circle stands up for them and recognises that they have rights?  The EU Foreign Affairs Council meets next Monday.  It is an opportunity.  I never receive a report on all the meetings the Taoiseach attends.  I never receive a report on this dreadful situation.  The unresolved Israeli-Palestinian issue is the main core of the destabilisation of the entire region.<\/p> <p> Regarding the rights and entitlements of LGBT citizens, it was a major victory for humanity when, overwhelmingly, people voted in favour of marriage equality.  The fact that it is being brought into law so quickly is to be commended.  The Northern Ireland Assembly recently voted in support of marriage equality.  Sinn F&eacute;in had moved the motion for the sixth time, this time with the support of the Social Democratic and Labour Party, SDLP.  The previous five times, we did it alone.  Although the Democratic Unionist Party, DUP, and other Unionist parties blocked it from becoming law, it was still a very important vote of confidence and a clear signal to LGBT citizens.  As the Taoiseach noted, some 80 UN states have criminal laws against sexual activity by LGBT citizens, and in at least eight of these the death penalty can be imposed.  While Russia does not have laws against homosexual acts, it has repressive laws against what it describes as the homosexual propaganda.  As the Taoiseach noted, there has been some success in overturning some of these laws in some states.  Did the Secretary General give any indication of the work of the UN in combatting these injustices?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111000024#W00200","speaker":"1066","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1447175100,"counter":242,"content":"<p>We referred to the Palestinian issue several times last week.  At my request, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, wrote to Deputy Adams.  The Government fully recognises Members' interest in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and has done so for many years.  Our goal is to achieve statehood for Palestine in reality, not rhetorically.  The Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, on behalf of the Government and, therefore, the people, is continuing to reflect on whether earlier recognition by Ireland would be a positive contribution to the situation and how it might affect our voice and influence on the issue.  Is it the right thing to do?  Is now the right time?  What are the consequences?  With the current wave of violence in Israel and Palestine, our immediate priority, quite rightly, must be directed towards reducing tensions and general de-escalation of this volatile situation.  The Minister, and his counterparts across the EU, will discuss, as part of the agenda, the Middle East peace process at the Foreign Affairs Council on 16 November.<\/p>  <p>  The climate change situation is more severe than the Deputy mentioned.  Whoever is in government between 2020 and 2030, if the targets for 2030 are based on the 2020 targets, the fines could run to the order of &euro;5 billion or &euro;6 billion, which is an astronomical charge.  There is a real challenge for the Government.  The people will elect a new Government in the spring, and if it becomes my responsibility, we will have a real challenge between now and 2020.  Our profile in terms of the agri sector is similar to only one other country, namely, New Zealand.  I have always held the view that the scientific analysis that was done originally was not, perhaps, as strong as it might have been, and it will make it very difficult for this country to achieve the 2020 targets, never mind the 2030 targets.  This means if we are to get any concession from Europe, another EU country will have to take up that slack.  Regarding the cost of reducing carbon, we have less room for manoeuvre than others, due to our circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  I referred to the issue with President Hollande the last time I was in Paris and I said we would attend and support COP21, which he will hold next month in Paris.  The potential charge on the country is very severe.  We have some of the best minds dealing with the sector and trying to work out how, technically and politically, we might be able to demonstrate that while we want to achieve targets we can achieve, we should not be saddled with something unachievable.  Most of Ireland's climate financing to developing countries, which comes to &euro;34 million per year, is being provided through the Irish Aid programme.  The resources are delivered principally for climate change adaptation in sub-Saharan African countries through our country programmes, civil society organisations and international organisations.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has pursued the transition to a low-carbon agenda.  Our goal is to achieve a competitive low-carbon, climate-resilient and environmentally sustainable economy by 2050.  The Government's Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill, which is before the Seanad, will build on existing efforts to decarbonise the economy.  The Bill sets out the process to achieve this transition, including the adaptation of a series of national mitigation plans.  In anticipation of enactment of the legislation, work has already begun on the first such plan.  A cross-departmental steering group will ensure the whole-of-Government approach to the plan and engagement across the sectors that is necessary will happen.  The Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill places the Government's adaptation efforts on a legal statutory footing.  These efforts are focused on the National Climate Change Adaptation Framework, published in 2012.  To protect vulnerable communities, the Government has prioritised the introduction of a new flood-risk management programme being handled by the Minister of State, Deputy Simon Harris.<\/p><p>The Government has prioritised the introduction of a new flood risk management programme to protect vulnerable communities.  Annual spending on the programme, which is being handled by the Minister of State, Deputy Harris, will reach approximately &euro;100 million by 2021.  The climate Bill also provides for an independent advisory council to advise the Government on matters relevant to mitigation and adaptation.  The members of the climate change advisory council, who were announced in June of this year, are due to have their second meeting at the end of November.  This will enable them to make an input into the important preparatory work that is already under way.  At the Paris conference, we will strongly support an ambitious, legally binding, global agreement with broad participation as a core outcome of COP21.  As an EU member state, Ireland is committed to playing its part in reaching an historic agreement on supporting decisions, which should put the world on a collective pathway to limit the average global temperature increase to less than 2&deg;C above pre-industrial levels.  Ireland recognises that some of the poorest and most vulnerable countries need real assistance in responding and adjusting to climate change.  We have maintained a flow of climate-related aid despite our recent economic circumstances.  We deliver grants of approximately &euro;34 million every year, mainly to countries in sub-Saharan Africa.  We are actively exploring options for scaling up that mobilisation of climate finance from public and private sources.  The recent passage of the climate Bill is an example of the steps we are taking in this regard.<br\/><br\/>Deputy Adams spoke about defence personnel.  I do not think we have had any further requests from the UN for defence personnel.  Such matters have to come before the Cabinet and the Oireachtas before they can be approved.  That is the context for the conditions that are set out for participation by Irish troops.  I will advise Deputy Adams further on that.<br\/><br\/>While we are not part of the protocol for the migration crisis and the asylum seekers, we have decided to opt into the protocol and agreed to accept approximately 4,000 asylum seekers and refugees under the resettlement or relocation programmes over a couple of years.  This is well in excess of any sort of notional quota that might be allocated.  This figure includes 520 refugees whom we have offered to resettle from existing refugee camps.  Some of these people have now started to arrive in Ireland.  It also includes 2,800 people under the Commission's relocation proposals.  An initial tranche of 20 asylum seekers from Italy or Greece will arrive here before Christmas.  The other numbers will arrive in stages after Christmas.  This first tranche will include Syrian and Eritrean asylum seekers.  The remaining people in that group - approximately 680 people - will be taken on a resettlement or relocation basis, with the final breakdown yet to be decided.  As Deputies are aware, we have deployed Naval vessels - first, the <i>LE Eithne<\/i>, then the <i>LE Niamh<\/i>and now the <i>LE Samuel Beckett<\/i>- in the Mediterranean since June.  It speaks for itself that 8,066 individuals had been rescued by 4 November last.  Obviously, this rotation is due to be completed at the end of November.  As the winter will have arrived at that stage, it is likely that a smaller number of boats will be travelling across the Mediterranean.  The question of a further deployment will be considered at that stage in the context of what is actually happening in the region.  I do not want to comment on the PDFORRA matter that was raised by the Deputy because it is the subject of arbitration at the moment.  Perhaps it will suffice to say that the matter has not been lost sight of.<br\/><br\/>We provide financial support to other parts of the world that are affected by instability and conflict.  Some &euro;41 million will be provided by the end of 2015 to assist those who have been displaced as a result of the crisis in Syria.  This is Irish Aid's largest response to a single crisis in recent years.  Some &euro;36 million has been allocated to deal with the humanitarian issue in Somalia since 2008.  We have committed to and approved a doubling of our annual world food programme allocation from &euro;10 million from &euro;20 million for the next three years.  High Representative Mogherini pointed out at a recent Council meeting that the level of food being given out for meals under the World Food Programme had been halved and that this was causing difficulties for thousands of children, in particular, who suffer from malnutrition and a lack of quality food.  At the Valletta summit, which takes place this week, the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, will make a formal announcement of a significant contribution to the EU trust fund for Africa.  The establishment of the Irish refugee protection programme and, in particular, the efforts of the interdepartmental task force, are important elements that we have to consider as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111000025#X00200","speaker":"1072","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1447175700,"counter":244,"content":"<p>When the Taoiseach met Ban Ki-moon, did he ask him for his perspective on the idea of statehood for the Palestinians?  We supported the motion on their right to a state at the time it came before the House.  We had earlier indicated our support for the idea of a Palestinian state anyway.  We regretted the fact that Sinn F&eacute;in kind of went solo on it.  My understanding was that all parties had agreed to meet to see whether a collective agreement across the House could be reached, thereby enabling us to speak with one voice.  While the Parliament has done that to a certain extent, the Government and the State have not recognised Palestine's statehood in UN terms.  I ask the Taoiseach to facilitate a meeting between the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and the respective party spokespeople on foreign affairs, or the party leaders if necessary, at which any issues the Minister may have with this can be teased out.  The line \"he continues to reflect\" is classic diplomatic-speak.  He can continue to reflect for a long time.  I ask the Taoiseach to consider arranging for the foreign affairs spokespeople of all the political parties to the Minister.  I agree that it should be more than rhetoric.  If we are going to do something in this regard, it should be done in unison because there is greater strength in unity.  I would appreciate it if that could be done because the construction of the settlements and the ongoing persecution and violence mean that the situation is getting more precarious and the two-state solution is becoming less viable.  It is clear that a majority at the EU Foreign Affairs Council will support the stance of Israel, just as the US does.

We could look at that question as part of the mid-term review of the capital programme.  There may be some items of planned infrastructure that cannot go ahead because of court decisions or planning objections.  If the economy continues to improve, which I hope it will, and we arrive at a balanced budgetary position from 2019 onwards, there will be more money available for whatever Government the people elect to deal with many of the social and infrastructural challenges that we have.

It was also the second summit with the recently established CELAC as the EU&rsquo;s counterpart.  The summit was chaired jointly by European Council President Tusk and by President Correa of Ecuador, which currently holds the presidency of CELAC. <\/p><p>The format of the summit involved two working group sessions and a discussion session.  I attended both working group sessions and spoke on the theme of re-invigorating the bi-regional partnership.  The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Dara Murphy, attended the less formal discussion session on 11 June on my behalf.  In my intervention I supported closer ties between the EU and CELAC and raised the key global challenges of development and climate change, our priorities with regard to human rights, disarmament and conflict resolution as well as the importance of 2015 for global co-operation.  I noted the historic opportunity this year provides for global consensus on many of the key challenges we face, particularly the UN&rsquo;s post-2015 development agenda, where Ireland was one of the UN co-facilitators for the final negotiations, and efforts to tackle climate change.<\/p><p>The main outcome documents of the summit were the political declaration, entitled A Partnership for the Next Generation, and an action plan which I am circulating with my reply.  The focus of the action plan is on areas including science, research, innovation and technology, sustainable development, environment, climate change, energy, regional integration and education to promote social inclusion and cohesion.<\/p><p>On the margins of the summit I had three bilateral meetings with the Presidents of Chile, Colombia and Mexico.  In my meeting with President Bachelet Jeria of Chile, I expressed my congratulations on the Start-up Chile programme and my appreciation that Irish entrepreneurs have had the opportunity to participate in the programme.  I also extended an invitation to the President to visit Ireland.  During my conversation with President Juan Manuel Santos of Colombia, I noted Ireland&rsquo;s support for the peace process in Colombia, the efforts of the Colombian Government to promote human rights and Ireland&rsquo;s recent ratification of the EU, Colombia, Peru Free Trade Agreement as well as an interest in growing our relations with Colombia.  I also noted that the Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs of Colombia, Ms Patti Londo&ntilde;o, was due to visit Ireland on 17 and 18 June 2015.  She subsequently did so and met with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charlie Flanagan.  I would like to take the opportunity to welcome warmly the<i><\/i>appointment of the former T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, to the role of EU Special Envoy for the peace process in Colombia.  I wish Deputy Gilmore every success in the important task of spearheading the EU's support for Colombia's efforts to build a lasting peace for the benefit of all its people.<\/p><p>I also met with President Pe&ntilde;a Nieto of Mexico and discussed trade issues between Ireland and Mexico with him as well as the EU-Mexico Global Agreement.  I reiterated an invitation extended by President Michael D. Higgins in Mexico in 2013 to the President to visit Ireland.<\/p><p>I meet regularly with my European counterparts and while we met informally at this summit, I did not have substantive meetings with them.  I met most recently with Prime Minister Cameron yesterday in London.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111000027#Z00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1447176300,"counter":257,"content":"<p>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply.  I welcome the aforementioned action plan and the issues it addresses, including sustainable development, climate change, trade and various other matters.  Obviously the Taoiseach did not meet the President of Bolivia at the summit or discuss the ongoing issue of the very unsatisfactory follow through by the Bolivian Government on the execution or murder of Michael Dwyer from County Tipperary a number of years ago.  I know the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, recently met the Bolivian President and has been involved with the case.  There is now a commitment, as I understand it, to an international, independent investigation.  At the time of that execution there was much written in the media which was unfair to Michael Dwyer and his family.  His mother has fought a very courageous campaign over quite a number of years.  Did the Taoiseach have any contact with the Bolivian Government on this issue?  The obfuscation and the stonewalling nature of its response over the years is extremely unsatisfactory.  The prosecution case never really hung together and has now fallen apart completely.  Essentially Mr. Dwyer was executed in a hotel bedroom by Government forces which raises issues for us, diplomatically, in terms of our relationship with the Bolivian Government, at least until the issue is resolved to some degree.  When I say resolved, I mean that some level of disclosure and honesty is required of the Bolivian Government in the context of what happened.<\/p>  <p>  I ask the Taoiseach to indicate if he had any briefings on the Cuban situation, particularly the moves by President Obama to change the relationship between the United States and Cuba, and whether that has been reflected on the EU front, in terms of changing the paradigm.

Some years ago Enterprise Ireland identified Latin America as a potential market for the penetration of Irish goods and services.

Apart from anything else, there are half a million or more citizens in that part of the world who claim Irish descent.  There has been a huge change in the politics of that region.  I commend Presidents Obama and Castro for the new accord which has developed and for the courage they have shown in terms of the initiatives to normalise the relationship between their two countries.  However, I think we can play a more positive role because while the US President has used some executive powers to remove some aspects of the blockade, it still remains in place.<\/p><p>Ireland could play a very positive role in encouraging a complete end to the blockade. <\/p> <p> Trade between the State and Latin America is worth &euro;3 billion annually.  I am convinced trade between the entire island and Latin America could be improved if we were imaginative about it.  I met some of the negotiators involved in the Colombian peace process.  I very much welcome the positive role certain countries - Norway and, in particular, Cuba - have played in that peace process.  The Cuban President, Ra&uacute;l Castro, hosted a press conference at which the Colombian President and the leader of the FARC rebel group shook hands, which was a remarkable breakthrough.  A timeframe of six months has been set for achieving a final agreement. <\/p> <p> I also welcome the appointment of Deputy Eamon Gilmore as the European Union's envoy for the peace process in Colombia and I wish him well in that role.  Sinn F&eacute;in is committed to providing whatever support and help it can to anyone in the region.  Given our background, the Government can play a role in this regard.  However, we must ensure bilateralism prevails in the Colombian peace process.  It must not only be about ending war.  While ending the war is crucially important, we have to build democracy and peace and this must be based on people's rights.  A bilateral cessation would be very helpful in Colombia because a unilateral cessation by one side is in place at the moment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111000027#Z01100","speaker":"1066","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1447176900,"counter":262,"content":"<p>I have to interrupt the Deputy because his time has concluded.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111000028#AA00200","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1447176900,"counter":263,"content":"<p>I will finish on the following point.

In recent years, we sent senior Ministers to Mexico to attend engagements during St. Patrick's week.

The Taoiseach confirmed earlier that this was the position.  This is a significant issue.  It is extraordinary that a Department would retain its rights in this matter.  It should co-operate 100% with the inquiry, which would mean waiving its rights with regard to the release of documents, including allowing the commission of inquiry to do so.<\/p>  <p>  Earlier this year, the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, promised legislation to establish a hospital trust, namely, the children's hospital trust, on a statutory basis before the end of the year.  The Minister made a significant statement last week regarding proposed legislation on such trusts when he indicated they that they should behave like commercial semi-State bodies.  He also stated they should trusts which do not perform should be sent out to tender or their management transferred to a private provider for a certain period, which essentially amounts to the privatisation of public hospitals.  Will the Taoiseach indicate when the Bill providing for a children's hospital trust will be brought before the D&aacute;il?  In light of the statement made by the Minister last week, will the Bill provide for a significantly different type of trust for the national children's hospital from the one we were promised? <\/p>  <p>  Will the Taoiseach facilitate a debate on the &euro;600 million Supplementary Estimate for health?

All politics is local; that is why I am here.  On the day we signed the commencement order of the marriage equality Act, I raise the issue of the need for clarity to be provided on the funding for the redevelopment of P&aacute;irc U&iacute; Chaoimh in Cork.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has a very proud and strong record on supporting large, important and necessary infrastructure projects in Cork.  Deputy Varadkar, the predecessor of the current Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, ensured that, with a limited budget, projects on the south side of the city were funded.  The current Minister has announced funding for the Dunkettle interchange and the Cork&ndash;Ringaskiddy road under the capital programme.  Funding of &euro;10 million has been included for the event centre and funding has been made available for the redevelopment of the historic Beamish and Crawford brewery site.<\/p>  <p>  The other significant project that the Government is committed to involves the provision of &euro;30 million for the redevelopment of P&aacute;irc U&iacute; Chaoimh, a development that is necessary and that will provide a significant economic boost for the city during its construction and when the stadium is in use.  The estimated total cost on completion is &euro;70 million.  The stadium will have a capacity of 45,000.  It will be a state-of-the-art facility for players, fans and staff.  The investment is not just about the stadium but also about jobs, the development of the marina park and delivering a tourism and economic boost to the area to the tune of &euro;22 million.  The combined projects will create employment and see a facility being redeveloped.  They will give to a generation of Cork people in the GAA a home for their activities, be it playing matches, training or creating a centre of excellence.<\/p>  <p>  Last month the Cabinet recognised the importance of, and signed off on, the grant of &euro;30 million.  We are led to believe, however, that Europe has raised questions about the allocation of the funding.  It is important that there be clarity on this.  Is Europe becoming too involved, interfering and putting its nose in where it should not be?  Is it the case that state rules were misapplied or not applied appropriately?  We need certainty at this stage in order that the project can continue and we will see the proper and justified use of taxpayers' money.<\/p>  <p>  As the Minister knows, the Cork county board has done a very significant job in making the finances available along with Government funding.  The board is committed to working with all the stakeholders to ensure the project is brought to completion.  Without State funding, it would not be possible to deliver the project.  If the Government were not involved, no private operator could step in to develop the project.  Without Government funding, the redevelopment of P&aacute;irc U&iacute; Chaoimh would be unlikely to take place.  In saying that, there is a need for clarity and certainty, not only for the people of Cork but also the men and women of Cumann L&uacute;thchleas Gael, all of whom work every day to provide facilities and help young boys and girls to play and train in our Gaelic games.<\/p>  <p>  We know the Government is committed to ensuring this important project is supported and comes to fruition, but it is important that we be assured the Minister and his officials will do everything in their power to ensure the best case is put forward at European level.  The project is of importance not only to Cork but also to the wider region, and it is the source of ongoing consultation between the Department and the local team at county board level.  It is important to ensure the redevelopment takes place while at the same time ensuring there is transparency and value for money for the taxpayer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111000031#DD00300","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1447178700,"counter":462,"content":"<p>I also acknowledge what a very important and positive day this is.  I am confident history will recognise the leadership role Deputy Jerry Buttimer played in allowing our country to get to this point.  It is my sincere hope that the people of Cork will do so as well.<\/p><p>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  As he acknowledged, Exchequer funding of &euro;30 million in support of the Cork GAA's P&aacute;irc U&iacute; Chaoimh redevelopment was agreed by the Government and announced as part of a package of stimulus measures in May 2014.  The package set out a proposed additional Exchequer investment of &euro;200 million to fund new projects in a range of sectors.  As with previous investment packages, the projects were spread geographically across the country and were expected to create economic activity and employment.  The announcement stipulated that projects were approved subject to compliance with the public spending code.<\/p><p>The redevelopment of P&aacute;irc U&iacute; Chaoimh includes the development of a centre of excellence, including a full-sized all-weather training facility and the establishment of a local marina park.  The redeveloped stadium will see an increase in capacity, with the new development accommodating 45,000 spectators when completed.  The proposed provision of &euro;30 million from the Exchequer is expected to help to progress this project, with the balance of funding being provided by the GAA at national, provincial and county levels.<\/p><p><b><\/b>As the funding will be channelled through my Department's Vote, with accountability for the investment lying with the Department's Accounting Officer, full compliance with the public spending code is required by my Department.  In addition, the normal terms and conditions of the sports capital programme will apply.  The public spending code requires that all publicly funded projects or initiatives should be appraised carefully for consistency with programme or policy objectives and value for money.  Following liaison between with my Department's economic, financial and evaluation unit and Cork GAA's advisers, a business case, incorporating an economic appraisal, was submitted on 13 August by Cork GAA.  This business case was sent to the central economic evaluation unit in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for approval in accordance with the provisions of the public spending code.  That Department has recently advised my Department that the business case is public spending code compliant.  Following the receipt of the finalised business case from Cork GAA in August, arrangements were made to discuss the project in detail at a meeting with the European Commission in Brussels.<\/p><p><b><\/b>After that meeting and the earlier submission of a pre-notification questionnaire, the competition directorate of the European Commission informed the Department by correspondence dated 28 October 2015 that a notification to the Commission for state aid clearance is required in respect of grant aid for the redevelopment of P&aacute;irc U&iacute; Chaoimh.  Naturally, this requires further work on the part of both Cork GAA and my Department.  The format for the notification will follow a template provided in EU regulations, supplemented by additional material specifically requested by the Commission in regard to the project.  This additional material will cover matters such as the nature and scope of the project, the amount of aid and its percentage of the overall costs, or the aid intensity.  Other information sought by the Commission includes the planned operation and use of the stadium, attendance figures, participation figures and other details.<\/p><p>The Deputy will appreciate that the Department must comply with the Commission's requirements.  While there is a Government decision to grant aid this project, it is not possible to give formal confirmation of the project until this process has been completed successfully.<br\/><br\/>I want to assure the Deputy and the House that my officials are working closely with Cork GAA and its advisors to ensure that the necessary material is compiled so that the notification can be formally submitted to the Commission as quickly as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111000031#DD00400","speaker":"1007","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1447179300,"counter":464,"content":"<p>It is important to recognise that the business case is compliant with the public spending code.

I just hope we can expedite the process quickly, because this is a successful venture not only for Cork city and county but also for the country.  When it is completed, P&aacute;irc U&iacute; Chaoimh will be central to our application for the Rugby World Cup, along with the fact that it will offer an alternative venue choice for supporters of the GAA and other codes.  More importantly, due to the foresight and stewardship of the Cork county board, the venue will also be of benefit to residents and the city generally.<\/p>  <p>  In his speech, the Minister referred indirectly to the fact that it is not just about Cork but also about us as a country.  It is about how we can ensure that our sporting facilities are developed to the best level, ensuring maximum attendance for a variety of codes.

I also wish to thank the Minister for Health for attending the House for this Topical Issue.  I am concerned about the existing dental services in south Galway and particularly in the Gort area.  Having spoken to the general public in that area, I know that it was a very good service in south Galway.  It was always important for a dentist or a nurse to visit a primary school, and the more medical professionals that can call to schools the better.  We have learned that prevention is the best cure and it is good for a young person to have a meeting with a dentist in a school setting.  Teachers have told me that such visits have always focused on children in second and fifth class, but sadly this is not happening now.  Many parents and teachers have asked me what happens when a child is in pain and needs fillings or sealants, and I wish to raise the issue of staffing in this regard.  Another important point is whom one deals with when trying to get detailed information about dental services, particularly in south Galway.<\/p>  <p>  What I am raising is relevant to any part of the country, but there was a good service in south Galway and there is a justifiable demand.  Consequently, there is a need to restore that dental service.  I hope that more resources can be allocated to the school dental service.  It is an important issue in dealing with the alleviation of toothache and other dental problems for young people.  If such visits and examinations are taking place in primary schools, eligible children could also be put on the list for orthodontic treatment.  We are all aware of the support for young people's confidence and self-esteem provided by orthodontic treatment, including braces.<\/p>  <p>  All branches of medicine remind us of the importance of early detection, which is crucial in fighting tooth decay.  That is why the provision of these inspections and examinations in school are most important for children who may otherwise not get to see a dentist.  If this service was affordable 50 years ago, surely it should be available today.  We all know of the risks to heart and body associated with tooth infections, so oral hygiene and care are best learned in early life.<\/p>  <p>  In Gort in the past, children were referred to a centre or the nearest hospital, which could be University Hospital Galway or Merlin Park Hospital in Galway, while children in east Galway were often referred to Portiuncula Hospital in Ballinasloe.  This service was much appreciated and I hope it will continue to be made available to young people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111000032#EE00500","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1447179300,"counter":468,"content":"<p>I want to thank Deputy Kitt for the opportunity to address the issue of the school dental service in Gort and south Galway.  I am taking this debate on behalf of my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, who is in the Seanad at present.<\/p>  <p>  Dental services for children up to 16 years of age and people of all ages with special needs are provided by the public dental service of the HSE through its dental clinics.  These dental clinics provide a screening and fissure sealant programme for children at key stages of development, aged between 6 and 8 and between 11 and 13.  The service includes referral for further treatment, including orthodontic treatment where necessary.  Emergency care for children up to 16 years of age and treatment for special needs patients are also provided.<\/p>  <p>  A reduction in staff numbers since 2010 has led to a reduced service in all Galway schools.  The HSE is aware of this difficulty and is currently taking steps to reverse it.  There are particular challenges in recruiting staff to work in more remote rural areas but, nevertheless, a recruitment drive is now under way.  It will take some time to fully realise the gain associated with the new staff, but the next school year, 2016-17, will see the benefits of this campaign.<\/p><p>In the meantime and for the current school year the objectives are to assess and treat sixth class children in all Galway schools; to assess the same schoolchildren for orthodontic need and refer, as necessary, to the local orthodontic service, to provide a dental service for patients with special needs, and to maintain an emergency dental service.<\/p> <p> Prioritisation of the older age group does not mean younger children will not be screened.  However, it is particularly important that children are referred for any necessary treatment before the age of 16 years as their eligibility for referral ends at that stage.  Where extra capacity is available, it is being targeted at isolated schools.  Given the additional challenges of providing an emergency service to isolated areas, such as Clifden and the Aran Islands, they are prioritised for preventative services where resources are available.  This work also involves addressing a backlog of some children who had not been seen in sixth class.<\/p> <p> To strengthen the service in County Galway, a programme of renovation of dental clinics and the provision of new developments is under way.  The renovation of the dental clinic at Merlin Park in the east of Galway city is finished and the renovation of the dental clinic in Shantalla Health Centre is to be completed by the end of January.  More clinics are also under consideration, including in Tuam, County Galway.  I am confident these measures will result in improved services for all children in the area in due course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111000032#EE00600","speaker":"948","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1447179900,"counter":470,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his reply.  He has said some positive things in the reply, especially in respect of assessing and treating sixth class children in all Galway schools.  I understand that previously two classes in each school were prioritised and the children in those classes were prioritised for treatment.  While I welcome what has been said in respect of Tuam and the services in Galway city, south Galway is still an issue.  This is the reason I am raising the matter.  We need a dental clinic providing services there.<\/p>  <p>  There is also a need for information to be provided to the public on what is available.  I cannot emphasise enough the importance of the school visit for cases requiring treatment and for those who need to be included on the orthodontic treatment list.  There is a long waiting list for orthodontic treatment in Galway, particularly in south Galway.<\/p>  <p>  It is unusual that we have orthodontic and dental treatment operating under two different sections of the HSE.  The primary care sector deals with dental treatment while the hospital group - Saolta, in the case of Galway - deals with orthodontics.  The practical problem is that when we have discussions with the primary care team in Galway, we can only talk about the particular issue of dental treatment.  By the way, we are glad to be invited to such discussions.  However, orthodontics is an issue we deal with through the hospital group.  That could be looked at again.<\/p>  <p>  I hope that the recruitment the Minister has referred to will improve the situation for the next school year.  Moreover, I hope younger children will not be forgotten when the Minister puts a priority on sixth class children in all Galway schools.

The high turnout highlighted the anger over any attempt to damage a public amenity.  I called the meeting to hear the views on the proposed flood defence wall.  There was never any agreement with local residents, local businesses or the joint working groups on the wall height, which is why there are major concerns.  The project was originally billed as a cycleway and assurances were given for a minor wall.  I am opposed to the current wall and its design.  It destroys a major public amenity and damages the scenic view of Dublin Bay and Bull Island.<\/p>  <p>  Dublin Bay is protected by nine special areas of conservation.  Why is there no aesthetic finish to this wall?  Thousands of people enjoy this environment each day.  Why would anyone want to damage such scenic beauty?  It seems to be a continuous battle to get Dublin City Council to realise the importance of Dublin Bay.  There seems to be a cultural view that concrete is the answer to everything.  Dublin City Council has a record of some bad decisions as a result of not listening to the people.  Is Dublin City Council concerned about its future working relationship with the joint working group or in respect of progressing flood defence work on this and future promenade projects?  A commitment was given by senior engineers that the wall would be no higher than the stone wall leading to the Wooden Bridge.  Why was this commitment not adhered to?  The local independent councillor, Damian O'Farrell, had motions agreed by Dublin City Council that called on the council to preserve the amenity and protect the environment in any future flood defence plan.  Why was this ignored?<\/p>  <p>  I have worked on Dublin Bay matters previously over the duration of my political career.  I was honoured to be endorsed by the late great Se&aacute;n Dublin Bay Loftus.  That tradition goes on.  I am well aware of the position Dublin Bay and Bull Island hold in our community.  Either one or the other is designated as a UNESCO biosphere, a nature reserve, a special protection area under the EU birds directive or a special area of conservation.  I will be damned if I let anything happen to this local and national amenity.<\/p>  <p>  Another important aspect relates to how no consideration was given to the wheelchair-bound population, although both the Irish Wheelchair Association and the Central Remedial Clinic are based in Clontarf.  At our meeting on Wednesday night, a young wheelchair-bound man made a poignant remark to the effect that while the able-bodied might have some chance of seeing over the wall, no consideration was given to wheelchair users who would never have that ability.<\/p>  <p>  The day after our public meeting I attended a meeting in City Hall with the city manager, officials, engineers and councillors.  Councillor Damian O'Farrell and I put the views of the local residents on the wall and Dublin Bay.  Councillor O'Farrell succeeded in getting a special city council meeting tomorrow at 6.15 p.m.  All I ask is for the Minister, the city manager and senior officials to listen to the views of the local residents and have sensible flood defence measures that protect local people but also enhance beautiful Dublin Bay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111000033#FF00500","speaker":"1017"},{"type":"speech","time":1447179900,"counter":474,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising the issue and for giving me the opportunity, on behalf of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, to outline the position regarding Dollymount promenade and the associated flood protection project.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, under section 30 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 the Minister, Deputy Kelly, is specifically precluded from exercising any power or control in respect of any planning case under consideration by any planning authority, including An Bord Plean&aacute;la.<\/p><p>The management of the Dollymount promenade and the associated flood protection project is a matter for the relevant planning authority, which is Dublin City Council in this instance, and the Minister has no function or remit in this regard. <\/p> <p> From inquiries made with Dublin City Council, I understand that this project, comprising a promenade and cycleway proposal as well as flood alleviation works to address higher tides and sea levels, was originally approved by An Bord Plean&aacute;la in 2011 under section 226 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, relating to foreshore developments.  The environmental impact of the project was comprehensively assessed as part of this process.  Dublin City Council subsequently made some alterations to the promenade and cycleway aspects of its proposals which were progressed under the Part VIII requirements of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001, as amended, relating to local authority developments.<\/p> <p> The Part VIII process for local authority development works involves extensive public notice, public consultation, including with prescribed bodies, and the public display of plans and other documentation, with the proposed development ultimately being subject to the will of the elected members of the local authority concerned.  As required under the Part VIII provisions, the revised proposals for the Dollymount promenade and flood protection project was the subject of extensive public consultation with the local community generally and with local community groups.  The National Parks and Wildlife Service was also consulted on the preparation of the proposal and habitat screening.  Planning approval for the revised proposals was granted by Dublin City Council in May 2013.<\/p> <p> I understand that the specific works proposed under the project include sea wall repairs and the insertion of a flood defence wall up to a maximum height of 4.25 m, which the council has indicated is the minimum recommended to protect this area of coastline.  The council has advised that these flood defence works will mean that 30% of the existing sea wall will remain at its current high level, 10% will be raised by between 1 and 8 inches, a further 32% will be raised by 8 inches to 1 ft. 4 in., with the remaining 28% raise in height by between 1 ft. 4 in. to 2 ft. 3 in., which will be the maximum height increase on any part of the flood defence wall.<\/p> <p> The proposed works are being undertaken against the background of the need to address the realities associated with adaptation to climate change and the putting in place of necessary flood risk management measures to address this phenomenon.  There are many areas of the country, including cities and towns, which are at risk from periodic flooding, and Dollymount promenade is seen to be particularly at risk as a result of rising tides and increasing sea levels.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111000033#FF00600","speaker":"1089","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1447180500,"counter":476,"content":"<p>The Minister of State can come back to the rest of his reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111000034#GG00200","speaker":"1026"},{"type":"speech","time":1447180500,"counter":477,"content":"<p>There are only two lines left.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111000034#GG00300","speaker":"984"},{"type":"speech","time":1447180500,"counter":478,"content":"<p>Okay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111000034#GG00400","speaker":"1026"},{"type":"speech","time":1447180500,"counter":479,"content":"<p>The works on the Dollymount promenade project have commenced.

It comprised elements of two schemes, one of which was the Dollymount promenade and flood protection project which received An Bord Plean&aacute;la approval in 2011.

I call on the city manager, Mr. Keegan, to make a statement on this matter.

In the end, two companies were selected to run labour activation measure on behalf of the Department.<\/p>  <p>  I understand almost &euro;7 million was spent on branding and publicising Intreo offices.  Those who engaged with the offices were assigned case workers who worked with them in trying to secure employment or upskilling.  The problem with the private companies operating the labour activation measures set up by the Department is that they are paid by results.<\/p><p>The reality on the ground - this is not hearsay and the evidence will bear this out - is that many of the people who are directed into those private companies - Seetec Limited and Turas Nua Limited - are being advised of things which I think are unethical.  For example, I know of one young lady who was advised to leave her qualifications off her CV because they indicated she would be overqualified for many of the jobs in which they were trying to place her.  Many individuals are being forced into low-paid jobs because it is done on a commission basis and the private companies are only paid if they are successful in placing somebody in employment.  What is happening is that people are being directed into low-paid jobs with no job security.  As a result, people are being recycled.  They are getting a low-paid job and are being let go.  They go back in again to the private companies and are again placed in another low-paid job and it is a continuous circle.<\/p> <p> I am sure all Deputies received the e-mail from a young lady who wrote a letter of complaint to the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, in respect of her experience with one of these companies, Seetec Limited.  It should be pointed out that Seetec Limited was under investigation in England for abuse of powers in respect of disabled people and how they were being treated in regard to labour activation measures.  That this company is running labour activation measures on behalf of the Department raises questions all on its own.  Some of the advice this individual got from a person in the private company was that she should leave her education qualifications off her CV, that she should not bother to get a full driving licence because one can drive around on a provisional licence, which is not the case, and not to go on to a community employment scheme because that scheme is being abused by people who do not wish to find real employment.  In her e-mail she said she felt put down, disrespected, belittled and bullied by the individual who was dealing with her who had no regard for what she wanted which was to try to secure sustainable employment.  The JobPath scheme is a failure and is just a profit-making exercise for private companies.

JobPath is a new approach to employment activation that will support people who are long-term unemployed and those most at risk of becoming long-term unemployed to secure and sustain paid employment.  Following the completion of a rigorous public procurement process, two companies were selected to provide the JobPath service, Turas Nua Limited and Seetec Limited.  The companies will deliver services directly and will also engage a range of local subcontractors, including local training and employment service providers.  In delivering these services the contractors will be supplementing and complementing the work of the Department's existing in-house case officers and the work of the mediators of the local employment services.  JobPath will not replace or substitute for these services.  It will provide additional capacity to extend case-managed activation to people who are long-term unemployed.<\/p>  <p>  JobPath has been designed having regard to international experience of contracted employment services.  Significant safeguards have been built into JobPath.  These include a service guarantee to ensure all participants receive a baseline level of service as well as payment penalties for the companies if service performance or service quality do not meet standards.<\/p>  <p>  Participants on JobPath will receive intensive individual support to help them address barriers to employment and to assist them in finding jobs.  Each person is assigned to a personal adviser who will assess a person's skills, experience, challenges and work goals.  A personal progression plan will be drawn up that will include a schedule of activities, actions and job-focused targets.  Participants are also provided with a range of training and development supports, including online modules, career advice, CV preparation and interview skills.  They will spend a year on the programme and if they are placed in a job, they may continue to receive support from the JobPath contractor for the first year of employment.  During their term on JobPath they may also be referred for further education and training opportunities.  Jobseekers retain their existing social welfare payments while on JobPath.<\/p>  <p>  An important feature of JobPath is that it is a payment by results contract.  Contractors are paid if and when they place clients into sustained employment.  In this regard employment is defined as work of at least 30 hours per week lasting for at least 13 weeks.  Contractors are paid a fee, in arrears, for each 13-week period of employment up to a maximum of four payments or one year's work.  This payment approach incentivises the contractors not just to find work for people but to strive to ensure the work is full time and sustained.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111000035#HH00200","speaker":"1089"},{"type":"speech","time":1447181100,"counter":486,"content":"<p>I will stop the Minister of State and he may come back to the rest of his reply.

This motion was considered by the Select Sub-Committee on Finance on Tuesday, 3 November.  Approval of this motion is an important part of the overall ratification process, with the other major element being the enabling legislation in Part 2 of the Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2015, Report Stage of which will be dealt with shortly.  There is a requirement for the member states to ratify the intergovernmental agreement before 30 November for the Single Resolution Mechanism to come into force by 1 January 2016.  As Members are aware, the Single Resolution Mechanism is a very important part of the banking union agenda and it is essential that it is ratified on time.  That is why I am seeking support for this motion.<\/p><p>The intergovernmental agreement was negotiated to enable the Single Resolution Fund, a key element of the Single Resolution Mechanism, to be put into operation.  The Single Resolution Mechanism will have a fund known as the Single Resolution Fund which will be financed by the banking sector.  In an ideal world, such a fund would have been fully mutualised from the outset.  However, because of concerns about legacy issues from a number of member states, this was not possible.  Consequently, the intergovernmental agreement was negotiated to facilitate a transition period of eight years to full mutualisation of the Single Resolution Fund by requiring that the contributions from the banking sectors of the participating member states are paid into national compartments within the fund in this time. This structure enables the progressive mutualisation of the fund by requiring that in the event of a call upon it, the national compartment of the affected member state pays first before, if necessary, the other compartments make a contribution.  As the transition proceeds, a smaller percentage is taken from the affected national compartment and a greater percentage is taken from the other compartments, until after eight years when full mutualisation occurs.  From that point, any funds required for the resolution of a bank or banks will come from the Single Resolution Fund as a whole.<\/p><p>I will give a brief overview of the Single Resolution Mechanism.  It is the second pillar of the banking union and will ensure that if a bank subject to the Single Supervisory Mechanism faces serious difficulties, its resolution will be managed efficiently, with minimal costs to taxpayers and the real economy through a single resolution board and a Single Resolution Fund financed by levies imposed on the banking sector.  The Single Resolution Mechanism applies to all credit institutions in the banking union.  The single resolution board is responsible for the effective and consistent functioning of the Single Resolution Mechanism but the operational side of its work is split with the national resolution authorities.  In this regard, the board is responsible for drawing up resolution plans and adopting all decisions relating to resolution from significant institutions, the category into which our four major institutions fall.  They are AIB Bank, Permanent TSB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank.  National resolution authorities, on the other hand, will be responsible for similar decisions for small institutions, except where the use of the Single Resolution Fund is required, where the board shall adopt the resolution scheme.<\/p><p>What this means in practice is that should any of our four major banks get into financial trouble, the decision about putting it into resolution will be made by the single resolution board rather than our domestic resolution authority.  In addition, where bail-in of shareholders, capital instruments and eligible liabilities are insufficient to cover the losses of the bank in question, there will be access to funds from the Single Resolution Fund.  This has the aim of breaking the link between banks and the sovereign and thus avoiding a repeat of the issues faced by countries during the recent financial crisis.<\/p><p>It should be noted that the target level of the Single Resolution Fund is at least 1% of the amount of covered deposits of all credit institutions authorised in all the participating member states, which is to be reached at the end of eight years.  This is estimated to be in the region of &euro;55 billion.  We estimate that the contribution of Irish banks to the Single Resolution Fund will be &euro;1.8 billion over the eight years, which amounts to approximately &euro;225 million per year.  The contribution of international banks to the overall total is likely to be significant - in the region of at least 50% - but unfortunately it is not possible to be more precise in the matter at this stage.<\/p><p>On the question of whether the fund of &euro;55 billion is sufficient, it should be noted that at the time of the negotiation of the Single Resolution Mechanism regulation, there was considerable discussion around the topic.  However, the general view that emerged was that most of the losses of a bank should be recovered by the bail-in of shareholders and creditors in line with the general philosophy underpinning the Single Resolution Mechanism regulation and the bank recovery and resolution directive.  In this regard, a contribution to loss absorption and recapitalisation equal to an amount of not less than 8% of the total liabilities, including own funds of the institution under resolution, measured at the time of the resolution action, must be used before the Single Resolution Fund can contribute.  This is a significant contribution to loss absorption and should, in many instances mean that the use of the fund will not be needed.  Therefore, in this context, the view of most member states was that a fund of &euro;55 billion struck an appropriate balance between the need to establish a credible and effective fund while at the same time not overly burdening the banking sector from a contribution perspective.<\/p><p>As noted at the outset, the passing of this motion is an essential part of the ratification process for the intergovernmental agreement and I would appreciate Members' support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111000036#JJ00500","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1447181700,"counter":493,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on behalf of Fianna F&aacute;il to the motion approving the terms of the intergovernmental agreement on the transfer and mutualisation of contributions to the Single Resolution Fund.  The Single Resolution Fund is an integral part of the banking union process that is designed to break the link between weak banks and taxpayer bailouts.  Fianna F&aacute;il supports the concept of banking union while maintaining our belief that Europe has still not made good on the commitment it entered into in June 2012 when it pledged to break the link between bank debt and sovereign debt.<\/p><p>Until such time as this is resolved, Ireland must continue to press its case for meaningful relief from the debt which was taken on to rescue the banks.  In the short time available for debate on this motion I will focus on three aspects of it: the size of the Single Resolution Fund, the period over which it is being implemented and the ultimate need for treaty change to underpin the process.<br\/><br\/>As my colleague, Deputy Michael McGrath, has pointed out, the Single Resolution Fund is likely to be too small for the purposes for which it is intended.  It is also not being implemented soon enough and is likely to suffer from political difficulties relating to its implementation.  I will start by addressing the size of the fund.  I concur with the principle that the Single Resolution Mechanism should in so far as possible be constructed with the intention of minimising the recourse to national taxpayers' money.  This would ensure that where a regional banking crisis develops, possibly for reasons outside the control of the national government, that country will not be overwhelmed by the cost of rescuing its banking sector.  As it stands, banks will contribute to the costs of resolution through the collection of levies, and where there is a shortfall, through <i>ex post<\/i>levies.<br\/><br\/>The initial target level of funding for the Single Resolution Fund is &euro;55 billion, to be achieved by 2024.  This is the estimated value of 1% of deposits of all institutions authorised by the relevant national authorities.  However, the eurozone banking sector is more than three times the size of the wider eurozone economy.  In that context, will the resolution fund be large enough to underpin the &euro;33 trillion eurozone banking sector?  The Open Europe organisation has estimated that a fund would need to be around &euro;500 billion to &euro;600 billion to provide a viable backstop for a banking sector this size in line with international comparisons and standards.<br\/><br\/>One of the most concerning aspects of the process is that so-called national compartments of funding for resolution will not be phased out until 2024.  This is a very long period when individual countries will be largely left to their own devices for resolving a banking crisis within their own borders.  It is a long way short of the notion of banking union and mutual support across countries.  There is every chance that a banking crisis will hit an individual member state before full introduction of the Single Resolution Fund.<br\/><br\/>The final issue I want to touch on is the potential need for treaty change to underpin the process for rescuing banks.  Under the current process, the single resolution board will make the initial assessment of whether a bank needs to be put into resolution.  It has the task of putting in place the rescue plan and deciding whether a call will be made on the Single Resolution Fund.  As current EU treaty provisions preclude the delegation of policy-making powers to a subsidiary body such as the single resolution board, it will be necessary for the European Commission to take the final decision to trigger resolution and use the fund.  This is where potential political difficulties arise.  There is still a mindset whereby European Commission members act primarily in what they perceive to be their national self-interest.  Any proposal for a streamlined process to remove the final decision-making power from the European Commission and vest it in the single resolution board will almost certainly meet with resistance from the German authorities.  If necessary, Ireland should seek to be build a consensus for treaty change to remove this potential roadblock to the successful implementation of the Single Resolution Mechanism.  Unless this happens, it is likely that the less than perfect system being presented to us will remain in place for some time to come.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111000036#JJ00600","speaker":"999","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1447182300,"counter":495,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas as ucht an deis labhairt ar an r&uacute;n seo.  Since the crash, we have heard many times that the Government seeks to break the link between the sovereign and the bank and that link needs to be separated fully.  Here we are, almost in 2016, and the final pieces of this process are coming together, but what we have is something that is watered down beyond recognition.  There is still a risk between the banking system and the sovereigns.  This period of eight years of mutualisation, which the Germans sought and got, will allow this risk to continue into the future.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, many organisations around Europe have argued that the fund being set up is too small to deal with the potential size of a banking crash and the procedures put in place do not go far enough to safeguard citizens from reckless bankers.  My colleague, Deputy Pearse Doherty, raised with the Minister at committee the fact we are not convinced there is a full understanding of how new entrants or legal changes to existing banks, such as the change we saw in Ulster Bank recently, are going to be dealt with under these new rules.  It seems there is a major gap and Frankfurt will decide in the future.<\/p>  <p>  The crucial failure, and this is very important, is that none of these new procedures that are being put in place throughout Europe after years of the EU stumbling and lunging around will do anything for Ireland's banking legacy debt.  That is one of the biggest issues at the heart of society and the economy at the moment.  The towel was thrown in on the Anglo-Irish Bank debt in February 2013 and that toxic debt has been placed on the shoulders of citizens of my generation and of the next generation.  Even their children will probably be paying for the mistakes of the Government on that toxic debt.  At the same time, some of the speculators involved in that are on course to benefit to the tune of hundreds of millions of euro on that toxic debt.<\/p>  <p>  The other chunk of debt, the pillar bank debt, was subject to the great game changer, the seismic shift.  We were told that Ireland would be able to apply retrospectively for recapitalisation.  Some of us called it correctly at the time.  We said the Government was over-egging what was in fact a vague commitment.  Here we are in 2015, approaching 2016, and they still have not bothered drawing up the rules on how a country can retrospectively recapitalise and how that system can work.  That is quite shocking.  We had the Taoiseach coming back to the State, like Neville Chamberlain, nearly saying \"peace in our time\" and that we had resolved this recapitalisation.  Now we are being told by the same Government that it is not even in our interest to apply for that money back.  Defeat is dressed up as victory.  When it comes to our banking debt, the Government has failed significantly twice and has called it victory both times.  It was unambiguously Frankfurt's way all the time.<\/p>  <p>  While Sinn F&eacute;in does not oppose this motion, as it is a technical one, I want to put on the record our party's distrust over the increasing powers being handed over to the ECB.  The undemocratic nature of that organisation has become increasingly clear.  It is entirely unaccountable to the national parliaments and to the citizens of the European Union, yet it increasingly oversees whole chunks of our economy.  My understanding is that even at the highest level of Europe there is little clarity as to the extent of the ECB's powers and that it will be decided case by case basis exactly what its competencies will be.  This is a very large issue at the heart of this process with regard to the ability of this State to determine its economic future.  I appeal to the Minister to stand up to Europe on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111000037#KK00200","speaker":"1080"},{"type":"speech","time":1447182300,"counter":496,"content":"<p>We can date this agreement back to the infamous summit in June 2012.  At that summit two clear commitments were made: affirming that it is imperative to break the vicious circle between banks and sovereigns and making a commitment to examine the situation of the Irish financial sector with a view to improving further the sustainability of the well-performing adjustment programme.<\/p><p>I will deal with the first commitment presently.<br\/><br\/>The second commitment was translated in the heads of the Taoiseach and the former T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Gilmore, into a game changer, a seismic shift and a promise that there would be retrospective recapitalisation of the Irish banking system.  Taxpayers in Ireland would get back some of the 42% of the total cost of the European banking crisis that they paid.  It was something which the media at the time fell for entirely, despite some of us pointing out the reality that was not contained in what was agreed and that it was an element of the kind of dreaming that goes on in the Taoiseach's head, a similar example being the ATM machines and the soldiers.  As Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n mentioned, the Government not only has been defeated on it but also has tried to present that as a victory.  It never applied for recapitalisation and it has no intention of applying for recapitalisation, and that should be noted now at a time when the Single Resolution Mechanism is being set up, by which time we were meant to have all of this sorted out.<br\/><br\/>I want to deal with the idea that this breaks the link between the sovereign and the banking sector, or as the former Commissioner for Internal Market and Services, Mr. Michel Bernier, stated, &quot;that taxpayers no longer foot the bill when banks make mistakes&quot;.  It is simply not true.  The big banks and their massive lobbying in Europe to the tune of &euro;120 million a year and 1,700 lobbyists, have shaped the Single Resolution Mechanism and taken any significant punch out of it to serve their interests.  This does not mean the public will not bail out banks in the future.  Banking union has been used as a mechanism by the big banks primarily to further liberalisation and deregulation throughout the European Union.  That is the reason the big Association for Financial Markets in Europe, AFME, welcomed banking union as a vital project which should advance market integration.<br\/><br\/>The Single Resolution Fund is entirely inadequate.  I thought it was best explained by Mr. Wolfgang M&uuml;nchau who wrote that the ECB will end up as the supervisor of 128 banks which have assets of between &euro;26 trillion and &euro;27 trillion.  He wrote:<\/p><blockquote>The bank resolution fund for this new banking union will be built up over 10 years through bank levies.  At the end of that period it will have reached &euro;55bn &ndash; a mere 0.2 per cent of the asset base.  Most of these banks have assets of more than &euro;30bn.  In a systemic crisis, in which banks can suddenly collapse, the whole European resolution fund could easily be swallowed by a single moderately sized bank. <\/blockquote><p>If that happens, it is the European Stability Mechanism, ESM, which is funded by taxpayers and will have conditionality built into it, as happened in Spain in the form of the demand for more austerity, that will pick up the can.  The Minister, if he had the chance, could point in response to the 8% of liabilities to be paid for by investors, but what about Anglo Irish Bank?  It far exceeded 8%.  What about the exceptions?  What about the various classes of investors who will not be included and who will not have to pay the 8%?<br\/><br\/>The reality is that we do not have fundamental change and public money will still be used to bail out private banks.  The European Central Bank has been further empowered.  It is the most powerful unelected and unaccountable institution in the world.  It serves the interests of big banks, hedge funds and financial markets.  It does not serve the interests of ordinary people.  One need only look at the incredible dictatorial role it has played in the European crisis in Greece, Spain and Italy.  This simply empowers it further.  Those who oppose it should vote against this motion and not go along with it.<br\/><br\/>The alternative is proper regulation of our banking system, genuinely preventing banks from becoming too big to fail but also fundamentally saying that we do not accept that we run society in the interests of private banks that are interested in maximising profit.  The massive resources that exist in the financial sector should be in public hands and used as a public utility, democratically controlled to serve the interests of society to provide funds, loans and so on necessary to provide infrastructure for small businesses and for others who need access to funds.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111000037#KK00300","speaker":"1197","continuing":true},{"type":"vote","time":1447183200,"counter":498,"content":"<p>Question put:<\/p><p>The D\u00e1il divided: T\u00e1, 74; N\u00edl, 12.<\/p><br\/><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Deputies Emmet Stagg and Joe Carey; N\u00edl, Deputies John Halligan and Paul Murphy.<\/p><p>Question declared carried.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111000039#MM00050","aye":["1066","1199","989","1029","1030","1071","1042","975","1083","1031","1041","1087","1099","1006","991","1101","986","1091","1046","968","976","1011","1103","957","1085","1047","1068","1100","1108","1076","1089","1049","1097","973","1012","1188","983","1072","1021","1110","1053","962","990","999","1008","1180","1000","997","981","1082","998","1026","1070","985","1034","1056","1045","969","1028","1060","1058","1069","971","1061","966","947","952","1048","961","1102","1080","1010","1095","948"],"nay":["1003","1190","1193","1050","1094","960","1017","1183","1197","1001","953","1203"]}]
