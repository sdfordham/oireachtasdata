It also clarifies that children born to diplomats and associated persons who are exempt from immigration controls do not qualify for Irish citizenship by birth, unless one of the child&rsquo;s parents is an Irish citizen or entitled to be, a British citizen, a person entitled to reside in the State without any restriction on his or her residence, or a person entitled to reside in Northern Ireland without any restriction on his or her residence.<\/p><p>With the amendments I am proposing to address a minor anomaly that has been identified in our citizenship legislation with regard to Irish public servants serving the State overseas.  Under section 7(3) of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, a person born outside the island of Ireland derives Irish citizenship through a parent who was also born outside the island of Ireland but only if their birth was registered on the foreign births register.  Pursuant to section 7(3)(b), if at the time of birth that parent was abroad in the public service of the State, the person is automatically an Irish citizen without being required to be registered on the foreign births register.  This ensures children born to non-Irish born public servants serving abroad are not disadvantaged in terms of entitlement to citizenship.  However, an issue has been identified with the provision insofar as disadvantages may arise in respect of subsequent generations.  For example, if a person who has derived his or her citizenship by virtue of section 7(3)(b) and who is not a public servant has a child abroad, assuming the child&rsquo;s other parent is also non-Irish born, that child would not derive Irish citizenship unless registered on the foreign births register.  The proposed amendments are aimed at correcting this anomaly by deeming such a person as having been born on the island of Ireland for the purposes of that subsection. <\/p><p>I am sure Deputies will agree that public servants working overseas do crucial work and are a credit to the State.  In many cases, taking up a foreign posting can entail considerable sacrifices for the individuals concerned and their families.  For these reasons, we are committed to ensuring disadvantages are minimised.  This is a minor anomaly in the citizenship legislation.  Nonetheless, it seems appropriate to take the opportunity in a miscellaneous provisions Bill to address it to ensure public servants, their children and grandchildren will not be disadvantaged under the citizenship laws.  I hope Deputies can support the amendments which are a practical and sensible response to recognising what service abroad is actually about, namely, working for one's country.  In simple terms, the provisions recognise that when an Irish diplomat serving abroad has children abroad, in law it is the same as having a child at home.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2017102400002#A00800","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1508839200,"counter":12,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1508839200,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 2:<\/p><blockquote>In page 6, between lines 27 and 28, to insert the following:&quot;(c) in section 7 (amended by section 3 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 2001) by the insertion of the following after subsection (3):<blockquote>&quot;(3A) A person to whom paragraph (b) of subsection (3) applies shall be deemed to have been born on the island of Ireland for the purposes<br \/><br \/>of that subsection.&quot;,<\/blockquote>and&rdquo;.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2017102400002#B00200","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1508839200,"counter":14,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1508839200,"counter":15,"content":"<p>Deputy Se&aacute;n Crowe submitted an amendment that was ruled out of order.

The section seeks to amend the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956 to provide that any period of time spent in the State where persons are exempt from immigration controls, as workers in embassies are, is not reckonable for residency in the context of a naturalisation application.  The rights of embassy workers are important and should not be undermined or interfered with in any way.  On Second Stage I said I did not understand why this provision was being included in the Bill.  Is it to do with immigration controls, checks and so on?  It proposes to take away the rights of a category of persons without any explanation as to why it is being done.  I still do not understand the purpose of excluding in this way what is likely to be a very a small group of workers which will probably comprise no more than 20 or 30 persons.<\/p> <p>  Following the Second Stage debate, nobody from the Department contacted me to provide the information I had requested and the section remains the same.  That is bad form.  It is seldom we have legislation passing through the House these days but normally the Minister or the Minister of State who sums up the debate will reply to questions raised by Members in the course of the debate.  That was not done in this instance.  I acknowledge that it was the Minister's predecessor who took the debate, but it is still unacceptable.  On Second Stage I asked the previous Minister to explain why these workers should be treated differently from others and indicate how many people had applied for naturalisation or citizenship in this way in recent years.  I pointed out that having this important information would help to explain the inclusion of this provision.  I questioned why this change was being made at this time and asked the Minister to outline the policy goal it reflected, but none of my questions was answered.  Does the Minister agree that they deserve some response?<\/p> <p>  On Second Stage I indicated my intention to raise this matter again on Committee Stage unless my questions were answered in a satisfactory manner.  Bizarrely, I was told my amendment had been ruled out of order because the retention of the current provision might involve a cost to the Exchequer.  Apparently, under the existing provision, people might potentially be eligible for citizenship at an earlier date, as a consequence of which additional costs might arise.  That is my understanding of the reason the change is being made.  That is an unacceptable usage of Standing Order 179(3), in respect of which there is no appeal mechanism.  When I queried why it cost an applicant &euro;950 to apply for Irish citizenship, I was told that the charge was necessary to cover the cost of the administration work involved in processing the application and reflective of the high value in which Irish citizenship was held.  If applicants are paying for their own application process, how can more applications be considered to be a charge on Revenue, or do citizenship applications cost the State money?  <\/p> <p>  I am seeking clarity from the Minister on these legitimate questions.  I am unable to push the amendment to a vote, but the Minister can do so on Report Stage.  If he does not, I will be voting against the Bill, something I do not want to do.  I have no other objections to what is a largely technical Bill.  When an Oireachtas Member asks legitimate questions, he or she should be given answers.

As the Chairman noted, neither I nor my Department has a role in deciding whether an amendment is ruled in or out of order.  From a policy perspective, the Deputy deserves to understand why we have not brought forward a similar proposal to what he has set out in the amendment which has been ruled out of order.  During the Second Stage debate my predecessor, Deputy Charles Flanagan, explained the rationale for this policy which I will reiterate briefly for the benefit of the Deputy.<\/p> <p>  Under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, members of diplomatic missions and their families are required to be exempt from immigration controls.  With regard to citizenship, like many other countries, Ireland has long considered that the spirit of the Vienna Convention envisages people coming to the State as employees of a foreign government for a finite period of time before returning to that country or another on assignment.  In these circumstances, it is considered appropriate to exclude such persons from the mainstream citizenship arrangements, just as they are exempt from immigration controls, one being a logical corollary of the other.  In effect, employees of foreign governments are deemed to be the responsibility of those governments.  Persons who are working in a diplomatic mission here are effectively exempt from all sort of things, including a potential liability for tax and PRSI, and do not need to go through work permit application procedures or anything like that.  They come as part of a diplomatic mission and are usually here for a set period before moving to another mission, whether back home or in a different state.  As such, they are in a different category from other types of non-citizen worker.  Somebody who receives a work permit to come here is effectively part of the Irish immigration system by being here.  After four to five years, he or she has the timeline required to be eligible to apply for naturalisation.  By contrast, a person who comes to Ireland to work in a diplomatic mission bypasses all of these application procedures and arrives as part of a team from another country, representing that country's interests and being employed by its government.  Of course, at some later point, if such persons wish to apply to come here as individuals, they may do so on the same basis as anybody else.<\/p><p>The matter being raised by the Deputy was whether they should be able to use the time they spent here on a diplomatic mission as time towards a naturalisation application at some stage in future.  That was not the intention of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations in general.  Just as when Irish teams are abroad in Irish embassies, they are essentially still part of Ireland although they operate outside the State as a representative for Ireland.  That was the rationale as outlined by the previous Minister, Deputy Flanagan.  I will take a look at it in a bit more detail if the Deputy so wishes before Report and Final Stages.  Perhaps we could have a stab at the numbers involved, as they would not be huge.  There is a point of principle whereby somebody who comes to Ireland and needs to go through the permitting and visa procedures and who works here on the back of that permit system is in a different category to somebody who comes here as part of a diplomatic team.  I will have a look at it but the rationale as outlined by the former Minister stands, and that is why we do not have an amendment mirroring that of the Deputy yet.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2017102400002#B01100","speaker":"1286","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1508839200,"counter":24,"content":"<p>Question put and declared carried.<\/p><p>Sections 10 and 11 agreed to.<\/p><p>Title agreed to.<\/p><p>Bill reported with amendments.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1508839200,"counter":25,"content":"<p>As the Bill has completed Committee Stage, it is recommended that members submit Report Stage amendments to the Bills Office without delay as Report Stage may be tabled at short notice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2017102400002#C00300","speaker":"1270"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Message to D\u00e1il","time":1508839200,"counter":26,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2017102400002#C00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1508839200,"counter":27,"content":"<p>In accordance with Standing Order 90, the following message will be sent to the D&aacute;il:<\/p><blockquote>The Select Committee on Foreign Affairs, Trade and Defence has completed its consideration of the Diplomatic Relations (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2017 and has made amendments thereto.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2017102400002#C00500","speaker":"1270"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict (Hague Convention) Bill 2016: Committee Stage","time":1508839200,"counter":28,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2017102400002#C00600"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1508839200,"counter":29,"content":"<p>Sections 1 to 11, inclusive, agreed to.<\/p><p>Schedules 1 and 2 agreed to.<\/p><p>Question proposed: \"That the Title be the Title to the Bill.\"<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1508839200,"counter":30,"content":"<p>I will make a general comment as I have not had the chance to put anything on the record in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2017102400002#C00800","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1508839200,"counter":31,"content":"<p>The Minister could quit while he is winning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2017102400002#C00900","speaker":"1313"},{"type":"speech","time":1508839200,"counter":32,"content":"<p>I am impressed by the committee's pace.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2017102400002#C01000","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1508839200,"counter":33,"content":"<p>We might put a time limit on this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2017102400002#C01100","speaker":"1270"},{"type":"speech","time":1508839200,"counter":34,"content":"<p>Everything that needed to be said was said on Second Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2017102400002#C01200","speaker":"1228"},{"type":"speech","time":1508839200,"counter":35,"content":"<p>I wish every Chairman was as efficient as this Chairman.

This is as important in terms of the signal sent to other countries as it is to the law in Ireland.  I am glad to say we are unlikely to have armed conflict in Ireland where this law would be necessary to apply but, unfortunately, many other countries are not in those circumstances.  We have seen devastating consequences of the destruction of very significant cultural and historical monuments, artefacts and so on in the latest Syrian war, for example, as well as many other conflicts in other parts of the world.

It is useful to be cognisant of the various aspects of cultural property in this country during peace, and not just in the case of war, as the Bill outlines.  It would be farcical to lament the destruction of cultural property in war without applying the same standards to the preservation of such property during peace.<\/p> <p>  We need only look at the historical quarter around Moore Street, which falls into the broad and positive definition of cultural property as laid down in section 1 of this Bill, yet it remains under threat from the policies of the Government and construction companies.

We have seen historic buildings being knocked down by developers because of light-touch legislation in the past and I refer to fighting a legal battle against the likes of the Moore Street campaign with public money in order to side with developers, whose only appreciation of culture is from pictures on bank notes.

In order for that to happen, the two largest parties need to find a way to accommodate each other, which is not easy, and I recognise the efforts made by both parties and their negotiating teams in recent weeks.  That has happened in private, which is as it should be, but the negotiations cannot go on forever, as everyone knows, so we are coming to a point where people must make choices.  My job and that of the Secretary of State, James Brokenshire, is to try to facilitate and encourage and help parties find the accommodation that is necessary in a way that is true to the agreements, including the Good Friday Agreement.  There is a genuine effort in both the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in to do that and support from the other political parties who want to be part of a fully inclusive executive in Northern Ireland.  We are at a point where most people accept that negotiations cannot continue week after week.  Northern Ireland needs a budget.  There are practical issues around that.
