While we discussed those accounts during that meeting it was only following the meeting that I got a proper look at the accounts, which were for the year ended 30 June 2011 and as such were a year and a half old at that stage.  I then looked at the commissions' websites and noted that those accounts had been posted on 13 January, which was a few days prior to that meeting.  The 2011 accounts were audited and signed off by Mr. John Buckley on 21 December 2011.  Perhaps the Comptroller and Auditor and General will tell us if the 2012 accounts have been signed off.<\/p><p>  It would have been far more beneficial for the committee to have had the most recent annual accounts as the topic on the agenda for our meeting on 17 January.  However, there was so much going on we did not get into that.  During a meeting last summer with another organisation - I think it was the NTMA - it transpired that we were dealing with accounts which were a year and a half old.  Within hours of that meeting finishing the organisation's accounts for the following year were published.  While they had been fully available within the system they had not been published.  It is important organisations are asked about the status of their most recent accounts prior to appearing before the committee.  We were way behind the clock last week in terms of the accounts with which we were dealing.  Have the commissions' annual accounts for the year ending 30 June 2012 been signed off?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013012400003#B00300","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1359021600,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I do not recall having signed them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013012400003#B00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1359021600,"counter":10,"content":"<p>The annual accounts for the year ending 30 June 2011 were signed off on 21 December 2011, which led me to query whether the 2012 accounts had been signed off.

Its first set of financial statements covered a 13 month period ending in December 2010.  Its 2011 financial statements are the subject of today's committee discussion.  Clear audit opinions were issued on both the 2010 and 2011 financial statements.<\/p><p>  The authority has responsibility for public transport capital investment in the greater Dublin area and projects promoting sustainable transport nationwide.  During 2011 it also assumed responsibility for licensing of public bus passenger services and taxi regulation, as provided for in the Public Transport Regulation Act 2009.  Its activities are largely funded by the Exchequer with funding from the Vote for the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  Some income is received from its bus and taxi licensing activities, but it has two main programmes of expenditure - capital investment grants paid to the CIE group companies, the Railway Procurement Agency and local authorities; and public service obligation, PSO, compensation payments to the three transport companies, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann.<\/p><p>  In 2011 the authority provided a total of &euro;204 million to fund capital investment in transport.  Just under two thirds of this funding - &euro;130 million - went to the CIE companies to fund capital investment within the greater Dublin area.  Most of the rest of the capital funding was provided for the Railway Procurement Agency and local authorities.  The majority of the large projects funded in 2011 had already been sanctioned and under way when the authority came into being.  Some of the projects funded in 2011 and earlier years have been deferred as a result of a Government decision in November 2011.  Significant expenditure has been incurred on some of these projects, including metro north, metro west and the DART underground.<\/p><p>  On its establishment in December 2009, the authority took over responsibility from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport for providing and overseeing public service obligation funding for the CIE group.  Public service obligation services are defined as \"socially necessary but financially unviable public transport services\".  The three CIE companies provide such services under contract to the authority.  The contracts set standards of operational performance and customer service and contain penalties for under-performance.  The current service contracts were signed in December 2009 and are for a period of five years in the case of bus services and ten years in the case of rail services.<\/p><p>  The authority also has responsibility for integrating payment and information systems for public transport.  One of the main projects in this area is the integrated ticketing system.  In September 2010 responsibility for this project transferred to the authority from the Railway Procurement Agency.  When the integrated ticketing project began in 2002, the Railway Procurement Agency planned that it would be delivered by 2005 at a cost of just under &euro;30 million.  When my office reviewed the project in 2006, it was found that the budget and project timescale were unrealistic and they were subsequently revised.  In the event, the Leap card was launched for Dublin Bus, Irish Rail and Luas in December 2011.  Phase 2 of the project includes the roll-out of integrated ticketing to other operators and the modification of the Leap card to take account of free travel.  Work on these aspects is ongoing.  The chief executive will be able to brief the committee on progress.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013012400005#D00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1359022800,"counter":53,"content":"<p>Will Mr. Murphy make his opening statement?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013012400005#D00500","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1359022800,"counter":54,"content":"<p>I believe it is appropriate to set out where we fit into the transport sector, an aspect the Comptroller and Auditor General has broadly covered.  When the National Transport Authority was established in December 2009, we subsumed the functions of the Dublin Transportation Office.  Later we took functions from the Railway Procurement Agency and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  After that, the Commission for Taxi Regulation was subsumed into our organisation.  We are responsible for public transport, as well as cycling and walking.<\/p><p>  We have contracts with the CIE companies and are responsible for the light rail service in Dublin.  We have assigned that function to the Railway Procurement Agency.  We have now started a tendering process for the replacement contract in 2014 for the operation of the light rail system in Dublin.  <\/p><p>  We also regulate and license public bus services which operate without subsidy from the State.  There is a wide range of services.  In the Dublin area people will be familiar with Swords Express and Aircoach, but throughout the country services are provided by private companies under licence.  <\/p><p>  We manage the rural transport programme on behalf of the Department.  We took over this function in the middle of 2012.  It includes all of the local services that emanated originally from the rural transport initiative which then became the rural transport programme.  Some of these are demand responsive services in rural areas, where people make a telephone call and the local bus picks them up.<\/p><p>  The Leap card was mentioned.  It is at the heart of the integration of public transport services.  Another successful project we have rolled out is the provision of real-time information for bus services.  We have also launched a national journey planner for all public transport services, both public and private.  It is the first time this has been made available.  One can plan one's journey across all operators in the State.<\/p><p>  At the start of 2011 we took over regulation of the taxi sector which includes taxis, hackneys and limousines.  This has been a very busy year with regard to implementing the recommendations of the Government's taxi review report.  Just this month we introduced a raft of new regulations and more will be introduced when the taxi Bill is enacted by the Oireachtas.<\/p><p>  We have a statutory planning role.  The objective is to integrate land use, transport provision and consolidation of land use to make transport provision more cost effective.  We do this throughout the country and advise regional authorities on their regional planning guidelines.<\/p><p>  We have a greater depth of functions within the Dublin area.  The greater Dublin area includes the four Dublin local authorities, Kildare, Meath and Wicklow.  It covers 40% of the population of the State and 40% of economic activity.  One can understand public transport capital investment is particularly important for this metropolitan region.  We deal with capital investment in the region, as well as regional traffic planning and securing greater integration between land use and transport planning.  The authority manages the capital investment programme for public transport, cycling and walking and funds the transport operators and local authorities for approved projects.  We also manage the capital investment programme for the regional cities of Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford on behalf of the Department, while we manage the national accessibility programme which deals with access to transport services for people with disabilities.<\/p><p>  A substantial amount of money, approximately &euro;500 million per annum, passes through our organisation.  We have been strongly focused from the start on adequate and robust financial and audit controls.  We have introduced a new financial management system which has streamlined our internal processes and made them more efficient by giving us greater capacity for analysis and reporting.  We have introduced a web-based grants system for all the bodies we grant aid which facilitates their submission of grant claims, our monitoring of progress and the disbursement of money to them.  In any one year we fund over 300 projects on the capital side.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013012400005#D00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1359022800,"counter":55,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. Murphy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013012400005#D00700","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speech","time":1359022800,"counter":56,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Murphy for attending.

Deputy Ross is asserting that there was a rationale to force efficiencies.  We advised that public transport is one of the lowest subsidised public transport systems in Europe and any cut to subsidy would lead to a cut in services.  The only way we can prevent significant cuts in services is to look at fares increases and try to grow passenger numbers through initiatives such as the Leap card, real-time information or to try to steady passenger numbers - which has been achieved this year - across all operators.  Our task in applying our contract which has onerous service requirements, such as frequency, reliability and quality factors is to rigorously enforce that contract.  I can say that since December 2009, CIE met all the targets and its performance moneys have been released to it, except for one minor exception for Saturday services by Dublin Bus.  Each year we have strengthened the parameters in those contracts and we have disaggregated the reporting.  For example, when we started the contract Bus &Eacute;ireann was reporting on a global basis, we have disaggregated reporting by city, by Dublin commute and by other services.  We have disaggregated reporting in Dublin Bus by corridor and brought greater depth of rigour in its own analysis of its operations.<\/p><p>  Our function is to monitor the contracts.  The contracts are operating satisfactorily.  We have preserved the bulk of services in the State, notwithstanding a significant drop in public subsidy from an already very under-subsidised public transport system.  By 2014, &euro;80 million a year will have been taken out of the subsidies to public transport, amounting to a 25% drop in what was an under-funded sector.  At the same time, generally bus services in Dublin are satisfactory, the rail services are satisfactory and the service on rural and city buses outside Dublin are provided.  There have been service reductions but we have tried to minimise their effect.  We have had fares applications from each of the operators.  We have asked for increased information to support the applications.  We have not accepted all the fares applications and have made significant reductions in the fares CIE proposed.  At the same time in the Dublin area we have incentivised the use of the Leap card and have introduced significant differentials from the cash fares, which are the highlight fares.  We have more than a 19% differential on rail, a 15% differential on light rail services and a 12% differential on Dublin Bus.  If customers had moved to using the Leap card instead of cash on Dublin Bus, they would not suffer an increase in fares.  There is a strategy in place.<\/p><p>  In regard to intercity rail pricing, we have simplified the system by eliminating the anomalies resulting from the historical legacy.  We now have a single journey, a day return, and an open return.  We have moved to distance and corridor-based pricing, reflecting journey speed.  It will take five or six years to get all the anomalies out of the system.  The end objective is to get a transparent easy to pay fares system which moves to smart card payment, which reduces the handling costs and increases the frequency of buses by reducing boarding time.  There is a strategy to the way we increase fares, there is a rigour to the approach we take to analysing the fares increases.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013012400007#F01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1359024000,"counter":133,"content":"<p>I am not disputing any of that.

What the NTA is doing is getting buses to run efficiently but it is shovelling money at an organisation that is inherently inefficient and deficient in the way it handles its own funds.  The evidence for that is quite clear and not just in the Baker Tilly report which found the corruption, and not just in all sorts of other areas that keep emerging.

The Department froze that process in 2009 or 2010 and any new people coming in with licences avail of that.  A review is currently being carried out by the Departments of Social Protection and Transport, Tourism and Sport - Ms Graham sits on the relevant national committee - in respect of where we are going in the context of the subsidisation of free travel.

We are contracted with the operators.  The operators are reducing their costs year on year and when we look at their fares increases, it is in the context of whether we want to maintain services, the drop in subsidy, the drop in patronage revenues and their cost control.  For example, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has reduced staff numbers from 6,000 to 4,000 in the past eight years.  Bus &Eacute;ireann has driven down its costs, and Dublin Bus has driven down its costs.  We are seeing cost reduction plans in the organisations.  We are seeing growing efficiencies.  In the Dublin area, where Dublin Bus is the biggest carrier of public transport in the State, we have seen a fundamental reorganisation of its services and its network direct.  It is much more efficient.  We have reorganised the services for Bus &Eacute;ireann in the regional cities.  In Galway, we are seeing a 20% increase in revenue from that and we are now reviewing all the services in rural areas throughout the State.  There are efficiency measures in place.  When we get the fares increases and look at the diminishing subsidies, we must also take account of whether we want to keep the network of public transport services operational in the State.<\/p><p>  We have separately reported to the Minister on the bus market and it is no secret that we have recommended to the Minister that there should be an opening of the bus market in 2014.  It is a matter for the Government to consider that item and it has to come back to us.  We have met with the Government's economic committee and we have been told to wait until we get a response.  We have identified that savings could be made by some graded opening of the market.  We believe that could work well.  It could also work well for the existing State operators because they will see benchmarking of a private operator doing a similar business.<\/p><p>  We are conscious of all these matters but I come back to the fundamental point that the organisations are not grossly inefficient.  Deloitte was commissioned by the Department of Transport in 2007.  It did a review of the operations of Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann and said that in general they were comparable with international standards.  That is not to say that we cannot achieve cost savings.  They are not grossly inefficient, therefore, and there are opportunities for efficiencies but they are under-subsidised.  They also have the perfect storm as the subsidy is dropping, passenger numbers have been dropping across all operators and because they are reliant on the revenue as well as on the passenger numbers they have been hit by that double whammy and the triple whammy of fuel duty rebate being gone.  All those factors have come about to create the cash flow problems for the CIE Group, the need for &euro;36 million to come in and our fares increases but we have reserved our position.  We have said we will only consider a fares increase annually on the basis of projections of cost savings, revenues, the services they will provide and the quality of what they have delivered in the past year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013012400016#P02400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1359029400,"counter":483,"content":"<p>I disagree with some of the points Mr. Murphy has made and I will come back to them in some other way but I want to ask a final question.<\/p> <p>Has Mr. Murphy a comment on the cost of the CIE board and chairman?

There are two strands to the work that is ongoing at the moment.  First of all, there was a value for money review of the rural transport programme.  It was found that there were excessive administration costs and a proliferation of groups - notwithstanding the great commitment of the groups - and that these costs need to be trimmed because there are cuts going into that rural transport system each year, like everywhere else.  What we are looking at is how we can rationalise the administration of the programme, keep the services and keep the local knowledge.  We have made some recommendations to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, which is considering them and discussing them with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  The idea of aligning with local government is partly at the heart of it, with local government doing more in this area.<\/p><p>  The second strand is to consider how we can integrate services.  One may have rural transport buses and one may also have buses or minibuses providing health care attendance or hospital attendance.

This is the first General Affairs Council of the Irish Presidency and I will have the honour of chairing the meeting.  The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Creighton, will represent Ireland.  The agenda is still being finalised but discussion is expected to cover the cohesion policy legislative package, our Presidency work programme and preparations for the European Councils on 7-8 February and 14-15 March.  Following the meeting President Van Rompuy will join Ministers at lunch to discuss the European Council later in the week.<\/p><p>  Before outlining February's business, I would like to update the committee on discussions at the final General Affairs Council of 2012, which took place on 11 December, as I did not have a chance to do so in the immediate aftermath.  I represented Ireland alongside the Minister of State, Deputy Creighton.  The main focus of discussion was on preparation for the meeting of the European Council which took place on 13-14 December and, in particular, on how to strengthen economic and monetary union.  President Van Rompuy presented his report at the ministerial lunch.  The ensuing debate, along with discussion at the December European Council, led to President Van Rompuy being asked to consult widely in order to bring forward a specific and time bound roadmap for strengthening EMU in June.  His deliberations will be focused on four particular questions that he has been asked to explore: <i>ex-ante<\/i> co-ordination of major economic reforms; the social dimension of EMU, including social dialogue; contracts between governments and EU institutions; and solidarity mechanisms.  <\/p><p>  The General Affairs Council also held a substantial discussion on enlargement, with conclusions providing a framework for the work that lies ahead, including during our Presidency.  They open up the possibility of important decisions on the western Balkans during our term.  This includes possible accession negotiations for Serbia and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the granting of candidate status to Albania and the opening of stabilisation and association negotiations with Kosovo.  While occupying the Presidency, Ireland will lead the Council's assessment on enlargement.  A delicate balance will need to be struck in this regard between allowing time for progress to be registered and reported, and for discussion and agreement so as to enable decisions to be taken at the June Council.  The timetable is ambitious but we work assiduously to secure progress on the accession paths of all the countries of the western Balkans.  On Croatia, we will oversee consideration of the Commission's final monitoring report, which I am confident will deem it ready for accession.  I look forward to welcoming Croatia as the 28th member state of the Union on 1 July.  We will also strive to make progress on Iceland, although we recognise that the decision on the Icelandic side to slow down negotiations ahead of the elections on 27 April will have an impact.  Nonetheless we would hope to open two chapters and close a further three during our term.  On Turkey, we hope to open at least one chapter, if that proves possible.  <\/p><p>  On other issues, no agreement was reached at the December Council on the proposed increase in the number of judges in the General Court of the European Court of Justice.  We are considering how this issue can be progressed during our Presidency.  As members of the committee will be aware, the kernel of this issue is how to ensure balanced representation of larger and smaller member states.  The Commission also made a presentation on the annual growth survey, which was a key input to the European semester process, and this will be considered further with the ultimate goal of agreeing guidance on the preparation of stability and convergence and national reform programmes at the March European Council.  At the meeting, I delivered two presentations on our Presidency objectives.  The first outlined our roadmap for the European semester 2013, setting out a practical response to the key recommendations from the Cypriot Presidency from the 2012 exercise.  Our objective will be to ensure that all relevant Council formations work in a co-ordinated and consistent manner towards a thorough preparation of the March and June European Councils.  Alongside colleagues from Lithuania and Greece I also introduced our joint trio programme for the next 18 months.  The trio concept seeks to promote longer term and more cohesive planning between groups of Presidencies.  I am pleased to report that the General Affairs Council endorsed our trio programme, which ties in directly with Ireland's national focus on promoting initiatives that deliver stability, jobs and growth.  Finally, I also took the opportunity at the meeting to express my appreciation of the Cypriot Presidency, which did an excellent job.<\/p><p>  The first item on the agenda for February's General Affairs Council is a reminder of the past work by Cyprus.<\/p> <p>As negotiations are being advanced on the framing of the Union&rsquo;s future budget, the legislative framework for this vital part of it is being prepared in parallel.<\/p><p> As with previous tr&aacute;nches of this work, we intend to seek agreement on a partial general approach for two additional blocks of the legislative package, subject to the proviso that \"nothing is agreed until everything is agreed\".  We cannot finalise the package until the MFF is agreed but we intend to make as much progress as possible.  The blocks to be presented on this occasion are \"Transitional and Final Provisions\" and \"European Groupings of Territorial Co-operation\".  It is possible that these may be agreed in the coming week at official level, in which case there would be no need for discussion by Ministers.<\/p><p> As this will be the first General Affairs Council of our Presidency, I will present our Presidency work programme.  I hope that all members will have had time to study the programme, which was published on 9 January and which sets out in detail the three priorities that underpin it: stability, jobs and growth.  Sustainable economic growth and employment creation require strong and stable foundations.  We will aim to take forward proposals for banking union with the urgency they deserve.  We will work for progress in deepening the Single Market and we will advance an ambitious agenda for trade.  We will aim for effective and efficient oversight of the European Semester process in order that it results in meaningful and concrete recommendations to member states on the reforms they need to undertake to prepare their economies for the challenges of the future.  We will work to secure the European Parliament&rsquo;s consent for any agreement on the MFF and we will put our shoulder to the wheel to take forward the extensive legislative programme that flows from it.  CAP, CFP, Horizon 2020 and cohesion all underpin growth and jobs across the Union.<\/p><p> Ireland will also push for a comprehensive approach to youth unemployment, starting with the youth employment package.  There will be a renewed emphasis on new opportunities - the digital Single Market and the digital agenda - to deliver benefits for EU business and consumers and to sharpen Europe&rsquo;s global competitiveness.  The Presidency will also advance the agenda on development, humanitarian issues, and the post-2015 Millennium Development Goals. <\/p><p> The main task for the General Affairs Council on 4 February will be to prepare the European Council meeting that will take place three days later at which President Van Rompuy has said he hopes to reach agreement on the MFF.  Following the further consultations he has had since the November summit, he feels a deal is within reach, and he informs us he will do his utmost to broker one.  While the atmosphere in November was constructive and progress was made then and since, it would be na&iuml;ve not to acknowledge that the task will be a difficult one.  Gaps may have narrowed but they, nonetheless, remain wide.  It will be important for all leaders to approach these discussions in a flexible manner, open to compromise, if agreement is to be achieved.  The Taoiseach and I have made it very clear to President Van Rompuy, including in our meeting with him during his visit to Dublin on 9 January, that we stand ready to be of whatever support to him that we can.  It is important that we reach an early agreement in order that we can all direct our energies to the work that needs to be done to secure economic recovery and growth.<\/p><p> While no formal discussion is planned for the GAC, it is likely to be discussed at the working lunch with President Van Rompuy at which he may set out his intentions regarding the handling of the negotiations at the European Council.  After a deal is reached by the European Council, it will fall to us, as holders of the Presidency, to seek the formal consent of the European Parliament for the MFF regulation and the accompanying agreement between the Council, Commission and Parliament.  We are conscious that the Parliament has strong views and cannot be taken for granted.  We have had intensive consultations to prepare the ground and these will intensify if a deal is done at the European Council.<\/p><p> The February European Council will also discuss the EU's external trade agenda.  President Van Rompuy shares our view that this has enormous potential as an engine for growth and jobs.  It is expected that the Commission will deliver a progress report on trade, growth and jobs to serve as a reference in the discussion.  This report has not yet been circulated and may not be available at the GAC.  In the meantime, I can affirm that advancing the EU's external trade agenda is a priority of the Irish Presidency.  Our aim is to prioritise bilateral trade agreements with key partners and we will, in particular, seek to make as much progress as possible towards an EU-US trade agreement during our Presidency.<\/p><p> The Council will also discuss the ongoing fallout from the Arab Spring.  Debate on Syria will be informed by the January Foreign Affairs Council, which is expected to cover the overall situation on the ground, EU sanctions, and recognition of the Syrian National Coalition.  It may also discuss the EU&rsquo;s overall strategy and support to countries of the region following the Arab Spring.<\/p><p> The GAC will also consider the annotated draft agenda for the European Council scheduled for 14-15 March.  The agenda is not available but discussion is expected to focus on the European Semester.<\/p><p> I appreciate the attention of the Committee and I look forward to hearing the committee's comments.  I will be happy to respond to your points or queries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013012400003#L00600","speaker":"951","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1359024000,"counter":649,"content":"<p>Before I ask others to contribute, I welcome the remarks made by the T&aacute;naiste.

We met Valentin Inzko who is the EU High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina in Sarajevo and he will attend the COSAC plenary session on enlargement to address us on the issues faced by the Balkans and Bosnia, in particular.<\/p><p>  The T&aacute;naiste also mentioned the other countries.  Has he thoughts on the issues related to Montenegro?  Earlier this week I met Aleksandar Andrija Pejovi\u0107 who is the chief negotiator on accession to the Union on behalf of Montenegro.  The Montenegrins are keen for liaison between national parliaments such as ours and their parliament to develop to ensure that as they move through the opening and closing of chapters, they get as much help as possible from countries such as Ireland.  Perhaps the T&aacute;naiste will take this on board.<\/p><p>  I welcome his comments on Turkey and the hope that we will open a chapter in this regard during our Presidency.  We have waited too long for the accession of Turkey and, therefore, I welcome the movement in that direction.<\/p><p>  I refer to the MFF and the development budget.

Has a date been considered for this potential referendum?<\/p><p>  With regard to the priorities for our Presidency, youth unemployment is high on the agenda and the T&aacute;naiste referred to the youth employment package.  One of the issues is whether members states will match their rhetoric on this issue with additional investment in direct or indirect supports aimed at getting young people back into work, training and education.  What discussions has he had with his European counterparts on the issue of additional investment in measures to target job creation for young people?<\/p><p> A banking union is also high on the agenda.  There have been mixed messages in recent weeks on the ongoing negotiations with the ECB on the promissory note and with our European partners on the use of the European Stability Mechanism, ESM, for the pillar banks.  Earlier, the chairman of the European affairs committee in Germany said he had concerns about the promissory note discussions and the ECB overstretching its mandate.  The T&aacute;naiste and the Taoiseach have been talking up the prospect of a deal whereas the Minister for Finance has been more circumspect and has highlighted the obstacles that need to be removed.  Media commentary suggests a deal is further away than speculated.  As part of the four presidents report last year, we are strongly urging the need for delivery on breaking the link between banks and sovereigns in the coming period.  What is the T&aacute;naiste's assessment of the state of play on both the promissory note negotiations and the legal bank debt issue?  What will be the consequences of a failure to secure a deal on one or both of these issues for our re-entry into sovereign bond markets?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013012400004#M00300","speaker":"1155"},{"type":"speech","time":1359024000,"counter":651,"content":"<p>I welcome the T&aacute;naiste and his officials and I wish him well in his role as president of the GAC over the coming months.<\/p> <p>Some of the issues have already been dealt with so I will stick to those that have not.

Arising from that it was made clear that unless the necessary provisions to provide for banking union were put in place, we would not progress to avail of the benefits of that.  What is the status of the banking union process?  When is it likely to conclude so that the obvious potential benefits might flow?<\/p><p> We have dealt with the MFF.  On CAP, the T&aacute;naiste rightly said that issues such banking union and Common Agricultural Policy will form part of an improvement in growth, jobs and stability, which are the key priorities of Ireland's Presidency.  I ask him do give more detail on the status of the CAP negotiations.  The speech by the British Prime Minister, Mr. David Cameron, MP, indicating that he intends to hold a referendum in a number of years creates considerable uncertainty around the whole European project.  While I do not expect the T&aacute;naiste to get into the affairs of another member state, given our dependence on trade with the UK I ask him to comment on the potential implications for Ireland during the hiatus between now and 2015, which will clearly bring a level of uncertainty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013012400004#M00400","speaker":"976","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1359024600,"counter":653,"content":"<p>The Chairman asked about enlargement.  This week there was an informal meeting of European affairs Ministers which was attended by the candidate countries.  The prospective candidate countries, Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Kosovo, had a meeting with the Presidency and the Commission.  That clearly demonstrates the role Ireland intends to play in engaging with not just candidate countries, but also with the other countries.  Bosnia and Herzegovina needs to do some work in order to meet the conditions that would enable it to apply for membership, including the alignment of its constitutional provisions with the rulings of the European Court of Human Rights.  I am hopeful that there will be progress in these areas.<\/p><p>  The Chairman asked specifically about Montenegro.  We must recognise that negotiations are at an early stage and therefore it is important for us to be modest in our ambitions.  We hope to open one or two negotiation chapters with Montenegro.  I commend the Cypriot Presidency on opening the first negotiation chapter in December.  The country has some work to do on rule of law and anti-corruption issues.  Consideration of Montenegro's progress on these issues will take place during our Presidency.<\/p><p>  The Chairman asked about the state of negotiations on the MFF and the development budget.  Yesterday I met Mr. Bill Gates of the Bill &amp;amp; Melinda Gates Foundation.  We co-operate with that foundation in respect of our development work.  It does tremendous work in many dimensions.  The European Union is, of course, the biggest contributor to development aid with more than 55% in total so understandably he was interested in the state of negotiations on the MFF and was obviously conscious of Ireland's Presidency role in those negotiations.  I gave him an assessment of that.  As members of the committee know, agreement was not concluded in November.  President Van Rompuy has had negotiations with Heads of State and Government in the intervening time.  He hopes to be in a position to present new proposals to the European Council meeting in February.  The original proposals on development on heading 4 from the Commission provided for a very substantial increase in the budget.  The proposals from President Van Rompuy still represent an increase in the budget of approximately 8%.  There will also be a separate European development fund and a separate budget for emergency humanitarian aid.  Clearly we will need to await further proposals because the pressure from some member states has been downward on the budget proposals.  Ireland has a very strong and proud record in development aid and strongly supports the role of the European Union in aid programmes in countries that need them.<\/p><p>  Senator Reilly asked about the unified patent court.  We will sign the agreement probably in February along with other member states.  It is likely to require a referendum.  We have not yet made any decision on when this might take place.  We will address that matter once the agreement has been signed.<\/p><p>  The Senator asked specifically about youth unemployment.  We have made the theme of our Presidency stability, jobs and growth, which is clearly aligned with our national priority.  The level of youth unemployment in Europe is unacceptably high.  In this country approximately one out of four young people between the ages of 16 and 25 who are in the labour market are unable to get a job.  The figure is more than 30% across the European Union and higher than 50% in some member states.  It is urgent that the European Union and member states address the issue of youth unemployment and provide employment opportunities.  Some of those employment opportunities may not be standard and may be new.  Individual states and the European Union as a whole will need to think outside the box about how we address the issue of youth unemployment in the short term.<\/p><p>  We need to come at it in a number of ways.  There are the measures we are taking to generate economic growth and employment in Europe generally.  That means, for example, completion of the Single Market measures - we have a long list of legislative measures we need to put through the European Parliament.  There is the issue of the digital Single Market, which has a direct relevance particularly to young people and the potential for the creation of employment.  We want to see the trade discussions advanced.  There is potential for the GDP of the European economy to grow by approximately 2% if we were able to conclude those trade agreements.<\/p><p>  That said, other specific measures need to be introduced to address youth unemployment.  The European Commission produced the youth employment package in December.  That included proposals for a Council recommendation on a youth guarantee.  The aim there is to ensure that young people who are not working or studying receive an offer of employment, continued education, or an apprenticeship or traineeship which will equip them for employment.  Our Presidency intends to make significant progress on this proposal with a view to adopting a Council recommendation at the February EPSCO Council meeting.  Youth unemployment will also be the main focus of the informal meeting of employment and social affairs Ministers which will take place in Dublin in February.<\/p> <p> With regard to the issue of banking union and the bank debt, which was raised by Senator Reilly and Deputy Dooley, there are a number of dimensions.  First there is the decision made in June, which was a game changer and involved the critical decision about the separation of bank debt and sovereign debt and the road map established to do that.  At the time, some thought this would not be followed through but it has been followed through and was reaffirmed at the October Council meeting.  Firm decisions were made in December about the timetable for putting in place the single supervisory mechanism which is the instrument required for the ESM to be in a position to recapitalise banks directly.  Work is proceeding with the European Parliament on the legislation for the single supervisory mechanism.  There are two separate elements of it - guaranteeing deposits and bank resolution.  Again, work is progressing in bringing forward proposals in respect of those issues.  The objective is that the single supervisory mechanism will be in place by early 2014 and we are on target to do that.<\/p><p> There are two separate issues.  They include the agreement concluded this week on the lengthening of the maturities of the money available to us under the EFSF and the EFSM mechanisms, which is very good news for Ireland.  Again, that has a very positive benefit for Ireland.  The technical work on that will proceed at official level.  The objective is to have that concluded by the end of March.  Separate to all of that are the discussions we are having with the ECB in respect of the promissory note.  Again, we must remember where the promissory note came from.  It is a consequence of the decision to provide a blanket guarantee for the banks back in 2008, the subsequent nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank, the establishment of the IBRC and the agreement by the last Government to commit paying &euro;3.1 billion of taxpayers' money each year to what is in effect a dead bank.  We did not make that payment that last year but found a way of exchanging it for a long-term bond.  We committed to having negotiations with the ECB to find a resolution and conclusion to the promissory note issue by the end of March 2013.  Those discussions are at a critical stage.  The end of March is not too far away and we are very conscious of the time limitations on us for a conclusion of those discussions.  I am optimistic we will have a satisfactory outcome to them.<\/p><p> In respect of entry to the bond markets, members will have seen that we have had a very good re-entry into these markets.  Members will have seen the successful sale of Irish paper in the first week of January at an interest rate below that of the bailout funding.  Last week saw the sale of about &euro;0.5 billion short-term bonds at a very low interest rate.  When one contrasts that with where we were two years ago and even a year ago when many people argued that we would not be able to get back into the markets again and would need a second bailout, one can see we have made significant progress.  In order for that progress and momentum to continue, we need the issue of the promissory note to be dealt with very soon.  <\/p><p> Deputy Dooley also asked about the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy.  Those negotiations are progressing.  Given our Presidency, we have a firm ambition to conclude them by the end of June 2013.  Of course, they cannot be finalised as far as figures are concerned until there is an multi-annual financial framework, MFF, agreed.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine has been making great progress on that work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013012400005#N00200","speaker":"951","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1359025200,"counter":655,"content":"<p>Could I-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013012400006#O00200","speaker":"976"},{"type":"speech","time":1359025200,"counter":656,"content":"<p>We will come back to it later.

In particular, we should acknowledge the progress made by the Government on the confidence that has been restored to the extent that we were able to re-enter the international bond markets in a confident fashion in the past few weeks.  I am not just saying this because the T&aacute;naiste is here.  This augurs well for the future and certainly recognises the tremendous effort made by a series of Ministers, the T&aacute;naiste and the Taoiseach in their various capacities and we should recognise that.<\/p><p>  The T&aacute;naiste's point about confidence resulting in growth, stability and youth employment is well made.  The emphasis on youth employment is particularly important at this time from the point of each member state and the EU as an entity.  We must support and pursue vigorously the objectives set out by the T&aacute;naiste and the EU.  <\/p><p>  I strongly support the greater emphasis on enlargement which has come about for a variety of reasons, particularly in the western Balkans and the need to include all possible applicant countries so as to ensure that nobody feels they are left out or that a longer term approach to achieving their objectives is being applied to them.  From the point of view of an applicant state, it is most important that it is recognises that if it follows the <i>acquis communautaire<\/i> and the EU guidelines on human rights and the need to observe strictly the regime on human rights, it expects its efforts will receive recognition.  <\/p><p>  My last point concerns the UK, around which much discussion will take place and which will probably be the subject matter for discussion in the meeting next week.  I suggest this could be a positive thing in a peculiar way.  We have all carefully read Mr. Cameron's speech.  He seemed to suggest that the EU should focus on certain aspects of its structures.  He did not seem to close the door indefinitely.  It presents an ideal opportunity for all member states to identify the extent to which Euroscepticism has eroded the European vision over the past number of years.  It presents a unique opportunity to address that issue in a very clear and positive way which will be beneficial for the UK and the other member states.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013012400006#O00400","speaker":"957"},{"type":"speech","time":1359025200,"counter":658,"content":"<p>The T&aacute;naiste is more than welcome to the meeting.

It is interesting to look at the Serbs and at what is happening in Kosovo.  Hopefully things will evolve progressively in that region.  I am particularly interested in Albania, which was one of the most closed societies in the world formerly, second to North Korea.  It has now progressed to the stage where it can take part in the accession process.  We will monitor through the OSCE this year's elections in Albania to ensure that they meet the criteria laid down.  My one worry is Bosnia and Herzegovina.  There remains a protracted difficulty in that region.  It is very sad that they have not moved at the pace of their neighbours.  I wish the T&aacute;naiste well in working on that.<\/p><p> I congratulate the T&aacute;naiste for noting the most important issues of stability, jobs and growth in the European Union.  The youth employment package is of tremendous importance.  It is of perhaps greater importance to partners of ours in Europe.  We have a highly educated workforce with 80% of citizens obtaining a third level education, which gives them superior job prospects to those of people in Spain, which has perhaps 50% youth unemployment.  Sovereignty and how we handle debt and promissory notes are important.  The T&aacute;naiste covered that.<\/p><p> Stability was the first issue the T&aacute;naiste mentioned.  I presume he meant the stability of Europe.  I am amazed and shocked at the damage to his own case Prime Minister David Cameron has done regarding his proposals for a referendum.  Perhaps the Department of Foreign Affairs will have time to examine the ramifications for Ireland as a divided, partitioned country.  The Northern counties are in the sterling area but we are happily in the European Union together.

It is time to remind all member states of the primary principle of closer union which underpinned the establishment of the EU.  Every member state knew that when it joined, including Great Britain.  It is funny that there should now be some emotional or mental doubt about the closer union they knew would be committed to when they joined.<\/p><p>  I am delighted to hear that progress is being made by applicant and accession countries.  The creation of the EU represents the best, largest and most wonderful achievement of mankind in modern times.  There has been no war since 1945 other than those taking place outside the territory of the EU.  The heart and soul of the EU project is that it is a community.  This represents the fundamental cornerstone politically and philosophically of our Presidency.<\/p><p>  However, there are also the nuts and bolts finance issues to consider.  The facts show that there is a remission in the parlous state of the world financial system and eurozone.  Bank balance sheets remain hugely buckled and doubtful.  Provisioning is understated.  The fact that Basel III has been pushed out to 2019 is an expression of the doubt that exists.  The off-balance sheet liabilities of institutions are huge.  Deutsche Bank has a &euro;2.2 trillion balance sheet.  These nettles must be grasped courageously and firmly.  It must be asked if the financial markets system has failed when 26 million people are unemployed in the EU, which is unacceptable.  In the United States of America, the unemployment rate hovers around 9%, which is also unacceptable.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the gap with the incomes of the few who control the greater percentage of wealth is widening.  We must go back to the drawing board and address the basics with radical and courageous thought.<\/p><p>  That is the general picture, but I turn to the particular case of Ireland where at least &euro;65 billion in private banking system losses have been channelled via financial engineering to become the sovereign debt of the State.  It is unsustainable by any measure when added to the huge national levels of household and private commercial debt.  We were told 18 months ago that technical papers were being drawn up which is why I do not buy statements to the committee to the same effect now.  There is recognition in principle that it is an odious debt which remains locked into our banking system comprising the dead banks in the IBRC and the survivor - I would not call them pillar - banks.  The system is unable to deal with the enlarging mortgage crisis.  As the Governor of the Central Bank admitted last week, the mortgage crisis is interlocked with the capital resources of the banks.  As we now see, they will have to start writing down and recalibrating mortgage and business loans, which will require more capital.  That capital should come from------<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013012400007#P00300","speaker":"1027"},{"type":"speech","time":1359025800,"counter":662,"content":"<p>The Deputy must conclude.

Individual countries know what they have to do.  We will encourage them in that direction.<\/p><p>  Deputy Bernard Durkan, Deputy Eric Byrne, Deputy Se&aacute;n Kyne and Deputy Timmy Dooley raised the UK issue.  I have read Prime Minister David Cameron's speech.  The first thing to be said is that it was framed in terms of keeping the United Kingdom in the European Union.<\/p> <p>He has set out a timeframe through the next general election in Britain and on to what he proposes as an in-out referendum sometime in the life of the next Parliament.  That is a matter for the United Kingdom and the British people to discuss and debate and to arrive at a conclusion about what their relationship should be with the European Union.  It raises significant strategic issues for us which revolve around our relationship with the Union.  It is important that there should be no doubt that irrespective of whatever debate takes place in the United Kingdom this country's relationship with the Union remains unchanged.  We see our place as part and parcel of the European Union and at its heart.  We have a unique, strong, neighbourly, friendly and very important economic relationship with the United Kingdom.  That relationship will also stay intact.  Irrespective of what happens in this debate, as far as Ireland is concerned we remain at the heart of Europe and close to the United Kingdom and we will work on that basis.<\/p><p> In respect of the European Union-US trade agreement raised by Deputy Kyne, a high-level group will present its report shortly.  We are anxious to progress this.  We need a mandate for the negotiation of the trade agreement.  Let us not be under any illusion that this will not be difficult.  When one gets down to the nuts and bolts of negotiating a trade agreement with any country huge issues arise across a range of industries and interests and so on that must be addressed but we have to get off the starting blocks.  If a mandate is not given and the issue is not progressed before St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day we will use the opportunity presented on that occasion when the Taoiseach will meet President Obama and I hope to meet the Secretary of State, John Kerry, to progress the issue.<\/p><p> In response to Deputy Mathews, it is important that we appreciate how far we have come.  Two years ago this country was teetering on the edge of an economic abyss.  We were about to go over the edge.  People were talking in terms of the State not being able to pay its way.  Nobody would lend to us and we need to borrow to keep our essential services such as schools and hospitals going, to make social welfare payments and pay pensions.

From March 2010 to August 2011 the NTMA&rsquo;s remit included certain banking system functions of the Minister for Finance.  The delegation of banking system functions to the NTMA ceased with effect from August 2011 and the NTMA banking team was seconded to the Department of Finance.  As a result, the NTMA no longer has any statutory responsibilities in the banking area.  The ongoing restructuring of the banking sector remains a crucial factor in driving down yields on our bonds and regaining full market access.<\/p><p>  We have made considerable progress in our re-engagement with the markets since my last appearance before the committee in September 2011.  The NTMA&rsquo;s working plan has been to return to the markets on a phased basis, both through shorter-term issuance and by taking advantage of opportunities to issue long-term debt when they arise.  During 2012 and earlier this month we conducted a number of successful long-term debt market operations as well as making a return to a regular schedule of short-term treasury bill auctions.<\/p> <p>In 2012 the NTMA's engagement with the debt markets included bond switches, the amount was &euro;4.5 billion; the issuing of conventional bonds, the amount was &euro;4.2 billion; and the issuing of a completely new instrument, Irish amortising bonds tailored to meet the needs of the domestic pensions industry and the amount was &euro;1 billion.  Earlier this month we raised &euro;2.5 billion from the sale of five-year bonds at a yield of 3.32%.  It was encouraging to see more than 200 institutional investors - including fund managers, pension funds, bank treasuries and insurance companies - placed orders totalling more than &euro;7 billion, almost three times the amount sold with strong demand from the UK, mainland Europe and the US.<\/p><p> The combined effect of these debt market operations has been to eliminate the challenging funding cliff presented by a<i><\/i>bond repayment of almost &euro;12 billion due in mid-January 2014, a priority for the NTMA.  This substantial redemption coming so soon after the end of the EU-IMF programme was seen by investors as a major obstacle to our smooth exit from the programme.  The gradual sourcing of funding in the market to meet that January 2014 repayment has been viewed positively by the investment community and has been a contributory factor to the continued fall in Irish bond yields.<\/p><p> Our 2012 funding included the introduction of a completely new debt instrument, Irish amortising bonds tailored to meet the needs of the domestic pension industry.  Unlike standard bonds, where the annual interest payment is followed by the repayment of principal at maturity, the new amortising bonds will pay an equal amount each year over their lifetime.  This reflects the preference of pension schemes and annuity providers for a steady stream of income.<\/p><p> The NTMA's objective is to diversify its investor base and part of that includes the provision of products that meet the needs of domestic investors.  An active and stable domestic investor base is not only important in its own right, but is also an important signal of confidence to overseas investors considering investment in Irish bonds.<\/p><p> I would like to comment briefly on our treasury bill programme which we recommenced last July when we issued &euro;500 million of three-month bills at an annual equivalent yield of 1.8%.  Last week we held our fifth such auction, again &euro;500 million of three-month bills but at an annual equivalent yield of 0.2%.  We believe that with the success of the auctions we have regained normal market access at this short end of the curve.  <\/p><p> Ireland has seen a significant decline in bond yields through 2012, most markedly in the shorter maturities, restoring the yield curve to a more normal upward slope compared to the inversion that marked much of 2011.  For example, the yield on the 2014 bond has declined from 7.58% at the end of 2011 to 1.05% currently, while the yield on the October 2020 has declined from 8.26% at the end of 2011 to 4.11% currently.<\/p><p> The rally in Irish bond yields has been driven by a number of factors including: Ireland's consistent delivery on its EU-IMF programme commitments; the progressive elimination of the bond refinancing requirement in mid-January 2014; the EU leaders' supportive reference to Ireland in their statement of 29 June 2012 on the necessity to break the link between sovereign and banking debt; and the outright monetary transactions, so-called OMT, policy initiative by the European Central Bank.<\/p><p> In absolute terms the yields on our bonds are at low levels but the spreads against Germany remain high - currently 2.98% for the October 2020 bond.  Some of this, of course, reflects differences in credit rating, Ireland being a BBB credit whereas Germany has a AAA rating, but another factor is that extremely low German yields are driven by Germany's status as a safe haven investment.<\/p><p> Following Ireland's entry into the EU-IMF programme at the end of 2010, our credibility among institutional investors had greatly diminished.  Uncertainty remained throughout the first quarter of 2011, as investors awaited the results of Ireland's severe stress test and restructuring plan for the pillar banks.  Following the publication of the PCAR results, the NTMA began the process of re-engaging with investors to rebuild damaged relationships, develop new ones and ultimately pave the way for eventual return to bond issuance.<\/p><p> This involved a structured programme of face-to-face meetings putting the investment case for Ireland to investors in Europe, the US, the Middle East, Asia and to the domestic market.  These presentations are based on three simple principles: tell investors the facts, do not over-promise and return regularly with a progress update.  It is a slow and deliberate process but one which I believe has already paid dividends and is being reflected through the rebuilding of Ireland's international reputation and, critically, investor buying of new debt issuance and falling yields on our bonds. <\/p><p> The following are seen as key issues from the perspective of investors and potential investors in Irish Government bonds: Ireland's ability and willingness to continue to meet the fiscal consolidation targets and the quarterly undertaking set out in the EU-IMF programme; Ireland continuing to achieve economic growth in spite of the ongoing requirement for fiscal consolidation; the risk of further recapitalisation requirements for the banks; continued progress in reducing contingent liabilities, of which NAMA's programme of asset disposals is the most important element; the regaining of trade competitiveness, highlighted by the return of large surpluses on the current account of the balance of international payments; improvement in Ireland's sovereign credit ratings; and the eventual resolution of the wider eurozone sovereign debt and banking crisis.<\/p><p> There have been a number of positive developments in these areas over the past year.  Investors see the economy stabilising and are giving Ireland credit for being well ahead of other troubled European countries in implementing its adjustment process.  Of course it is likely that much of this good news is priced into Ireland's reduced bond yields.  In particular, the market has priced in, to a greater or lesser extent, relief on the promissory notes and other bank related debt.  Indeed, notwithstanding all the steps that Ireland has taken and continues to take to address its domestic issues, wider eurozone uncertainty remains a risk to achieving sustainable market re-entry.<\/p><p> Ireland retains investment grade status with Standard &amp;amp; Poor's and Fitch, which have both set a rating of BBB+, which is three notches above sub-investment grade.  Moody's downgraded Ireland to sub-investment grade in July 2011, which was the last downgrade by any of the major ratings agencies.  As Ireland's average rating across the three main agencies is still investment grade, Irish Government bonds remain in the main bond indices.<\/p><p> In early 2012, each of the three main ratings agencies downgraded a number of eurozone countries in response to the sovereign debt and banking crisis.  Ireland avoided a downgrade during that round of rating actions and has maintained its current rating, thanks to progress made in restoring our creditworthiness.  Indeed the announcement by Fitch ratings last November that it was revising Ireland's outlook from negative to stable was the first positive action by a ratings agency on Ireland since the start of the financial crisis.<\/p><p> On a very general level, I note the ratings agencies are satisfied with the progress made by Ireland as reflected in the quarterly positive reports from the troika but the scope for ratings upgrades is constrained by the agencies' concerns about global economic growth on which Ireland is seen as dependent, the wider eurozone issues and the need to make progress towards a banking union in order to secure a delinking of sovereign from banks.  It is instructive to note that NAMA is not a headline issue for the ratings agencies.<\/p><p> The reason that our sovereign ratings are so important, apart from somewhat limiting the market for the buyers of Ireland's sovereign debt, is the fact they represent a ceiling for the ratings of other Irish entities and are a key driver of the funding costs of the banking sector.<\/p><p> As I noted to the committee in 2011, in order to stabilise our debt to GDP ratio, Ireland needs to get back to running a primary budget surplus, that is the budget balance, excluding interest payments, as soon as possible.  In the context of debt sustainability, this metric is far more important than the absolute level of debt <i>per se<\/i>. <i><\/i>I note that the projections published by the Department of Finance in budget 2013 are for the general Government debt to GDP ratio to peak at around 120% of GDP in 2013 and to start to decline thereafter when the Government will once again be running primary budget surpluses.<\/p><p> The NTMA's focus in 2013 will be on stepping up its re-engagement with the markets so that Ireland is positioned to successfully exit the EU-IMF programme.  To achieve this the NTMA plans to raise in the region of &euro;10 billion during the year, subject to market conditions.  With the &euro;2.5 billion issue earlier this month, we are already a quarter of the way towards achieving this target.  Raising the &euro;10 billion this year, will give the NTMA and the investors the comfort of having a full year's advance funding in place.  Such funding visibility is vital if Ireland is to successfully exit the programme at the end of the year.<\/p> <p> Continuing access to the markets remains critically dependent on a number of external factors, particularly developments at a wider eurozone level.  We are in something of an investment \"sweet spot\" in which we are benefiting not only from more positive sentiment towards Ireland, an issue to which I alluded, but also from greater risk appetite among investors generally.  While I am encouraged by the positive start to the year, it would be unwise to be complacent.  Markets do not necessarily move in a straight line and investor sentiment can be fickle.  We are likely to proceed with a syndicated issue of a longer term bond prior to resuming regular scheduled bond auctions, although we will remain adaptable in the light of circumstances. <\/p><p> Before concluding, I will briefly address the National Pensions Reserve Fund and the work being done in refocusing its investments towards commercial investment in Ireland.  As members may be aware, earlier this month the NPRF announced investment commitments to three new long-term funds that will provide &euro;850 million of equity, credit and restructuring-recovery investment for Irish small and medium-sized businesses and mid-sized corporates.  The NPRF played a significant role in the development of the funds and will be a cornerstone investor in each, alongside additional investment from third party investors.  I have circulated for the information of members the press release issued by the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission announcing these investments.  I look forward to members' questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013012400003#C00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Corrigan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1359037500,"counter":711,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Corrigan.

One of the proposals for Irish Water is that a free allowance will be issued to households and then people will be charged for water after that allowance is used.  In terms of setting up a non-profit company, one provides households with water, charges them per litre and operates a cost model which ensures the lowest cost to the customer.  However, if the company is issuing a free allowance of 100 litres per week, or per day, for example, that could cause a difficulty.  I will use the example of going to a pub to illustrate my point.  Let us say we decide to go for a drink after this meeting and I tell you that I know of a pub where every second pint is free, but we have to pay &euro;10 each for the first one.  In the same way, if Irish Water provides a free allowance of 100 litres, it may have to charge a high price for every litre after that.

Those who run the banks have decided to cherry-pick staff from the NTMA and offer them jobs with their own organisations.  The staff in question are officials from the Department of Finance who were seconded to the NTMA and who are in possession of all the relevant information relating to deleveraging.

As we are acutely conscious of the financial difficulties facing the State, particularly given our role in the frontline of selling debt to pay bills and meet debt redemptions, there has not been a general pay increase in the NTMA since 2009.  The bonuses to which the Deputy referred are incentive payments made earlier this year in respect of 2011.

That is the way I see it but it is not just me.  The European Union Commission stated that if growth does not materialise and unemployment continues to stay high our debt is likely to be unsustainable.

I wonder about the nature of this relationship.  Who is advising who what to do and how to manage this situation?  In terms of the various companies the NTMA has enlisted to run the small and medium enterprise, SME, funds, I know that previously it took advice from the Rothschild Group.

These are global asset managers.  Are they advising the NTMA?  Is that they circle in which NAMA moves?  Obviously, those people would have the view that it would be unthinkable that we would repudiate the debt because they take the hit but our responsibility is to the citizens of this country.

The bond markets express  delight and buy Irish bonds because they know Ireland will do anything to give them back their money and make them a profit regardless of the cost to the Irish citizenry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013012400013#N00900","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1359042300,"counter":891,"content":"<p>To answer the Deputy's question on the relationship between the NTMA and the Government, the NTMA is an agent of the Minister for Finance.

Across the board in financial markets there is a race to the bottom regarding bond yields.  The VIX index, with which the delegation will be familiar, exhibited a fortnight ago the least risky presentation since 1991.  CNN's Fear &amp;amp; Greed Index was at the highest level.  Therefore, the markets are piling in to reduce yields wherever there is cash.  That is the truth on how our bonds were issued at such prices.  We need to be honest about this.  If we are not, we will let ourselves down in the negotiations which are running out of time and road as we approach 31 March.<\/p><p>  I agree with Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett on the promissory note, a contrived financial instrument to validate the loans to our banks by the Central Bank of Ireland and the European Central Bank under exceptional liquidity assistance guidelines.  These could not and would not have been advanced had the Government not been strong-armed into creating the promissory note.  That is another point the public does not understand.  The public believes the promissory note is a liability.  It is not; it is a financial asset that becomes a liability as it is turned into cash to redeem exceptional liquidity assistance to the IBRC.  The European Central Bank has lent money to the survivor banks.  This is tantamount to capital in so far as it is plugging all the funding requirements of the banks.  The return that should be received is not being received because the money is at a low cost base.  The banks asset and profit generation capabilities are in bits because of the rotten loans they are still trying to collect.<\/p><p>  The mortgage problem which is now beginning to be acknowledged must be borne in mind.  The Governor, Mr. Honohan, stated some days ago that there were all sorts of interrelationships to be considered.  The banks have a difficulty in dealing with household and SME loans, the legacy loans, from the bursting of the bubble.  They are incapable of being repaid by the borrowers.  The banks, therefore, will need more capital.  The severe stress tests were not nearly severe enough.  It is like attending to the boil after it has burst and must be cleaned up.  The problem will need to be addressed in one year if we do not state emphatically to our colleagues in Europe that the scale is bigger than it was.  They will not like hearing this because they believe they are actually carrying the load.  They are not; they are lending to us.  There are no free gifts.  They are giving us loans that they should not have been lending.  As in the case of Iceland, the investors should have taken a bath.  If this had occurred, we would be back to recovery, with a primary deficit that would actually be very manageable.<\/p> <p>As for the bridging of the gap between Government revenues and expenses, even though it was big and had a wow factor - with a lot of belt tightening, which has been done - it is manageable.  The problem is the legacy financial architecture that will kill this country in the next ten years and that is not right.  I am prepared to stand up anywhere in Europe, in any language they like - I will learn a language - to tell them this is the case.  Ireland holds the Presidency of the European Union.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013012400014#O02200","speaker":"1027","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1359043500,"counter":919,"content":"<p>Please, Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013012400015#P00200","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speech","time":1359043500,"counter":920,"content":"<p>No, please.

In fact, the more we show that we are managing the primary deficit and the correction of expenditure and the collection of revenues, the more it is not a problem.  In that situation, however, a complacency can set in about the origin and provenance of the odious debt from the bank-related issues and it becomes easy to lull us into a sense that it can be done over ten or 15 years.  In principle, it is wrong.  It is not our debt.  It should have been mutualised.  It will be mutualised in the future and the ESM and all of these mechanisms are being set up to deal with these matters.  It would be a very unfair situation if, for instance, Deutsche Bank decides to recognise &euro;250 billion worth of provisions in a year's or 18 months' time and it gets the benefit of an ESM intervention and we do not, at the same time, clean up the entire household across Europe and mutualise and perpetualise it at a cheap rate?

The NTMA should not be afraid and should come out from under its shell and do battle for us.<\/p><p>  On Bank of Ireland, the three senior staff who were lost from the NTMA-Department of Finance arrangement all went to either Bank of Ireland or to other non-nationalised banks.

Also, on Bank of Ireland, I texted the Taoiseach before 31 July 2011, the capitalisation date for the banks, not to use the National Pensions Reserve Fund, carefully built up over the years, to capitalise it, and to insist at that point on creditor capitalisation for the reasons already stated.  I said it should not be used the fund as it is the pension reserve fund for the State and we should not be strong-armed into raiding it.

It is great to be back and I appreciate the opportunity to present on this very challenging subject.<\/p><p>  I want to give members some idea of the damage being done to the Northern Ireland economy as a result of the ongoing flag protests and of our plans to address the problem.  By way of background information, my organisation represents more than 1,400 members in every village, town and city in Northern Ireland.  Our members include independent retailers of all kinds, wholesalers, the suppliers sector and a number of affiliated chambers of commerce.  Over the years we have built excellent relationships.  RGDATA and Retail Excellence Ireland and Retail Excellence Ireland and ourselves have been keen of late to work with InterTradeIreland to examine how we can develop the potential of the retail sector as a whole on this island.  We are in the early stages of establishing a joint North-South retail forum to address the many challenges facing the sector and, more importantly, how we can create the next generation of retail entrepreneurs on the island, how we can create 21st century town and city centres on the island and how we can develop the island of Ireland as a major retail destination.  The island of Ireland is known for its world-class food.  Another idea is could we develop this island as a word-class retail destination in the years to come.  Those are some of the ideas we have been developing and I would be happy to touch on those at a later stage.  I thought it would be useful for the committee to note where we are in the early stages of this process.  <\/p><p>  In 2012 the retail sector trade in the UK and on the island of Ireland was one of the worst since records began.  In the 2011-12 period, nearly 2,000 shops and smaller chain stores closed their doors in Northern Ireland and, sadly, Northern Ireland achieved the status of having the worst shop vacancy rate in the UK - it is twice the national average.  One in four shops in Belfast is vacant and across the North one in five is vacant.  <\/p><p>  We have put forward our ideas in a 50-point plan, which I would be happy to share at some point, on how we can turn the situation around in our retail sector and in our town and city centres.  I want to set that out to give the context of where we are at.  Many traders thought that Christmas 2012 would be their harvest time given that 2012 was such a bad year.  They had hoped that it would be a very productive Christmas but, sadly for many, that was not the case when the flag protests and rioting began.  <\/p><p>  The impact of the flag protests has brought the commercial heart of Belfast to its knees and severely impacted on the wider Northern Ireland economy.  In recent weeks retailers and traders have been struggling to get people through their doors.  As a result, many businesses in Belfast have been forced to let staff go and as the situation is showing no signs of improving more job losses are expected in the coming weeks.<\/p><p>  A closer analysis of the trade figures at Christmas show that trade in Belfast was to some degree displaced to other town and city centres in the North and to Dublin and there was also a big increase in online and out-of-town trade.  Many shoppers in Belfast were put off coming into the city centre on Saturdays because of the regular protest which takes place every Saturday which effectively gridlocks the main part of Belfast city centre.  I want to be clear  on this.  It is not for my organisation to comment on the politics of  flying the Union flag or on how Belfast City Council votes, what is crucial for us to do is to comment on the damage being done to Belfast and a number of other towns in the North.<\/p><p>  With regard to some of the wider issues in terms of cost, our colleagues in the CBI estimate the loss to our economy to be around &pound;15 million.  I would say that is now a very conservative figure.  The cost of policing the protest was recently put at &pound;7 million and, again, I would say the figure is likely to be much more than that.  <\/p><p>  Our colleagues in the Pubs of Ulster who represent the licensed trade in Northern Ireland reveal that pubs, restaurants and hotels are suffering severely as a result of the protests with people not going out and visitors opting to avoid towns and cities.  As a result trade has dropped by an average of 30% and in some cases by as much as 55% during recent weeks.  In real terms the hospitality industry is suffering a dramatic drop in turnover with one publican alone reporting a loss of &pound;95,000 before Christmas and &pound;60,000 after the Christmas period and with another publican reporting that trade fell by 54% in one week alone.  There is grave concern that the situation is showing no signs of improving.  <\/p><p>  However, what is very hard to put a real figure on is the damage done to Northern Ireland's international reputation at a time where we are seeking to attract more tourists and foreign direct investment.  I have lost count of the number of international media, from al-Jazeera to CNN,  who have reported the violence, all sending highly damaging images of violence and rioting right across the world.  We want to be very clear on this.  We believe that the protests, the violence and illegal blocking of roads should end immediately.  This is a political problem and can only be resolved by politics.  We would urge all the political to go the extra mile to resolve the flag issue and other grievances and, above all, let us take this problem off the streets.  The bottom line in all of this is that political stability and greater progress on the shared future agenda is essential for sustained economic development.  Divided societies are bad for business.  <\/p><p>  I am sure that the Chairman and his colleagues saw the television pictures of the riots  in east Belfast on the Newtownards Road and the Albertbridge Road and I know that they are meeting some community representatives from Short Strand today.  I was born and bred just off the Newtownards road and I still live in east Belfast.  That area faces huge challenges in terms of educational underachievement and the people there are crying out for new jobs and private sector investment but the reality is that will not happen while ongoing rioting and violence continue in those areas.  Many of our members and local traders in those areas are on their knees, their businesses will not last very much longer, and that will add to the unemployment figures in that area.  <\/p><p>  However, the Pubs of Ulster and the Belfast Chamber of Commerce and ourselves have joined together to bring solutions to Ministers in the Executive on how to address the problems facing our hospitality and retail sector in Belfast.  On Tuesday we met six Executive Ministers from all the parties to outline the need for an immediate funding of a marketing campaign to promote the city centre and to encourage the citizens of Belfast to exercise their civic responsibility and to support our retailers, pubs and restaurants, particularly over the next two weekends which, effectively, are the pay day weekends.  This campaign will be called \"Backin' Belfast\".  I have given the clerk a copy of our strategy document, and members may have a copy of it in from of them, which we submitted to the Executive Minsters on how we consider this can be funded.  One of the core themes of it is what are the immediate challenges we need to face because doing nothing is not an option.<\/p> <p> The second phase of the campaign must aim to try to repair the international damage done to Northern Ireland's reputation.  As Belfast is the centre of the regional economy in Northern Ireland, it is vital that our efforts are focused there first.  If it suffers; all of Northern Ireland will suffer.  We hope that by protecting the future of trade in Belfast we are limiting the damage caused to local businesses right across Northern Ireland, ensuring the sustainability of the local economy as a whole.<\/p><p> We have been greatly encouraged by the level of support we have received from all five parties and welcome the continuing discussions focused on providing immediate support for the business community in Belfast.  Without doubt, each Minister we have met has stepped up to the plate and vowed to look at ways to help traders and retailers through this difficult time.  We have made significant progress and are looking at a number of options, including a commitment to conduct an immediate marketing campaign and help the businesses worst affected.<\/p><p> There was some discussion about rate relief.  We are clear that in the short term that is probably not going to happen.  There is no point in giving &pound;1,000 in rate relief to businesses that are losing thousands of pounds every week.  What we need are people &ndash; footfall &ndash; in the city centre, customers in the shops, pubs and restaurants.  That is what we hope the marketing campaign will do.  This weekend, in particular, there will be great use of social media.  There is a Take Back our City campaign and another called Backing Belfast.  It will all be trending on Twitter and Facebook and there will be a lot of advertising and offers.  I encourage the Chairman and members to visit if they have nothing better to do in the next couple of weekends as they will definitely find a bargain and have a good time in Belfast city centre.  I am well aware of the MPs for West Tyrone and Fermanagh-South Tyrone.  There are fantastic opportunities in Enniskillen, Omagh and Strabane.  I thought I would get in the plug.<\/p><p> I also hope to brief the leaders of Fianna F&aacute;il and Sinn F&eacute;in while I am in Dublin, as well as representatives of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  If there is one message I want to get across to the committee, it is that I am optimistic that we can move forward.  Instead of dwelling on the problem, we must focus on the solutions.  We realise that all the marketing in the world will not amount to much unless we have the issues resolved and the protests come to an end.  Doing nothing is not an option.  Northern Ireland has so much potential in the coming year, with Derry being the City of Culture, the G8 summit and the World Police and Fire Games taking place.  I really do believe we will bounce back.  I, therefore, urge committee members to pass on to their constituents the message that they should not let the protests put them off.  Belfast and Northern Ireland are great places to visit.  If one is a tourist, we have some of the best restaurants and retailers in the world.  I, therefore, urge members not to be put off by what they see.  They should come up and support us.  I do believe we will get through this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2013012400005#J00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Glyn Roberts","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1359022800,"counter":978,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Roberts and thank him for his presentation.

I know of investors who have seen the pictures on television and pulled their projects.  The impact is difficult to quantify, but the Deputy is right - we must bring the protests on the streets to an end.  The issues must be resolved politically, as doing nothing is not an option.  We must do what we can to get people in Belfast, in particular, to support businesses in their city centre at this difficult time.  We have said it is their civic duty to do so.  Not every road in Belfast is blockaded.  There is not violence in every part of the city.  It is only in a relatively small number of areas and there is a small minority involved in the rioting.  The vast majority have no time for taking part in riots and attacking the police.  They may have their own views about the Union flag, which is fine, but they do not believe it is necessary to attack the police to prove a point.<\/p><p>  We have to start promoting the city.  A week or two ago there was an unofficial Twitter campaign, Operation Sit In, to encourage people to stay in Belfast after work.  It had a degree of success and certainly took the edge off it.  We have been considering how we can build on it by using social media to encourage people to support traders at this difficult time.  We have to do everything we can in that regard.  The most pressing need is to increase footfall in Belfast city centre.

If we are to create 21st-century town and city centres and revitalise the retail sector, we need a radical change in policy in terms of what the Executive does and how retailers do their business.  We have said we need a more joined-up approach, including on the part of the Executive, to urban regeneration.  It does not help in Northern Ireland that there are three Government Departments responsible for town centre regeneration.  We must examine this.<\/p><p>  We have made progress on rates.  The small business rates relief scheme has been extended for the second time and it will come into play on 1 April.  We now have the empty premises relief, for which we lobbied heavily.  If a new business takes over an empty premises that has been empty for a year, it must pay only 50% of the rates normally due in the first year.  We all know that the first year of any business is critical.  If one is paying only 50% of the rates in the first year, it is a help.  The relief has helped approximately 69 new businesses, including restaurants and shops.<\/p><p>  We need a proper joined-up vacancy strategy.  We need an effective audit of vacant sites in towns and city centres.  We also need more engagement with some of the retail chains.  Local authorities to be created in the next year or two will have a substantially greater role in regeneration and planning.  It is a question of engaging with retail chains to tell them a certain empty building would be a perfect location for their shop.  We need more pop-up shops.  We need to determine how to create the next generation of retail entrepreneurs and how we support them.  We must get car parking facilities and a range of other facilities right.  I hope this is all contained in the document.<\/p><p>  The biggest change must come in the mindset of traders themselves.  They must stop seeing online business as a threat and regard it as an opportunity.  They must ensure they have world-class customer service and embrace new ways of doing business.  The reality in retail is that the only constant is change.  If retailers do not embrace change, they will go under, sadly.  A constant process of reinvention and innovation is required.  We must rethink fundamentally our approach to the centres of towns and cities.  That is why we are concerned that the hospitality sector is being hit so hard.  An integral part of any town or city centre is a strong night-time economy and caf&eacute; culture.  Town and city centres must be made into destinations.  This is why we are particularly concerned that, out of the two sectors that have been hit, the hospitality sector has been hit the hardest.  This is why the marketing campaign we are trying to get off the ground is very much targeted at the hospitality sector.  Overall, we want footfall in Belfast city centre.  If Dublin were going through what Belfast is going through, every Deputy in this House, irrespective of what part of the island he was from, would be seeking to determine how the problem could be solved.  It is a question of focusing on everything I have mentioned.  This weekend, we will use social media, such as Facebook and Twitter, to galvanise people from any part of the island to come to the city centre to support us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2013012400008#N00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Glyn Roberts"},{"type":"speech","time":1359023700,"counter":994,"content":"<p>I congratulate whoever thought of the sit-in.

He states people need to sit down and talk.  <\/p><p>  We need to understand Belfast is a shared city.  People have said to me that one reason they were not going into the city centre, apart from the protests, was uncertainty over public transport.  Public transport is important.  People will not go out to enjoy themselves or socialise if they are not sure of getting home.  These are some of the points that the Northern Ireland Independent Retail Trade Association and PSNI need to examine.<\/p><p>  People on this side of the Border realise that although the protests in Belfast are very small, they are having a huge effect, locally and throughout the city as a whole.

That is a very important point to get across.  We met the chief constable last week and that is one of the first things he said.  Issues arise as to getting policing right.  I recognise the PSNI is an incredibly difficult position.  At times, it is caught in the middle and trying to ensure roads are kept open.  There are steps the police need to take.  I understand the force is reconsidering its tactics in this area.<\/p><p>  With regard to Belfast being a shared city, the Deputy is correct.  It illustrates why we need an effective shared-future strategy.  Ultimately, a shared future is about an economically sustainable future.  Companies will not invest in divided societies.  Some of the worst aspects of unemployment and poverty are associated with interfaces in Belfast.  We must, therefore, try to ensure balanced and sustainable economic development that does not just benefit one community; it should benefit all communities.  In east Belfast, particularly areas such as Short Strand and Lower Newtownards Road, there is a lot more we need to do to ensure we have the right skill set in the communities such that they can take advantage of the developing Titanic quarter and other opportunities that exist.  Since I come not far from that area, I realise educational underachievement is a considerable issue.<\/p><p>  On the question on public transport, we have engaged with Translink.  It is very keen to do what it can but ultimately it must consider the safety of its drivers.  A number of buses have been hijacked.  This is an incredibly difficult set of circumstances.<\/p> <p>However, the top priority obviously is to keep the roads open.  This is a problem in that reports become widespread that every road in Belfast is blocked, but this is not the case.  While some main roads are, most of the main arterial routes through the city centre are actually open.  It is just that when this situation happens, there are misconceptions, the rumour mill starts and then people do not go out.  We must challenge that and state that we have some fantastic retailers and world-class restaurants.  Moreover, there will be lots of offers on in Belfast over the next two weekends and we hope this will entice people in.  However, we must try to get this issue off the streets.  The political parties must all sit down to resolve this issue.  The protesters obviously have grievances and the only way to deal with the political problem is to let the political parties come up with a political solution.  This is the only way we will tackle this problem effectively and I hope we can continue to do this.  We will not solve the problem of reduced footfall in the city centre until the protest issue is resolved.  It is not for us to comment on its causes or, if one likes, \"the capital P politics\" as to the reason this happened, but as business representatives, it is important that we point out the disruption to trade.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2013012400008#N00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Glyn Roberts","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1359024300,"counter":997,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Glyn Roberts to the meeting and thank him for his presentation.

The dialogue is on how can we develop the retail sector on the island of Ireland and on how can we make the island of Ireland recognised as a major international retail destination.  One initiative being considered by our two organisations is the setting up of a North-South retail forum between ourselves, which would engage with InterTradeIreland and the Administrations in Belfast and Dublin to consider what are the challenges in that regard and how we can engage with them.  This is an initiative that we, as two business organisations, are taking because in retail terms, there is no such thing as a border.  Shoppers will go wherever there is a bargain and that is the reality.  The interesting development this Christmas was that although we normally have lots of Southern shoppers coming north into Belfast, this year it was the other way around to some degree.  I was talking to retailers in Dublin who had an enormous number of Northerners, including people from Belfast, who were shopping.  We must try to establish how we can develop all of that and we are at the very early stages of so doing.  I have had an initial meeting with the new chief executive of InterTradeIreland, and obviously we are at the early stages of this initiative.  However, its establishment is one of our projects for this year.<\/p><p>  In respect of Belfast City Council, the Lord Mayor hosted a meeting last week of all the different agencies and key players in the Lord Mayor's Parlour.  We envisage that this campaign fund will be administered by the Belfast Visitor and Convention Bureau.  The bureau will be the lead organisation in this regard and we expect that Belfast City Council also will have a role in funding that campaign.  We have had that engagement and obviously it was helpful, in addition, that Belfast City Council struck a zero rate.  We are having that dialogue and what we really are trying to do is to bring solutions.  We can dwell on this problem all we like but we must focus on solutions.

People are just not spending in the same way they were and as a result, there were huge challenges in 2012.  However, Belfast still has a very strong retail offering.  We are working hard to ensure that it is a destination and that we have a strong daytime and night-time economy.  In addition to a good mix of retail, we have a very successful continental market, which is important in helping to generate footfall because anyone who visits the continental market will tend to go to other shops when they are in the city centre.  We are contemplating the development of initiatives such as a Belfast restaurant week or an independent retail week and have been trying to implement lots of ideas.  I welcome the focus of Belfast City Council in particular on trying to get more independent retailers into Belfast city centre because they obviously add something different.  While it was not without its difficulties, it is a very strong retail offering.  Many of our towns and cities in Northern Ireland have very strong retail offers.  We still have a reasonably strong independent retail sector that offers something different.<\/p><p>  As for the <i>Titanic<\/i> exhibition, its visitor numbers surpassed all expectations.  While it is a fantastic opportunity, we need to do a bit more work to connect the <i>Titanic<\/i> museum to the rest of the city centre.  I have a slight worry that it is almost a destination in itself, in that people might go there but not go into the city centre as much.  There is something of a job of work to do in that regard, which I think can be done as it is only a very short walk away.  However, the <i>Titanic<\/i> exhibition is a fantastic thing for Belfast and the centre really is a fantastic building.  In addition, there is a lot more work to be done to develop the Titanic Quarter and, hopefully, we will continue to build in that area - for instance, through the work of Northern Ireland Screen - to make sure that more television productions and films are shot there.  There is still a lot of potential and I would like to see a lot more work done to develop the Titanic Quarter and to ensure we can match up jobs and skill sets in order that the communities of Short Strand and east Belfast benefit as well.  While I acknowledge that they have benefited, we need to do a fair bit more work.  However, the Titanic Quarter and its future development is very exciting.  We also have the Royal Exchange and fantastic opportunities in the Cathedral Quarter.  We are developing the concept of Belfast being a city of quarters, which obviously does not just mean four quarters.  The quarters include the Titanic Quarter, the Cathedral Quarter, the Gaeltacht Quarter and Queen's Quarter.  They all add to a city of quarters in a city that offers something very different.  It is a city that ultimately must realise it is now a shared city.  It is a city of many different cultures, not just Unionist and Nationalist.  It is a city that I believe has something to offer and we have made good progress in this regard.  While I acknowledge the last couple of months have been a setback, members may rest assured that the city will bounce back.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2013012400009#O00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Glyn Roberts"},{"type":"speech","time":1359024300,"counter":1001,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Roberts.  Unless anyone else wishes to add anything, we will bring the session to a close.  I note in conclusion that the joint committee appreciates Mr. Roberts's attendance.  Were there a blueprint for coming up with a solution to many of the problems on this island, it would already have been rolled out.  However, to an extent, the blueprint we have is the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p> <p> We take Mr. Roberts's point about the Irish reputation.  With the instantaneous nature of media and its international access, it is not just television, one can check on YouTube and one can readily view incidents that have taken place over the past month or more.  Something that is happening in Belfast, or Pat Doherty's constituency in Castlederg, or in Derry affects the whole island.  That is how seriously we take this particular crisis at the moment.<\/p><p> We do not feel, as a committee, that we have the solutions.  However, the committee has agreed to provide an opportunity to community, business and political groups on either side of the Border to offer their observations and solutions.  We feel strongly that there is a sense of urgency about this, so we need to act proactively.  The committee is a North-South implementation body with a diverse membership.  We have an appetite not alone to facilitate but also to be with and show our support for the people of Northern Ireland who are affected by these incidents.  In acknowledging that trust has been broken to a degree, there are still trust lines that have been built up since the Good Friday Agreement in 1998.  The committee is confident that things will improve in future, but we are not naive enough to believe that things will work out on their own.  There will have to be different interventions including, as Mr. Roberts said, at a political level.  People are also working closely at community level and I acknowledge the work of everyone who is doing such work at the interfaces, including religious leaders who have been involved proactively in recent weeks.  We wish Mr. Roberts well in his own efforts and campaigns.  We are delighted that he came down here today.  The committee wishes to demonstrate its support for him and his colleagues.  <\/p><p> Over the years, people have said that we cannot be complacent about the peace process.

What does Mr. Roberts think politicians in the South can do to help the situation?  When we met the loyalist groups in Belfast, I found it most striking that they felt they had a disconnect from their own politicians to a large extent, and felt they needed outside help to get funding and progress matters.  What, in Mr. Roberts's view, is the most immediate thing that can happen to address this matter?  I know he is not a politician, but what does he think politicians can do in the short term to try to address these issues?

One of the reasons I wanted to come down here was to get that message across.  Many of my members and those in the hospitality sector rely on trade from the South.  It is important that continues to be the case, and vice versa.  If there is one message the committee can convey, it is to encourage people to come to Belfast and support traders there by shopping, socialising and enjoying food and drink.  It is not necessarily a political thing, but that is what we need the most.  We need footfall and people to support us.  That is one of the main reasons why I am down here today.

It is the sincerely held view of the INMO that the survey confirms that staffing levels in this country are at a critical and unsafe level.  The survey was carried out independently by Dr. Keith Hurst, independent researcher and analyst and editor of the International Journal of Healthcare Quality Assurance and a most reputable expert in the area who has worked for the HSE and other major health employers.  The INMO in approaching this exercise was acutely aware that there are many variables in health staffing including patient dependency and acuity, physical layout of wards and units, skill mix and grade mix and traditional roles of key grades.  These variables make it difficult for any party to be absolutist as to what constitutes safe or unsafe staffing levels.  Notwithstanding these caveats, we sit before the committee today clearly of the view that the survey confirms our worst fears that staffing levels have reached unacceptable levels which compromise patient care and the ability of registered nurses to ensure safe care through safe practice.<\/p><p>  Apart from the demand from our own members, the INMO was influenced to undertake this staffing comparison by the Royal Commission report on standards of care in the Mid-Staffordshire Hospital Trust in the United Kingdom.  The Royal Commission found that between 2005 and 2009 there were between 400 and 1,200 avoidable deaths due to poor care.  In addition, the report found that nursing staff had submitted 1,722 incident reports on poor staffing levels which had not been acknowledged or responded to by the trust's senior management.  It is of serious concern to the INMO that a similar environment now exists in Ireland with the same adherence to budgets, realisation of targets and contraction of frontline staff which led to negative findings in mid-Staffordshire.  Our members tell us daily that their documented expressions of concern about patient care are being ignored by senior management due to a fixation with meeting budget targets and WTE ceilings.<\/p><p>  The comparative survey was undertaken on a wholly independent basis by Dr. Keith Hurst and his team based in the United Kingdom.  The survey involved a detailed sampling of wards in the four specialties of general medicine, surgery, elderly care and admissions and assessment.  The number of wards sampled in each specialty is set out in the table in the opening statement document circulated to members.  The difference in the number of wards sampled per speciality is explained by reference to the overall size of the respective health services.  The methodology employed in the survey involved the collection of data from a cross-sample of medical, surgical, elderly care and admission and assessment units and, or, wards in hospitals of similar size and complexity; the analysis of this data with reference to the size of ward, grade and skill mix and patient acuity; the measurement in comparative terms of man hours per patient, staff per occupied bed, and the application of these measurements to a standard 25-bedded ward in both countries.<\/p><p>  Appendix 1 to the copy of my opening statement as circulated to members provides a single-page summary of the findings of this survey which confirms that Irish wards, without exception, are larger in terms of bed numbers which, of itself, has significant nursing workload implications.  The summary also states that the average 25-bedded Irish ward as compared to its UK counterpart has fewer staff as follows; six fewer surgical ward or unit staff; 3.5 fewer medical ward or unit staff; 13.5 fewer admission and assessment units staff; and 3.25 fewer elderly care ward staff.  The average roster on these wards sees clinical areas operating with between one and two fewer staff members at all times over a 24-hour cycle as compared to UK counterparts.  According to the feedback and responses from nurses in Ireland, the staffing deficit is negatively affecting patient care and increasing staff burnout, absenteeism and overall fatigue.  We also set out in the appendix a tabulated breakdown of the staffing reality with reference to staff per occupied bed; total care hours available on a ward per week and the resulting ward complement on a 25 bedded ward.  In addition, we have also detailed in a comparative sense the implications for a ward by reference to a sample daily roster of staffing on mornings, afternoons and night shifts.<\/p><p>  It is necessary to remind the committee of a number of matters in order to contextualise the comparative survey.  As a direct result of the public service recruitment moratorium, the number of nursing and midwifery posts in the public health service has fallen from 39,006 at the beginning of 2009 to 34,614 currently.  This is a loss of 4,392 posts or 11.5%.  The reduction in posts has taken place in an uncontrolled manner and has been particularly severe over the past 12 months due to the volume of retirements which took place in the weeks leading up to 28 February 2012.  In the same period, the public health service has reduced the number of health service support staff, including ward clerks, health care assistants and ward support staff, from 18,517 to 17,142.  This is a loss of 1,375 posts or 7.5%.  The contraction in numbers within these grades has further depleted the number of ward-based staff which, in turn, increases workloads and negatively impacts upon the time available for patient contact, overall patient care and safe practice.  During the same period - primarily under the clinical care programmes - the acuity and dependency of patients in these wards increased significantly.  The reasons for that are as follows.  There has been increased throughput as the number of day procedures has increased from 675,162 in 2009 to 804,274 in 2011.  There has been a decrease in the average length of stay from 6.4 in 2009 to 5.8 at the end of 2012 and an increase in the occupancy rate from 89.3% in 2009 to 91.2% at the end of 2012.<\/p> <p>Bed occupancy of over 80% is internationally recognised as overcrowding.  The continuing closure of beds, acute and non-acute means that we now have 2,469 beds closed throughout the country.  The source for that information is our own bed count, not an external source.  In addition to these specific measurable increases in productivity, we have also seen the introduction of specific targets at hospital level, including no patient waiting longer than nine months for admission and a maximum of six hours' waiting time, from presentation to either admission or discharge, in emergency departments.  Both of these increases, while welcome, have further increased the pressure upon surgical, medical, admission and assessment units.<\/p><p> In recent years, successive Ministers, the Department of Health and the HSE have consistently and repeatedly stated that Ireland is \"rich\" in the number of nurses we have per 1,000 of the population when compared with fellow OECD countries.  This is wholly incorrect, seriously misleading and not borne out by any serious examination of the real manpower figures.<\/p><p> In 2002 the Department of Health and Children undertook the first large-scale study for workforce planning which provided a comprehensive approach to the issue of nursing and midwifery workforce planning inclusive of 118 recommendations.  This report identified and corrected one of the most significant misconceptions in relation to our nursing and midwifery resource, which suggested that Ireland had one of the highest ratios of practising nurses per 1,000 of the population at 16.5.  The Department&rsquo;s own text states that this figure was significantly inflated and the actual figure was 10.8 per 1,000 of the population and 8.04 in the public health service.  This correction, however, is consistently ignored by the Department of Health when making public comment.<\/p><p> Furthermore, in the context of the impact of the recruitment embargo, summarised earlier, and the current population of Ireland, the INMO believes a more relevant measure is that of employed nurses in the public and private health service which is as follows.  The number of nursing and midwifery posts in the HSE is 34,614.  The number of nurses and midwives in the private sector is approximately 10,000 which, minus the number of midwives in public and private hospitals, leaves 2,200, giving a total of 42,414 nurses employed for a population of 4.6 million.  Therefore, the ratio of nurses per 1,000 of the population is 9.22.  This falls within the average ratio found by the OECD and fails to take into account the following: the unique demography of the Irish population, that is, the percentage over 65 and percentage under five which places pressure on the hospital system; the reduced level of acute beds per 1,000, resulting in high acuity, dependency and overall turnover; and a very high bed occupancy rate which, internationally, would be accepted as ongoing overcrowding.<\/p><p> It should also be noted that, in Ireland, the undergraduate nurse or midwife, when undertaking a rostered placement, is counted as 0.5 of a whole-time post.  This confirms their inclusion as an integral part of the qualified nursing workforce despite the fact that they are not registered nurses and midwives.  In comparison, the UK excludes all reference to undergraduate nurses and midwives undertaking clinical placements when they calculate their nursing and midwifery numbers.<\/p><p> This Registered Nurse Forecasting, RN4CAST, study funded by the European Union also found that the Irish nurse per 1,000 population falls within the average OECD ratio.  The RN4CAST studied features of hospital environments which impact on nurse recruitment, retention and patient outcomes in approximately 500 general acute care hospitals in 12 European countries, as listed in the document submitted to the committee. The study found that workforce planning in the Irish health service and for nursing in particular has been limited due to poor information on public health workers and inadequate availability of information on the supply and demand of health care workers in the private and voluntary sectors.  The RN4CAST found that the determination of staffing levels on Irish wards with 30 participating hospitals was reported to be largely historical for 24, not based on a formal system for 25, variable across wards in 23, reviewed regularly in almost half the hospitals - 14, not determined by reference to benchmarks in 17, not set to match existing benchmarks in 20, not set to exceed existing benchmarks in 28, not matched to patient acuity or dependency in 21, somewhat based on informal review of patient acuity in 18, and not planned on a shift-by-shift basis using patient acuity or dependency in 23.  The need for a comprehensive approach to strategic workforce planning for the health service is becoming more evident.  There are no set or recommended nurse to patient ratios in Ireland and workload assessment tools, staffing systems and workforce planning techniques are varied and lack integration.  The World Health Organization states that \"the formulation of national human resources for health (HRH) policies and strategies requires evidence-based planning to rationalise decisions\".<\/p><p> In every economic downturn, and particularly where cost containment is required in health, nursing and midwifery staff are often seen as a target for cost saving rather than being an essential part of the solution.  The current emphasis is on crisis management as opposed to a planned strategy of how best to use existing valuable resources like nursing and midwifery.  Over decades research studies across the world, as detailed in appendix 2 of our submission, have established a direct association between lower nurse staffing and higher mortality; adverse events and poor care; less effective and efficient care; and higher fatigue and burnout.  Lower staffing associated with higher patient mortality has been identified in numerous countries, including the USA, England, Switzerland, Belgium, China and Taiwan.  Poor nurse staffing practices are associated with increased incidence of a range of poor patient outcomes, including increased rates of pneumonia, rates of urinary tract and surgical site infection and pressure ulcers.  Lower nurse staffing is associated with longer lengths of stay, as well as increased rates of readmission to hospital after discharge.  Both readmission and longer lengths of stay increase health care costs.<\/p><p> Internationally, it has been demonstrated that poor staffing levels increase the risk of burnout among nurses.  This in turn increases the risk of poorer patient care.  This has also been supported by the RN4CAST research across the 30 participating Irish hospitals which found 77.6% of staff reporting that there was insufficient staff to get all the required work done, 74.9% reporting there were inadequate numbers of registered nurses to provide quality care, and 42% of nurses surveyed reporting high levels of emotional exhaustion.<\/p><p> A number of research studies have also shown that increasing the number of staff with lesser qualifications will not bring about the same care improvements as increasing the number of registered nurses.  Similarly, poorer care outcomes have been associated with lower proportions of registered nurses in the staffing profile.  The RN4CAST survey found in relation to grade mix of staff on the last shift that Ireland had a 72:28 ratio of nurses to support staff and the UK ratio is 70:30.  This further rebuffs the perception that Ireland is \"rich\" in nurses.<\/p><p> In this comparative survey and associated research, the INMO has sought to outline, through the use of wholly independent sources, the very serious staff shortages and deficits which now exist in critical areas of our hospitals throughout the country.  The comparative study itself has confirmed our worst fears as it has identified in surgical, medical, care of the elderly and admission and assessment units that our staffing levels are significantly below those of the United Kingdom.  These staffing deficits are undoubtedly at this stage compromising both the quality and quantity of care available to patients and the ability of registered nurses to provide safe care through safe practice.<\/p><p> This situation continues to worsen due to the current application of the public service recruitment moratorium and the policy, imposed by Government, of further contraction of staffing in our health service, which this year alone demands a further 2,500 net loss of posts.  We respectfully suggest to the committee that this cannot continue and this unmanaged approach to staffing on the front line must cease.<\/p><p> Arising from this study, and the compilation of related research, it is also possible to state the following.  Ireland does not have an oversupply of nurses compared with the OECD, and the actual number of nurses employed falls within the average range.  At a ratio of 72:28 of registered nurse to support staff, our grade mix is very similar to that which applies in the United Kingdom where it is 70:30.<\/p> <p>However, this fails to take into account that all of the support staff, included in this ratio in the United Kingdom, have undertaken standard vocational-type further education.  Staffing levels, in our wards, continue to vary, considerably and would appear to be based on historical factors rather than any qualitative estimation of need or measure of patient acuity or dependency.  This cannot continue and needs to be addressed as part of the ongoing reform and reorganisation of our health service.<\/p><p> Associated academically-proofed and wholly independent research continues to record the growing fears of registered nurses that patient care is being compromised on a regular basis arising from this low staffing level and that burnout and fatigue resulting in absenteeism are now significant problems for nurses.  All measures brought forward to address this critical staffing shortage must ensure that adequate numbers of registered nurses remain in the clinical area, as international research shows patient outcomes are improved and enhanced when the required level of registered-nurse presence is maintained.<\/p><p> It is the view of the INMO that the health service must fundamentally alter how it determines and maintains adequate staffing levels on wards, which ensure the best outcome for patients and safe practice for registered nurses.  In this context and having studied many other jurisdictions, it is our view that the best and ultimately most cost-effective way of doing this is to introduce mandatory nurse-patient ratios.  It is therefore our request that once the committee has studied, examined and analysed this comparative study and related international research, it would initiate discussions with all the relevant stakeholders on bringing forward the required regulation which would introduce mandatory nurse-patient ratios.  This would ensure consistent care standards and patient outcomes throughout our health system regardless of geography or any other factor.  We believe this reform is of greater relevance and importance than the constant attention being given to the reform and reorganisation of management structures while hospital wards and units are left understaffed and overworked.<\/p><p> I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for affording us the opportunity of this meeting this morning.

I commend Mr. Doran on his presentation and on taking the initiative to commission and publish this report.  It is a very valuable aid to the members of the committee in our respective roles here in the Houses of the Oireachtas in addressing the very obvious staffing deficiencies in our hospital network.  It confirms from international research the adverse impacts, as Mr. Doran has documented, of understaffing in our hospitals, including increased mortality as outlined in a number of the reports.  This impact is firstly and most importantly on the patient.  However, we are also very conscious that it has a significant impact no front-line staff - not only nurses but also hospital doctors.  We are very conscious that is stretching them to the limit in their workload.  It is not an overstatement to say that the overwhelming number of them are coping only through heroic efforts.<\/p><p>  The report focuses on international research.

Has the INMO considered taking appropriate action to address this in a challenge to what is legally permissible and legally safe at the very extremities?

I wish to put on record my appreciation and thanks to nursing staff throughout the country and particularly in south Tipperary, where I have worked closely with nursing staff over a 20-year period.  The presentation referred to crisis management in our hospitals and health service.  Last night and this morning one of the hospitals I managed for more than 20 years has 26 patients on trolleys in the emergency department, in corridors and offices off the emergency department, and indeed in the atrium of the hospital.  At the same time that hospital has had approximately 30 beds closed.  I am speaking about South Tipperary General Hospital.  That is clear evidence that there is now effectively crisis management in our hospitals.<\/p> <p>There is no doubt that in recent years the face of nursing and the provision of services in hospitals has changed.  That has put huge pressure on staff generally and on nursing staff in particular.  That so many beds are closed and that we have lost so many nursing staff - almost 4,500 nursing staff have gone in recent years - is causing enormous difficulties and more nursing positions are ear-marked for reduction in the coming year.  This, coupled with the move to more day-case treatments and reductions in the length of stay for patients has changed the face of nursing and placed enormous additional pressure on nursing staff throughout the hospital system.  <\/p><p> In the context of this independent report, which contains international comparisons, it seems there are now no regulations or guidelines for staffing levels on wards in Irish hospitals.  Has there been any engagement by the HSE or by the Department of Health with the INMO, or with staff generally, regarding the setting of agreed standards and ratios for hospital wards?  How does the INMO believe the existing recruitment moratorium and the continuing reductions in staff will affect the current situation?  I imagine it will create an even more difficult situation.  I will not ask about the graduate scheme, Chairman, but how does the INMO feel the availability of opportunities for nursing abroad will impact on the availability of nurses here?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013012400006#G01600","nonspeaker":"Deputy S&eacute;amus Healy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1359021900,"counter":1050,"content":"<p>I should put on record that it is not that we are not going to discuss the graduate scheme but rather that the request came in last November from Mr. Doran that the committee would discuss this particular report.

As someone who has several family members working in both the medical and nursing professions, I am very much aware of the difficulties that exist in our hospital system.  I am approaching this from the budgetary point of view and in 2011 and 2012, the total budget for health care exceeded the total amount of money collected in income tax.  This year, as I understand it, the budget for health care will be approximately 90% of the total income tax take.  Over the last number of years, despite the downward trend in terms of tax yields and the budgetary constraints under which the Government is operating, increments continue to be paid in the public sector whereas in the private sector, salaries have decreased by as much as 40%.  If one takes the legal profession, for example, on average, young solicitors have experienced a drop in salary of up to 40%.  In terms of the way forward in the health sector, we are not going to be in a position to increase the budget, certainly in the next three to four years.  In fact, we will be very lucky to hold the budget at its current level.  In that context, how can savings be made in some areas so that we can actually maintain, if not increase, the levels of front line nursing staff in the system?  I agree that there are enormous demands being made of those in the front line.  The INMO's own report gives a very comprehensive overview of changes in the level of  day-care, where the number of procedures has increased from 675,000 to over 804,000.  The number of outpatient appointments has increased also from 2 million per annum to more than 3.5 million.  There have been huge changes which have placed huge demands on staff.  Nevertheless, we still have a budgetary problem and I would like to hear suggestions from the INMO on how the budget could be more carefully managed so that we can maintain, if not increase the number of nursing staff in the system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013012400007#H00300","speaker":"1150"},{"type":"speech","time":1359021900,"counter":1052,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Doran and members of the INMO for their presentation this morning.  The most frustrating aspect of the health service, for those on the front line and for members of this committee examining the system is that we see the HSE managing the cents while, at the same time, haemorrhaging thousands of euros in the way in which it operates the system on a day-to-day basis.  The report before us today clearly undermines the general impression that there are too many nurses in the system.  We have seen how the large numbers of nurses who retired last spring has impacted on the numbers of agency staff being used, which is unsustainable.  I wish to ask the witnesses about the vacant posts within the system.  On foot of the retirements last year, the HSE gave approval to managers, on a case-by-case basis, to sanction individual posts-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013012400007#H00400","speaker":"1177"},{"type":"speech","time":1359021900,"counter":1053,"content":"<p>I would prefer the Deputy to stick to the report rather than raising outside matters, to be fair.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013012400007#H00500","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1359021900,"counter":1054,"content":"<p>It is relevant in the context of staffing numbers in the hospital system.  These were key posts that were part of overall staffing numbers.  The presentation today was very much about decision making, about who makes staffing decisions and about the fact that it should be nurses who make them.  Approval was given to fill a number of key nursing posts deemed to be critical to the day-to-day operation of hospitals.  That was shelved last August when the new moratorium was introduced.  The Department has given the impression that the new graduate scheme will fill those vacancies.  Is that the case?  Will that scheme fill those critical posts or how will it address that issue?  The problem now is that in many hospitals, including one in my own area, patients are being transferred to private nursing homes because of staffing difficulties.<\/p><p>  On the issue of the registered nursing forecasting system funded by the EU, a very telling point in the study was that there is a very poor level of information on public health workers and that the information that is available is inadequate.  Is it not the case that the inadequate compilation of information is allowing individual hospitals to cook the books, so to speak, regarding what is happening on the ground?  I have given evidence here, backed up by the HSE, that a particular hospital was actually managing the trolleys in order to undermine the trolley count.  In light of that, does the INMO believe more investment is needed in the collation of information so that we know exactly what is happening.  We should not have to rely on the INMO to fund independent research in order to get this data.<\/p><p>  In the context of the registered nursing forecast findings, the point was made that the ratio in Ireland relative to the UK is roughly the same, with a difference of about 2%.  However, that 2% equates to approximately 1,000 front line nurses.  The INMO has made the point that there has been a lot of vocational training provided to support staff, who number about 30%, in the UK.  Is the INMO making the case today that as well as dealing with the challenges that we have regarding recruitment, there is room to improve efficiency by having properly trained support staff who could release nurses back onto the front line, as has been done in the UK?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013012400007#H00600","speaker":"1177"},{"type":"speech","time":1359021900,"counter":1055,"content":"<p>I will start by saying that the nurses in our hospitals do a fantastic job.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013012400007#H00700","speaker":"1068"},{"type":"speech","time":1359021900,"counter":1056,"content":"<p>I am sorry to interrupt, Deputy, but somebody's phone is interfering with the sound system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013012400007#H00800","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1359022500,"counter":1057,"content":"<p>Chairman, you might not be too happy about it but I would like to talk for a few seconds about the ban on nursing places.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013012400008#J00100","speaker":"1068"},{"type":"speech","time":1359022500,"counter":1058,"content":"<p>No.  I chastised Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in and Deputy Healy in a nice way for that.

The Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, has advised all members to submit what we call disclaimer forms to their management whenever they find their ability to provide safe care is compromised.  These are being submitted on a daily basis, sometimes two and three times per day, in most hospitals throughout the country as we speak, because the registered nurses <i>in situ<\/i> maintain they cannot provide the care.

In fairness, local general management are being beaten all the time and they have an impossible problem to solve, because they may have posts to fill but they may have no money to fill them or they may have no money but they may have posts.  One way or another they cannot answer the demand.  They are avoiding the additional staff.  This is the reason we commissioned the study in this area.  There is a perception that most of the health service is made up of intensive care or coronary care area or the oncology services in the country and so on, but the vast bulk of health care is delivered in the ordinary areas such as a medical ward, a surgical ward or an elderly care unit.  It is not necessarily the hi-tech intensive care or coronary care areas.  It is precisely these areas that are being totally dissipated of the quality of staff they require and these areas have been shown up in the comparative study.<\/p><p>  I try not to be too alarmist but the embargo has been an abject failure by downsizing our health system in an unmanaged way rather than allowing patient care to always determine that the right person is in the right place at the right time at the right grade to perform the right task on the patient.  It has been uncontrolled and it continues to be uncontrolled.  We have lost 11.5% of our workforce.  I respectfully put it to colleagues present that an 11.5% loss of workforce, regardless of whether one factors in changes in work practices, increases in productivity, more flexible rosters and so on, must produce a give or compromise somewhere.  That is the ordinary levels of care required by patients which are going undone by nurses and which is a source of concern to them.<\/p><p>  I will not go there now but this is one of our pleas today.  Our greatest fear at the moment is that there is no bottom line for our health care system and no one who will draw a line and say we will not go below it.  It is because we do not have nurse-patient ratios.  We have examined the idea of nurse-patient ratios long and hard.  They are not the automatic solution to all of our difficulties, but they set a minimum whereby at least there is a commonality of standard whether I am in Donegal, Wexford, Dundalk or Bantry.  We maintain this must be applied in Ireland.  At present, what manager A says is safe may be deemed unsafe by manager Y for various reasons.  There is simply no common standard.  Many of our staffing levels are based on history, geography and whether one had influential people <i>in situ<\/i> over the years.  We realise these are the realities.  I put it to the committee that the comparative study has thrown up the deficits that exist.  The deficits continue to worsen and to standardise the situation or put some foundation on it we maintain we must consider, debate and bring forward nurse-patient ratios to give a standard which would apply regardless of the hospital.<\/p><p>  I will not go into the issue about graduates other than how it relates to the comparative study.  We are not simply discussing the number of nurses.  Within any grade there must be a skills mix as well.  With respect to Deputy Fitzpatrick, if it were as simple as he has described we might all have an engagement but ultimately the employment of the graduate programme is only redirecting moneys currently given to agency employment towards graduate employment.  There are no additional man hours.<\/p><p>  When people refer to 35,000 and 36,000, I respectfully suggest that it is mere imagination.  There are 36,000 people in the system already, albeit 34,500 in official whole time employment and up to 1,500 employed every day via agencies and so on.  One cannot simply get rid of 1,200 experienced nurses and replace them with new graduate nurses, who will not have the mentorship and support envisaged in a graduate placement programme, and suggest nothing has been lost.  There would be skills, expertise and experience lost by such a change.  This is another thing wrong with the graduate programme apart from the 80% and so on.  I genuinely and sincerely put it to Deputy Fitzpatrick that not one additional hour will accrue to any ward arising from the programme.  They are displacing experienced staff and replacing them with new graduates.  That is not a solution in a situation where short staffing already exists.<\/p><p>  The committee should understand that we have not had our head in the sand on the issue of training.  In 2007, we agreed with the HSE on job descriptions for health care assistants, based on a level 5 FETAC programme, a general job description and some specialist jobs descriptions for maternity, theatre and elderly care.<\/p> <p>Nothing happened uniformly.  The INMO does not have a difficulty with a 70:30 mix at ward level.  We understand a ward cannot be staffed solely by nurses and that it would be wrong to do so.  It would be a waste of time and not be a proper use of resources.  Equally, there can be a ratio of 80:20 in some places and 60:40 somewhere else.  There are no minimum educational criteria for support staff.  If a nurse delegates to them, it is necessary to know that they are competent in certain basic areas such as in making daily observations, for example.  We do not have a difficulty in engaging and embracing that dialogue, but there is no one on the opposite side of the table.  We have agreed job descriptions and to the level 5 FETAC programme, but the system has not delivered the quantum of people required through that programme to put it back <i>in situ<\/i>at health care assistant level to complement the nurse and take delegated duties from him or her.  That is necessary and I plead with the committee in that regard.  <\/p><p> I will deal with Senator Colm Burke's point, but when we engage with the health system, all we ever hear about is the extended role of the nurse, whether it be undertaking intravenous canulation, catheterisation, phlebotomy or first dose antibiotic therapy.  We would embrace all of this.  However, there has to be a safe cohort of people who have received vocational training and are ready to take up the slack.  All we hear is that the nurse will do more, but there are no plans for the evolution of care from the health care assistant's role through vocational training.  It is an excellent proposal and would be a brilliant addition for ward staff to have a 70% cohort of nurses or midwives and to grow towards reducing the reliance on the non-consultant hospital doctor.  In particular, I suggest relying on non-training NCHD posts is not a cost-effective way of providing care in many of our smaller acute hospitals.  We will participate, but it has to be in a continuum and planned.  We are up for it, but all we get is talk about budgets, money, the lack of clarity and the nurse having to pick up the slack all the time.  I will say unapologetically to the committee that this cannot continue.  The nurse cannot be regarded as dispensable when it comes to filling posts but in the workplace regarded as the person who does everything that has not been done. <\/p><p> On the question of budgets, we are having a conversation in another place about what the Government is seeking.  Like other public sector unions, we aim to put our best foot forward.  However, with respect, I am a bit tired of hearing that, somehow or other, the public sector has got away scot-free in carrying the burden of recovery.  We are talking about the new graduate programme and there was a cut of 24% before we even started.  This does not include the numbers that were cut, the changes in rosters and work practices, as well as the expansion of the nurse's role.  The new graduate, just like the nurse who has been qualified for ten or 20 years, is subject to the same regulations, correctly so.  There is no difference between the person who has been a registered nurse for one day and the person who has been registered for ten years.  All a patient wants to know is whether the person concerned is capable of performing procedures correctly to a high standard.  The public has a right to have this measured by An Bord Altranais or the new nursing and midwifery board of Ireland.  We have put our best foot forward on the issue of savings, although I know that is an argument for another place.  After pursuing a degree course lasting four years, a nurse earns &euro;26,700 - if the correct salary is paid - a salary that has already been cut by 24%.  He or she will be asked to work all the hours God sends and required to be very flexible.  In my view, the persons concerned have put their shoulders to the wheel and, correctly, will be measured to the same level of acuity, proficiency and perfection as every other nurse.  <\/p><p> I have tried to cover all of the points raised.  Have I left anything out?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013012400008#J02100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Doran","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1359023100,"counter":1079,"content":"<p>I refer to the shifts described that suggested to those of us who heard the interviews that they were outside the law.

However, there is a contracting budget.  In fairness to the health service, nurses, junior doctors and consultants have made significant compromises in an attempt to maintain the same level of service.  The best example is the maternity care service in which the number of deliveries has risen from 55,000 to 75,000 a year, without a great increase in staffing levels.  We also have one of the lowest perinatal mortality rates in Europe.  The service continues to be provided, which is not in question.  However, how can we move forward, taking into account all of the difficulties encountered?

I do not want to be misunderstood when I say this, but the numbers of NCHDs and medical staff have been maintained throughout the embargo period, which is wholly proper.  However, the numbers of nurses and support staff have dropped.  This has meant that the pressure has fallen more on NCHDs in the out-of-hours periods.  I refer to the abject failure to redefine in a planned way the roles of nurse and health care assistant.  If these roles were redefined, there would not be a need to call a doctor at 4 a.m. to perform a relatively simple task which the nurse should be empowered to do.  The ward should be staffed appropriately to carry out such tasks.  The problem on the other side is that there are no laws in place with regard to what should be the workload of staff.  I do not wish to be alarmist, but as a citizen of Ireland, I genuinely and honestly say to the committee that I am fearful of where the health service is going in terms of its ability to look after me when I get sick, as the staff are being stretched.

The INMO has been running a safe practice campaign around the country for the past 18 months at its own expense and which is free to members.  The campaign is focusing on clinical risk and completion of clinical risk forms.<\/p> <p>It is about the nurse protecting herself.  Somebody commented that it is not about the staff but that the link between the nurse and patient outcomes is integral.  One does not have good patient outcomes if one does not have the quality of staff.  According to feedback we receive, although people fill in the clinical risk forms, staffing shortages are frequently not used as an excuse for something that has happened.  The productive ward series, which is being brought out within our hospital level, aims to maximise the amount of time the nurse can have with the patient instead of carrying out other duties.  Even through the small amount of data from the productive ward series, it is possible to correlate increases in falls with drops in staffing numbers.  One frequently finds the same number of staff on duty in hospitals during the day as during the night, although the day workload is excessive.  This is due to staff shortages.  Patient outcomes and the burnout level among nurses are affected.  Somebody spoke about the length of shifts.  Nurses frequently tell us that once they have had their lunch break at 2 p.m., they work until 9 p.m. and may not get a cup of tea because there may be three nurses on duty dealing with 30 patients and a turnover of patients.  That all leads to an increase in infection and we know we have a significant issue with infection across our hospitals.  It also leads to an increase in falls and pneumonia.  The significant factor is the mental exhaustion experienced by the nurses.  They do report these issues but they do not see anything happening on the ground because people put their hands in the air and say they cannot do anything about it because of the budget.  Nurses are faced with such decisions on a daily basis.  They are facing the public on the front line and taking the criticisms but are powerless to do anything to make this better apart from refusing to take additional patients into their wards.  It is coming to the stage where that will probably happen.  We are there to protect the nurse but are also there to protect the patient.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013012400009#K01500","nonspeaker":"Ms Claire Mahon","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1359023700,"counter":1094,"content":"<p>I will address the question about risk forms and the filling out of incident forms when one finds one's self without adequate numbers of staff to provide safe care.  The difficulty is that in many hospitals, when one fills out the risk or incident form, which is for a near miss, sets out that A, B and C are going to happen if one is not provided with another nurse, health care assistant or member of staff and sends it to the risk manager, business managers and other people, while the director of nursing may endeavour to get more staff in view of all the international evidence about staffing numbers, one must go through hoops, roundabouts and unbelievable paperwork to get somebody who is not a nurse to make a decision on behalf of the nursing profession about whether the risk form is adequate or not.  Many people are filling out forms - some of us are better at filling them out than others - but those of us who fill out a lot of them do so because we see the difficulty at ward level.  The people making the decisions about staffing numbers are not nurses, which is why we need to have directors of nursing making decisions about nursing, staffing levels and patient safety.<\/p><p>  We cannot get away from the fact that everybody and anybody will tell one that it is nurses who are the glue holding the health service together at present and in the past.  The Minister agreed with us on that and said that the people who keep the health service going are the nursing staff.  To answer Senator Burke's query, the difficulty lies with the budget.  When we qualify and train, all we are ever taught, and all that is engendered in my bloodstream as a registered nurse, is patient safety and putting the patient and quality first.  Unfortunately, the people in charge at the moment put the budget first.  One cannot put the budget first if one is trying to put patient safety first.  To answer the question about how we might save money, all the evidence in Ireland, from the RN4CAST and internationally for years and years is that when nursing numbers are cut, as they have been in Ireland, with a view to saving money because of budgetary constraints, the patient impact is so great that there is definitely an increase in the number of patients who fall and get pneumonia and urinary tract infections.  After a fall, a patient may not be able to go back to live in his or her own home.  It can cost a fortune in respect of having fractured femurs fixed and requirements to go to the operating theatre.  There is also the question of the general impact on them and their re-entry into society, because the majority of people who fall are over 70.  The difficulty is that antibiotics must be used for pneumonia and urinary tract infections.  There is also an increase in the number of pressure ulcers if there is a reduced nursing staff.<\/p><p>  If one increases the number of nursing staff to the levels we are asking for, guided by international best practice, one will save a fortune.  Things are extremely unsafe at the moment due to the numbers with which we are working.  We are working with one hand tied behind our back, which is impossible in nursing because it is very labour-intensive.  We are not being recognised for the job we do on a daily basis.  The consequences for patients are detrimental.  It is definitely dangerous; I cannot use another word.  What we and the patients are being put through every day is dangerous and not right.  We are responsible and accountable, unlike other people who are not in the nursing profession and who are making decisions about those incident forms.  These people cannot be struck off the register of nurses tomorrow morning because they made a mistake.  Yet we are being prevented as registered nurses and midwives from doing our job, which is to ensure patient safety, care and quality.

I had a quick look at my ward yesterday as I was working.  This time 12 months ago, we had a whole-time equivalent, WTE, of 23.5 for a 31-bed ward.  We were told 12 months ago by our managers that this would be reduced to 22.5 and would affect all wards.  Yesterday, our WTE was 19.8.

One of my colleagues had to go down to the emergency department so I rang my assistant director of nursing to inform her that we were now short and looking for assistance.  She had no nurse to give us and we were told to get on with it.

We genuinely suggest that we must engage with the committee and other stakeholders.  Some type of uniformity must be achieved in respect of the skill mix and grade mix issues and also the nurse-patient ratio in order that there might be a bottom line.  There must be a spectrum whereby patients can expect from nurses the same standard of care, and broadly the same conditions, whether they are in hospital in Dundalk, Sligo, Wexford or wherever.  At present, we do not have this.  We need those ratios and the relevant discussion in respect of them must take place.  This committee is in a powerful position in the context of stimulating that discussion.  We understand that we must engage in it.  Others will also have an interest in it.  We have arrived at the conclusion that without the ratios I referred to, we will never have a standard safe environment right across the spectrum of ordinary specialties.  I do not refer here to high-end specialties, I am referring to ordinary surgical or medical wards, care-of-the-elderly facilities, etc.  The latter are the settings in which the majority of care is delivered and in which that care is being most compromised at present.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013012400011#M01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Doran"},{"type":"speech","time":1359024300,"counter":1113,"content":"<p>I do not wish to engage in a major debate at this point but are the nurse-patient and other ratios being discussed in the context of the new negotiations on a successor to the Croke Park agreement?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013012400011#M01400","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1359024300,"counter":1114,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013012400011#M01500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Doran"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1359024300,"counter":1115,"content":"<p>I will not apologise for being here on behalf of nurses and midwives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013012400011#M01600","nonspeaker":"Ms Clare Mahon"},{"type":"speech","time":1359024300,"counter":1116,"content":"<p>And there should be no need for Ms Mahon to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013012400011#M01700","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1359024300,"counter":1117,"content":"<p>I wish to focus on the level of burnout among nurses.  If one considers the age profile of the people who left last February, one can see that we have lost a good ten years' worth of experience out of the workforce.  The majority of the individuals who left were in their early to mid-50s.  We have, therefore, lost a massive number of senior and experienced staff.  We do not have staff coming along behind these people to gain experience.  At ward level, there is a very poor skills mix.  I am not referring here to nurses and health care assistants in this regard, but to the level of experience among the nurses working on wards.  This has a major impact on patient outcomes.  It must be recognised that nurses are going home each day both exhausted and worried and that this is a real problem.  After all, nurses operate at the coalface and they witness the problems that exist.  Mr. Geoghegan indicated his belief that we are heading towards a scenario similar to that which obtained at Mid-Staffordshire hospital.  I am of the view that, were the truth known, we have already arrived at that scenario.  The reality in this regard is not being acknowledged.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013012400011#M01800","nonspeaker":"Ms Clare Mahon"},{"type":"speech","time":1359024300,"counter":1118,"content":"<p>I thank our guests, Mr. Doran, Ms Mahon, Ms Talty, Mr. Geoghegan, and Adams for their attendance, for their engagement with the committee and for their excellent, thought-provoking and challenging presentation.  I also thank them for commissioning the study.  There is no doubt that we are living in challenging times and it is important that the committee should understand and recognise the pressure and demands being placed on nurses, midwives and public health nurses.  We must also recognise the significant change that those our guests represent have brought about in the delivery of health services.  At a time when there has been a great deal of, in many cases, unfair criticism of public servants, nurses and those in the other health care professions have delivered major changes.  It is important that the committee should reflect no just on our guests' presentation, but also on the testimony they have provided during these proceedings.  I refer, in particular, to their request in respect of the nurse-patient ratio.  We will certainly reflect on the comments that have been made and on our guests' presentation.<\/p><p>  I again thank our guests for giving of their time to come before us.  I wish to place on record our appreciation of the work done throughout the country each day by the people they represent.  The nature of the relationship between politics and trade unionism at times does not allow us to recognise the humanity and professionalism displayed by and the humanitarian work and caring done by nurses each day in our hospitals.  Anyone who engages on any level with the health service will agree that the INMO's members are a credit to it and to the hospitals in which they work.<\/p><p>  I wish to again place on record my thanks to Mr. Michael Dineen and Ms Patsy Doyle in Cork for the great work they do.
