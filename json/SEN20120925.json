In general I take the Leader's point.  As the situation in Syria is very serious it is important that the House discusses it properly and puts forward its view.<\/p><p>Yesterday, thousands of mortgage holders received a letter from the ICS Building Society and Bank of Ireland, dated 31 August.  That letter informed them that Bank of Ireland and ICS Building Society, part of the Bank of Ireland group, are increasing their variable mortgage interest rate by 0.5%, that ICS Building Society has a new lending rate of 4.49%, a net increase of approximately \u20ac100 per month on a \u20ac300,000 mortgage.  The situation is getting out of control.  CSO figures issued last week indicate that 83,251 mortgages, nearly 11% of private residential mortgages, are in arrears of 90 days or more, a further 40,000 have been restructured and 65,700 are in arrears of 180 days or more.  The Central Bank report states that increasing the higher variable rates to compensate for the losses incurred by ICS and Bank of Ireland on tracker loans is a risk which may be counterproductive and continue to exert upward pressure on arrears.  Everyone in the House will be concerned about this issue.  The pressure that the rate increase exerts on mortgage holders and families is becoming extremely hard to bear and they are at breaking point.  Numerous people have been in contact with me about it.  I telephoned ICS yesterday.<\/p> <p>After waiting almost 25 minutes to get through, the first choice one is given is to press No. 1 on the telephone if one has a difficulty with one's mortgage or envisages having a difficulty with it.  There will be many more people pressing the No. 1 button after this increase.  When I eventually got through I asked the bank's representative why the bank, in the letter it sent to mortgage holders, did not give a justification for the increase.  The person said it was due to the cost of covering the bank's increased deposit rates, which is nonsense and, frankly, a lie.<\/p><p>I ask the Leader to arrange for a proper, non-partisan debate on the ongoing mortgage crisis.  There has been an increase of 50% in arrears since last June.  If ICS, Bank of Ireland and the public interest directors in Bank of Ireland think that asking an average mortgage holder to pay \u20ac100 net more per month will get them out of a hole, be any good for their customers or will improve the arrears situation, they are living in cloud-cuckoo-land.  This cannot be allowed to continue.  The taxpayer owns 15% of the Bank of Ireland and ICS group and that institution is still covered by the bank guarantee.  Now, however, tens of thousands of mortgage holders have received this arbitrary statement, which the bank did not even have the guts to give to the media.  The fact that the bank sent a letter dated 31 August which arrived in people's houses on 24 September is a joke.<\/p><p>I believe we must give time to this issue.  We should schedule a debate this week with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, or the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes.  Perhaps they could tell us whether the Central Bank has received from the lending institutions their long-term mortgage arrears strategy and the list of new products they will be offering, something for which the Government set a time deadline of 30 September.  This crisis cannot continue.  People cannot afford these mortgage interest rate increases.  With the ECB base rate at 0.75% why do Bank of Ireland and ICS believe they can charge 3.5% more to their clients, who are already put to the pin of their collars?  It is an absolute disgrace and it requires more than me, the Leader or Government Ministers saying it is terrible.  It requires action, once and for all, because there is no doubt that people are at breaking point.<\/p><p>I ask the Leader to arrange an urgent debate this week and show that the Seanad will deal with this matter.  I hope the Leader can refer back to me tomorrow with a scheduled time for a debate on it in order that we can ask the Minister what the public interest directors are doing in Bank of Ireland if they are not protecting the public interest.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012092500003#B00500","speaker":"1139","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348580100,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I seek a debate on the plans for a youth guarantee, which the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, spoke about yesterday when she announced that the Government will advance plans during Ireland's EU Presidency next year for a European youth guarantee to help reduce youth unemployment.  This is a very exciting prospect which offers practical possibilities and potential for addressing the seriously high rate of youth unemployment in Ireland and across the EU.  We can learn from countries such as Austria and Germany, which have far lower youth unemployment rates and where the idea of a youth guarantee originated.  The idea is a guarantee to young people that within four months of becoming unemployed they will receive an apprenticeship, training or combined work and training, if not a job offer.  If that guarantee is made, it will give people some hope that there is a viable prospect for them in Ireland.  It would be a very important initiative to launch during our EU Presidency starting in January next year.<\/p><p>We have had debates in the House, including with the T\u00e1naiste present, about the plans for Ireland's EU Presidency but the really concrete thing we could do is tie down a guarantee of EU-wide funding for the concept of a youth guarantee.  The Minister, Deputy Burton, spoke about the need for the European Commission to provide money from EU Structural Funds or from the European Social Fund.  The issue must be tackled on a European-wide basis and the funding must be sourced there.  It would be an ideal proposal for our Presidency.<\/p><p>I also wish to express concern, as other Members will, about the two shocking killings yesterday associated with so-called gangland or organised crime.  A good deal of media attention has been generated by them.  While one does not wish to jump to any conclusions on foot of the events of one day, especially as it appears to be a coincidence of two shootings, one of them took place in the south inner city of Dublin, an area I know well.  It is an area where there are a number of schools.<\/p> <p>This happened at 8 p.m. on the South Circular Road and there were a lot of children in the vicinity, including a child with the victim.  We must examine how we tackle this sort of visible incidence of organised crime in the community.  There have been calls for more legislation, and we have seen waves of successive Bills to tackle organised crime, but we should be looking at targeted policing.  In Limerick, effective policing methods have resulted in a reduction in gangland crime, particularly in this visible type of crime.  A sub-committee of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality is looking at the issue and I hope, when it has reported, that we will have a debate in this House on policing methods, including the policing of organised crime.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012092500004#C00200","speaker":"1148","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348580700,"counter":13,"content":"<p>On the front of today's edition of <i>The Irish Times<\/i>, it is reported that a top level report has urged a merger of Trinity College and UCD.  It states the report was prepared without consultation with the colleges themselves and the panel worked solely on the basis of a portfolio of information and statistics about Irish higher education.  The chairman of the group states modestly on his website that he was once the rector magnificus of a Dutch university, a university ranked 159 places behind Trinity College on the QS index, 83 places behind on the <i>Times Higher Education<\/i> index, and ranked only 11th among Dutch universities.  The University of Aarhus is mentioned, and we are also ahead of it.<\/p><p>  This follows the Hunt report, which brought in an American, whose college is ranked 61 places behind TCD, and involved a Finnish university ranked 245 places behind Trinity.  I welcome the interest of the Leader in these matters and the fact the Minister for Education and Skills is due to come to the House, but could I ask for that visit to be facilitated?  The mischief-making by the Higher Education Authority, HEA, against those who do the work in Irish universities has got to stop.  I will give the HEA some information.  Senators Bacik and Norris and I represent some 90,000 graduates in 130 countries, our external examiners report all the time on the high standards of our degrees and school leavers have made us the number one choice.  Oxford, Cambridge, Harvard, Princeton and Yale take our best people into their graduate schools and there is a low rate of unemployment among the other graduates.<\/p><p>  It is about time the Minister got a grip on the Higher Education Authority for publishing such shoddy work with such damaging consequences for Irish education.  We are here to serve this country and we will continue to do so splendidly.  We have had enough slipshod analysis by people who never talked to anyone who works in the lecture halls.  I estimate 140 alleged experts have been flown into this country to report on Irish education and they have neither attended nor given a lecture.  The rector may have been magnificus but how come his college was not?  We rank higher and we will defend that.  If the Higher Education Authority continues to attack us, we have one old slogan - no surrender - and we will say it to those people.

It was especially horrific that they were carried out in the presence of young children.  We can just imagine the long-lasting damage that will cause vulnerable young people.  We need a debate on organised crime.  It is obvious that, in the main, organised crime in this country is linked to the drugs trade.  We all know of the many lives being destroyed and the significant health issues and costs to our health service.  There are murders almost every week and we are all aware of suicides because of pressures put on people to pay drug related debts.  There is a major crisis related to organised crime.  We must consider whether our sentencing regime is adequate.  We must see whether the Criminal Assets Bureau is as effective as we would like in confiscating the proceeds of organised crime.<\/p> <p>I would like to know if the Revenue Commissioners are doing their job in ensuring those people are tax compliant and not benefiting from the proceeds of organised crime.

We have witnessed many murders, none more brutal that the one in Sligo where somebody sitting in his home was tied up, beaten and left to die for a number of days.  It shows a lack of fear among criminals that this crime took place yards from both the regional Garda headquarters and the seat of law and order, the courthouse, and near my own office.  The victim was respected and he was no different from people in all our communities who could be killed in this manner.  This crime shows a lack of respect for the law and that there is no respect for human life.  Clearly, successive Governments, including the current one, have failed in their reaction to crimes of this nature.  I am sure every Member received an e-mail from Australia where somebody has made a suggestion about offering a reward for information about the crime.  When it suits us, we can incarcerate people such as Malcolm MacArthur for 30 years for a heinous crime, but, as we have witnessed in recent days, people known to be involved in murder, drugs and other criminal activity seem to only have been in jail for a few years before being released for crimes that could be said to have been more serious.<\/p><p>Clearly, our justice system is floundering.  I do not believe the courts and the Garda are being provided with the resources they require to prevent people from carrying out such heinous and brutal crimes and, for that reason, and without taking from the important points that have been made, this issue should be at the top of our agenda today.  When one considers the lack of respect for human life with five people cut down over the past number of days without us taking the appropriate action, it is important that we debate the issues as a matter of the utmost urgency with a view to introducing emergency measures and resources for the Garda and the other authorities to ensure some level of fear can be injected into these criminals who are clearly holding the State to ransom.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012092500006#E00200","speaker":"1149"},{"type":"speech","time":1348581000,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I would like to raise the issue of safety on farms in light of the recent tragic accident involving the Spence family in County Down.  While I acknowledge some of the circumstances in this case were unique, we cannot get away from the fact that we need to examine the issue of slurry and farm safety.  I understand the difficulties that arise in regard to slurry are a consequence of the crust of the slurry being broken and the agitation process commencing.  It can be highly dangerous for those in close proximity if the noxious fumes are allowed to linger and they are not diluted by a strong wind.  The reliance on wind and other factors for safety is an archaic discipline and it is not particularly suited to modern farming practices.  We need to examine ideas for dealing with this silent killer.  It is imperative that the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine be asked to summon the necessary chemical experts to report on the potential for the development of a chemical that might go some way towards breaking up the slurry and relieving the farmer and his family of having to engage in the highly dangerous agitation process or to explore the possibility of developing an alarm mechanism that would alert people in the vicinity when the slurry's fumes are at their most potent.  In the circumstances, I also request that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine come to the House to debate this issue and to allow Members to contribute their thoughts and ideas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012092500006#E00300","speaker":"1173"},{"type":"speech","time":1348581000,"counter":18,"content":"<p>A consultation paper on the future of the Seanad is due to be published later.

While Members have debated this issue previously, they should consider it again because it has been some time since they did so.  However, there are concerns in this regard.  When the addition of fluoride to drinking water was made mandatory, it was done so based on scientific evidence.  However, that was quite some years ago and a number of reports from both the United States and Europe now suggest it may not be as favourable as was thought and the benefits derived from it may be outweighed by the disadvantages.  There is expertise in this House on this issue and I am sure Senator Crown, who is sitting beside me, has views on it because one suggestion is that fluoride is carcinogenic, while others still maintain the benefits far outweigh those concerns.  I make this point because this is precisely the sort of topic Members should debate in this Chamber, not necessarily immediately but some time within the next few weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012092500006#E00400","speaker":"1145","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348581600,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I join previous speakers in raising the heinous crimes that have occurred in recent days.

The most worrying aspect is people in Ireland are becoming somewhat desensitised to crimes of this nature.  I am happy to state I remember a time when murders and crimes of this type were really unusual and rare and it is of huge concern that something of a lack of respect for human life is entering our society.  Huge concern does not even cover it.  However, in the recent past the Garda has made many strides to combat organised and gangland crime in particular.  I note the Garda representatives speaking on radio today genuinely are upset and disappointed by these recent crimes.  It is to be hoped they are coincidental and are not linked in any way.  While one must ensure the Garda has the resources, it can happen that these were coincidental heinous crimes.  In any case, I would welcome a debate on the issue.

I have been requesting a debate on youth unemployment since last December with the relevant Minister.  I have asked for such a debate at least five times without proposing or pressing an amendment to the Order of Business.  Each time, I have been told I would be facilitated but nearly a year later, with youth unemployment rates as high as ever, this House still has not had the chance to quiz the relevant Minister on her policy.<\/p><p>Senator Bacik mentioned an announcement made yesterday.

The closest Members got to an indication regarding this plan moving forward was detail on a meeting she intended to hold in February next year to push the plan.  I consider this to be grossly unacceptable given that thousands more people will have emigrated.  This government by announcement or by reading things in the newspaper is not good enough, especially as I have asked numerous times for the Minister to come into this House to discuss the issue.

They are depraved.

The Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors issued a statement this morning in which, I glean from the subtext, it more or less pleaded with the Minister for Justice and Equality to ensure there would be no further reductions in Garda resources.  I know that each time the Garda calls for more resources, the then Minister states unlimited resources will be provided and that there are sufficient and adequate resources in place.  It is obvious that there are not.  If the trend is to have a number crunching exercise encompassing the reduction in the number of Garda personnel and the closure of Garda stations, with the Department believing this does not have an adverse social impact, the officials are living in cloud-cuckoo-land.<\/p><p>As Senator MacSharry stated in his proposed amendment to the Order of Business, it is incumbent on the Minister for Justice and Equality to appear before this House.

The murders are not only gangland murders because the Sligo murder is not such a crime.  I commiserate with all those who have suffered as a result of this.<\/p><p>To reiterate the words of Senator Leyden, there are people who know who carried out these crimes.

It is unacceptable that this thuggery continues, where people are just gunned down in broad daylight in front of children on the main streets of our cities and towns.  I am sure the Cathaoirleach remembers a time when there was a thing called internment in this country.  If the Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence was to recommend the introduction of internment to deal with the current problem, I would be the first to support him.  I would like the Leader to convey to the Minister that if he and the Garda believe primary legislation is required to deal with this thuggery on our streets, I am sure Seanad \u00c9ireann would be quite happy to facilitate the initiation of such legislation in this House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012092500014#N00600","speaker":"1158"},{"type":"speech","time":1348583700,"counter":70,"content":"<p>I also thank the Donegal team, which has made my colleague, Senator Harte, very happy and will probably keep him happy until Christmas.  I also support Senator Kelly's call for a debate on the property tax but my comments relate to the other end of the property spectrum - that of homelessness.  I bring to the attention of colleagues the 2011 census results on homelessness which show that 3,808 people are homeless, 64 of whom are living on the streets.  While that is an improvement on the previous census, there are question marks around the methodology.  It should be brought to everyone's attention that 498 of these people are children.<\/p><p>I ask the Leader to bring to the Chamber the Minister of State with responsibility for housing.  It has been shown that homelessness can be prevented in respect of the majority who are homeless.  As the Government supports the Housing First approach, I ask the Leader to suggest to the Minister of State that she tell this House the measures being taken under the Housing First approach and the resources being applied to that programme.<\/p><p>Half of those enumerated as homeless were in the labour force.<\/p> <p>That raises the significant issue of rent supplement cuts.

I welcome the youth guarantee scheme proposed by the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, which is aimed at directing those under 25 years of age into education, training or employment.  I would like the scheme extended to those under 30 years of age.  The Minister is appearing at the Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection at 10 a.m., which is a good place to ask questions of the Minister.  I intend to focus on the issue there.<\/p><p>My question to the Leader is on the hullabaloo around allowances.  Everybody was aghast at the weekend as to the reason the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, could cut only one of 1,100 allowances.  I ask the Leader to invite the Minister to the House because we need to ask him what went wrong.  Mr. David Begg has said that some allowances should go.  We must be independent as a Government and cannot expect to be directed by certain groups.  We all know that in politics we are at risk of that but there is a robust case for some allowances to be directed into core pay, for example, the allowance for a principal teacher is an addition to the core pay of a teacher.  However, there are some ridiculous allowances.  We are facing huge cuts to services in the budget and we do not want a two-tier society. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012092500015#O00200","speaker":"1131"},{"type":"speech","time":1348584300,"counter":73,"content":"<p>Is the Senator seeking a debate on the issue?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012092500015#O00300","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1348584300,"counter":74,"content":"<p>I am seeking a debate that will support a productive culture.

It is a matter of concern.  However, as pointed out by the Senator, Bank of Ireland is a majority private-owned bank and must be run on a commercial basis; the State owns 15%.  The Government has targeted assistance measures at protecting the homes of those who are facing real difficulties in paying their mortgages, as I have outlined previously.  Rising mortgage rates remain one of the biggest challenges facing the country.  The Government has outlined its five part response to assist those in mortgage arrears.<\/p> <p>It involves providing comprehensive advice and assistance for those in mortgage difficulty, introducing innovative new measures to deal with debt outside formal judicial bankruptcy, rebalancing personal insolvency legislation to strike a fairer balance between debtor and creditor, introducing measures to assist families to stay in their homes, if possible, and challenging the banks to live up to their responsibilities in the crisis through the speedy roll-out of their own range of forbearance measures.  When the Personal Insolvency Bill is brought to this House - it is currently before the D\u00e1il - we will have the opportunity to discuss the very important matters raised by Senator Darragh O'Brien.<\/p><p>Senators Bacik, Reilly and Healy Eames raised the European youth guarantee.  Senator Reilly also sought a debate on youth unemployment.  We have had a number of debates on job creation but the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, will be in the House on 18 October, as I mentioned last week.  Matters relating to youth unemployment relevant to her Department can be addressed to the Minister during the debate on that date.<\/p><p>Senators Bacik, MacSharry, Leyden, Moloney, Mooney, Conway, O'Keeffe and others raised the gangland killings and the murder of the elderly gentleman in Sligo.  These brutal events have shown the savage disregard some people have for human life.  The Garda is determined to do everything possible to bring the evil perpetrators to justice.  Like other Senators, I call on anybody who might be able to help in any way to contact the Garda.  The Minister for Justice and Equality is in ongoing contact with the Garda Commissioner about all aspects of serious crime and the Garda will continue to bear down heavily on the activities of those involved in gangland crime.  That is clear from the series of recent operations launched by the Garda against criminal gangs and the many drug seizures that have taken place in recent weeks.  The Minister and the Government will continue to support the Garda in every way possible in counteracting this evil menace in our society.<\/p><p>While recently enacted legislation underpinning the State's response to organised crime has been fully utilised by the Garda, the Minister has given a commitment to keep under review the question of whether improvements can be made which would render it more effective.  In particular, he has requested his Department to review the operation of the organised crime provisions in the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009 to see if they can be strengthened.  He has made it clear to the Garda Commissioner that he is open to considering any change in the law which the Garda believes would be helpful in tackling these activities.<\/p><p>Despite these shocking events, we should remember that every week the Garda is successfully bringing people involved in gangland activities before the courts and securing convictions, and that a substantial number are serving sentences in prison.  That should not be forgotten.  The Garda is devoting all the necessary resources to these investigations and disrupting gangland crime.  Despite the constraints on the public finances, substantial Garda resources remain in place and must be seen in the context of the programme of real reform which is being delivered in An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na under the Croke Park agreement.  The Minister has full confidence in the Garda Commissioner and the members of the force in continuing the delivery of this reform, to provide for more effective front-line policing to investigate and detect heinous crimes such as these.<\/p><p>People have also spoken about the punishment fitting the crime.  I could not agree more with them.  Recently we saw the case involving drugs activity off the coast of Ireland in which one of the perpetrators was sentenced to 28 years in prison.  That is the type of sentence which I believe should be handed down to such perpetrators.<\/p> <p> In response to Senators Barrett and Cullinane on the Higher Education Authority report, I look forward to reading it when it is published, which I hope will be soon.  I agree with Senator Cullinane about the reports on Waterford and the south east.  Expert reports have been commissioned on several occasions and Waterford Institute of Technology has jumped through all the hoops, but every time the bar is raised.  That must be borne in mind when these reports are published.  There are universities that in the past vigorously opposed the raising of Waterford Institute of Technology to university status.  There must be balance in this debate.<\/p><p>Senator Mullins and many other Senators raised the issue of organised crime.  I will try to get the Minister to come to the House to debate the matter.<\/p><p>Senator Quinn raised the consultation document to be published today on the future of the Seanad.  I am sure it will make for good night-time reading for all Members.<\/p><p>On the fluoridation of water, things have changed over the years.  I will try to get the relevant Minister to come to the House to discuss the issue soon.<\/p><p>Senator Reilly mentioned youth unemployment, an issue I have addressed.  We will have the Minister in the House to discuss the topic.<\/p><p>Senator Whelan asked about teachers being transferred in County Laois.  This is happening in many counties.  We will have the Minister for Education and Skills in the House soon and those matters can be addressed then.<\/p><p>Senator Colm Burke asked about the backlog of legislation in the Attorney General's office.  The office is under tremendous pressure because the Government wishes to bring in a lot of legislation but I will bring the matter to the attention of the Government Whip.  On the Health Service Executive (Governance) Bill that is being brought to the Seanad tomorrow, I assure the Senator that the debate on it will not be guillotined.  I propose spokespersons be given 12 minutes and all other Senators eight minutes on that subject.  If there are Members still offering at the end of the allocated time, I will adjourn the debate and we can continue the Second Stage debate next week.  This is important and we have had requests from many Members to deal with health issues in the House.  This is the opportunity to address those concerns.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012092500015#O00700","speaker":"1130","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348584900,"counter":80,"content":"<p>Is the senior Minister at the Department of Health coming in to take that Bill?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012092500017#Q00200","speaker":"1139"},{"type":"speech","time":1348584900,"counter":81,"content":"<p>I am not aware which Minister is coming in, but I assure the Senator there will be a Minister in the House to deal with that important legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012092500017#Q00300","speaker":"1130"},{"type":"speech","time":1348584900,"counter":82,"content":"<p>They are displaying confidence in their colleagues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012092500017#Q00400","speaker":"1146"},{"type":"speech","time":1348584900,"counter":83,"content":"<p>Senator Crown asked about waiting list times for those awaiting specialist treatment.

I emphasise the Government's continued commitment to promoting respect for human rights and equality of opportunity in Irish society.  Tolerance of homophobic bullying is simply not compatible with respect for the intrinsic dignity of each human being.<\/p><p>Good humoured, if sometimes robust, teasing and banter between colleagues, classmates and team mates are part of the culture of modern Ireland.  It has an important place in social interaction, in building camaraderie and friendships.  It can nudge us out of depression, help us see the funny side of situations, think more optimistically and can add enormously to the quality of life.  There is, however, another darker side.  Without good will, empathy or respect for others, what seemingly starts off as banter can quickly turn sour.  To put this in context, the ground-breaking 2009 survey of Irish lebian, gay, bisexual and transgender, LGBT, people, &quot;Supporting LGBT Lives&quot;, found that to avoid being threatened or called abusive names by work colleagues, almost one in ten respondents had missed work.<\/p><p>Bullying can be insidious.  The dividing line between acceptable and unacceptable behaviour is often a fine one.  This is a question to which the Oireachtas has given careful consideration.  In laws enacted by these Houses, we have defined bullying as repeated inappropriate behaviour, direct or indirect, whether verbal, physical or otherwise, conducted by one or more persons against another or others, and which could reasonably be regarded as undermining the individual's right to dignity.  In the work environment, an isolated incident may be an affront to dignity but, as a once-off incident, is not considered to be bullying.  I should stress, however, that it can he harassment.  Harassment, in equality law, is any form of unwanted conduct related to any of the discriminatory grounds, such as gender or sexual orientation, which has either the purpose or effect of violating a person's dignity and of creating an environment for the person that is intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive.  Such conduct may consist of spoken words, actions or gestures. It may also consist of the production, display or circulation of written words, pictures or other material.<\/p><p>These are powerful definitions.  They make it quite clear that certain kinds of behaviour are totally unacceptable in law.  This is not because of any concerns of political correctness.  Such kinds of behaviour are unacceptable precisely because they are harmful, both to the individuals targeted and to wider society.  This point should by now be beyond dispute.<\/p><p>We know that bullying and harassment cause harm.  If Senators are not familiar with the 2008 &quot;Supporting LGBT Lives&quot; study, I urge them to read it.  For the most vulnerable, this research showed heightened levels of psychological distress arising from stigmatisation and harassment, leading to significant levels of self-harm and thoughts of suicide.  Being physically threatened or attacked, or experiencing homophobic bullying in schools, were identified as risk factors for those who attempted suicide.  Recent research from the United States goes further, and suggests identity-based bullying, such as homophobic bullying, impacts more severely on the victim than other forms of bullying.<\/p> <p>It is quite clear in the employment context that bullying impacts on health and safety.  Harassment on the ground of sexual orientation or gender identity is also a form of discrimination and as such is prohibited.  A workplace in which bullying and harassment are tolerated and allowed to continue is neither a safe nor a productive environment for any of the persons working there.  In other areas of public life, such as in accessing health care, education, transport, clubs and sports, harassment on the grounds of sexual orientation or gender identity is also prohibited under the Equal Status Act.<\/p><p>There are means in law of pursuing complaints and seeking redress where a person has suffered bullying or harassment.  We are strengthening these mechanisms with the forthcoming merger of the Equality Authority and Irish Human Rights Commission and the formation of the new workplace relations service, which will incorporate the Equality Tribunal.  These new structures will be simpler and easier for members of the public to find and to deal with, and will provide more effective means of enforcing decisions.<\/p><p>I would like to focus, however, on preventive measures.  Combating homophobic bullying and harassment successfully requires action on a number of levels.  It starts with a recognition that a problem exists.  The key to this has to be education, which extends into every facet of public life from school to work to community activities.  In this regard, I cannot overstate the value of the persistent advocacy of NGOs representing LGBT people and their generosity in sharing their knowledge and skills.  I refer to one example, a short video from BeLonGTo encouraging young people to support their LGBT friends called &quot;Stand Up! Don't stand for homophobic bullying&quot;, which is currently the most viewed video posted online by an Irish charity with more than 1 million views.  This also features in the first UN global campaign to tackle homophobic bullying, which serves to demonstrate the universal application and importance of this message.<\/p><p>Debates in public foras such as today's, and last May's D\u00e1il debate on bullying in schools, also play an important part in normalising discussion of matters related to sexual orientation and, in particular, informing the public about the issue of homophobia.  It is a matter for us, as public representatives, to promote respect for the rule of law and to challenge breaches of human rights as we see them, to do our utmost to encourage the businesses, employers, schools and voluntary groups in our communities and to take simple and practical steps to embed respect for all persons in the way their staff, customers or members interact.<\/p><p>What are these steps?  For businesses, they start with taking note of two codes of practices, on bullying and on harassment and sexual harassment, respectively.  It is a matter of great credit to the Equality Authority that we have had a statutory code of practice on harassment and sexual harassment in the workplace since 2002.  This code was updated earlier this year and it is a powerful tool for employers who want to get things right.  Advice and support on giving effect to the code is available to them from the Equality Authority.  Moreover, a practical guide for employers on lesbian, gay and bisexual diversity in the workplace is available from GLEN, having been developed with support from the Equality Authority and others.  In addition to tackling workplace bullying and harassment, this involves building a culture of respect in the organisation, recruiting and selecting fairly, reviewing terms and conditions of employment, and managing performance fairly . Community and voluntary groups, sports clubs and associations are encouraged to develop equal status action plans.  The education sector, in post-primary schools in particular, has seen a sustained focus over the past decade on tackling bullying.  Considerable work has been done by State agencies and NGOs such as the Gay + Lesbian Equality Network, GLEN, and BeLonGTo.<\/p><p>Most recently, the anti-bullying forum established last May by the Minister for Education and Skills brought together a range of experts, support groups and representatives of the schools sector to explore ways of tackling bullying in schools.  The outcomes, recommendations and submissions from this forum are assisting the dedicated working group set up by the Minister to consider further actions required to tackle bullying in schools, including homophobic bullying, cyber bullying and racist bullying, in particular.  A key element in dealing with the problem of bullying is having a school culture of awareness of the seriousness of the issue and having in place a whole school approach to dealing with it.<\/p> <p> Anti-bullying policies work best where the entire school community, including school management, authorities, staff, students and parents all support and adhere to them.  None of these measures on their own will eliminate completely homophobic bullying but used consistently and effectively, they can and will demonstrate such behaviour is unacceptable in a civilised society and has adverse consequences for bullies and their employers.  We must now seek to address how we can deepen the impact of the measures that already are in place, as well as strengthening the culture of awareness in schools and businesses.  I look forward to hearing the debate today, which always is both interesting and informed.  There may be a question and answer session later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012092500019#W00200","speaker":"982","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348585500,"counter":108,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.  I welcome both her contribution and that Members specifically are debating homophobic bullying today.  Although they have had debates in the past on mental health and bullying in general, as the Minister of State has pointed out, while all young people are at risk of bullying and intimidation in schools, young lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender, LGBT, people experience far higher incidences in this regard.  Bullying at school is a huge risk factor for self-harm and suicide.  The research presented to the Department's forum on bullying by the Gay + Lesbian Equality Network, GLEN, and BeLonGTo shows the stark reality in this regard, which is that 27% of LGBT young people have self-harmed, 50% of those under 25 have thought seriously about ending their own lives and 20% of those under 25 have attempted suicide.  This is the stark reality of the issue under discussion today.  Bullying of any sort directed at any victim is designed to cause hurt and fear and to make the other person feel small.  However, in the case of homophobic and biphobic bullying, it is also designed to make the other person ashamed of who he or she is and who he or she loves.  Fear in this regard means that over generations, many young people have gone in and out of schools feeling miserable and afraid on a daily basis.  Moreover, fear they might be bullied has led to many people being afraid to reveal their true identity while at school on something as core as who they have fallen in love with and for this experience to carry on with them for a long time thereafter, as well as to make LGBT people invisible, not just in schools but in many parts of wider society as a whole.<\/p><p>It is welcome that much work has been done in recent years.  The Minister of State rightly recognised the leadership GLEN and BeLonGTo have shown on this issue.  It also is fair to recognise the teacher unions and management bodies have shown great leadership on this issue by coming together as a broad coalition and developing guidelines for schools.  This sent out a message from the higher levels of the teacher unions and management bodies that they take seriously and seek the engagement of their members with the issues of diversity and tackling discrimination and prejudice, which is important.  While it is good that such guidelines are in place, as with any policy the key issue is implementation and making sure they make a real difference on the ground.  I welcome the participation of GLEN and BeLonGTo in the Department of Education and Skill's group examining the issue of bullying.  I understand good work is being done there and the group is examining homophobic bullying in the context of prejudice in general because it is no different, no less ugly and no less harmful than are racism or discrimination against people with disabilities and should be seen in that context.  At the same time, it is important to make a distinction in respect of homophobic bullying, in that one should introduce it in the overall context of discrimination but should have specific strategies to deal with it.  A large part of that strategy concerns educating young people on diversity and difference, which can be complicated work.  It is known from research to which teachers have provided feedback that many teachers feel awkward about this issue.  I refer to teachers who would like to take a positive role but who are unsure about how to address it.<\/p> <p>It is important that we equip them to do that.  Bullying is one extreme but, of course, it must be seen in the context of the broader mental health agenda and the Minister of State's own brief.  This is because positive mental health is important, as is teaching young people how to look after themselves and have the courage to seek help if they are worried before they end up depressed or harm themselves and teaching everybody to look out for each other.  Prevention is always better than ending up with victims and having to have a disciplinary policy.  <\/p><p>It is important that we have a way of teaching young people about the differences between different LGBT identities.  I visited the Liberal Democrats' conference in Brighton over the weekend.  I had the privilege of attending a session that its LGBT group and the British organisation, Stonewall, ran on homophobic bullying.  They are dealing with the same issues as us.  It is the same in other European countries from which we can learn.  One thing that came across quite strongly was that when we are dealing with homophobic bullying, we must be careful not to phrase the debate as being either heterosexual or homosexual - there are so many different identities.  Bisexual young people often feel alienated by that and a different approach is needed with transgender young people, which must be backed up by the overall State response to gender recognition.  It is all very well to give a message in schools but what if we are not supporting it outside?  <\/p><p>In that context, I refer to section 37(1) of the Employment Equality Act.  We debated it here a number of months ago and there was support on all sides of the House for it to be changed.  I do not know if the Minister of State will get an opportunity to speak again but perhaps she could speak to me afterwards to update me on what progress, if any, has been made in that regard.  Again, it is all very well to teach young people that everybody is equal but if their teachers and role models are not equal and people are not treated with respect in the workplace, what message does that send out?  It is contradictory and I hope progress has been made on that because it is urgent.  <\/p><p>In that context, I also mention marriage equality.  Again, all of this is so important in this broader context if we are going to truly recognise and celebrate diversity and genuinely recognise everybody for who they are and the value of their relationships.  The reason young LGBT people are uncomfortable about who they are or are scared to admit who they are is not just because of their peers in the classroom but about the broader messages they get from society.  It is long past time that we recognised that every committed relationship should be regarded with the same level of respect and recognition.  <\/p><p>I think I have covered all the main points.  I am slightly disorganised because I have just come back from a conference last night.  I wanted to make the point that the issue should be seen in the broader context of mental health.  I know the Minister of State recognised it in her contribution but I would stress the importance of peer groups.  The Stand Up! video was incredible.  This short piece presents messages, not just about homophobic, biphobic or transphobic bullying, but about bullying in general and teaching all our young people to stand up for their friends.  It promotes the idea that if one sees a friend being isolated and discriminated against, one backs him or her up and makes the bully feel like he or she is the idiot and the one who should be isolated and ashamed.<\/p><p>In addition to having strategies for teachers, boards of management and different groups, it is so important that we equip young people with the skills to look after themselves and others and that we bring parents into that debate.  It is also important that we ensure that when we have a more detailed strategy and, crucially, an implementation plan for dealing with homophobic bullying in schools, it is a whole-community approach.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012092500019#Y00200","speaker":"1154","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348585500,"counter":110,"content":"<p>I also welcome the Minister of State to the House.  We are all aware of her commitment to and support for LGBT issues.<\/p><p>  In a message delivered at a UN global consultation on homophobic bullying in Rio de Janeiro last December, the UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, referred to homophobic bullying as follows:<ul>This is a moral outrage, a grave violation of human rights and a public health crisis.  It is also a loss for the entire human family when promising lives are cut short.<\/ul><\/p> <p>He called on governments throughout the world to act to protect lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender young people.  Also in December, the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights released a groundbreaking report on the human rights of LGBT people.  Therefore, it is clear that the issue of homophobic bullying is one that is of high importance at an international level.  What exactly is it?  It can be defined as any hostile or offensive action against lesbians, gay males, bisexuals or transgender people, or those perceived to be lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender.  These actions might be verbal, physical or emotional harassment, including degrading comments, name calling, gestures, taunts, insults or jokes.  An excellent example of this was contained in the Stand Up! video which hit home succinctly but got the point across.  It can also include offensive graffiti, humiliating, excluding, tormenting, ridiculing or threatening to refuse to work or co-operate with others because of their sexual orientation or identity.  They are terms that can be used for bullying in every sense.  It is good that today we are concentrating on homophobic bullying and looking at it in context and in isolation.<\/p><p>While most adults in Ireland can be open about their sexual orientation, the reality for young people is very different.  The teenage years are a challenging time for everybody but for those who think they might be gay, lesbian or bisexual it can be even more bewildering.  In the past, homophobic bullying was viewed as not too serious, a bit of banter or teasing among youngsters that took place in the schoolyard, youth club or in the sports ground.  However, it is recognised that this type of bullying is not only harmful, it is costing young people their lives.  <\/p><p>The National Office for Suicide Prevention annual report 2009 showed that LGBT persons had shockingly high levels of suicidal behaviours.  This was clearly linked to the experiences of homophobic bullying.  The study found that 50% of LGBT young people under the age of 25 had seriously thought about ending their lives while a staggering 20% had attempted suicide.  The study also revealed that the majority of bullying was taking place in schools and up to one third of these young people had been subjected to homophobic comments from teachers.  As a former teacher, I found this shocking coming from those who are supposed to be teaching and leading.  It is important that adequate training is provided for them and that we are all singing from the same hymn sheet. <\/p><p>International research has shown that for many, homophobic bullying at school can result in long-term social, emotional and psychological effects.  Those who are bullied at school can become fearful of their peer group and isolate themselves from them.  The young person who is repeatedly bullied at school can experience anxiety, loss of confidence, loneliness and depression which can result in problems such as punctuality, deteriorating academic attainment, poor attendance, truancy, dropping out, mental health problems and the idea of suicide.  The findings are worrying and upsetting.  In the review of the junior certificate, I hope subjects such as SPHE may be given a firm footing on the curriculum and that adequate training for SPHE is provided for the teachers concerned.<\/p><p>Equality legislation protects the rights of everyone in the State at places of work or places of leisure, transport and health care.  All areas of our daily lives should be free from discrimination on grounds of gender, marital status, family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability and race.  Specifically, the Education (Welfare) Act 2000 requires schools to prepare a code of behaviour that specifies the standards of behaviour to be observed by students.  All second level schools are required to have a number of policies in place, including one on bullying.  <\/p><p>In August 2006, in order to reduce the administrative burden on schools, the Department of Education and Skills issued a template anti-bullying policy.  This template built on previously issued guidelines on countering bullying in schools and included references to homophobic bullying.<\/p> <p>This was a major step forward in breaking the silence and invisibility that often surrounds homophobic bullying in Irish second level schools, even at a policy level.  Research carried out in the schools has established that while anti-bullying policies, campaigns and initiatives are working very well in most schools, there is an obvious reluctance on the part of many schools to be specific on the issues of homophobic bullying.  This must be changed urgently.  A school ethos cannot be rooted in the presumption that everybody in the school is heterosexual.  School leaders will have to challenge such presumptions by making explicit reference to LGBT issues and providing relevant resources and other materials for use in the classrooms and around the school.  This should remind everybody, including the staff, that although often invisible, people who identify as LGBT are valued members of the school community.  What is most important is that no member of staff and no parent or student is left with any ambiguity in terms of where the school, including the trustees of the school, stand on the issues of homophobic bullying.<\/p><p>As recently as May last, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair\u00ed Quinn, established a forum to explore ways of tackling bullying in schools.  Experts, support groups and representatives of the school sector were brought together to explore how best to tackle bullying in schools and to consider changes that might be required to existing practices.  The Minister also established a working group to address the issue of bullying in schools, including homophobic bullying, cyber bullying and racist bullying.  I welcome the fact that BeLonGTo and GLEN were both represented on this working group.  It was an important move.  The group is reviewing current measures and identifying priorities based on international research and the findings of the forum.<\/p><p>BeLonGTo was singled out for particular praise at the UNESCO global convention and in the Rio statement referred to earlier.  Its work was highlighted as good practice and was included as a positive response to homophobia in the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights report on LGBT human rights.  At the beginning of September BeLonGTo youth services unveiled LGBT Youth Mental Health Ireland, a project which specifically supports LGBT young people around the country to develop positive mental health.  The project, which was launched by the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, who has been a strong advocate for LGBT youth, obviously recognises the gravity of the situation and the need for support for vulnerable young people.<\/p><p>In my home town of Dundalk I have been involved with the group Dundalk Outcomers for the last two years.  I have been very impressed by its commitment to helping and supporting LGBT young people and giving them a chance to come out and be themselves.  It has run some excellent festivals over the last two summers.  This summer I attended some local events at which I was delighted to meet some former students of mine.  It was really encouraging to see how we have progressed along the path of acceptance, inclusivity and diversity.  However, we cannot afford to become complacent.  We must work and although we have come a long way, we must keep moving.<\/p><p>For most adults it is possible to be gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender in Ireland today, but for many young people daily homophobic bullying means it is still not okay.  Our challenge is to ensure that this generation of young LGBT people is cared for, accepted, included and supported in their life choices.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012092500019#Z00300","speaker":"1174","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348585500,"counter":113,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch.  It is very difficult to encapsulate in a single definition the scourge that is homophobic bullying, and the devastating impact it has on LGBT people, particularly young LGBT people.  Senator Moran cited the words of Ban Ki Moon which come close to describing it.  Mary Robinson has said that homophobic bullying continues to be a society wide issue, and a link between it and suicide sends a clear message that this trend must be reversed.<\/p><p>Everybody in this Chamber agrees that homophobic bullying is a very serious issue.  Like many, I am alarmed by the national and international studies that show homophobic bullying is endemic in schools.  However, it is also an area in which much dedicated and targeted work is being done, both at governmental and non-governmental levels.<\/p> <p>That does not mean we should be complacent; there is much more that needs to be done.<\/p><p>We should also be proud that Ireland is at the forefront internationally of efforts to eliminate homophobic and transphobic bullying from schools.  The working group on tackling bullying, including homophobic bullying, cyber bullying and racist bullying, established by the Minister for Education and Skills in May 2012, is due to publish its report in the coming months.  I commend the Leader for facilitating debates called for by Senators but, frustratingly, when preparing for today, I had to question the timeliness of the debate, and why we could not have waited for the report of the working group to be produced in order that we could debate its recommendations.  I say that as a Senator who wants us to have a debate, but it should be on the recommendations when they are produced.  Never one to waste a good opportunity, however, I will use this chance to say more about homophobic bullying.<\/p><p>A key objective of the working group is to help draft a roadmap towards the elimination of homophobic bullying from our schools and, as such, I will reserve my comments about how best to move forward until I have seen the report and heard from the Department about how it intends to implement the recommendations.  The Seanad has an important role to play there.<\/p><p>I hope the recommendations coming from the report of the working group speak of the need for effective structural changes in curriculum policy, in support services and in teaching practices.  The elimination of homophobic and transphobic bullying is an issue about which I feel strongly.  I was delighted to be a member of the National Youth Work Advisory Committee when it produced its guidelines for the youth sector in Ireland, &quot;Addressing Homophobia&quot; in 2010.  Tremendous work is also being done by NGOs and advocacy groups on behalf of LGBT young people in Ireland and I welcome the members of BeLonGTo and GLEN who are in the Visitors Gallery.<\/p><p>BeLonGTo is the national youth service for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender young people in Ireland.  In addition to providing vital nationwide youth work services, BeLonGTo runs a number of excellent and innovative initiatives.  The most recent is the LGBT mental health initiative, which the Minister of State launched earlier this month.  It is supported by the HSE's national office for suicide prevention, which I welcome, given the direct correlation between homophobic bullying and suicidal behaviour among LGBT young people.  BeLonGTo was behind the hugely effective &quot;Stand Up!&quot; video campaign, which had 1 million views on YouTube, the most successful Irish charity video ever.  I am not remotely surprised by this.  I stood up for Jen back in March and I will never forget the sadness I felt at having to do so but equally the sense of pride and empowerment I felt at being part of a movement standing united against homophobic and transphobic bullying.  I was greatly moved by it and I recommend any of my fellow Senators who have not yet seen it to look for the video on YouTube.<\/p><p>BeLonGTo should be very proud that its work in this area has been cited in a UN report as an example of good practice in this area and will be included in the UNESCO toolkit.  I also commend the work done by GLEN which has been centrally involved in the progress that has been made in recent years by the Department of Education and Skills and all the education partners in addressing LGBT issues in second level schools.<\/p><p>I would like to raise a deep concern I have about homophobic bullying and the fear of violence, discrimination and stigma felt by LGBT asylum seekers in Ireland.  While the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service does not provide figures for the number of LGBT refugees seeking asylum in Ireland, anecdotal evidence from groups working directly with asylum seekers, such as the Irish Refugee Council, points to an acute fear on the part of asylum seekers about disclosing their sexual orientation and gender identity at the screening stage, even when the impetus for fleeing their country of origin was homophobic persecution.  The Irish Refugee Council also has testimonies from LGBT asylum seekers about the immense stress they are under trying to conceal their sexual orientation and gender identities from fellow asylum seekers, with whom they are often sharing close living quarters in direct provision accommodation centres.<\/p> <p>A common experience about which I have heard on numerous occasions involves a gay man who has fled his native country in which homosexuality is both illegal and subject to active persecution by his peers sharing a room in direct provision accommodation with four other men from the same country who is terrified they will uncover his sexual orientation and that he will be subjected to attack and persecution in the short term and if returned to his country of origin, where word would no doubt spread, his life would be in jeopardy.  We have come far in many ways but these young men are being placed in accommodation where they have to continue to conceal their identity.  That means Ireland is going backwards to a time to which we do not want to return.  It must be ensured that support for protection against homophobic violence, discrimination and stigma are equally afforded to those living in direct provision.  All asylum seekers entering Ireland should receive training, awareness and orientation about a wide range of issues, including LGBT rights and the principles of non-discrimination in the State.  I encourage the Department of Justice and Equality to develop its work in this area, as further progress could be made.<\/p><p>I welcome the Minister of State's openness and look forward to the working group's report.  She will witness following the input of Senators to the debate that the Seanad has a role to play.  While I question the timing of the debate, it is a way for Members to stand up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012092500019#BB00200","speaker":"1171","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348585500,"counter":116,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and, as usual, she has relayed words of wisdom which are appreciated.  Bullying, particularly homophobic bullying, is a crime against humanity.  While it is a political issue, thankfully, it is not a party political issue.  There is unanimity across all political parties that this issue must be addressed and whatever steps must be taken to eradicate such bullying will be welcomed.  I come from a county where Phoebe Prince was a student before moving to America.  That was a high profile case of bullying and there was a sad case in County Leitrim last week, which was equally traumatic and tragic.  This also encompassed cyberbullying as well as bullying in general.  Bullying is a serious problem in our schools, especially with the advent of text messaging, Facebook and Twitter and other ways and means of perpetrating hurt against people and perpetrating acts that are not acceptable.  As a society, we all have to be vigilant against bullying.  Homophobic bullying questions someone's identity and makes him or her feel inadequate because of his or her identity.  I commend previous speakers because most of what I feel has been reflected in their contributions.<\/p><p>I also commend the NGOs in this area, particularly those represented in the Visitors Gallery such as GLEN and BeLonGTo.  The work they have done has paved the way to improvements.  There is legislative provision in place but, hopefully, this will be tightened up going forward.  I also await with interest the recommendations in the report of the working group set up by the Minister for Education and Skills.  Senator van Turnhout is correct in the sense that we are talking in a vacuum but I am confident that when the report is published, we will have another opportunity to debate this issue.  I will encourage the Leader to provide us with such an opportunity in light of the working group's recommendations.<\/p><p>We have all dealt with people who have suffered greatly as a result of homophobic bullying.<\/p> <p>I encountered a case recently in which a hearse pulled up at the home of a young gay person seeking his remains.  It was simply appalling stuff.  This is the level of intimidation that is going on in society.  As legislators, Members sometimes feel powerless because regardless of what legislation may be introduced, how can one prevent something like that from happening except by ensuring those responsible for it are held accountable?  Everyone has examples of such bullying and the examples to which Senator van Turnhout referred regarding people seeking asylum in Ireland certainly are important and such issues must be addressed with absolute urgency.  International experience is one thing but Ireland must take a lead.  It will hold the Presidency of the European Union during the first six months of 2013 and I hope it will lead the way in coming up with best practice in respect of legislation and dealing with such bullying.<\/p><p>As I stated, bullying is bullying and in ways, homophobic bullying is the same as &quot;ordinary&quot; bullying.  The only difference is it involves bullying based on identity and tries to make people feel their identity is in some way inadequate.  This must be addressed and I note a very interesting discussion took place at a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality at which the various NGOs made presentations.  Having spoken to joint committee members afterwards, it was considered to be a most informative experience.  On foot of the presentations given by the NGOs and the Oireachtas Members asking questions and discussing the issue, people came away from that experience much better informed than beforehand.  In fairness to the Government, this issue has been at the centre of the Minister of State's agenda.  She has quite happily attended or launched any initiative to which she has been invited and is in the House today because her attendance has been requested by Members.  This issue is a centre point of equality.  In this context, the merging of the Equality Authority and the Irish Human Rights Commission will bring a more focused and dedicated approach to dealing with all such issues, particularly those pertaining to equality and so on.<\/p><p>I look forward to the report and debating its recommendations and, more important, seeing a pathway to their implementation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012092500019#DD00200","speaker":"1158","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348585500,"counter":118,"content":"<p>I call Senator Reilly, who has ten minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012092500019#EE00200","speaker":"1164"},{"type":"speech","time":1348585500,"counter":119,"content":"<p>I did not know I was a spokesperson.

In that vein, I warmly welcome this debate and the opportunity for Senators to express their opposition to homophobic bullying in all forms, to propose some positive ideas on how to tackle the issue and to ensure the issue is high on the political agenda in order that tough anti-homophobic bullying measures and guidelines are put in place in workplaces and schools, where they are most sorely needed.  As other Members have noted, homophobic bullying can occur anywhere to people of any age and in any profession or walk of life.  It is not simply a matter for schools or businesses to deal with but rather is a matter for society as a whole and this important point must be remembered.<\/p><p>In common with other Members, I wish to focus in particular on homophobic bullying and its effect on young people.  In common with my colleagues, I acknowledge the excellent work being carried out by the Gay + Lesbian Equality Network, GLEN, and the BeLonGTo youth group which, as has been noted previously, has been running successfully the Stand Up! campaign, which has won praise from the United Nations for its quality.  I also commend and acknowledge the work of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, which has played a progressive role on this issue.<\/p> <p>It is not often we acknowledge the work being done in this area.  It is crucial this work continues and that we listen to the experiences and ideas of people, including parents, who work with young people.  Through my engagement with the youth organisation SpunOut, I have heard from young people who have experienced homophobic bullying at school that while there have been some improvements, it remains an extremely common issue in schools, which is worrying in this day and age.  While the positive moves of recent years must be commended, we may need to open up our thinking and to look at related issues in terms of how they impact on young lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender, LGBT, people in education.  <\/p><p>I take the opportunity to thank two people from SpunOut, Patrick and Christine, for sharing their experiences with me.  We can talk all day long in this House about issues but unless what we say is rooted in fact and real life experience, it will be irrelevant and will not help bring about progressive change.  Christine spoke to me about how sex education in school dealt solely with heterosexual sex.  The marginalising effect of this on young LGBT people needs to be considered.  Christine also spoke of her experience of emotional blackmail by another school girl who became aware of her sexuality.  While we have moved on, if the sexuality of a young school-going person is something that continues to stigmatised, we have a long way to go.  This must be recognised.<\/p><p>Another young person, Patrick, raised with me a number of important issues which he believes need to be acted upon, including that homophobic bullying must be stopped immediately it occurs.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, stated that bullying can be insidious and that the dividing line between acceptable and unacceptable behaviour is often a fine one.  While we do not tolerate a festering of racist behaviour or abuse, some teachers and adults are uncomfortable or lack the knowledge to engage with homophobic bullying in a direct manner.  This sense of discomfort needs to be addressed through education and positive peer pressure.  A school's ethos should have no bearing on its approach to homophobic bullying.  That is critical.  Homophobia should be considered as unacceptable as racism or sexism.  There should be no excuses for tolerating it.  Any teacher or adult in a position of authority who does not immediately intervene when homophobic bullying occurs is failing young people and should be told so.<\/p><p>We are all aware of the prevalence of mental ill health in this country, in particular among young people in recent years.  Bullying and being open about and dealing with one's sexuality can be a factor in this regard.  Homophobic bullying is, therefore, a specific issue that must be dealt with sensitively but unflinchingly.  I again commend the groups working to challenge homophobia, in particular those working with young people.  I appeal to the Government and others to continue working with these groups.  As I stated, we must be vigilant of homophobic bullying, ensure it remains on our agenda and is, where it occurs, constantly challenged.  Like Senator van Turnhout and others I look forward to discussing the recommendations of the working group.  I hope this is not just a once off debate cast into the chronicles in terms of what we have done.  Young LGBT people need to be at the centre of our thinking.  It is our voices rather than those of other interests that should provide guidance on this issue.  This issue must remain on our agenda.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012092500019#EE00800","speaker":"1155","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348585500,"counter":124,"content":"<p>I wish to share time with Senator Healy-Eames.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012092500019#FF00200","speaker":"1165"},{"type":"speech","time":1348585500,"counter":125,"content":"<p>Is the Senator sharing time equally?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012092500019#FF00300","speaker":"1164"},{"type":"speech","time":1348585500,"counter":126,"content":"<p>I will take four minutes, leaving two minutes for Senator Healy Eames.

I only became aware a number of hours ago that this issue was being discussed in the House today.  I would like to share my thoughts and observations on the subject matter with the Minister of State.<\/p><p>Homophobic bullying as a problem in schools is an issue which has only been explored since 2004.  We are all aware that society and in particular our youth, not alone in Ireland but worldwide, are experiencing many problems, including alcohol abuse, misuse of drugs, obesity and racism.  I do not foresee the problem of homophobia going away for a long time.  I am not necessarily sure if the efforts through education will make a major difference.  I note that 41% of teachers say that homophobic bullying is more difficult to deal with than is any other form of bullying in schools, the reason being their fear of also being targeted by the bullies.<\/p><p>I wanted to contribute to this debate because as a coach and mentor to many young boys and girls for a number of years I have dealt at first hand with victims of bullying, in particular young men.  They have told me of how at school they were called &quot;gay&quot;, &quot;queer&quot; or &quot;fags&quot;.  This type of slagging affects self-esteem and increases anxiety, often causing depression.  Those slagging do not necessarily always know they are being bullies.  However, bullying often becomes physical.  When, as I once witnessed, a young man is thrown through a glass door in a secondary school, resulting in his head being cut open and him having to be brought to hospital, that is homophobic bullying.  <\/p><p>Another young man whom I mentored was told when he tried to get into a nightclub that he could not go in because the bouncer at the door did not like his friend.  The bouncer turned to his friend and said: &quot;Get out of here you gay queer.&quot;  When the first young man defended himself and his friend to the bouncer, he was dragged into the nightclub, had his trousers pulled down below his waist and shoes taken from him and was brought into a dark room and beaten.  The Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na was called and the garda\u00ed believed the bouncer.  The young man was imprisoned in Kevin Street Garda station over night and had to eventually, after six months, plead guilty because he did not want to have to go to court.  What kind of homophobic bullying is that?<\/p><p>In another instance of which I am aware, a young man was travelling to town in a taxi with a male and two female friends.  They had not met each other for approximately three or four months over the summer.  When the taxi driver asked where they were going and they told him, he turned and called them &quot;queers&quot; and told them to get out of his taxi.  The young man took issue with this.  The taxi man stopped in the middle of the Stillorgan dual carriageway and told them to get out of the car.  When they did the young man slammed the door and told the taxi driver to go you know where.  The taxi driver got out of the car and beat up the young man.  I saw the photographs of the young man following that beating.  He had blood pouring down onto his chest.  The Garda was called, but garda\u00ed did nothing.  They provided no protection whatsoever for the young man concerned.  There are no rights for these type of victims and action will not be taken against the perpetrators of homophobic bulling.  <\/p><p>Young men and women are not only emigrating from this country because of economic difficulties and unemployment.  They are emigrating because of homophobic bullying.  I do not believe it will ever come to an end.  We must work hard with schools, sports clubs and society to try to educate people of the harm done physically and mentally as a result of homophobic bullying.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012092500019#FF00600","speaker":"1165"},{"type":"speech","time":1348585500,"counter":129,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Coghlan for sharing time with me.  I did not give notice to speak on this issue but decided to come to the House and contribute to the debate because of the pervasive and endemic affect which I believe homophobic bullying is having on our society.  In 2010, I compiled, with the Educational Research Centre, an Oireachtas education report on early school leaving.<\/p> <p>We picked groups of kids at risk of dropping out of school.  One of those groups were lesbian, homosexual and transgender youngsters.  I had the honour of interviewing some of the children and one interview with a boy sticks in my mind and is the reason I am speaking on this topic.  He was a kind and gentle 16 year old boy and his humanity remains with me.  It was very difficult for him to stay at school and he said that GLEN and BeLonGTo helped him.  His self-esteem had taken a beating and suicidal thoughts were common.  He said that physical education was particularly difficult for him, especially in the changing room.  We need to be alert to those areas and we need to give guidance to physical education teachers.  This is not a school problem but a societal problem.  I have a teenage son and I heard a group of his peers in a shop recently speak about homosexuality in a very negative way, saying that if they had sons who were homosexual, they would kill them.  It is not just coming from these fine young people, it is an attitudinal problem.  We need an information and promotional campaign in a positive way to promote tolerance of sexuality and acceptance of all sexuality.  This must be in people's faces in order that the issue is not spoken about in silent tones.  It is a wider issue than school and if we expect schools to solve it, we will fail.  We have a long way to go on this issue but it is helpful and healthy to have this debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012092500019#FF00700","speaker":"1131","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348585500,"counter":131,"content":"<p>I am pleased to have the opportunity to join in statements on this important issue.  We are all agreed on deploring homophobic bullying, which I regard as despicable behaviour.  The same applies to all bullying.  We can all endorse the comments made by the UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, when he declared that homophobic bullying is a moral outrage, a grave violation of human rights and a public health crisis.  It is also a loss for the entire human family when promising lives are cut short.<\/p><p>It is heartening that Ireland is seen as being to the forefront of efforts to eliminate homophobic bullying from schools.  It has also been one of the driving forces behind UNESCO's global good practice policy manual.  The Fianna F\u00e1il Party supports and welcomes the decision of the Minister for Education and Skills to address bullying through the forum on bullying and through the setting up of a working group on tackling bullying.  Bullying should be viewed in the context of a whole school approach to promoting mental health.  However, while all young people are at risk of being subjected to bullying, research shows that lesbian, gay and bisexual and transgender young people suffer far higher incidences of bullying behaviour and that teachers find it particularly hard to deal with homophobia.  In view of this, a specific strategy is required to address homophobic bullying.  According to GLEN, homophobic bullying has been documented as one of the most pervasive forms of bullying in Irish schools.  Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender young people experience bullying at a much higher rate than other young people.  Irish research shows that homophobic bullying is a significant causal factor in self-harm, suicide and other severe mental health difficulties.  Two in five Irish teachers find homophobic bullying more difficult to address than other forms of bullying.  Supporting LGBT Lives, a study funded by the HSE National Office for Suicide Prevention, found that among lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, 50% experienced verbal homophobic bullying, 40% were verbally threatened by fellow students, 25% were physically threatened by their peers and 34% heard homophobic comments from teachers.  The last statistic may go some way to indicating why two in five Irish teachers find homophobic bullying more difficult to address than other forms of bullying.<\/p><p>The Fianna F\u00e1il Party believes that, in addition to general measures to deal with and prevent bullying, a specific strategy is required to address homophobic bullying.  We must ensure that measures to prevent bullying and deal with incidents form part of an overall strategy to promote positive mental health among young people.  The focus should be on promoting young people's well-being.  It is essential the Department of Education and Skills updates its current bullying guidelines, which were introduced in 1993.  They must be updated to address racist bullying, homophobic bullying and cyber bullying, including the use of text messages and mobile phones in schools.  This should be an emphasis on the more subtle ways available in 2012, particularly Facebook.  The guidelines must be significant be strengthened so that schools are required to implement an anti-bullying programme.  The programme should involve the whole school community.  It seems that schools must have policies in place to address bullying and list clear actions that must be taken following breaches of the policies, schools can do as much or as little as they see fit in tackling bullying.  I agree with the position outlined by Professor Mona O'Moore of TCD in her presentation to the recent forum on bullying, that the definition of bullying in the 1993 guidelines must be updated as bullying is currently viewed as one or more individuals repeatedly targeting another.  Cyber bullying can involve just one damaging incident, which is sufficient to be defined as bullying; it may not be a repeated attack.  Schools need to be provided with proper training and support to implement the guidelines in order to take a more proactive approach to tackling bullying.  We face a challenge and the fight against prejudice and intolerance is never easy.  Those vices will always seek new outlets but with time and education we can overcome the challenge.  Let us look at how attitudes have changed in so many recent years.  For me and for the Fianna F\u00e1il Party, it is a challenge we are willing to meet.  I wish the Minister of State continued success with all her great work.  I am one of her biggest fans.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012092500019#GG00200","speaker":"1156"},{"type":"speech","time":1348585500,"counter":132,"content":"<p>I also welcome the Minister of State.  I recognise the good work of BeLonGTo, GLEN and the Union of Students in Ireland, which has a robust LGBT campaign.  We must bear in mind that bullying is only part of the treatment faced by LGBT people.  This discussion will take place in the wider context of other issues faced by LGBT people, particularly young LGBT people.  It is not commonly known that the age of 12 is the most common age when such people discover their LGBT identity.  At 16 years of age, they are most vulnerable to beginning to self-harm and 17 is the most common age to tell someone of their sexuality.  It is also the most vulnerable age for attempting suicide for the first time.  There is a significant issue in respect of treatment of LGBT young people.  The statistics are quite startling.  Some 50% of LGBT people under the age of 25 have seriously thought about ending their lives.  Some 20% of LGBT people under the age of 25 have attempted suicide at least once.  Homophobic bullying is a clear risk factor for self-harm and attempted suicide.<\/p> <p>It is important to note that the age of greatest vulnerability for LGBT people is between 12 and 17, which corresponds to the period of second level education.<\/p><p>The Minister of State has mentioned that we have put in place certain protocols to combat bullying and that we have introduced equality legislation, but the reality of the matter is that research has shown young LGBT people experience marginalisation and present with a higher incidence of drug and alcohol abuse.  In particular, they experience geographical isolation, and they also experience rejection among parents and family.  They live with secrecy and are more likely to become homeless, and they are more likely to remain homeless when they have experienced homelessness.  One of the most pressing issues is that LGBT people believe they have a lack of role models, although there has been an improvement in this regard.<\/p><p>We need to tackle the fact that LGBT people suffer from a feeling of invisibility in society, among other conditions.  We can talk about all the measures we have put in place to tackle homophobic bullying in schools but the reality is that if we do not deal with the kinds of societal norms we present to young people, we will never deal with it.  The kinds of people Senator Coghlan mentioned, who exhibit behaviour that is nothing short of that of animals, will never be tackled if we do not tackle social norms.  As long as we have curricula for schoolchildren that present Ladybird-style, Jane and Peter, or mum and dad types of norms and fail to present the kinds of relationships with which LGBT people can identify, we will never tackle their lack of self-respect and the attitudes of the kinds of people spoken about the Senator Coghlan.  If we do not regard the relationships between LGBT people as really equal in society \u2013 I am not a great believer in the equal but different attitude to legislation \u2013 the problem will continue to obtain.  We must tackle marriage equality, for example.  If we do not do so, there is very little point in saying all are equal and that we believe certain attitudes are reprehensible; if one believes in what one is saying, one should act upon it.  One should be judged on one's words and on what one is prepared to do.<\/p><p>Section 31 of the Education Act was referred to by Senator Power.  I raised this matter during the course of the debate thereon.  If we discover that amending section 31 cannot be achieved legislatively because it is repugnant to the Constitution, the only way to tackle the matter will be through constitutional reform.  If an LGBT young person does not see an LGBT teacher in his or her own school being treated as an equal, how can he or she believe he or she is also equal?  Ultimately, norms, codes and legislation are fine, but if we do not back them up with sincere, genuine equality, we will never tackle the attitudes about which Senator Coghlan spoke.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012092500019#GG00300","speaker":"1172","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348585500,"counter":134,"content":"<p>I am filling in for Senator Reilly and did not intend to speak this evening.  I am taking the opportunity to do so, however, because it is an important issue.  I welcome the Minister of State to the House and the fact that we are having a debate on this issue.  Many of the main points have been made.  The most obvious point we should make is that we must all offer leadership on this issue.  The first step the State and we, as legislators, should take is to ensure there is equal recognition for LGBT people.  This means full equality and that we must go beyond civil partnerships such that LGBT people will be allowed to marry and have equal rights in the same way as the rest of us.  If the State does not confer on its citizens equality, this is partly why many in society are not minded to regard people as equals and the reason they look at differences rather than equality.<\/p><p>The State has a great responsibility in this regard.  We should all promote equality.  All institutions in the State have a great responsibility.  I include the church, whose views and teachings on homosexuality are completely outdated and should change.  This is part of the problem.  When one considers that the church has control over many of our schools, which matter is being examined, is it any wonder that sexual education is what it is?  When views such as those of the Catholic Church are being expressed and when there is not full equality for LGBT individuals, is it no wonder that there is a very high level of homophobic bullying in schools and throughout society?<\/p><p>Everybody should begin by looking at himself or herself.  I would certainly raise my children by making sure they viewed people as equals and recognised and celebrated difference, be it in respect of people who come from different communities or people of a different sexuality, religion, race, creed or colour.  I would stress that we are all equal and all human beings.  If we start by promoting this ethos among our own children, it will be the best possible start we can give them.<\/p><p>Leaving aside our personal responsibilities as parents are citizens, as legislators we have a responsibility to ensure that we do the right thing.  I recognise that there have been some positive moves recently on civil partnership, but we still have a long way to go to ensure this State fully vindicates the rights of LGBT people.  While it is very welcome that we are having a very constructive debate in this House today, and that we are facing up to the reality that many people are being subjected to homophobic bullying, we must examine the practices of institutions, be they educational organisations or businesses, and those in workplaces.   We must also consider ourselves.  If we are not prepared to look at ourselves, we have no right to point the finger at other organisations.  I hope that, in the coming years, the Government, which is a year and a half into its term of office, will prioritise the need to ensure full and equal recognition for gay people in respect of marriage.  Once the State takes these steps, young people, especially, will realise that LGBT individuals are equal in the eyes of the State, and that this is how they should be viewed by everybody.  We must first look to ourselves and ensure we do the right thing as legislators.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012092500019#HH00200","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speech","time":1348585500,"counter":135,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, to the House and apologise for my being delayed.

Senator Zappone also attended the committee hearing.  I apologise for not having been here earlier.<\/p><p>I was one of the Senators who spoke on 17 May, the international day against homophobia and transphobia.  This was raised in the House.  I am delighted we are returning to the issue, specifically homophobic bullying.  Bullying in general and particularly the horrific consequences of Internet bullying or cyber-bullying, as in the very tragic case involving a young girl, have been in the news in recent days.<\/p><p>The sort of language used about cyber bullying can sometimes mask the real anguish and heartbreak that it can cause for people.  There is much flippant talk about Internet trolls, anonymous people who post vicious and hurtful comments online.  This sort of anonymous bullying can have really tragic consequences and certainly causes great distress.<\/p><p>The specific issue of homophobic bullying is clearly what we are speaking about and what the Minister of State focused on.  The Government has taken very significant action thereon already.  Homophobic bullying has been recognised internationally as a serious violation of human rights and a public health crisis.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State referred to the efforts of the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, through his Department to ensure that homophobic bullying is eliminated in schools.  The programme for Government commits to encouraging schools to develop anti-bullying policies.

Research has been done on the higher incidence of bullying of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender, LGBT, people in general.<\/p><p>The work at Government level has been important, but I take Senator Cullinane's point, in that it is not just a question of focusing on homophobic bullying or of taking action in schools, but of ensuring that Government policies are in keeping with the principle of equality and do not encourage, however indirectly, a perception in the community that people who are LGBT are less deserving of equal status.  I refer in particular to the campaign for marriage equality, of which I have been a supporter.

At some stage, we have each heard of incidents of bullying and its horrific consequences.  Homophobic bullying has been documented as being one of the most pervasive forms of bullying in schools.  It begins at national school.  The programme for Government commits to encouraging schools to develop anti-bullying strategies, in particular strategies to combat homophobic bullying.  In 2011, the Minister, Deputy Quinn, established a working group to help draft a roadmap towards the elimination of homophobic bullying from our schools.  This was a positive step.<\/p><p>Recently, President Higgins spoke of the destructive reality of homophobic bullying.  He stated that it was an important issue, not merely an emotional one.  Four out of five Irish teachers are aware of homophobic bullying in their schools, but research shows that only one in five LGBT young people who are victims of it seek support from their schools or teachers.  The impact on young people's mental health is well known to us all and includes self-harm, suicide attempts and tragedies, such as the recent one in Dromahair.<\/p><p>Children and teenagers are now more susceptible to bullying in national schools.  It can emanate from a variety of sources.  A high proportion of young people have been subjected to some form of bullying, leading to tragic consequences in some cases.<\/p><p>According to a 2008 survey, the most common form of bullying was verbal, followed by exclusion and physical bullying.  Bullying via written messages and electronic means has become more prominent in recent times.  Young children are susceptible to electronic bullying, as the sending of messages to one another via that media continues to grow on a daily basis, particularly in light of social networking.  This type of bullying was apparently evident in the sad case of a 15 year old girl who died recently.  If possible, cyber bullies must be named and shamed.<\/p><p>I can recount two incidents, although they were not as serious as those described by my colleague.  No one was beaten up, etc.  A young boy was bullied going to, at and coming from national school.  He told his parents that he did not want to go to school any more.  They reported it to the teacher and principal, who were unaware that there had been any bullying.  A young girl in sixth class who was ready to attend second level told her parents at Christmas that she would not return to school under any circumstance because she had been bullied.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012092500019#JJ00300","speaker":"1138"},{"type":"speech","time":1348585500,"counter":139,"content":"<p>The Senator should conclude because the Minister of State must respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012092500019#JJ00400","speaker":"1132"},{"type":"speech","time":1348585500,"counter":140,"content":"<p>People were staring at the girl.

We are all conscious of the constitutional and other difficulties, for example, the fact that the people on the other side have rights as well.<\/p><p>When he was a member of the British Government, Jack Straw was interviewed by David Frost early on a Sunday morning when people like me have nothing better to do than to watch political interviews.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012092500019#JJ00600","speaker":"982"},{"type":"speech","time":1348585500,"counter":142,"content":"<p>As one does on a Sunday morning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012092500019#JJ00700","speaker":"1174"},{"type":"speech","time":1348585500,"counter":143,"content":"<p>At 7 a.m.  Jack Straw was speaking about equality when David Frost told him that he could not legislate for attitudes.  Jack Straw agreed, but replied that he could legislate to ensure that a person's attitude would not detrimentally affect someone else.  That is what the Government is doing.  A great deal of work must be done in respect of the type of violence referred to by Senator Eamonn Coghlan.  Someone can be physically abused for standing up to verbal abuse, yet his or her word on it might not be taken despite there being evidence and witnesses.  We have all been there and know how it works.  The State's institutions need to take account of this issue.<\/p><p>No one could claim that I am not completely in favour of equality.  I always have been.  It is something I no longer question, it is part of what I am.<\/p> <p>I am not certain that marriage equality will stop bullying.  Bullying is a separate issue.  It is something insidious and we must be continuously conscious of it.  We must stamp it out, even at the very early stages.  As a grandmother of two young boys in national school, I know this type of bullying is used as a form of abuse, even when a child is not homosexual.  That shows how endemic the matter has become and we must stop it.  Even when a child does not understand the consequences of what is being said, it is still used, which I find very worrying.  It must be stopped.<\/p><p>Being a teenager is difficult enough at the best of times.  Imagine if a person's essence or sexuality is being questioned.  It is what we are so imagine if this is challenged.  Even if a person is not homosexual, bisexual or transgender, such a challenge in those circumstances must have serious repercussions.  I do not accept that teachers should not deal with this because they do not know how to deal with this issue.  Teachers deal with very difficult matters every day of the week and we could introduce a whole-of-school approach, where a teacher would not be isolated, alone or subject to the type of bullying that can go on in secondary schools, even with teachers.  The Minister, Deputy Quinn, is putting in place this whole-of-school approach, and with it we could do something about this problem.<\/p><p>The first and only idea we must drive into society is that tolerance is above all else.  We should be tolerant of other people's differences, no matter what they are, and in doing so we will have a better society in which we can all be more comfortable and live in a more open and generous fashion.  As each of us can understand the difficulties that arise when a person's essence is challenged, we must be constantly on our guard against it.  I saw the BeLonG To video Stand Up! and we have all done what it portrays through the years.  It might have been under different circumstances or guises but we all did it.  What we are saying is that people should support one another.<\/p><p>With regard to cyber bullying, our young people are now under more pressure than ever.  We did not have to deal with Facebook, Twitter or texting when we were teenagers.  We must get parents to have a serious look at what is happening in schools and communities because children and teenagers are not inclined to tell parents everything.  Perhaps we should try to get adolescents to talk to one significant adult, even if it is not a mother, father or teacher.  No one is coming to the table without the best of intentions, but homophobic bullying is quite a damaging prospect for society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012092500019#JJ00800","speaker":"982","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1348585500,"counter":145,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 5.45 p.m. and resumed at 6 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Syrian Conflict: Statements","time":1348585500,"counter":146,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012092500019#LL00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1348585500,"counter":147,"content":"<p>We are meeting to discuss the devastating humanitarian crisis in Syria and neighbouring countries.  I am heartened that Members of Seanad \u00c9ireann have taken the time and interest to request an update on the situation.  During my recent visit to Jordan, I was able to witness first-hand the enormous humanitarian consequences that the crisis is having on innocent civilians and the pressures that it is placing on host countries such as Jordan.  I am most appreciative of the opportunity to share my insights with Senators today and I look forward very much to hearing their contributions.<\/p><p>When the revolts across the Arab world began to put unprecedented pressure on long-standing authoritarian regimes, we all hoped that this would mark the beginning of a move towards democratic reform and respect for the rights of citizens.  However, progress has been varied and in Syria, the future remains highly uncertain.  All of us, I am sure, have been shocked and terribly saddened by the relentless onslaught on the Syrian civilian population in the past 18 months.  The brutally repressive actions of the Assad regime and an increasingly militant armed resistance from elements of the opposition have resulted in extraordinary human suffering.<\/p><p>It is very clear that while this is a humanitarian crisis, it is driven by politics and will only be solved with a political solution.  From the beginning, Ireland has recognised this, striving to respond to the humanitarian needs of the populations affected by the violence while working for a sustainable political solution based on accommodating the legitimate democratic aspirations of the Syrian people.<\/p><p>I would like to focus my remarks on three key areas.  First, I will provide an update on the current humanitarian situation within Syria and in neighbouring countries; second, I will summarise Ireland's response to the humanitarian crisis; and, third, I would like to touch on the highly complex and uncertain subject of what may happen in the coming months and years.<\/p><p>In regard to the humanitarian situation in Syria and neighbouring countries, the headline figures speak for themselves.  More than 19,000 people were killed in the violence, 2.5 million people in Syria are in desperate need of assistance, more than 1.2 million Syrians are displaced within their own country and approximately 283,000 Syrians are now refugees in neighbouring countries.  More than half of the refugees are children.<\/p><p>My visit to Za'atari refugee camp, 80 km north of the Jordanian capital Amman, close to the Syrian border, allowed me to hear the human stories and suffering behind such statistics.  In the camp, I heard powerful testimonies from Syrians who had recently fled the violence.  Many had been displaced up to four or five times within Syria before finally crossing the border into Jordan, with little or no possessions to their name.  I saw how the staff of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR, the agency responsible for the camp, were struggling with limited resources to provide even the most basic services such as shelter, food and water.  It is a race against time as the numbers of refugees escalates.  At the time of my visit, there were approximately 16,000 refugees in the camp.  In only a matter of weeks, this has doubled to nearly 32,000.  It is important to note that this is in addition to more than 55,000 refugees who are already living with host communities in Jordan and many more who are understood to have fled the conflict but have not registered as refugees.<\/p><p>When I met the Jordanian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Nasser Judeh, and the Jordanian Minister for Planning and International Co-operation, Dr. Jafar Hassan, they impressed on me how this refugee burden is placing a huge strain on the country which has a high pre-existing refugee population coupled with severe resource constraints.  They even went so far as to express fears that this could jeopardise a fragile political equilibrium and may pose a threat to national security and stability.<\/p><p>In Syria violence has intensified and spread across the country.  Recent weeks have seen most of the fighting centred on the country's main population centres, Damascus and Aleppo, further endangering civilians populations.  There is no safe place for those innocent civilians caught up in the conflict and protection is a major concern.<\/p><p>Recent reports have described indiscriminate shelling of densely populated areas, excessive use of force, including utterly unacceptable use of air strikes by aeroplanes and gun ship helicopters against civilian areas and random targeting of innocent civilians.  As the humanitarian situation deteriorates, there is urgent need for food, medical care and shelter.  The school term was due to start last week, yet more than 1 million people have taken refuge in schools and public buildings across the country, particularly in Jordan.<\/p><p>There is particular concern for the 500,000 Palestinian refugees in Syria who were already poorer and more vulnerable than the general population.<\/p> <p>While they have originally been spared the excesses of the violence, the camps where they reside in Dara'a and Damascus have recently been severely affected.  Any significant move of Palestinian refugees outside Syria is likely to create very serious political problems in the neighbouring countries.  <\/p><p> The aid operation in Syria is extremely complex.  During my discussions with the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross, humanitarian access, limited information and lack of funding were cited as the biggest challenges.  While the United Nations and non-governmental agencies have recently been able to considerably scale up the delivery of humanitarian assistance, the operation continues to be hampered by the administrative control of the Assad regime and by violence on the part of Government forces and the armed opposition.  The reality on the ground is that agencies respond on a day-to-day basis, delivering life-saving supplies and services as and when the security situation permits.  <\/p><p> Ireland has responded swiftly to the humanitarian crisis in Syria and the neighbouring countries.  As early as March this year, I authorised &#8364;500,000 in emergency funding for the International Committee of the Red Cross, the UNHCR and the World Food Programme.  The recent visit enabled me to see for myself how this support has provided life-saving services for refugees in Jordan.  While I was there, the humanitarian needs were escalating on a daily basis.  In response, I was able to mobilise an additional &#8364;1.6 million of humanitarian assistance to the ICRC - which includes the Red Crescent - the UNHCR, the World Health Organization and the International Rescue Committee for their response to the crisis.  This includes non-food items such as tents, mattresses, kitchen sets, water tanks and jerry cans from our rapid response stocks in Dubai worth &#8364;400,000.  Since March this year, Ireland has therefore provided &#8364;2.1 million in humanitarian assistance.  In my discussions with the Jordanian Government, the United Nations and the ICRC, they all expressed their sincere appreciation for Ireland's generosity, particularly given the difficult economic climate that we face.  <\/p><p> I have emphasised that this is a humanitarian crisis arising from an underlying political conflict.  Over the past 18 months, our efforts and those of international partners have been directed at ending the violence and repression inflicted upon the people of Syria.  Even if the reality on the ground is disheartening, we must continue to promote a peaceful settlement with the ultimate aim of political transition in Syria.  Ireland is fully supportive of the newly-appointed UN-Arab League Joint Special Representative, Lakhdar Brahimi, and his efforts to negotiate a ceasefire and chart a political path ahead.  In parallel, international pressure needs to be maintained to bring an end to the violence and compel the Syrian regime to stop its bloody repression.  Ireland, with our international partners, has been advocating for a strong UN Security Council resolution.  I believe this is long overdue.  There is a need for effective leadership and action on the part of the Security Council, imposing sanctions on those who continue to wage war on innocent civilians and who fail to meet their international obligations.  In particular, a comprehensive arms embargo remains absolutely crucial as the only real way to curb the ongoing flows of arms and ammunition making their way to Syria.  There also needs to be full accountability for what has transpired in Syria, with the clear and incontrovertible evidence presented by the UN and others of serious human rights violations committed primarily by the Assad regime and its forces but also, to a lesser extent, by certain elements of the armed opposition.  That is why Ireland continues to fully support the calls for the situation in Syria to be referred by the Security Council to the International Criminal Court.<\/p><p> The general view expressed by my interlocutors in Jordan was that while the Assad regime would eventually fall, this may not be imminent and indeed there is every possibility that Assad will hang on to power at any cost.  Possible spill\u00adover of the conflict into neighbouring states remains a serious concern, as recently reflected by ongoing clashes in northern Lebanon.  With no early political solution in sight therefore, the prospect of continued displacement and humanitarian suffering within Syria and an escalating and protracted regional refugee crisis is very real.  In Jordan alone, current predictions are that the number of refugees will reach 250,000 by the end of the year.  As winter approaches, the pressure for shelter, fuel, health services and food will multiply.  Coping mechanisms are severely depleted and vulnerability levels of both displaced populations and refugees increase as the conflict endures.  We are now facing into missed harvests, missed schooling and lost economic opportunities - all of which will have a profound impact on the affected populations in the years ahead.  <\/p><p> Without doubt, the biggest unknown is what comes after Assad.  The opposition is clearly fragmented and concern is growing that fractures among the disparate elements of the opposition may contain the seeds of further instability.  Ireland, along with its EU and international partners, has long called for all strands of the opposition to set aside their differences and agree a platform for democratic change reflective of the legitimate aspirations of all Syrians.  Engagement with leading regional players and others, particularly Russia, which are in a position to exert influence on the Assad regime will also be of key importance in the efforts to broker a solution.  This is a task which Joint Special Representative Brahimi is already clearly committed to undertaking.  In the meantime, the grim reality remains that the suffering of Syrian civilians is growing with each day.  The immediate imperative therefore is to respond to the humanitarian needs on the ground, while maintaining our international efforts to find a sustainable political solution that is so desperately needed.  Ireland is wholeheartedly committed on both fronts and the visit to Jordan was an important demonstration of our solidarity with those affected by the crisis.<\/p><p> I have received information that the UN Human Rights Council is meeting in Geneva, the Arab League is putting forward proposals in respect of the conflict and, for the first time, the Russian Federation has put forward its own package.  Therefore, there is likely to be some negotiations in respect of the proposals being put forward within the UN Human Rights Council by the Arab League and the Russian Federation.  Russia plays a key role, as we know from its disagreement, along with China, with some of the positions taken by other members of the Security Council.  I hope that by Friday, there will some progress in that respect.  <\/p><p> There will be a meeting of the UN General Assembly in New York this week, for which the Tan\u00e1iste has already left; therefore, the issue is very much on the agenda of the assembly.  Certainly there will be discussions by like-minded friends of Syria with discussions <i>en marge<\/i>of the General Assembly discussions.  I have brought the House up to date with the present situation, which is the best information I can provide.  I hope there is some possibility of the deadlock being broken and some progress being made in the not too distant future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012092500019#LL00300","speaker":"1006","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348585500,"counter":149,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State with responsibility for trade and development to the House, of which he was a Member in the past.  He is always welcome.  He has two very important portfolios in overseas development and trade.  I served as Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce for some time.  It is a most interesting and important Department as far as our future is concerned.  I commend the Minister of State for travelling to Jordan and seeing at first hand the effects of the ravages on Syria, which is the most serious issue in the world.  The Minister of State has also authorised \u20ac500,000 in emergency funding and \u20ac1.6 million in humanitarian aid and assistance to the ICRC.  He is prepared to continue supporting it the best he can in very difficult times here.  On behalf of this side of the House, I commend the Minister of State for his commitment to the region and refugees.<\/p> <p>The situation is that Syria, as is well known throughout the region, has been a destabilising force for some time in respect of its support for and the establishment of Hezbollah, its effects in Lebanon and its supply of weapons to certain elements who targeted Israel.  The position in regard to refugees is extremely serious because there are 500,000 Palestinian refugees who have nowhere to go.  They cannot go back to Palestine as the state is not established.  They are being housed in Jordan and surrounding areas, including Syria which gave them a home.  However, they are now in a vulnerable position and it is vitally important that the United Nations, China and Russia bear this in mind.  It is a catastrophe of huge proportions and the future is uncertain as the Minister of State pointed out.  <\/p><p>The Assad regime was supported and used in the past by various countries in the region but is now in a vulnerable position.  The Minister of State expressed concern about the future as there is not a united opposition.  The situation is diffuse.  There is concern about minorities in Syria such as the Christian minority.  Under the Assad regime they were given support and, as far as I am aware, were not discriminated against in any way.  If and when the new regime is put in place, their position will be vulnerable and they are concerned.  Some are viewed as being on the side of the establishment but a civil war such as this is extremely dangerous.  The position is that 90,000 people have gone into Turkey - 80,000 to camps and 10,000 to communities.  The total number of refugees expected in the country is 250,000.  Some 90,000 have gone into Iraq and it is not known how many others will travel there.  Jordan has 77,000 refugees while it expects 250,000 in due course, and Lebanon has 56,000.  Those are massive numbers of refugees as winter approaches and will create enormous pressure on the United Nations.  That is the reason it is important that the Government and the Minister of State have ensured that funding is provided.<\/p><p>The civil war in Syria has worsened and the humanitarian crisis has deepened because of the violence and refugees threatening to spill out across the region.  The instability of the Arab spring is all too apparent in the wave of violence against American embassies and the threat against French embassies, following the publication of inflammatory material depicting the prophet Muhammad.  The reaction of countries to these publications is enormous.  It was irresponsible, to say the least, knowing the effect it would have, to publish the cartoons, and the film depicting Muhammad which was made in America was outrageous.  I heard some extracts from it and, frankly, any religion would be deeply upset.  In the Christian community we have tolerated the depiction of biblical scenes in films and there has not been the same reaction but they have been condemned in a democratic way.  The way in which these inflame the passions of the Islamic community is unbelievable.  Irrespective of free speech in America, France and elsewhere, there is no excuse, knowing the effect it would have, for publishing such cartoons or making a film depicting Muhammad in a derogatory fashion. That is unforgivable and has caused an enormous number of deaths in the region, attacks and the murder of the US ambassador to Libya.  Those are serious issues and must be borne in mind.<\/p><p>Some 20,000 people have been killed in the violence unleashed by the regime of Bashar al-Assad since protests erupted more than one year ago and Syria has slipped into the chaos of civil war.  A report by the international charity, Save the Children, states that as Syria's civil war has intensified, thousands of children have died in brutal attacks and many more have been injured, traumatised or forced to flee their homes.  It warns that boys and girls continue to be killed, maimed and tortured.  These appalling violations against children must stop and those carrying them out must be held to account.  <\/p><p>Hundreds of thousands of refugees have fled the country to surrounding states.  The Free Syrian Army has moved back into an area controlled by the rebels.  At the United Nations General Assembly today, the UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, described the fighting in Syria as &quot;a regional calamity with global ramifications&quot;.  He called for action from the divided UN Security Council and said that the international community should not look the other way as violence spirals out of control.  He said that brutal human rights abuses continue to be committed, mainly by the Government, but also by opposition forces.<\/p><p>President Obama has announced to the UN General Assembly that the regime of President Bashar al-Assad should step aside.  The majority of people would call on that regime to step aside and try to put a transitional government in place.  However, the United Nations Security Council has been unable to reach agreement on the Syrian crisis and on Monday, UN envoy Lakhdar Brahimi warned that the situation was extremely bad and getting worse.  While he did not have a full plan he said he had a few ideas.  Mr. Brahimi had just visited Damascus as well as refugee camps in neighbouring Jordan and Turkey.  Diplomats have played down expectations for the mission with no sign of fundamental divisions on the Council being bridged.<\/p><p>The UN Secretary General is wary of interference with Russia and China wielding a veto over any Council mandate.  Russia regards military intervention as an infringement on the sovereignty of Syria.  The Council is further divided over whether the current regime has any role to play in a transition.<\/p><p>The deteriorating situation marks a clear failure of the United Nations which has been paralysed over the issue while thousands continue to die.  Western states have been reluctant to give unilateral military support to the Free Syrian Army in the fear that the group will become more radical and that heavy weapons will ultimately be used to enforce an Islamic regime.  The murder of the US ambassador to Libya has underlined the potential for a revolution to rebound on its supporters.<\/p><p>I thank the Leader for providing time for the debate and the Minister of State for a comprehensive response.  I wish him well when travelling to the region and assisting in the humanitarian needs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012092500019#MM00300","speaker":"1140","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348585500,"counter":151,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Costello, to the House and thank him for a comprehensive report on his recent visit to Jordan.  I compliment him on securing aid of more than \u20ac2 million which is badly needed by the people who are suffering gravely as a result of the Assad regime.  It is timely that the debate is taking place in a week when the T\u00e1naiste is attending a meeting of the UN General Assembly which will discuss the Syrian crisis and, I hope, make some progress.<\/p><p>As the Minister of State has outlined, several million people within the country and refugees in Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey are in need of help and the crisis is growing.  We have all been horrified and shocked by the scale of the crisis we have seen on our television screens and on various media outlets which have sent us information recently and we are frustrated at the lack of progress in bringing about a peaceful resolution to the conflict.<\/p><p>In a recent report on the humanitarian situation, the UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, painted a particularly grim picture when he said that the conflict has taken a particularly brutal turn with Government forces continuing their indiscriminate shelling of densely populated areas with heavy weapons and opposition groups stepping up their military activities.  Civilians have borne the brunt of the violence and large-scale human rights violations have been reported.  Prisoners on both sides have been subjected to harsh treatment, including torture, and there have been alarming reports of summary executions.<\/p> <p>Government forces and the armed opposition had failed to protect civilians and respect international humanitarian law while more than 1.2 million people have been displaced inside Syria.<\/p><p>  The UN Secretary General also said that the number of refugees registered in Turkey, Jordan, the Lebanon and Iraq was rising to above 225,000.  While primary responsibility for ending the conflict lay with the parties, notably the government, there was a collective duty to help Syrians to resolve their differences peacefully.  With that in mind, he again urged the Government and armed opposition to abandon military activities, engage in dialogue, protect civilians and abide by their obligations under international human rights and humanitarian law.  The United Nations was committed to helping them come to the negotiating table and move towards a democratic and plural political system with equal rights for all.  The Syrian people have waited too long, he declared.  We all share his sentiments and call on all international politicians to redouble their efforts to resolve the conflict before any more innocent lives are lost.<\/p><p> Amnesty International, in a recent briefing, said: <ul>Indiscriminate air bombardments and artillery strikes by the Syrian army are killing, maiming and terrorizing residents of Jabal al-Zawiya, Idlib and north Hama regions. Every day civilians are killed or injured in their homes or trying to shelter from the bombings.  Hundreds have been killed or injured in recent weeks, many of them children, in indiscriminate attacks.  <\/p><p> Some towns and villages have been virtually emptied of their residents, many of whom are now camping out in surrounding countryside or hiding in caves; others are crowding in with relatives in what they hope are safer areas, while others have sought refuge in Turkey - or are currently stuck at the border with Turkey waiting to flee the country.  <\/p><p> With the attention of the international media mostly focused on the fighting in Aleppo and the capital, hardly any news reaches the outside world about the horrors of daily life for the residents of Idlib and other Hama regions.  <\/ul>It is particularly worrying that while we there is a high profile coverage given to the atrocities in highly populated areas much is happening in the smaller regions and communities.  <\/p><p> The Irish Syrian Solidarity campaign has lobbied the Government to prioritise the distribution of aid to field hospitals in areas of Syria controlled by the opposition.  These hospitals, I am told, are the only sources of medical aid for civilians living in the areas.  Recently a Syrian consultant interviewed on RTE - he now works in Ireland - said that during his work in a field hospital over the summer almost all of his patients were injured civilians.  So far the Government has declined to assist field hospitals but I ask the Minister of State to review the situation.  Perhaps he will comment on it during his response.  A serious concern is that Irish aid may not be reaching the areas in dire need in Syria.  According to Dr. Banan, the Red Cross and other large NGOs are only able to distribute aid with the agreement of the Assad regime.  The Minister of State referred to the matter in his speech and I ask him to elaborate further on the matter.<\/p><p> The Syrian conflict is a humanitarian crisis of enormous proportions.  There is a responsibility on the international community to force a solution and the Assad regime and armed opposition groups must be held accountable for their actions.  The UN Security Council must show some muscle by referring the Syrian conflict to the International Criminal Court and I welcome the Government's support for the stance. <\/p><p> The Government will hold the Presidency of the EU from 1 January and I hope that significant progress will be made during the period to resolve the crisis.  I welcome the Minister of State's closing remark when he said that some progress may be made with the united Arab League and the Russian Federation beginning to engage in the process.   <\/p><p> As I said, we are horrified at the enormous loss of life and the displacement of so many innocent people in Syria.  It is incumbent on all of us, as politicians, to redouble our efforts to ensure that the situation can be resolved or improved.  The Minister of State indicated that the grave uncertainty about the future of the Assad regime makes the entire situation uncertain.  <\/p><p> I welcome the appointment of the Joint Special Representative Brahimi and hope significant progress will be made during the coming months.  The conflict will take a considerable amount of time to resolve and there will be a significant opportunity for Ireland and its EU partners, during our Presidency, to assist in the process.  I look forward to the Minister of State's response to the issues I have raised. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012092500019#NN00200","speaker":"1118","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348585500,"counter":153,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  He has been a regular visitor to the Seanad since he took up his portfolio, for which I commend him.  I also compliment him on securing &#8364;2 million in aid for the war torn area.  It is great that he is here to listen to our views and statements on the humanitarian crisis arising from the regrettable conflict in Syria.  The conflict appears to be intensifying  and, as a consequence, is devastating for all civilians who reside there and whose lives have been utterly changed since the catastrophe began.<\/p><p>  The conflict has taken on a particularly brutal and violent character.  We have all been privy to horribly distressing images on our television screens that show ordinary women, men and children being caught up in the midst of it all.  Lives have been, and continue to be, devastated and families are being decimated.  People are being killed at a rate of over 20 per day and well over 100,000 citizens have been arrested or detained.  The regime's totalitarian tactics have reached a pitch of unparalleled savagery in the history of the Arab world.<\/p><p>  Part of the problem in the country is due to the fact that the traditional political opposition in Syria has not been strengthened over the years and the Assad regime has squashed any such development in the three decades that it has held power.  As a consequence there is no meaningful political participation in the country given that the people and state employees, in particular, are expected to slavishly follow the rule of politics laid down by the Ba'athist regime.  For those opposed to Assad's political views they can expect to forgo their freedom and languish in prisons or in exile so it has proved difficult to garner and foster any real opposition.  There have been attempts to unite all opposition groups into a single front but given that their geographical position is outside of the country it has been hard to do anything meaningful.<\/p><p>  A beacon of hope shines in the grassroot organisation known as the people's movement.  This gathering can be confident of its achievements to date and with every passing day it grows and advances the people's cause, the citizens of Syria.  In hot spots such as Homs, Hama, Deraa and the Damascus hinterland it has won over the majority of inhabitants.  Thousands of civilians are now participating in hundreds, if not thousands, of organised demonstrations, rallies and sit-ins which aim to highlight its attempts at rebellion and speaking up for the ordinary citizen.  They have shown heroic courage and continue with their protests unabated  despite a real threat to their safety.  It is worth noting that from the first day the Assad regime has encouraged the uprising away from its non-violent principles and towards militarisation.  It was a cunning political move by the regime because it was aware that the opposition would be militarily inferior and easily squashed and at the same time it would legitimise, or attempt to legitimise, Assad's use of violence and thereby gain some degree of international support.  The move is worrying.<\/p><p>  A potential stumbling block in the desire of the grassroot popular movement to advance is the regime's remarkable cohesion.  It is in stark contrast with the Libyan crisis where significant elements declared internally that they had broken with the regime and displayed a degree of fragility, albeit behind the <i>faux<\/i> portrayal of public solidity.<\/p><p>  Syria's armed forces remain obedient to the regime to a fault. Their unwavering loyalty to a despotic regime can be explained in the context of Assad's response to any perceived lack of commitment.  Reports from the battleground mean that it is not unusual for soldiers to pay with their lives for refusing to open fire on civilians or attempting to flee clashes and demonstrators.  Moreover, all senior government employees are forbidden from leaving Syria without first obtaining special permission from the security services.  All of this means that there has been a clear and flagrant breach of international humanitarian law.  The most fundamental protection offered under these laws is the protection of civilians.  Ireland must do its bit to highlight the crisis, keep highlighting it and to raise it again with the appropriate officials within the EU and the UN.<\/p> <p>We must do something further to increase our humanitarian assistance to the men, women and children who are facing the terrible consequences of this crisis.  It is clear from international reports that the humanitarian situation has worsened considerably since it first began.  People are displaced and homes are abandoned.  According to the Syrian Government's figures, up to 1.2 million people are sheltering in public buildings.  Others are seeking refuge with their relatives and friends and all concerned urgently require humanitarian intervention by the necessary agencies due to the widening impact of the crisis on the economy and people's livelihoods.  There is a clear and present requirement for health care, shelter, food, water and sanitation.  There are serious public health issues in many of the public buildings that are being used as shelters.<\/p><p> There has been significant disruption as well to the education of thousands of Syrian children, as the Minister of State, Deputy Costello, alluded to, since the beginning of the academic year in September.  The future seems very bleak.  I commend the UN and its partners on reaching more people each month with emergency aid.  I commend the countries in Europe and throughout the world that have contributed to the aid programme.  In spite of difficulties accessing people in most need as a result of heavy fighting, the World Food Programme distributes food through the Syrian Arab Red Crescent.  The local partners reach more than 820,000 people across Syria.  While this goes some way to alleviating hunger problems, it is merely a drop in the ocean, considering there is a real and pressing need to deal with 2.5 million people.  While the current situation in Syria is becoming more severe, we must find a new solution to the issue.  I commend the efforts being made by the UN and other agencies in this regard.  As an EU country we must continue to lobby the UN and other agencies to keep the pressure on the various factions and call on them to enter talks with one another.  We must urge them to co-operate with the mediation efforts of international peace envoy, Lakhdar Brahimi. <b><i><\/i><\/b>Furthermore we must aim to get diplomatic support for an agreement between the government and opposition<b><i><\/i><\/b>for the formation of a transitional government.<b><\/b>However, as a caveat, we must fully ensure that any movement is championed by the Syrian people and is not imposed from outside.<\/p><p> The brutality associated with the war has transformed most Syrian citizens into tragic figures and it is high time that stopped.  As an Irish observer in the conflict I reiterate that Ireland must make it very clear that we reject in its totality all forms of violence and breaches of human rights.  We must ensure that we are more vocal in urging the different factions to ensure a successful ceasefire, which should include the release of all prisoners and the granting of humanitarian access unhindered.<\/p><p> I repeat my call to those engaged in the conflict to respect civilians and abide by international humanitarian law.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012092500019#OO00200","speaker":"1173","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348585500,"counter":155,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Costello, to this Chamber.  I listened on the monitor to his moving account of his visit to Jordan.  It brings home to us in the Seanad what is happening in Syria.  May I ask a personal question?  It seems there is a sense of resignation, and the sense of the impotency of the United Nations.  I read the oral update issued in June on the independent international commission of inquiry in the Syrian Arab Republic.  We are witnessing a human catastrophe in terms of human rights.  There is evidence of the sexual violation of children.  The commission of inquiry acknowledges that the joint special envoy's six-point plan, supported by the United Nations mission in Syria offers the best framework for the resolution of the conflict.  I would like to hear the Minister of State's political viewpoint.  We are looking for a non-violent resolution to the conflict but at the same time we are also bearing witness to a catastrophe and, in my view, war crimes.  I have been careful in my use of language.  I know the Minister must be careful also.<\/p><p>  I got a sense of resignation when listening to the Minister of State.  He did say, however, and we might tease out this point, that the Russian Federation was beginning to get involved.  We may look at how it might engage with the humanitarian side. <\/p><p>  I feel very helpless about what is happening.  There was a report in<i> The Irish Times <\/i>on Saturday which brought the situation home to us.  Irish citizens from the Muslim community are involved in the fighting and are implicated in the anti-Government side.  We have a moral responsibility to our citizens, which means that for all of us, Syria is not that far away.  I would like to get a sense of reassurance or qualification on my feelings that what the United Nations is trying to do is not good enough, whether there is another way of resolving the issue or that we should stick to the framework suggested by the United Nations mission in Syria. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012092500019#PP00200","speaker":"1167"},{"type":"speech","time":1348585500,"counter":156,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his presence in the Chamber.  We are all struck by what we see on the television, and what we read with regard to the Syrian catastrophe.  My reason for speaking today is as a result of my experience during my visit to Rwanda in August.  There I saw the fallout of the genocide 18 years earlier, where 1 million people were killed in 100 days and the international community failed to act, in spite of the fact it was asked to provide 5,000 troops.  Kofi Annan now admits he was wrong and did not listen.  Some 18 years later, people are still devastated.  Many of the men were killed, leaving widows and orphans.  There are families headed by children.  We are looking at a similar situation happening in Syria.<\/p><p>I support many of the views expressed by Senator Mac Conghail.  I am concerned that we are happy enough with how the UN is dealing with the situation, but I do not think it is working.  The UN is certainly not reacting fast enough.  We are fortunate that a man of the deep humanity of Deputy Joe Costello is the Minister of State at the Department dealing with this issue.  When the Minister of State responds to the debate will he outline whether Ireland is doing enough, in terms of the weight it can bring to bear on human rights abuses?  We have always punched above our weight in the area of human rights.  Some 19,000 people have been killed and 2.5 million people are in desperate need of assistance.  The Minister of State described the plight of the refugees.  To echo his comment, this is a timebomb.  The civilian population, including children, are bearing the brunt of the conflict.  The Government forces attack indiscriminately.  The indiscriminate nature of the bombardments means there is little residents can do to protect themselves.  There is clear violation of international humanitarian law.  Amnesty has urged the UN Security Council to refer the situation in Syria to the prosecutor at the International Criminal Court in order to ensure that the perpetrators of these crimes and other crimes under international law are brought to justice.  The families of their victims would then receive reparations.  In his speech, the Minister of State said he supported this call.  Has Ireland formally referred the situation in Syria to the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court?  Are we just supporting others?  We must step up to the plate and show leadership.  We must act.  If this was happening to Irish civilians, we would want the protection of the international community.<\/p><p>The killing in Syria is government-sponsored.  As the independent international commission said, the human rights abuses by the opposition groups are not comparable in scale and organisation to those carried out by the state.  This is state-sponsored war.  It is similar to what I saw in Rwanda.<\/p> <p> On the issue of why the UN is not acting more resolutely to stop this, there is the veto situation with Russia and China, and they have a great deal to answer for in this regard.  What contact has the Minister of State had with the Russian and Chinese ambassadors to Ireland to reflect the serious disappointment of the Government with the repeated vetoes used by Russia and China of Security Council resolutions on Syria to resolve this conflict?  I understand that we are trying to build trade relations with China, but that does not mean one cannot express one's deep concern about its actions in this regard.  We must be very clear about what is right and wrong.  Has the Minister raised with the ambassadors the call from Amnesty International and others for arms embargoes, referrals to the International Criminal Court and Ireland's position in that regard?<\/p><p>In summary, is the Minister satisfied that Ireland is doing enough?  Ordinary people on the street regularly ask me what they can do.  It is an interesting question from the people in Galway.  They are really asking on whom they can put pressure.  They know they can donate, but it is not enough simply to donate when there is a political crisis in this case and where political interests are put ahead of human rights.  Children are being used as human shields, people are being tortured and killed and the displacement described by the Minister means there will be fallout for many years to come.  I look forward to the Minister of State's response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012092500019#PP00300","speaker":"1131","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348585500,"counter":158,"content":"<p>I extend a hearty c\u00e9ad m\u00edle f\u00e1ilte to the Minister of State, Deputy Joe Costello, who is very familiar with this Chamber.  I applaud him for the initiatives he has taken so far on behalf of the people, particularly his recent visit to Jordan which was widely publicised.  He brought home to the people the horror of the humanitarian crisis that is unfolding just a few hours away by aeroplane.  In fact, the UN envoy, Mr. Brahimi, warned on Monday that the situation was &quot;extremely bad and getting worse.&quot;<\/p><p>  I will take up the theme of Senator Healy Eames's contribution regarding what the Government can do and the issue of the UN and its lack of capacity to move forward on this issue at the Security Council.  What political dimension is the Government bringing to this?  I compliment the Government on the fact that it moved very quickly.  As a result of initiatives taken over the last number of years we were able to move resources from within the region.  Heretofore, we would have been obliged to send them directly from Ireland, which would have taken a great deal of time.  Goods to the value of &#8364;400,000 were moved from Dubai and there has been a total donation of &#8364;2.1 million.  That is an example of joined-up thinking in terms of the manner in which we provide humanitarian aid internationally.<\/p><p>  What else is the Government doing, for example, in terms of lobbying at the United Nations?  Ireland has a proud record in the United Nations.  It is not seen as an aligned country, although the complexities of the Middle East might limit our capacity in that regard.  It should also be remembered that Ireland currently holds the chairmanship of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE.  As Russia is a leading player in the OSCE, have there been bilateral discussions with the Russian Federation regarding the stance it has taken so far at the United Nations?  Obviously, Russia has a vested interest given that its only port on the Mediterranean is in Syrian territorial waters.  China always has its own agenda and it is keeping a watching brief.  Obviously it is scared silly, as is Russia, of any type of military intervention because they say it would infringe on the country's sovereignty.  When one has the Chechen problem in one's backyard, as Russia does, and a Taiwan problem, as China has, one will obviously take that position anyway.  However, that does not help the situation.  Like Senator Mac Conghail and others, I ask the Minister of State to elaborate in his final comments regarding the Russian Federation now engaging in terms of putting forward a concrete proposal.  It would be helpful to hear if the Minister of State has any further information in that regard.<\/p><p>  The humanitarian crisis is overwhelming when one considers the numbers.  As the Minister of State outlined them, I will not repeat what he said but 2.5 million people, which is equivalent to two thirds of the population of the country, are in need of humanitarian assistance.  The biggest problem is the impact it is having in terms of the destabilising effect on neighbouring countries, particularly Lebanon.  There are more than 56,000 Syrians in Lebanon who are registered or awaiting registration.  However, there is also the Palestinian refugee issue, which has not been highlighted to any great extent.  Syria hosts nearly 500,000 Palestinian refugees.  It has offered assurances that they will not be attacked but the camps have been attacked.  As a result the Palestinians have been fleeing to Jordan and Lebanon.  In Jordan there is a real destabilising impact because of the sensitivities surrounding the Palestinians already <i>in situ<\/i> who came there following the expulsion of Palestinians from Kuwait in 1992 and the exodus from Iraq during the war.  In Lebanon it is even more problematic because those who are fleeing Syria are seeking shelter in the Shatila refugee camp, which is effectively a slum and where there are 455,000 Palestinian refugees already registered.  The question is whether that country has the capacity to absorb any more without destabilising it.<\/p><p>  I make a plea to the Minister of State in the context of humanitarian assistance.  I understand that while Syrian refugees receive assistance from the UN refugee agency, UNHCR, to which we have contributed &#8364;2.1 million, Palestinian refugees fall under the mandate of UNWRA, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, which has a smaller budget.  UNWRA has appealed for an additional &#8364;21.4 million for its consolidated regional plan but has so far received less than a quarter of that sum.  It has appealed for the &#8364;21.4 million to assist Palestinian refugees, who are falling between the cracks in this growing humanitarian crisis.  Perhaps the Minister of State has an opinion on this.  We contribute to UNWRA and as I am sure the Minister of State has already visited the UNWRA camps, he will be familiar with this matter.  Given his background he will already be aware of the important work UNWRA is doing in the Palestinian territories.<\/p><p>  I will conclude my contribution with one stark fact.  In the context of any attempt being made by Mr. Brahimi, the UN, the Government and others to try to solve this problem, it is estimated that there are more than 2,000 armed groups operating on Syrian soil.  Most of them are fragmented and disparate.  I wish the Minister of State well in his efforts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012092500019#QQ00400","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1348585500,"counter":159,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State back to the House.  I strongly welcome the information he gave the House towards the end of his statement regarding the initiatives being taken today by the Arab League and Russia.  This conflict has dragged on for 18 months and has claimed 20,000 lives, and violence continues to spread to more parts of the country.  In August alone, 100,000 people fled Syria.  The initiatives by Russia and the Arab League are a chink of light in what has been a period of utter desperation for the ordinary, innocent Syrian population.  I hope the new peace envoy, Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi, will have a more successful mission than his predecessor, Mr. Kofi Annan.  Both sides in Syria have until now rejected any type of compromise and the international community has been deeply divided.  Mr. Brahimi said recently that the support of the international community is indispensable and urgently required.  I hope, as a result of what has happened today, we will see some progress.<\/p><p>Last month's flood of refugees is certainly not a coincidence given that Bashar al-Assad appears to have upped the ante, to use a crude phrase.<\/p> <p>His regime controls the skies, although I do not believe it has control on the ground, and it uses this advantage to indiscriminately bomb towns and villages, schools, hospitals and homes with absolute impunity.  As a result of this bombardment, according to an article in <i>The Washington Post<\/i>yesterday, most people now sleep in the fields at night.  While that option was viable in warmer temperatures and while food was plentiful, cushioning the blow somewhat for the displaced, the arrival of near freezing winter temperatures will mean greater suffering and a deepening of the crisis.  Last winter was bad and this winter will be worse, in my opinion.  Last winter people had savings and food but the situation is now completely different because those savings are exhausted.  While food might be plentiful in the north of Syria, it is not affordable for many.<\/p><p> The Minister of State acknowledged Ireland's response.  I wonder, however, about the humanitarian aid hub that was mooted for Shannon Airport some time ago.  Perhaps a project like this would give a shot in the arm to the region and we could see it speeded up or realised during our Presidency of the European Union.<\/p><p> Following the European Union lead recently, the United States today has agreed to delist from a terrorist database a group styling itself the People's Mujahidin of Iran.

The media and some commentators regularly use the term \"Arab spring\" but the reality is that each country must be looked at differently.  There are similarities and many positive things happening throughout the Arab world but in the case of Syria we should not rush to simplistic conclusions.<\/p><p>Our position in Sinn F\u00e9in is clear - we want to see Assad gone.  The regime is brutal, we have heard numerous examples of that brutality throughout this debate, and it has no respect for human rights.  That is not a recent change in the nature of the regime.  In 1982, Assad's father brutally cracked down on a rebellion, killing between 20,000 and 40,000 people.<\/p><p>We are not, however, prepared to blindly throw support behind any particular opposition group.  The aims and origins of many of these groups can be shadowy and diverse.  Both sides to the conflict have been involved in the torture and assassination of prisoners, the indiscriminate targeting of rival ethnic religious groups and we should not be naive to the fact there have been foreign influences and interests in Syria and they are not entirely benign to say the least.  It is a fractured opposition that includes Islamic fundamentalists as well as ordinary Syrians who want civil and political rights.  These groups are then further subdivided, with some funded by America, France, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Turkey, while the Government is allegedly receiving military and financial support from Iran.<\/p><p>There has been an undoubted intensification of the fighting in recent weeks, with the Syrian Government increasing its bombing of residential areas and using its superior air power to bomb the rest of the population into submission.  In addition, rebel groups have grown stronger in the north and control certain border areas with Turkey.  This points to a protracted military stalemate, the last thing the ordinary people of Syrian want or need.  There is an immediate need to end this and for peace and reconciliation to start as soon as possible but that is easier said than done.  We do, however, want to see Assad gone and the introduction of democracy and the rule of law, with respect for all ethnic, religious and racial groups in Syria.<\/p><p>Neutral countries with no strategic interest in the region have an important role in trying to broker a peace but post-war settlements should be decided by Syrians and it is up to the Syrian people to decide what government they will install when the fighting stops.  It should be done democratically.  We are against any country providing military or financial support to any side in the war but countries should use their resources to help those displaced and wounded in the fighting.  We have heard repeatedly this evening about the number of people who have been killed, injured and displaced and we call on the Syrian Government to open its borders to NGOs and humanitarian organisations to help the civilians who are drastically affected by the war.<\/p><p>We welcome the Minister of State's decision to visit the Syrian refugee camps in Jordan recently and commend the Government for its recent decision to contribute an extra \u20ac1.6 million in aid to the UN agencies and humanitarian organisations.  We call on the Government to use its influence during the Presidency of the European Union in 2013 to help broker a peace deal and to ensure humanitarian assistance continues to flow into Syria to help those affected by the humanitarian crisis and those refugees who have fled to neighbouring countries.  Senator Healy Eames talked about our human rights record and it is important we use the EU Presidency to highlight the ongoing humanitarian situation in Syria and put our weight behind it because of our credibility in the area.<\/p><p>Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi, in his first interview, said that the point he wanted to make as strongly and seriously as possible is that the situation is bad and getting worse, it is not improving.  According to him, Syrians on both sides say from time to time that victory will be won soon but that is not true, no side is winning now and the situation is getting worse, and that is a huge threat to the region.  Does the Minister of State think the new UN-Arab League envoy to Syria can help broker a peace deal and will he get any more respect from the Syrian regime and the fighters than Kofi Annan did when trying to broker a peace deal?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012092500019#RR00200","speaker":"1155"},{"type":"speech","time":1348585500,"counter":162,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and thank him for the contribution he made.  I commend him for taking the initiative to visit the refugee camps.  It is only when one visits the refugee camps that one can see the difficulties on the ground.  In 2008 I visited Chad and the Sudanese border area to see 500,000 people in refugee camps and IDP sites, where people lived in fear because within a short distance of the camps there were people carrying arms and the danger was constant.  Going to the refugee camp means we can see the difficulties.<\/p><p>The difficulty during a war is getting access to food, water and medical supplies.<\/p> <p>As for my experience back in March 2008, I recall speaking to the people who were organising the importation of food.  They needed to bring in something like 57,000 tonnes by the start of June and trying to so do was a huge effort.  The same problem arises in this case, as the refugee camps are getting bigger by the day.  As the numbers seeking a place of safety continue to grow, trying to service such sites and ensuring people who require medical treatment can get it are major problems, as are trying to bring in the required expertise to the sites and making sure those who provide that expertise are secure and protected, which also is an important issue.  The Minister of State's visit highlights the importance Ireland is placing on trying to deal with the issues involved.<\/p><p>One major concern is the American presidential election campaign will take place in the next three months.  People who wish to gain power tend to make use of this time because people in America - this is not a criticism of United States - are greatly focused on the next four years of government.  In particular, Members should consider what happened in January 2009, when Israel decided to bombard Gaza.  The interesting point is this bombardment took place during a changeover of the United States presidency, when little or no action would be taken against Israel.  Similarly, because of the aforementioned three or four-month timeframe between now and Christmas, I am concerned by what people on all sides in Syria may attempt to do in the full knowledge there will be little international response, particularly from the United States.  The Minister of State referred to the more than 500,000 Palestinians living in Syria, which is another issue of concern.  It is a huge number of people to which one can add the 900,000 people in Gaza who are being supplied from food stations at present and are reliant on getting food from them.  One thing I did as a member of the committee on foreign affairs of the European Parliament was to visit Gaza four weeks after the Israeli bombardment to see the kind of conditions in which people were living.  The difficulty with Syria is the problem is growing in that the number of casualties is growing and lack of care and access to medical treatment unfortunately is also a huge problem.<\/p><p>One issue that always is of concern to me in respect of all international conflicts is the manner in which the arms trade is the real beneficiary and how very little has been done on an international basis to place restrictions on how the arms trade behaves.  This issue has never been tackled by the United Nations or internationally.  The arms trade has been given an absolute free hand and Europe must do something in that it plays a part in contributing to that trade.  Many countries within the European Union, including Ireland, make contributions to the arms trade and I reiterate the real beneficiaries in wars and conflicts are those who manufacture the arms and provide the munitions.  People have failed to face or stand up to this issue and Ireland should examine it during its Presidency of the European Union.  While I acknowledge it is not a very popular issue to raise, I believe it can no longer be ignored.  When one considers what is happening in Syria, where arms and munitions are coming in from all directions, many people are making much profit from that trade.  This is an issue we must face up to from a European perspective.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012092500019#RR00300","speaker":"1150","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348585500,"counter":164,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his attendance.  As other Members have noted, he has given them a good account of his visit, which has brought home to them the importance of being on the ground.  I believe Senator Mac Conghail referred to how there is a sense of powerlessness.  When something of this scale involving thousands of people in such difficulty takes place, it is very hard to believe Members speaking up can make a difference.  However, of course it does because were they to stay silent, they would appear to acquiesce and, consequently, they must continue to speak up and to maintain the pressure and must continue to remind themselves, other Irish people and the world of their concern in this regard.<\/p><p>The word &quot;crisis&quot; is too small to describe the devastating situation in Syria.  However, it is extraordinary to discover the matter of Syria is not on the formal agenda of the United Nations General Assembly meeting that opened yesterday.  I find this to be beyond belief.  The Minister of State may know the reason - I do not necessarily expect he does - and may be able to tell Members the reason.  I note this did not prevent the envoy, Lakhdar Brahimi, from expressing his views and thoughts, albeit in an informal manner.  His statement that matters are bad and getting worse gave Senator Mac Conghail the opportunity to mention that feeling of resignation.  This is a man of enormous experience who has worked in Haiti, Afghanistan and Iraq and who is a member of both the Elders and the Global Economic Forum.  Even though he has only been in the job for a mere month, if such a man returns from Syria to make such a statement, he really is saying much more than that.  While there is no easy answer to this, what he did was to make a real plea and a real cry for help.  Senator Healy Eames referred to a visit to Rwanda and as she noted in respect of the events there involving 1 million people and the Hutu and Tutsi, people stood aside and let that happen.  However, 18 years later, we are doing the same thing again for the past 18 months.  Today's report from the Save the Children charity is full of stories.  They have named the children in order that people can understand this is not merely bunches of thousands or hundreds of people.  This involves real children with real parents in real places being treated appallingly in the bus queue, buying bread, in the shops or in hospitals and schools.  They are being abused, tortured, kidnapped, imprisoned, murdered or bombed.  It is the same story from Amnesty International.  As a huge quantity of material is available, we are actually doing the same thing that was done previously in Rwanda.  I refer to Senator Healy Eames's comments on the legacy there 18, 28 and 30 years on.  Moreover, I note Kofi Annan, who was Secretary General of the United Nations at the time, has acknowledged he was wrong.  He played a considerable part in the decisions that were taken in that instance to do very little or nothing.<\/p><p>In this case, Ireland's role is smaller.  While it has punched above its weight in the United Nations, as other Members have noted, not being on the Security Council leaves it with a ringside seat only.  However, we must make use of that and it is clear that Syria is a political football.  I refer to the role of China and the Russian Federation on the one side and while Lakhdar Brahimi is stating things are getting worse, he effectively is stating that while the fighting is getting worse, the relationships on the Security Council also are worsening.  I do not know whether the Minister of State is in a position to tell Members whether Ireland, during its forthcoming Presidency of the European Union, has the capacity or willingness to use it as a wider platform to take on that debate at a political level.  I acknowledge this would not be not easy and do not suggest Ireland should simply go out and do it.  The matter is far too complex and I would not insult anyone's intelligence by suggesting that but I wonder where Ireland stands or whether it would be able to do this.  I acknowledge the Minister of State and others have called for many measures in support of human rights, such as referring Syria to the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court for investigation of crimes.  This should have been but has not been done by the Security Council of the United Nations.  The Government of Syria continues to not allow proper international human rights monitors into the country.  While these measures should be taken now, they are merely part of the immediate crisis.  As for the bigger political picture, however, while Ireland is small it will be stuck right in the middle of Europe -for want of a better way of putting it - in the next six months.<\/p> <p>I would like to believe the Government will not shirk from the responsibility and find a way to play a role in this matter.  Many of us have been on our feet in this House about this issue, and we will go on.  However, as Senator Mac Conghail says, sometimes we feel very powerless in this situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012092500019#SS00200","speaker":"1129","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348585500,"counter":166,"content":"<p>I thank the Senators for their incisive and knowledgeable input.

There is constant United Nations revision of the funding needs for the humanitarian aid response.

In March 2012 we gave \u20ac500,000 broken down as follows: the UNHCR got \u20ac200,000, the International Committee for the Red Cross-Red Crescent got \u20ac100,000, and the World Food Programme got \u20ac200,000.  In August we gave \u20ac1.6 million broken down as follows: the UNHCR got \u20ac500,000 plus \u20ac400,000 for non-food items, the ICRC got a further \u20ac300,000, the World Health Organization got \u20ac300,000, and the IRC got \u20ac100,000.<\/p><p>Already the United Nations has contacted us seeking further funding, in particular indicating it will need tents and materials for the winter, including blankets.  I have asked my staff to try to arrange a further shipment of up to 300 tents, 2,500 blankets and 3,000 jerry cans for the Sasari refugee camp, which represents a value of up to \u20ac150,000.  These items will be available from the Irish Aid stocks in Dubai.  Senator Heffernan mentioned the humanitarian hub we are seeking to establish in Shannon.  I have initiated a feasibility study of Shannon becoming a humanitarian depot, using the space available there to provide supplies of materials that can be used at short notice for humanitarian emergencies.  I expect to receive that report tomorrow and will study it carefully.  In due course I will let Senators know the outcome.  Ireland is to the fore in the quest to have depots throughout the world to provide a rapid response to earthquakes, tsunamis, famines, etc.  Ireland has a rapid response unit allowing us to immediately send into the field people who have technical abilities in areas such as medicine, tents, sewerage, civil engineering, etc.  A depot would allow those supplies to be transported immediately to any part of the world.<\/p><p>Senator Mooney spoke about the Palestinian population in Syria.  That area is very much a cockpit, with Syria right in the middle surrounded by countries such as Lebanon, Jordan, Iran and Iraq, with countries such as Qatar and Saudi Arabia further afield.  All have political interests in the area.  Some of them are fragile states and some are states which feel they have strategic interests in it.  In addition, the superpowers have strategic interests there.  As it is such a complex situation, it has been impossible to get UN Security Council agreement on a resolution.  Mr. Kofi Annan's six point plan begins with a ceasefire and the Security Council could not even reach agreement on that, which is outrageous.  The Security Council has been pretty much stymied in that respect and the six point plan has been made redundant.  Mr. Kofi Annan has resigned and has been replaced.<\/p><p>The Palestinian aspect is potentially quite serious because there are already 2 million displaced Palestinians in Jordan, for example.  There are also displaced Palestinians in Lebanon, Iraq and Turkey.  However, Jordan is particularly affected, not to mention Gaza.  There are 500,000 in the Damascus area, which is not far from either Jordan or Lebanon.  If 500,000 Palestinians came into Jordan, it would result in Palestinians becoming the majority population in Jordan because Palestine is a small country.  This would create a major logistical and political issue.  There is real concern among the Jordanian population at the possibility of having such a massive influx of Palestinians and there is the real danger of them closing their borders because it would result in a disproportionate element to the population.  That is quite serious and it is equally serious for Lebanon and could have a major impact on what are fragile countries in political terms.<\/p><p>Senator Mooney mentioned the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, UNRWA, and we are in contact with it.  Representatives of UNRWA will visit the country shortly given the possibility of something along the lines of what we have been discussing arising.  Mr. Filippo Grandi, the commissioner general of UNRWA, will visit Ireland shortly to discuss matters of this nature with the T\u00e1naiste and me.  He will seek funding and support, obviously, in dealing with that sort of displacement, particularly as it might affect the Palestinian community.  There is flux in all these situations and we are addressing them as best we can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012092500019#TT00200","speaker":"1006"},{"type":"speech","time":1348585500,"counter":167,"content":"<p>It might help to stabilise the Palestinian issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012092500019#TT00300","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1348585500,"counter":168,"content":"<p>It is vital we stabilise the Palestinian issue because it could have a knock-on effect throughout the Middle East and further afield.<\/p><p>A number of Senators asked how we would address the issue of human rights.  We have raised the issue at every level, including at European Union level where we have sanctions.  We have raised it in respect of the International Criminal Court at the United Nations.  Unfortunately, as Senator O'Keeffe mentioned, we cannot get the issues relating to Syria referred to the International Criminal Court.  It can only be done through the Security Council, which must agree to it.  We are working with other countries to get such agreement.<\/p> <p> The same problems have arisen in regard to getting agreement on intervention in Syria and on the arms embargo and so on.  There are countries that are sending arms into Syria on both sides and using Syria for their own political purposes.  It is difficult to move forward while this continues.  The Security Council is not agreed on a way forward.  We will continue to raise the matter at the United Nations.  While the issue is not directly on the agenda of the United Nations, which I do not understand, <i>en marge <\/i>there will be substantial meetings in regard to the Friends of Palestine getting together to try to agree a formula for progress in that respect.<\/p><p> I have mentioned that the Human Rights Council is meeting in Geneva.  While I do not wish to be over-enthusiastic about a possible resolution it is encouraging that the Russian federation is, for the first time, engaging with the Arab League, which is the body more likely to have some clout in this area than would perhaps some other countries.  Russia is an important player in this.  In many ways, China is taking its lead from Russia.  Russia has important strategic interests and wants to see how they are going to be protected.  As far as I can gather, none of the countries are carrying a torch for the Assad regime but are all concerned about what will happen if that regime collapses.  For this reason, it is very important - we have also been calling for this - that the disparate groups in the opposition, of which there are so many, come together and agree a cohesive position which ensures they are seen as a negotiating group.  Negotiation will probably be the solution to the problem.  Substantial parts of the population of Syria and substantial other countries support the Assad regime.  As such, it is likely there will eventually be a negotiated solution.  It is important in this regard that there is a transitional process and an opposition within Syria that can negotiate that process because there will be no internal intervention.<\/p><p> There is no question of military intervention in this case because there is no agreement among the various powers.  The situation in Syria is not at all like that which pertained in Libya.  There was no problem in regard to the Security Council.  If there is any interference in Syria, Russia and China will view it as military interference in respect of which they are not in agreement.  That in itself could create its own problems.  The general opinion abroad is that unless there is a movement on the chemical weapons in Syria it is unlikely there will be military intervention.  The fear in this respect is that the situation would only go from bad to worse.  As such, that is not going to happen, particularly in the short term.  <\/p><p> While there might be  prevailing air of powerlessness, that does not mean we will not continue to argue strongly for a humanitarian exercise in Syria.  There have been improvements in this area.  Currently, 19 local and eight international non-governmental organisations are granted access by the regime.  This means that the United Nations now has much greater access than it had.  For example, the United Nations world food programme, which is by far the largest humanitarian food aid programme in the world, which deals with the humanitarian hubs and aid depots and so on, is reaching 850,000 people each month in all of the 14 governor areas in the country.  It is reaching government and opposition controlled areas and aims to reach 1.5 million people through food distribution by the end of this month.  That is huge progress on the situation which prevailed a couple of months ago, when there was virtually no access granted to any international organisation other than the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.  When we spoke to those organisations a few weeks ago, they expressed the concern that despite the fact that they had official approval by the regime to access all areas of Syria in practice that was not the case.  They said that security was a major issue for them in accessing certain areas.<\/p><p> Senator Mullins asked about the Syrian-Irish humanitarian forum.  I have met that organisation on three or four occasions and I am sympathetic to what it has to say.  There is a fine bunch of people involved, some of whom are Irish and others of whom are Syrian, including Syrian medical professionals.  In the early stages, they were anxious that mechanisms be found to get food and medical supplies and equipment to areas of greatest need because this could not easily be done by other organisations owing to the limited access being permitted by the regime.  We explored this and learned that even the mechanisms which they used in terms of mobile hospitals within Syria had been seized of their supplies.  We could not go down the road of providing supplies unless we were working with accredited organisations.  We took up this matter directly with the United Nations, which argued the case in respect of the world food aid programme and secured access points.  The supplies we provide are delivered through accredited organisations such as the United Nations and the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.<\/p><p> Mention was made of having an air, food or humanitarian corridor, which would be impossible to do because they could only be protected through military intervention, which itself was a problem.  We will continue to examine by what avenues it is possible to get aid, supplies and medicines to civilians in need of it, regardless of what part of the country they are located, be they controlled by the regime or some of the opposition free Syrian army groups and so on.  As I stated, there is currently greater access to both areas.  We hope this will continue.  It is always useful to hear what is happening from people engaged on the ground, to whom we will respond as best we can.<\/p><p> On the question of what Lakhdar Brahimi will do, Mr. Brahimi is a person with huge credentials.  He was very candid about the fact that it was an uphill struggle, that he was operating with a redundant six point plan and that the Security Council rendered him powerless.  However, he is talking to people and is endeavouring to talk to the Syrian regime.  He has been in dialogue with the Arab League in particular, including Egypt, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Iran and is seeking to leverage their influence in relation to the crisis.  Mr. Brahimi is trying to organise inclusive dialogue - he is also talking to the Russians and Chinese - on the subject.  He is a man with considerable political skills.  I hope he makes some progress in that respect.  In the meantime we will continue to do what we can.<\/p> <p>A major OSCE meeting is taking place on 6 and 7 December, with 56 countries present.  That will be a feature of the debate.  The Presidency will begin in January and it is an issue on which we hope to make progress in terms of what the European Union can do.  The EU is the only organisation with sanctions at present and we will try to extend them and introduce an arms embargo in respect of Syria.  We will also try to make progress on humanitarian aid and gaining full access to Syria in that respect.  There are other aspects that people forget.  Schools are occupied by refugees and we must then consider where children can get education.  Today, I heard that the Zaateri camp I was in will have sufficient prefab units to enable 2,000 children to start education tomorrow.  That is only a drop in the ocean.  Winter is coming and that camp was chosen because Jordan is a country with so little water and that it is one area where adequate underground water can be accessed.  It is in the desert, close to the border with Syria.  It is a bad spot in the winter and can get very cold.  It is a tough area and the same applies to Turkey and Lebanon.<\/p><p>I am delighted to come to the Seanad to deal with the major conflict and Syria.  It could become the next major world conflict and we must do whatever we can.  We will continue to monitor the situation and use every avenue at our disposal to make a contribution to dealing with it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012092500019#TT00400","speaker":"1006","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348585500,"counter":171,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to sit again?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012092500019#VV00200","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1348585500,"counter":172,"content":"<p>Maidin am\u00e1rach ar 10.30.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012092500019#VV00300","speaker":"1130"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Adjournment Matters","time":1348585500,"counter":173,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012092500019#VV00400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects","time":1348585500,"counter":174,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012092500019#VV00500"},{"type":"speech","time":1348585500,"counter":175,"content":"<p>Senators are expected to cover the whole country, not just constituencies.

There is no better place to be for the summer.  I thank the Minister for giving of his time.  The meeting was a positive step and put the topic on the table.  It has been on the agenda for over ten years.  The current school was designed to accommodate 250 pupils in 1974 but the original design was never completed.  The school is in poor condition.  A detailed technical evaluation showed that the school building was unsuitable.  Two independent studies were carried out in 2000 and in 2003.  The second study concluded that the problems identified with the building were such that they could not be resolved except through the provision of a new building.  The conclusion was accepted by the Department of Education and Science in 2003.  The problem is not resolved.  Following on from the meeting between Community School Initiative: Clifden and the Minister, there is a new plan for special consideration for school projects in isolated areas, as opposed to areas with population growth.  The Minister mentioned a plan to take into account schools in isolated areas so that criteria can be used for selection and advancement on the five-year list for schools in isolated areas.  Does the Minister of State have any news on this?<\/p><p>We are living in unprecedented economic circumstances but a new school for the area is a priority.  If one uses the criteria for population growth to get new schools on the list, one will be waiting forever for Clifden.  With unemployment, emigration and location on the western seaboard, the existing criteria alone cannot be used.  I ask the Minister to take into account criteria other than population growth.  He should also consider the isolation of the area and outline the new criteria used.<\/p><p>I ask the Minister of State to explain the timeline of when this project will be realistic.  Plans come and plans go and five-year plans are developed.  This project is not currently included in the five-year plan.  Some projects may be cancelled or will not go ahead and if other criteria are used now that were not used in the past, perhaps the Minister can explain the timeline envisaged for the commencement or completion of the new school.  I do not want it on the back burner.  I thank the Minister for meeting Community School Initiative: Clifden but meetings are one thing whereas actions are another.  I want to see some follow-up.  I ask the Minister of State for a timeline and hope he has the information in time to respond to this Adjournment debate.  If not, perhaps he can e-mail or write to me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012092500019#VV00800","speaker":"1135"},{"type":"speech","time":1348585500,"counter":178,"content":"<p>I am responding on behalf of the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair\u00ed Quinn.  I thank the Senator for raising the issue relating to Clifden community school and welcome the opportunity to clarify the current position on the new school building project for Clifden.<\/p><p>Clifden community school is the only second level school in the Clifden post-primary feeder area.  There are 14 primary schools in the feeder area.  The enrolments at primary level have remained stable, with 656 pupils in 2001-02 and 654 pupils in 2010-11.  The Department's projected enrolments show a slight decrease over the coming years, with a projected figure of 627 primary level pupils in 2017.<\/p><p>The design of the proposed new school building for Clifden community school has been developed based on a long-term projected enrolment of 425 pupils.  The current enrolment is just over 400 pupils and enrolment levels have been relatively stable in recent years.  Full planning permission for the new school was granted in February 2011.  The school's design team have recently submitted the stage 2(b) reports that include the detailed design of the school and tender documents.  The submission is under review by the Department.<\/p><p>In view of the need to ensure that every child has access to a school place, the delivery of major school projects to meet the demographic demands nationally will be the main focus for capital investment in schools over those years.  Total school enrolments are expected to grow by around 70,000 students between now and 2018 - by over 45,000 at primary level and 25,000 at post-primary.  Second level enrolment is expected to continue to rise until at least 2024.<\/p> <p>Recent birth rate data published by the CSO show that there were nearly 20,000 births registered in the first quarter of 2011, the highest number of births registered in a quarter since the series began in 1960.  It is vital that the schooling system be prepared to cope with these increasing numbers.  Therefore, the Government's priority is now to focus on major school projects to meet these demographic demands.  In order to meet the needs of our growing population of schoolgoing children, the Department must establish new schools in addition to extending or replacing a number of existing schools in areas where demographic growth has been identified.  The delivery of these new schools, together with extension projects to meet future demand, will be the main focus for the Department's capital budget for the coming years.  In March 2012, the Minister, Deputy Quinn, announced a five-year construction programme as part of a \u20ac2 billion capital investment programme, which outlined all the major school building projects at primary and post-primary levels which had been scheduled to commence construction over the timeframe.  The project announced will account for the bulk of the capital funding available each year from 2012 to 2016.  In that context, it was not possible to advance all applications for capital funding concurrently.<\/p><p>All other schools building projects within the architectural planning process, including the project for Clifden community school, will continue to be advanced incrementally in the context of the funding available.  However, in light of current competing demands on the Department's capital budget, it is not possible at this time to progress the project at Clifden community school to tender and construction stages.  I understand the Minister attended a meeting during his summer holiday period in Clifden with members of CSI Clifden and the board of management.  Officials of the planning and building unit in the Department held a meeting last July with a delegation from the patron body and the board of management in which the current position was fully explained to the delegation.

I wish to raise the issue of ground rents, a long-standing issue for many individuals and families in the State.  Ground rents are something of an oddity and an anomaly, but they do not comprise a benign anomaly.  They are, in effect, a hangover from a colonial past.  It is shameful that, almost 100 years since the proclamation of the Irish Republic, citizens are still paying rent to absentee landlords.  I refer not only to individual citizens as I understand the Office of Public Works pays ground rent of &#8364;14.44 per annum to the Duke of Leinster for the National Library of Ireland's premises.  While this may be seen as a small amount, it is preposterous that State and Government buildings are still subject to ground rents to absentee landlords.<\/p><p>  Ground rent landlords do not need to be compensated in the event of the abolition of ground rents.  As a legacy of colonialism, ground rents have been unjust from the beginning.  Therefore, compensation would legitimise what is manifestly unjust.  Those who are bearing the real brunt of this ongoing ground rents fiasco are those private homeowners who find that their ground rent leases are about to expire and who face having to choose between buying out their ground rent lease, paying one eighth of the value of their home to the ground rent landlord or renewing the lease for a far higher rate than they had previously been paying.  People are faced with demands for huge sums from the ground rent landlords and this is causing severe hardship for many.<\/p><p>  I was motivated to raise this issue because I was contacted by the chairperson of the Lismore Park residents' association in Waterford, an association that covers hundreds of houses in Lismore Park, Lismore Heights and Lismore Lawn in Waterford city.  Many people find that their leases are up for renewal and they face bills.  The alternative for those who cannot afford to buy out the expired lease is to sign a renewal of the lease for 35 years.  Many of those who find themselves in this invidious position are elderly and have no income other than their pensions.  The rents are an unjust feudal imposition and are uncommon and unacceptable in many other countries.  Ground rents primarily affect elderly people whose leases often expire when they reach a senior age.  Ground rent landlords and their legal professionals capitalise actively on the frailty of the elderly.<\/p><p>  I will not get into the detail of the Shirley case, of which I am sure the Minister of State is aware.  Based on this case, the T\u00e1naiste and the Taoiseach once made very clear commitments that, if they ever were in government, they would legislate on this issue.  When in opposition, the Taoiseach, when supporting a Fianna F\u00e1il-led Bill following the Shirley case, stated his party shared the then Government's view on the important issue and looked forward to being in a position to act following the general election.  He was speaking about abolishing ground rents.<\/p><p>  In March 2007 when in opposition, Deputy Gilmore, now T\u00e1naiste, said:<ul>As you know, the Labour Party wishes to abolish ground rents.  As you know we brought forward a Private Members&#8217; Bill some time ago to this effect.  If in government, we intend to introduce legislation along those lines.<\/ul>Where is this legislation?  Is what I propose legislatively possible?  I believe so and the Taoiseach and the T\u00e1naiste believed so when in opposition.  We owe it to the citizens who live in Lismore Park, Lismore Lawn and Lismore Heights in Waterford and to many others across the State in the same circumstances.  It is unacceptable that this has not been fully resolved.  It is a hangover from our colonial past and we should deal with it.  We have a responsibility regarding the affected citizens.  I look forward to the Minister of State's response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012092500019#WW00500","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speech","time":1348585500,"counter":184,"content":"<p>I am standing in for my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, who is unavailable.  I thank the Senator for raising this matter on the Adjournment.  The Minister has asked me to inform the House that he is not in a position to comment on the particular situation in the Lismore Park area of Waterford but welcomes this opportunity to outline the current situation with regard to ground rents.<\/p><p>The rights of tenants occupying residential property under long leases have been under discussion since the latter half of the 19th century.  In such situations, the tenant normally pays a ground rent to the landlord.  The problem that arises is the tenant's rights on expiry of such a lease.  Under common law, the land and buildings reverted to the ground landlord leaving tenants with no right to compensation for losing the houses they, or their predecessors, had bought and no guarantee of any renewal or extension of their leases.  In the event of renewal or extension, there was no guarantee that the terms were fair or reasonable.<\/p><p>A number of changes in the law during the 20th century greatly improved the situation for tenants.  Under the Landlord and Tenant Act 1931, as amended by the Landlord and Tenant Act 1943, tenants with a &quot;long family equity&quot; became entitled to new tenancies on expiry of the original lease, or up to seven years before expiry, at rents fixed by the Circuit Court, in default of agreement.  The Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act 1967 gave tenants the right to acquire the freehold - that is, to acquire the fee simple - of the property.  The ground landlord has no option in the matter.  The Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act 1978 prohibited the creation of new ground rents in respect of dwellings, and leases after that date are only valid if they operate as a renewal of an existing lease.  The Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No.2) Act 1978 simplified procedures and gave the Land Registry, now the Property Registration Authority, responsibility for operating a special scheme for dwelling houses.  This scheme greatly reduces the costs involved for tenants and, to date, over 80,000 ground rents have been bought out under this scheme.  Of course, other ground rents may have been dealt with without recourse to the scheme.<\/p><p>In summary, the Landlord and Tenant Acts from 1967 to 2005 have improved conditions for ground rent tenants and contain provisions which permit certain tenants to acquire the fee simple, thereby ending their liability for the payment of ground rent to the ground rent landlord.  The Acts provide a general right to such tenants to acquire the fee simple and for mechanisms for determining the purchase price in order to compensate the landlord.  One further aspect of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act 1978 worth noting is that section 27 provides that a landlord cannot re-enter or take possession of a premises where the tenant is in arrears with a ground rent.  While prohibiting the creation of new ground rents on dwellings, the 1978 Act did not abolish existing ground rents and this has given rise to periodic demands for their abolition.<\/p><p>The position on the possible abolition of ground rents is that legal advice obtained from the Attorney General's office in recent years has drawn attention to possible constitutional difficulties with proposals to abolish remaining ground rents.<\/p> <p>These relate mainly to the possible infringement of property rights.  First, difficulties in respect of the rights of tenants could arise by forcing such a tenant to acquire the fee simple, that is, the act of transforming a current right into an obligation.  Such a tenant may have no wish to purchase the ground rent, or not immediately at any rate.  The current scheme is open ended.  On the other hand, a tenant might not be able to afford the purchase price despite the reasonable way in which it is calculated.  Second, removing for compensation purposes the distinction between leases with more than 15 years to run and those that have either expired or have less than 15 years to run could be seen as infringing upon the property rights of ground landlords.  Third, securing payment of the ground rent purchase price as a charge on the property, for example, in order that the tenant does not need to pay cash up front for the buy-out of the ground rent, could also create problems, in that there could be an accumulation of interest charges until the dwelling changed hands.  Payment of the accumulated debt might then require that the property be sold.<\/p><p>The Minister, Deputy Shatter, would add that the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution, which published its ninth progress report, dealing with private property, in April 2004, also noted that a ground landlord's ground rent represented a right to an income that, in principle, was constitutionally protected and that any legislation to abolish ground rents must include a scheme of adequate compensation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012092500019#WW00600","speaker":"1042","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348585500,"counter":186,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response.

The motion was passed and forwarded to the Minister.  Perhaps he decided to reinstate the centre on the list in response to those representations.<\/p><p>The people of Kells deserve to know the up-to-date position.

I welcome the opportunity to outline the current position on Kells primary health care centre.  As the Senator is aware, the programme for Government sets out the Government's commitment to ensuring a better and more efficient health system and a single tier health service that will deliver equal access to health care based on need, not income.  In a developed primary care system, up to 95% of people's day-to-day health and social care needs can be met in the primary care setting.  The key objective of the primary care strategy is to develop services in the community that will give people direct access to integrated multidisciplinary teams of general practitioners, GPs, nurses, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and other health care disciplines.  This is central to the Government's objective of delivering a high quality, integrated and cost-effective health system.<\/p><p>A modern, well equipped primary care infrastructure is central to the effective functioning of primary care teams.  These teams enable multidisciplinary services to be delivered on a single site, provide a single point of access for users and encourage closer co-ordination between health providers.  The infrastructure development, through a combination of public and private investment, will facilitate the delivery of multidisciplinary primary health care and represents a tangible refocusing of the health service to deliver care in the most appropriate and lowest cost setting.<\/p><p>The intention to date has been that, where appropriate, infrastructure for primary care centres would be provided by the private sector through negotiated lease agreements.  The Exchequer will also fund the delivery of some primary care centres, particularly in deprived urban areas, small rural towns and isolated areas.  In addition, a list of 35 potential locations for development by way of PPP as part of the Government's infrastructure stimulus package was published in July.<\/p><p>The provision of a centre in Kells has been progressed to date by way of a private sector operational lease process.  Submissions were assessed by the HSE.  A preferred provider was identified that satisfied the HSE key criteria and offered acceptable accommodation, in development, at a suitable location on the Dublin road in the town.  An agreement for lease was reached with the preferred provider in 2010 and planning permission was received for the approximately 30,000 sq. ft. development.  However the preferred provider has not been able to deliver the new primary care accommodation, due mainly to funding difficulties.<\/p><p>The HSE continues to engage with the preferred provider in the hope that the facility might be delivered within the timeframes of the agreement.  While it continues to consider the possibility of delivering the centre by the private sector operational lease process, it is also considering alternative mechanisms and opportunities, including the PPP process.  Kells is included in the locations being considered by the HSE for the Government's infrastructure stimulus package.  Accordingly, the HSE is engaging with GPs in the area to assess GP interest and determine how best to deliver primary care accommodation in Kells.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012092500019#XX00600","speaker":"1042"},{"type":"speech","time":1348585500,"counter":191,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.

I emphasise the Government's continued commitment to promoting respect for human rights and equality of opportunity in Irish society.  Tolerance of homophobic bullying is simply not compatible with respect for the intrinsic dignity of each human being.<\/p><p>Good humoured, if sometimes robust, teasing and banter between colleagues, classmates and team mates are part of the culture of modern Ireland.  It has an important place in social interaction, in building camaraderie and friendships.  It can nudge us out of depression, help us see the funny side of situations, think more optimistically and can add enormously to the quality of life.  There is, however, another darker side.  Without good will, empathy or respect for others, what seemingly starts off as banter can quickly turn sour.  To put this in context, the ground-breaking 2009 survey of Irish lebian, gay, bisexual and transgender, LGBT, people, &quot;Supporting LGBT Lives&quot;, found that to avoid being threatened or called abusive names by work colleagues, almost one in ten respondents had missed work.<\/p><p>Bullying can be insidious.  The dividing line between acceptable and unacceptable behaviour is often a fine one.  This is a question to which the Oireachtas has given careful consideration.  In laws enacted by these Houses, we have defined bullying as repeated inappropriate behaviour, direct or indirect, whether verbal, physical or otherwise, conducted by one or more persons against another or others, and which could reasonably be regarded as undermining the individual's right to dignity.  In the work environment, an isolated incident may be an affront to dignity but, as a once-off incident, is not considered to be bullying.  I should stress, however, that it can he harassment.  Harassment, in equality law, is any form of unwanted conduct related to any of the discriminatory grounds, such as gender or sexual orientation, which has either the purpose or effect of violating a person's dignity and of creating an environment for the person that is intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive.  Such conduct may consist of spoken words, actions or gestures. It may also consist of the production, display or circulation of written words, pictures or other material.<\/p><p>These are powerful definitions.  They make it quite clear that certain kinds of behaviour are totally unacceptable in law.  This is not because of any concerns of political correctness.  Such kinds of behaviour are unacceptable precisely because they are harmful, both to the individuals targeted and to wider society.  This point should by now be beyond dispute.<\/p><p>We know that bullying and harassment cause harm.  If Senators are not familiar with the 2008 &quot;Supporting LGBT Lives&quot; study, I urge them to read it.  For the most vulnerable, this research showed heightened levels of psychological distress arising from stigmatisation and harassment, leading to significant levels of self-harm and thoughts of suicide.  Being physically threatened or attacked, or experiencing homophobic bullying in schools, were identified as risk factors for those who attempted suicide.  Recent research from the United States goes further, and suggests identity-based bullying, such as homophobic bullying, impacts more severely on the victim than other forms of bullying.<\/p> <p>It is quite clear in the employment context that bullying impacts on health and safety.  Harassment on the ground of sexual orientation or gender identity is also a form of discrimination and as such is prohibited.  A workplace in which bullying and harassment are tolerated and allowed to continue is neither a safe nor a productive environment for any of the persons working there.  In other areas of public life, such as in accessing health care, education, transport, clubs and sports, harassment on the grounds of sexual orientation or gender identity is also prohibited under the Equal Status Act.<\/p><p>There are means in law of pursuing complaints and seeking redress where a person has suffered bullying or harassment.  We are strengthening these mechanisms with the forthcoming merger of the Equality Authority and Irish Human Rights Commission and the formation of the new workplace relations service, which will incorporate the Equality Tribunal.  These new structures will be simpler and easier for members of the public to find and to deal with, and will provide more effective means of enforcing decisions.<\/p><p>I would like to focus, however, on preventive measures.  Combating homophobic bullying and harassment successfully requires action on a number of levels.  It starts with a recognition that a problem exists.  The key to this has to be education, which extends into every facet of public life from school to work to community activities.  In this regard, I cannot overstate the value of the persistent advocacy of NGOs representing LGBT people and their generosity in sharing their knowledge and skills.  I refer to one example, a short video from BeLonGTo encouraging young people to support their LGBT friends called &quot;Stand Up! Don't stand for homophobic bullying&quot;, which is currently the most viewed video posted online by an Irish charity with more than 1 million views.  This also features in the first UN global campaign to tackle homophobic bullying, which serves to demonstrate the universal application and importance of this message.<\/p><p>Debates in public foras such as today's, and last May's D\u00e1il debate on bullying in schools, also play an important part in normalising discussion of matters related to sexual orientation and, in particular, informing the public about the issue of homophobia.  It is a matter for us, as public representatives, to promote respect for the rule of law and to challenge breaches of human rights as we see them, to do our utmost to encourage the businesses, employers, schools and voluntary groups in our communities and to take simple and practical steps to embed respect for all persons in the way their staff, customers or members interact.<\/p><p>What are these steps?  For businesses, they start with taking note of two codes of practices, on bullying and on harassment and sexual harassment, respectively.  It is a matter of great credit to the Equality Authority that we have had a statutory code of practice on harassment and sexual harassment in the workplace since 2002.  This code was updated earlier this year and it is a powerful tool for employers who want to get things right.  Advice and support on giving effect to the code is available to them from the Equality Authority.  Moreover, a practical guide for employers on lesbian, gay and bisexual diversity in the workplace is available from GLEN, having been developed with support from the Equality Authority and others.  In addition to tackling workplace bullying and harassment, this involves building a culture of respect in the organisation, recruiting and selecting fairly, reviewing terms and conditions of employment, and managing performance fairly . Community and voluntary groups, sports clubs and associations are encouraged to develop equal status action plans.  The education sector, in post-primary schools in particular, has seen a sustained focus over the past decade on tackling bullying.  Considerable work has been done by State agencies and NGOs such as the Gay + Lesbian Equality Network, GLEN, and BeLonGTo.<\/p><p>Most recently, the anti-bullying forum established last May by the Minister for Education and Skills brought together a range of experts, support groups and representatives of the schools sector to explore ways of tackling bullying in schools.  The outcomes, recommendations and submissions from this forum are assisting the dedicated working group set up by the Minister to consider further actions required to tackle bullying in schools, including homophobic bullying, cyber bullying and racist bullying, in particular.  A key element in dealing with the problem of bullying is having a school culture of awareness of the seriousness of the issue and having in place a whole school approach to dealing with it.<\/p> <p> Anti-bullying policies work best where the entire school community, including school management, authorities, staff, students and parents all support and adhere to them.  None of these measures on their own will eliminate completely homophobic bullying but used consistently and effectively, they can and will demonstrate such behaviour is unacceptable in a civilised society and has adverse consequences for bullies and their employers.  We must now seek to address how we can deepen the impact of the measures that already are in place, as well as strengthening the culture of awareness in schools and businesses.  I look forward to hearing the debate today, which always is both interesting and informed.  There may be a question and answer session later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012092500022#W00200","speaker":"982","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348587300,"counter":202,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.  I welcome both her contribution and that Members specifically are debating homophobic bullying today.  Although they have had debates in the past on mental health and bullying in general, as the Minister of State has pointed out, while all young people are at risk of bullying and intimidation in schools, young lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender, LGBT, people experience far higher incidences in this regard.  Bullying at school is a huge risk factor for self-harm and suicide.  The research presented to the Department's forum on bullying by the Gay + Lesbian Equality Network, GLEN, and BeLonGTo shows the stark reality in this regard, which is that 27% of LGBT young people have self-harmed, 50% of those under 25 have thought seriously about ending their own lives and 20% of those under 25 have attempted suicide.  This is the stark reality of the issue under discussion today.  Bullying of any sort directed at any victim is designed to cause hurt and fear and to make the other person feel small.  However, in the case of homophobic and biphobic bullying, it is also designed to make the other person ashamed of who he or she is and who he or she loves.  Fear in this regard means that over generations, many young people have gone in and out of schools feeling miserable and afraid on a daily basis.  Moreover, fear they might be bullied has led to many people being afraid to reveal their true identity while at school on something as core as who they have fallen in love with and for this experience to carry on with them for a long time thereafter, as well as to make LGBT people invisible, not just in schools but in many parts of wider society as a whole.<\/p><p>It is welcome that much work has been done in recent years.  The Minister of State rightly recognised the leadership GLEN and BeLonGTo have shown on this issue.  It also is fair to recognise the teacher unions and management bodies have shown great leadership on this issue by coming together as a broad coalition and developing guidelines for schools.  This sent out a message from the higher levels of the teacher unions and management bodies that they take seriously and seek the engagement of their members with the issues of diversity and tackling discrimination and prejudice, which is important.  While it is good that such guidelines are in place, as with any policy the key issue is implementation and making sure they make a real difference on the ground.  I welcome the participation of GLEN and BeLonGTo in the Department of Education and Skill's group examining the issue of bullying.  I understand good work is being done there and the group is examining homophobic bullying in the context of prejudice in general because it is no different, no less ugly and no less harmful than are racism or discrimination against people with disabilities and should be seen in that context.  At the same time, it is important to make a distinction in respect of homophobic bullying, in that one should introduce it in the overall context of discrimination but should have specific strategies to deal with it.  A large part of that strategy concerns educating young people on diversity and difference, which can be complicated work.  It is known from research to which teachers have provided feedback that many teachers feel awkward about this issue.  I refer to teachers who would like to take a positive role but who are unsure about how to address it.<\/p> <p>It is important that we equip them to do that.  Bullying is one extreme but, of course, it must be seen in the context of the broader mental health agenda and the Minister of State's own brief.  This is because positive mental health is important, as is teaching young people how to look after themselves and have the courage to seek help if they are worried before they end up depressed or harm themselves and teaching everybody to look out for each other.  Prevention is always better than ending up with victims and having to have a disciplinary policy.  <\/p><p>It is important that we have a way of teaching young people about the differences between different LGBT identities.  I visited the Liberal Democrats' conference in Brighton over the weekend.  I had the privilege of attending a session that its LGBT group and the British organisation, Stonewall, ran on homophobic bullying.  They are dealing with the same issues as us.  It is the same in other European countries from which we can learn.  One thing that came across quite strongly was that when we are dealing with homophobic bullying, we must be careful not to phrase the debate as being either heterosexual or homosexual - there are so many different identities.  Bisexual young people often feel alienated by that and a different approach is needed with transgender young people, which must be backed up by the overall State response to gender recognition.  It is all very well to give a message in schools but what if we are not supporting it outside?  <\/p><p>In that context, I refer to section 37(1) of the Employment Equality Act.  We debated it here a number of months ago and there was support on all sides of the House for it to be changed.  I do not know if the Minister of State will get an opportunity to speak again but perhaps she could speak to me afterwards to update me on what progress, if any, has been made in that regard.  Again, it is all very well to teach young people that everybody is equal but if their teachers and role models are not equal and people are not treated with respect in the workplace, what message does that send out?  It is contradictory and I hope progress has been made on that because it is urgent.  <\/p><p>In that context, I also mention marriage equality.  Again, all of this is so important in this broader context if we are going to truly recognise and celebrate diversity and genuinely recognise everybody for who they are and the value of their relationships.  The reason young LGBT people are uncomfortable about who they are or are scared to admit who they are is not just because of their peers in the classroom but about the broader messages they get from society.  It is long past time that we recognised that every committed relationship should be regarded with the same level of respect and recognition.  <\/p><p>I think I have covered all the main points.  I am slightly disorganised because I have just come back from a conference last night.  I wanted to make the point that the issue should be seen in the broader context of mental health.  I know the Minister of State recognised it in her contribution but I would stress the importance of peer groups.  The Stand Up! video was incredible.  This short piece presents messages, not just about homophobic, biphobic or transphobic bullying, but about bullying in general and teaching all our young people to stand up for their friends.  It promotes the idea that if one sees a friend being isolated and discriminated against, one backs him or her up and makes the bully feel like he or she is the idiot and the one who should be isolated and ashamed.<\/p><p>In addition to having strategies for teachers, boards of management and different groups, it is so important that we equip young people with the skills to look after themselves and others and that we bring parents into that debate.  It is also important that we ensure that when we have a more detailed strategy and, crucially, an implementation plan for dealing with homophobic bullying in schools, it is a whole-community approach.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012092500024#Y00200","speaker":"1154","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348587600,"counter":204,"content":"<p>I also welcome the Minister of State to the House.  We are all aware of her commitment to and support for LGBT issues.<\/p><p>  In a message delivered at a UN global consultation on homophobic bullying in Rio de Janeiro last December, the UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, referred to homophobic bullying as follows:<ul>This is a moral outrage, a grave violation of human rights and a public health crisis.  It is also a loss for the entire human family when promising lives are cut short.<\/ul><\/p> <p>He called on governments throughout the world to act to protect lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender young people.  Also in December, the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights released a groundbreaking report on the human rights of LGBT people.  Therefore, it is clear that the issue of homophobic bullying is one that is of high importance at an international level.  What exactly is it?  It can be defined as any hostile or offensive action against lesbians, gay males, bisexuals or transgender people, or those perceived to be lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender.  These actions might be verbal, physical or emotional harassment, including degrading comments, name calling, gestures, taunts, insults or jokes.  An excellent example of this was contained in the Stand Up! video which hit home succinctly but got the point across.  It can also include offensive graffiti, humiliating, excluding, tormenting, ridiculing or threatening to refuse to work or co-operate with others because of their sexual orientation or identity.  They are terms that can be used for bullying in every sense.  It is good that today we are concentrating on homophobic bullying and looking at it in context and in isolation.<\/p><p>While most adults in Ireland can be open about their sexual orientation, the reality for young people is very different.  The teenage years are a challenging time for everybody but for those who think they might be gay, lesbian or bisexual it can be even more bewildering.  In the past, homophobic bullying was viewed as not too serious, a bit of banter or teasing among youngsters that took place in the schoolyard, youth club or in the sports ground.  However, it is recognised that this type of bullying is not only harmful, it is costing young people their lives.  <\/p><p>The National Office for Suicide Prevention annual report 2009 showed that LGBT persons had shockingly high levels of suicidal behaviours.  This was clearly linked to the experiences of homophobic bullying.  The study found that 50% of LGBT young people under the age of 25 had seriously thought about ending their lives while a staggering 20% had attempted suicide.  The study also revealed that the majority of bullying was taking place in schools and up to one third of these young people had been subjected to homophobic comments from teachers.  As a former teacher, I found this shocking coming from those who are supposed to be teaching and leading.  It is important that adequate training is provided for them and that we are all singing from the same hymn sheet. <\/p><p>International research has shown that for many, homophobic bullying at school can result in long-term social, emotional and psychological effects.  Those who are bullied at school can become fearful of their peer group and isolate themselves from them.  The young person who is repeatedly bullied at school can experience anxiety, loss of confidence, loneliness and depression which can result in problems such as punctuality, deteriorating academic attainment, poor attendance, truancy, dropping out, mental health problems and the idea of suicide.  The findings are worrying and upsetting.  In the review of the junior certificate, I hope subjects such as SPHE may be given a firm footing on the curriculum and that adequate training for SPHE is provided for the teachers concerned.<\/p><p>Equality legislation protects the rights of everyone in the State at places of work or places of leisure, transport and health care.  All areas of our daily lives should be free from discrimination on grounds of gender, marital status, family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability and race.  Specifically, the Education (Welfare) Act 2000 requires schools to prepare a code of behaviour that specifies the standards of behaviour to be observed by students.  All second level schools are required to have a number of policies in place, including one on bullying.  <\/p><p>In August 2006, in order to reduce the administrative burden on schools, the Department of Education and Skills issued a template anti-bullying policy.  This template built on previously issued guidelines on countering bullying in schools and included references to homophobic bullying.<\/p> <p>This was a major step forward in breaking the silence and invisibility that often surrounds homophobic bullying in Irish second level schools, even at a policy level.  Research carried out in the schools has established that while anti-bullying policies, campaigns and initiatives are working very well in most schools, there is an obvious reluctance on the part of many schools to be specific on the issues of homophobic bullying.  This must be changed urgently.  A school ethos cannot be rooted in the presumption that everybody in the school is heterosexual.  School leaders will have to challenge such presumptions by making explicit reference to LGBT issues and providing relevant resources and other materials for use in the classrooms and around the school.  This should remind everybody, including the staff, that although often invisible, people who identify as LGBT are valued members of the school community.  What is most important is that no member of staff and no parent or student is left with any ambiguity in terms of where the school, including the trustees of the school, stand on the issues of homophobic bullying.<\/p><p>As recently as May last, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair\u00ed Quinn, established a forum to explore ways of tackling bullying in schools.  Experts, support groups and representatives of the school sector were brought together to explore how best to tackle bullying in schools and to consider changes that might be required to existing practices.  The Minister also established a working group to address the issue of bullying in schools, including homophobic bullying, cyber bullying and racist bullying.  I welcome the fact that BeLonGTo and GLEN were both represented on this working group.  It was an important move.  The group is reviewing current measures and identifying priorities based on international research and the findings of the forum.<\/p><p>BeLonGTo was singled out for particular praise at the UNESCO global convention and in the Rio statement referred to earlier.  Its work was highlighted as good practice and was included as a positive response to homophobia in the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights report on LGBT human rights.  At the beginning of September BeLonGTo youth services unveiled LGBT Youth Mental Health Ireland, a project which specifically supports LGBT young people around the country to develop positive mental health.  The project, which was launched by the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, who has been a strong advocate for LGBT youth, obviously recognises the gravity of the situation and the need for support for vulnerable young people.<\/p><p>In my home town of Dundalk I have been involved with the group Dundalk Outcomers for the last two years.  I have been very impressed by its commitment to helping and supporting LGBT young people and giving them a chance to come out and be themselves.  It has run some excellent festivals over the last two summers.  This summer I attended some local events at which I was delighted to meet some former students of mine.  It was really encouraging to see how we have progressed along the path of acceptance, inclusivity and diversity.  However, we cannot afford to become complacent.  We must work and although we have come a long way, we must keep moving.<\/p><p>For most adults it is possible to be gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender in Ireland today, but for many young people daily homophobic bullying means it is still not okay.  Our challenge is to ensure that this generation of young LGBT people is cared for, accepted, included and supported in their life choices.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012092500025#Z00300","speaker":"1174","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348588500,"counter":207,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch.  It is very difficult to encapsulate in a single definition the scourge that is homophobic bullying, and the devastating impact it has on LGBT people, particularly young LGBT people.  Senator Moran cited the words of Ban Ki Moon which come close to describing it.  Mary Robinson has said that homophobic bullying continues to be a society wide issue, and a link between it and suicide sends a clear message that this trend must be reversed.<\/p><p>Everybody in this Chamber agrees that homophobic bullying is a very serious issue.  Like many, I am alarmed by the national and international studies that show homophobic bullying is endemic in schools.  However, it is also an area in which much dedicated and targeted work is being done, both at governmental and non-governmental levels.<\/p> <p>That does not mean we should be complacent; there is much more that needs to be done.<\/p><p>We should also be proud that Ireland is at the forefront internationally of efforts to eliminate homophobic and transphobic bullying from schools.  The working group on tackling bullying, including homophobic bullying, cyber bullying and racist bullying, established by the Minister for Education and Skills in May 2012, is due to publish its report in the coming months.  I commend the Leader for facilitating debates called for by Senators but, frustratingly, when preparing for today, I had to question the timeliness of the debate, and why we could not have waited for the report of the working group to be produced in order that we could debate its recommendations.  I say that as a Senator who wants us to have a debate, but it should be on the recommendations when they are produced.  Never one to waste a good opportunity, however, I will use this chance to say more about homophobic bullying.<\/p><p>A key objective of the working group is to help draft a roadmap towards the elimination of homophobic bullying from our schools and, as such, I will reserve my comments about how best to move forward until I have seen the report and heard from the Department about how it intends to implement the recommendations.  The Seanad has an important role to play there.<\/p><p>I hope the recommendations coming from the report of the working group speak of the need for effective structural changes in curriculum policy, in support services and in teaching practices.  The elimination of homophobic and transphobic bullying is an issue about which I feel strongly.  I was delighted to be a member of the National Youth Work Advisory Committee when it produced its guidelines for the youth sector in Ireland, &quot;Addressing Homophobia&quot; in 2010.  Tremendous work is also being done by NGOs and advocacy groups on behalf of LGBT young people in Ireland and I welcome the members of BeLonGTo and GLEN who are in the Visitors Gallery.<\/p><p>BeLonGTo is the national youth service for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender young people in Ireland.  In addition to providing vital nationwide youth work services, BeLonGTo runs a number of excellent and innovative initiatives.  The most recent is the LGBT mental health initiative, which the Minister of State launched earlier this month.  It is supported by the HSE's national office for suicide prevention, which I welcome, given the direct correlation between homophobic bullying and suicidal behaviour among LGBT young people.  BeLonGTo was behind the hugely effective &quot;Stand Up!&quot; video campaign, which had 1 million views on YouTube, the most successful Irish charity video ever.  I am not remotely surprised by this.  I stood up for Jen back in March and I will never forget the sadness I felt at having to do so but equally the sense of pride and empowerment I felt at being part of a movement standing united against homophobic and transphobic bullying.  I was greatly moved by it and I recommend any of my fellow Senators who have not yet seen it to look for the video on YouTube.<\/p><p>BeLonGTo should be very proud that its work in this area has been cited in a UN report as an example of good practice in this area and will be included in the UNESCO toolkit.  I also commend the work done by GLEN which has been centrally involved in the progress that has been made in recent years by the Department of Education and Skills and all the education partners in addressing LGBT issues in second level schools.<\/p><p>I would like to raise a deep concern I have about homophobic bullying and the fear of violence, discrimination and stigma felt by LGBT asylum seekers in Ireland.  While the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service does not provide figures for the number of LGBT refugees seeking asylum in Ireland, anecdotal evidence from groups working directly with asylum seekers, such as the Irish Refugee Council, points to an acute fear on the part of asylum seekers about disclosing their sexual orientation and gender identity at the screening stage, even when the impetus for fleeing their country of origin was homophobic persecution.  The Irish Refugee Council also has testimonies from LGBT asylum seekers about the immense stress they are under trying to conceal their sexual orientation and gender identities from fellow asylum seekers, with whom they are often sharing close living quarters in direct provision accommodation centres.<\/p> <p>A common experience about which I have heard on numerous occasions involves a gay man who has fled his native country in which homosexuality is both illegal and subject to active persecution by his peers sharing a room in direct provision accommodation with four other men from the same country who is terrified they will uncover his sexual orientation and that he will be subjected to attack and persecution in the short term and if returned to his country of origin, where word would no doubt spread, his life would be in jeopardy.  We have come far in many ways but these young men are being placed in accommodation where they have to continue to conceal their identity.  That means Ireland is going backwards to a time to which we do not want to return.  It must be ensured that support for protection against homophobic violence, discrimination and stigma are equally afforded to those living in direct provision.  All asylum seekers entering Ireland should receive training, awareness and orientation about a wide range of issues, including LGBT rights and the principles of non-discrimination in the State.  I encourage the Department of Justice and Equality to develop its work in this area, as further progress could be made.<\/p><p>I welcome the Minister of State's openness and look forward to the working group's report.  She will witness following the input of Senators to the debate that the Seanad has a role to play.  While I question the timing of the debate, it is a way for Members to stand up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012092500027#BB00200","speaker":"1171","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348589100,"counter":210,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and, as usual, she has relayed words of wisdom which are appreciated.  Bullying, particularly homophobic bullying, is a crime against humanity.  While it is a political issue, thankfully, it is not a party political issue.  There is unanimity across all political parties that this issue must be addressed and whatever steps must be taken to eradicate such bullying will be welcomed.  I come from a county where Phoebe Prince was a student before moving to America.  That was a high profile case of bullying and there was a sad case in County Leitrim last week, which was equally traumatic and tragic.  This also encompassed cyberbullying as well as bullying in general.  Bullying is a serious problem in our schools, especially with the advent of text messaging, Facebook and Twitter and other ways and means of perpetrating hurt against people and perpetrating acts that are not acceptable.  As a society, we all have to be vigilant against bullying.  Homophobic bullying questions someone's identity and makes him or her feel inadequate because of his or her identity.  I commend previous speakers because most of what I feel has been reflected in their contributions.<\/p><p>I also commend the NGOs in this area, particularly those represented in the Visitors Gallery such as GLEN and BeLonGTo.  The work they have done has paved the way to improvements.  There is legislative provision in place but, hopefully, this will be tightened up going forward.  I also await with interest the recommendations in the report of the working group set up by the Minister for Education and Skills.  Senator van Turnhout is correct in the sense that we are talking in a vacuum but I am confident that when the report is published, we will have another opportunity to debate this issue.  I will encourage the Leader to provide us with such an opportunity in light of the working group's recommendations.<\/p><p>We have all dealt with people who have suffered greatly as a result of homophobic bullying.<\/p> <p>I encountered a case recently in which a hearse pulled up at the home of a young gay person seeking his remains.  It was simply appalling stuff.  This is the level of intimidation that is going on in society.  As legislators, Members sometimes feel powerless because regardless of what legislation may be introduced, how can one prevent something like that from happening except by ensuring those responsible for it are held accountable?  Everyone has examples of such bullying and the examples to which Senator van Turnhout referred regarding people seeking asylum in Ireland certainly are important and such issues must be addressed with absolute urgency.  International experience is one thing but Ireland must take a lead.  It will hold the Presidency of the European Union during the first six months of 2013 and I hope it will lead the way in coming up with best practice in respect of legislation and dealing with such bullying.<\/p><p>As I stated, bullying is bullying and in ways, homophobic bullying is the same as &quot;ordinary&quot; bullying.  The only difference is it involves bullying based on identity and tries to make people feel their identity is in some way inadequate.  This must be addressed and I note a very interesting discussion took place at a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality at which the various NGOs made presentations.  Having spoken to joint committee members afterwards, it was considered to be a most informative experience.  On foot of the presentations given by the NGOs and the Oireachtas Members asking questions and discussing the issue, people came away from that experience much better informed than beforehand.  In fairness to the Government, this issue has been at the centre of the Minister of State's agenda.  She has quite happily attended or launched any initiative to which she has been invited and is in the House today because her attendance has been requested by Members.  This issue is a centre point of equality.  In this context, the merging of the Equality Authority and the Irish Human Rights Commission will bring a more focused and dedicated approach to dealing with all such issues, particularly those pertaining to equality and so on.<\/p><p>I look forward to the report and debating its recommendations and, more important, seeing a pathway to their implementation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012092500029#DD00200","speaker":"1158","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348589400,"counter":212,"content":"<p>I call Senator Reilly, who has ten minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012092500030#EE00200","speaker":"1164"},{"type":"speech","time":1348589400,"counter":213,"content":"<p>I did not know I was a spokesperson.

In that vein, I warmly welcome this debate and the opportunity for Senators to express their opposition to homophobic bullying in all forms, to propose some positive ideas on how to tackle the issue and to ensure the issue is high on the political agenda in order that tough anti-homophobic bullying measures and guidelines are put in place in workplaces and schools, where they are most sorely needed.  As other Members have noted, homophobic bullying can occur anywhere to people of any age and in any profession or walk of life.  It is not simply a matter for schools or businesses to deal with but rather is a matter for society as a whole and this important point must be remembered.<\/p><p>In common with other Members, I wish to focus in particular on homophobic bullying and its effect on young people.  In common with my colleagues, I acknowledge the excellent work being carried out by the Gay + Lesbian Equality Network, GLEN, and the BeLonGTo youth group which, as has been noted previously, has been running successfully the Stand Up! campaign, which has won praise from the United Nations for its quality.  I also commend and acknowledge the work of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, which has played a progressive role on this issue.<\/p> <p>It is not often we acknowledge the work being done in this area.  It is crucial this work continues and that we listen to the experiences and ideas of people, including parents, who work with young people.  Through my engagement with the youth organisation SpunOut, I have heard from young people who have experienced homophobic bullying at school that while there have been some improvements, it remains an extremely common issue in schools, which is worrying in this day and age.  While the positive moves of recent years must be commended, we may need to open up our thinking and to look at related issues in terms of how they impact on young lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender, LGBT, people in education.  <\/p><p>I take the opportunity to thank two people from SpunOut, Patrick and Christine, for sharing their experiences with me.  We can talk all day long in this House about issues but unless what we say is rooted in fact and real life experience, it will be irrelevant and will not help bring about progressive change.  Christine spoke to me about how sex education in school dealt solely with heterosexual sex.  The marginalising effect of this on young LGBT people needs to be considered.  Christine also spoke of her experience of emotional blackmail by another school girl who became aware of her sexuality.  While we have moved on, if the sexuality of a young school-going person is something that continues to stigmatised, we have a long way to go.  This must be recognised.<\/p><p>Another young person, Patrick, raised with me a number of important issues which he believes need to be acted upon, including that homophobic bullying must be stopped immediately it occurs.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, stated that bullying can be insidious and that the dividing line between acceptable and unacceptable behaviour is often a fine one.  While we do not tolerate a festering of racist behaviour or abuse, some teachers and adults are uncomfortable or lack the knowledge to engage with homophobic bullying in a direct manner.  This sense of discomfort needs to be addressed through education and positive peer pressure.  A school's ethos should have no bearing on its approach to homophobic bullying.  That is critical.  Homophobia should be considered as unacceptable as racism or sexism.  There should be no excuses for tolerating it.  Any teacher or adult in a position of authority who does not immediately intervene when homophobic bullying occurs is failing young people and should be told so.<\/p><p>We are all aware of the prevalence of mental ill health in this country, in particular among young people in recent years.  Bullying and being open about and dealing with one's sexuality can be a factor in this regard.  Homophobic bullying is, therefore, a specific issue that must be dealt with sensitively but unflinchingly.  I again commend the groups working to challenge homophobia, in particular those working with young people.  I appeal to the Government and others to continue working with these groups.  As I stated, we must be vigilant of homophobic bullying, ensure it remains on our agenda and is, where it occurs, constantly challenged.  Like Senator van Turnhout and others I look forward to discussing the recommendations of the working group.  I hope this is not just a once off debate cast into the chronicles in terms of what we have done.  Young LGBT people need to be at the centre of our thinking.  It is our voices rather than those of other interests that should provide guidance on this issue.  This issue must remain on our agenda.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012092500030#EE00800","speaker":"1155","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348589700,"counter":218,"content":"<p>I wish to share time with Senator Healy-Eames.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012092500031#FF00200","speaker":"1165"},{"type":"speech","time":1348589700,"counter":219,"content":"<p>Is the Senator sharing time equally?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012092500031#FF00300","speaker":"1164"},{"type":"speech","time":1348589700,"counter":220,"content":"<p>I will take four minutes, leaving two minutes for Senator Healy Eames.

I only became aware a number of hours ago that this issue was being discussed in the House today.  I would like to share my thoughts and observations on the subject matter with the Minister of State.<\/p><p>Homophobic bullying as a problem in schools is an issue which has only been explored since 2004.  We are all aware that society and in particular our youth, not alone in Ireland but worldwide, are experiencing many problems, including alcohol abuse, misuse of drugs, obesity and racism.  I do not foresee the problem of homophobia going away for a long time.  I am not necessarily sure if the efforts through education will make a major difference.  I note that 41% of teachers say that homophobic bullying is more difficult to deal with than is any other form of bullying in schools, the reason being their fear of also being targeted by the bullies.<\/p><p>I wanted to contribute to this debate because as a coach and mentor to many young boys and girls for a number of years I have dealt at first hand with victims of bullying, in particular young men.  They have told me of how at school they were called &quot;gay&quot;, &quot;queer&quot; or &quot;fags&quot;.  This type of slagging affects self-esteem and increases anxiety, often causing depression.  Those slagging do not necessarily always know they are being bullies.  However, bullying often becomes physical.  When, as I once witnessed, a young man is thrown through a glass door in a secondary school, resulting in his head being cut open and him having to be brought to hospital, that is homophobic bullying.  <\/p><p>Another young man whom I mentored was told when he tried to get into a nightclub that he could not go in because the bouncer at the door did not like his friend.  The bouncer turned to his friend and said: &quot;Get out of here you gay queer.&quot;  When the first young man defended himself and his friend to the bouncer, he was dragged into the nightclub, had his trousers pulled down below his waist and shoes taken from him and was brought into a dark room and beaten.  The Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na was called and the garda\u00ed believed the bouncer.  The young man was imprisoned in Kevin Street Garda station over night and had to eventually, after six months, plead guilty because he did not want to have to go to court.  What kind of homophobic bullying is that?<\/p><p>In another instance of which I am aware, a young man was travelling to town in a taxi with a male and two female friends.  They had not met each other for approximately three or four months over the summer.  When the taxi driver asked where they were going and they told him, he turned and called them &quot;queers&quot; and told them to get out of his taxi.  The young man took issue with this.  The taxi man stopped in the middle of the Stillorgan dual carriageway and told them to get out of the car.  When they did the young man slammed the door and told the taxi driver to go you know where.  The taxi driver got out of the car and beat up the young man.  I saw the photographs of the young man following that beating.  He had blood pouring down onto his chest.  The Garda was called, but garda\u00ed did nothing.  They provided no protection whatsoever for the young man concerned.  There are no rights for these type of victims and action will not be taken against the perpetrators of homophobic bulling.  <\/p><p>Young men and women are not only emigrating from this country because of economic difficulties and unemployment.  They are emigrating because of homophobic bullying.  I do not believe it will ever come to an end.  We must work hard with schools, sports clubs and society to try to educate people of the harm done physically and mentally as a result of homophobic bullying.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012092500031#FF00600","speaker":"1165"},{"type":"speech","time":1348589700,"counter":223,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Coghlan for sharing time with me.  I did not give notice to speak on this issue but decided to come to the House and contribute to the debate because of the pervasive and endemic affect which I believe homophobic bullying is having on our society.  In 2010, I compiled, with the Educational Research Centre, an Oireachtas education report on early school leaving.<\/p> <p>We picked groups of kids at risk of dropping out of school.  One of those groups were lesbian, homosexual and transgender youngsters.  I had the honour of interviewing some of the children and one interview with a boy sticks in my mind and is the reason I am speaking on this topic.  He was a kind and gentle 16 year old boy and his humanity remains with me.  It was very difficult for him to stay at school and he said that GLEN and BeLonGTo helped him.  His self-esteem had taken a beating and suicidal thoughts were common.  He said that physical education was particularly difficult for him, especially in the changing room.  We need to be alert to those areas and we need to give guidance to physical education teachers.  This is not a school problem but a societal problem.  I have a teenage son and I heard a group of his peers in a shop recently speak about homosexuality in a very negative way, saying that if they had sons who were homosexual, they would kill them.  It is not just coming from these fine young people, it is an attitudinal problem.  We need an information and promotional campaign in a positive way to promote tolerance of sexuality and acceptance of all sexuality.  This must be in people's faces in order that the issue is not spoken about in silent tones.  It is a wider issue than school and if we expect schools to solve it, we will fail.  We have a long way to go on this issue but it is helpful and healthy to have this debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012092500031#FF00700","speaker":"1131","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348590300,"counter":225,"content":"<p>I am pleased to have the opportunity to join in statements on this important issue.  We are all agreed on deploring homophobic bullying, which I regard as despicable behaviour.  The same applies to all bullying.  We can all endorse the comments made by the UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, when he declared that homophobic bullying is a moral outrage, a grave violation of human rights and a public health crisis.  It is also a loss for the entire human family when promising lives are cut short.<\/p><p>It is heartening that Ireland is seen as being to the forefront of efforts to eliminate homophobic bullying from schools.  It has also been one of the driving forces behind UNESCO's global good practice policy manual.  The Fianna F\u00e1il Party supports and welcomes the decision of the Minister for Education and Skills to address bullying through the forum on bullying and through the setting up of a working group on tackling bullying.  Bullying should be viewed in the context of a whole school approach to promoting mental health.  However, while all young people are at risk of being subjected to bullying, research shows that lesbian, gay and bisexual and transgender young people suffer far higher incidences of bullying behaviour and that teachers find it particularly hard to deal with homophobia.  In view of this, a specific strategy is required to address homophobic bullying.  According to GLEN, homophobic bullying has been documented as one of the most pervasive forms of bullying in Irish schools.  Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender young people experience bullying at a much higher rate than other young people.  Irish research shows that homophobic bullying is a significant causal factor in self-harm, suicide and other severe mental health difficulties.  Two in five Irish teachers find homophobic bullying more difficult to address than other forms of bullying.  Supporting LGBT Lives, a study funded by the HSE National Office for Suicide Prevention, found that among lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, 50% experienced verbal homophobic bullying, 40% were verbally threatened by fellow students, 25% were physically threatened by their peers and 34% heard homophobic comments from teachers.  The last statistic may go some way to indicating why two in five Irish teachers find homophobic bullying more difficult to address than other forms of bullying.<\/p><p>The Fianna F\u00e1il Party believes that, in addition to general measures to deal with and prevent bullying, a specific strategy is required to address homophobic bullying.  We must ensure that measures to prevent bullying and deal with incidents form part of an overall strategy to promote positive mental health among young people.  The focus should be on promoting young people's well-being.  It is essential the Department of Education and Skills updates its current bullying guidelines, which were introduced in 1993.  They must be updated to address racist bullying, homophobic bullying and cyber bullying, including the use of text messages and mobile phones in schools.  This should be an emphasis on the more subtle ways available in 2012, particularly Facebook.  The guidelines must be significant be strengthened so that schools are required to implement an anti-bullying programme.  The programme should involve the whole school community.  It seems that schools must have policies in place to address bullying and list clear actions that must be taken following breaches of the policies, schools can do as much or as little as they see fit in tackling bullying.  I agree with the position outlined by Professor Mona O'Moore of TCD in her presentation to the recent forum on bullying, that the definition of bullying in the 1993 guidelines must be updated as bullying is currently viewed as one or more individuals repeatedly targeting another.  Cyber bullying can involve just one damaging incident, which is sufficient to be defined as bullying; it may not be a repeated attack.  Schools need to be provided with proper training and support to implement the guidelines in order to take a more proactive approach to tackling bullying.  We face a challenge and the fight against prejudice and intolerance is never easy.  Those vices will always seek new outlets but with time and education we can overcome the challenge.  Let us look at how attitudes have changed in so many recent years.  For me and for the Fianna F\u00e1il Party, it is a challenge we are willing to meet.  I wish the Minister of State continued success with all her great work.

It is not commonly known that the age of 12 is the most common age when such people discover their LGBT identity.  At 16 years of age, they are most vulnerable to beginning to self-harm and 17 is the most common age to tell someone of their sexuality.  It is also the most vulnerable age for attempting suicide for the first time.  There is a significant issue in respect of treatment of LGBT young people.  The statistics are quite startling.  Some 50% of LGBT people under the age of 25 have seriously thought about ending their lives.  Some 20% of LGBT people under the age of 25 have attempted suicide at least once.  Homophobic bullying is a clear risk factor for self-harm and attempted suicide.<\/p> <p>It is important to note that the age of greatest vulnerability for LGBT people is between 12 and 17, which corresponds to the period of second level education.<\/p><p>The Minister of State has mentioned that we have put in place certain protocols to combat bullying and that we have introduced equality legislation, but the reality of the matter is that research has shown young LGBT people experience marginalisation and present with a higher incidence of drug and alcohol abuse.  In particular, they experience geographical isolation, and they also experience rejection among parents and family.  They live with secrecy and are more likely to become homeless, and they are more likely to remain homeless when they have experienced homelessness.  One of the most pressing issues is that LGBT people believe they have a lack of role models, although there has been an improvement in this regard.<\/p><p>We need to tackle the fact that LGBT people suffer from a feeling of invisibility in society, among other conditions.  We can talk about all the measures we have put in place to tackle homophobic bullying in schools but the reality is that if we do not deal with the kinds of societal norms we present to young people, we will never deal with it.  The kinds of people Senator Coghlan mentioned, who exhibit behaviour that is nothing short of that of animals, will never be tackled if we do not tackle social norms.  As long as we have curricula for schoolchildren that present Ladybird-style, Jane and Peter, or mum and dad types of norms and fail to present the kinds of relationships with which LGBT people can identify, we will never tackle their lack of self-respect and the attitudes of the kinds of people spoken about the Senator Coghlan.  If we do not regard the relationships between LGBT people as really equal in society \u2013 I am not a great believer in the equal but different attitude to legislation \u2013 the problem will continue to obtain.  We must tackle marriage equality, for example.  If we do not do so, there is very little point in saying all are equal and that we believe certain attitudes are reprehensible; if one believes in what one is saying, one should act upon it.  One should be judged on one's words and on what one is prepared to do.<\/p><p>Section 31 of the Education Act was referred to by Senator Power.  I raised this matter during the course of the debate thereon.  If we discover that amending section 31 cannot be achieved legislatively because it is repugnant to the Constitution, the only way to tackle the matter will be through constitutional reform.  If an LGBT young person does not see an LGBT teacher in his or her own school being treated as an equal, how can he or she believe he or she is also equal?  Ultimately, norms, codes and legislation are fine, but if we do not back them up with sincere, genuine equality, we will never tackle the attitudes about which Senator Coghlan spoke.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012092500032#GG00300","speaker":"1172","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348590900,"counter":228,"content":"<p>I am filling in for Senator Reilly and did not intend to speak this evening.  I am taking the opportunity to do so, however, because it is an important issue.  I welcome the Minister of State to the House and the fact that we are having a debate on this issue.  Many of the main points have been made.  The most obvious point we should make is that we must all offer leadership on this issue.  The first step the State and we, as legislators, should take is to ensure there is equal recognition for LGBT people.  This means full equality and that we must go beyond civil partnerships such that LGBT people will be allowed to marry and have equal rights in the same way as the rest of us.  If the State does not confer on its citizens equality, this is partly why many in society are not minded to regard people as equals and the reason they look at differences rather than equality.<\/p><p>The State has a great responsibility in this regard.  We should all promote equality.  All institutions in the State have a great responsibility.  I include the church, whose views and teachings on homosexuality are completely outdated and should change.  This is part of the problem.  When one considers that the church has control over many of our schools, which matter is being examined, is it any wonder that sexual education is what it is?  When views such as those of the Catholic Church are being expressed and when there is not full equality for LGBT individuals, is it no wonder that there is a very high level of homophobic bullying in schools and throughout society?<\/p><p>Everybody should begin by looking at himself or herself.  I would certainly raise my children by making sure they viewed people as equals and recognised and celebrated difference, be it in respect of people who come from different communities or people of a different sexuality, religion, race, creed or colour.  I would stress that we are all equal and all human beings.  If we start by promoting this ethos among our own children, it will be the best possible start we can give them.<\/p><p>Leaving aside our personal responsibilities as parents are citizens, as legislators we have a responsibility to ensure that we do the right thing.  I recognise that there have been some positive moves recently on civil partnership, but we still have a long way to go to ensure this State fully vindicates the rights of LGBT people.  While it is very welcome that we are having a very constructive debate in this House today, and that we are facing up to the reality that many people are being subjected to homophobic bullying, we must examine the practices of institutions, be they educational organisations or businesses, and those in workplaces.   We must also consider ourselves.  If we are not prepared to look at ourselves, we have no right to point the finger at other organisations.  I hope that, in the coming years, the Government, which is a year and a half into its term of office, will prioritise the need to ensure full and equal recognition for gay people in respect of marriage.  Once the State takes these steps, young people, especially, will realise that LGBT individuals are equal in the eyes of the State, and that this is how they should be viewed by everybody.  We must first look to ourselves and ensure we do the right thing as legislators.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012092500033#HH00200","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speech","time":1348590900,"counter":229,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, to the House and apologise for my being delayed.  I was at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, which had a hearing on the merger of the Irish Human Rights Commission and the Equality Authority, to which I know the Minister of State referred in her speech as one of the important mechanisms we hope will strengthen equality protection.  Senator Zappone also attended the committee hearing.  I apologise for not having been here earlier.<\/p><p>I was one of the Senators who spoke on 17 May, the international day against homophobia and transphobia.  This was raised in the House.  I am delighted we are returning to the issue, specifically homophobic bullying.  Bullying in general and particularly the horrific consequences of Internet bullying or cyber-bullying, as in the very tragic case involving a young girl, have been in the news in recent days.<\/p><p>The sort of language used about cyber bullying can sometimes mask the real anguish and heartbreak that it can cause for people.  There is much flippant talk about Internet trolls, anonymous people who post vicious and hurtful comments online.  This sort of anonymous bullying can have really tragic consequences and certainly causes great distress.<\/p><p>The specific issue of homophobic bullying is clearly what we are speaking about and what the Minister of State focused on.  The Government has taken very significant action thereon already.  Homophobic bullying has been recognised internationally as a serious violation of human rights and a public health crisis.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State referred to the efforts of the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, through his Department to ensure that homophobic bullying is eliminated in schools.  The programme for Government commits to encouraging schools to develop anti-bullying policies.  As colleagues have mentioned, a great deal of work has been done by the anti-bullying centre at Trinity College in respect of the homophobic targeting of pupils by bullies.  Research has been done on the higher incidence of bullying of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender, LGBT, people in general.<\/p><p>The work at Government level has been important, but I take Senator Cullinane's point, in that it is not just a question of focusing on homophobic bullying or of taking action in schools, but of ensuring that Government policies are in keeping with the principle of equality and do not encourage, however indirectly, a perception in the community that people who are LGBT are less deserving of equal status.  I refer in particular to the campaign for marriage equality, of which I have been a supporter.  Recently, the T\u00e1naiste referred to equal recognition as being an important civil rights issue.<\/p><p>As Senator Brennan wished to contribute, I will conclude.

At some stage, we have each heard of incidents of bullying and its horrific consequences.  Homophobic bullying has been documented as being one of the most pervasive forms of bullying in schools.  It begins at national school.  The programme for Government commits to encouraging schools to develop anti-bullying strategies, in particular strategies to combat homophobic bullying.  In 2011, the Minister, Deputy Quinn, established a working group to help draft a roadmap towards the elimination of homophobic bullying from our schools.  This was a positive step.<\/p><p>Recently, President Higgins spoke of the destructive reality of homophobic bullying.  He stated that it was an important issue, not merely an emotional one.  Four out of five Irish teachers are aware of homophobic bullying in their schools, but research shows that only one in five LGBT young people who are victims of it seek support from their schools or teachers.  The impact on young people's mental health is well known to us all and includes self-harm, suicide attempts and tragedies, such as the recent one in Dromahair.<\/p><p>Children and teenagers are now more susceptible to bullying in national schools.  It can emanate from a variety of sources.  A high proportion of young people have been subjected to some form of bullying, leading to tragic consequences in some cases.<\/p><p>According to a 2008 survey, the most common form of bullying was verbal, followed by exclusion and physical bullying.  Bullying via written messages and electronic means has become more prominent in recent times.  Young children are susceptible to electronic bullying, as the sending of messages to one another via that media continues to grow on a daily basis, particularly in light of social networking.  This type of bullying was apparently evident in the sad case of a 15 year old girl who died recently.  If possible, cyber bullies must be named and shamed.<\/p><p>I can recount two incidents, although they were not as serious as those described by my colleague.  No one was beaten up, etc.  A young boy was bullied going to, at and coming from national school.  He told his parents that he did not want to go to school any more.  They reported it to the teacher and principal, who were unaware that there had been any bullying.  A young girl in sixth class who was ready to attend second level told her parents at Christmas that she would not return to school under any circumstance because she had been bullied.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012092500034#JJ00300","speaker":"1138"},{"type":"speech","time":1348591500,"counter":233,"content":"<p>The Senator should conclude because the Minister of State must respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012092500034#JJ00400","speaker":"1132"},{"type":"speech","time":1348591500,"counter":234,"content":"<p>People were staring at the girl.

She asked for an update.  As soon as the Irish Human Rights Commission, IHRC, and the Equality Authority have merged, the Minister for Justice and Equality intends to ask the new body to investigate section 37 as a priority.  We are all conscious of the constitutional and other difficulties, for example, the fact that the people on the other side have rights as well.<\/p><p>When he was a member of the British Government, Jack Straw was interviewed by David Frost early on a Sunday morning when people like me have nothing better to do than to watch political interviews.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012092500034#JJ00600","speaker":"982"},{"type":"speech","time":1348591500,"counter":236,"content":"<p>As one does on a Sunday morning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012092500034#JJ00700","speaker":"1174"},{"type":"speech","time":1348591500,"counter":237,"content":"<p>At 7 a.m.  Jack Straw was speaking about equality when David Frost told him that he could not legislate for attitudes.  Jack Straw agreed, but replied that he could legislate to ensure that a person's attitude would not detrimentally affect someone else.  That is what the Government is doing.  A great deal of work must be done in respect of the type of violence referred to by Senator Eamonn Coghlan.  Someone can be physically abused for standing up to verbal abuse, yet his or her word on it might not be taken despite there being evidence and witnesses.  We have all been there and know how it works.  The State's institutions need to take account of this issue.<\/p><p>No one could claim that I am not completely in favour of equality.  I always have been.  It is something I no longer question, it is part of what I am.<\/p> <p>I am not certain that marriage equality will stop bullying.  Bullying is a separate issue.  It is something insidious and we must be continuously conscious of it.  We must stamp it out, even at the very early stages.  As a grandmother of two young boys in national school, I know this type of bullying is used as a form of abuse, even when a child is not homosexual.  That shows how endemic the matter has become and we must stop it.  Even when a child does not understand the consequences of what is being said, it is still used, which I find very worrying.  It must be stopped.<\/p><p>Being a teenager is difficult enough at the best of times.  Imagine if a person's essence or sexuality is being questioned.  It is what we are so imagine if this is challenged.  Even if a person is not homosexual, bisexual or transgender, such a challenge in those circumstances must have serious repercussions.  I do not accept that teachers should not deal with this because they do not know how to deal with this issue.  Teachers deal with very difficult matters every day of the week and we could introduce a whole-of-school approach, where a teacher would not be isolated, alone or subject to the type of bullying that can go on in secondary schools, even with teachers.  The Minister, Deputy Quinn, is putting in place this whole-of-school approach, and with it we could do something about this problem.<\/p><p>The first and only idea we must drive into society is that tolerance is above all else.  We should be tolerant of other people's differences, no matter what they are, and in doing so we will have a better society in which we can all be more comfortable and live in a more open and generous fashion.  As each of us can understand the difficulties that arise when a person's essence is challenged, we must be constantly on our guard against it.  I saw the BeLonG To video Stand Up! and we have all done what it portrays through the years.  It might have been under different circumstances or guises but we all did it.  What we are saying is that people should support one another.<\/p><p>With regard to cyber bullying, our young people are now under more pressure than ever.  We did not have to deal with Facebook, Twitter or texting when we were teenagers.  We must get parents to have a serious look at what is happening in schools and communities because children and teenagers are not inclined to tell parents everything.  Perhaps we should try to get adolescents to talk to one significant adult, even if it is not a mother, father or teacher.  No one is coming to the table without the best of intentions, but homophobic bullying is quite a damaging prospect for society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012092500034#JJ00800","speaker":"982","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1348592100,"counter":239,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 5.45 p.m. and resumed at 6 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Syrian Conflict: Statements","time":1348592400,"counter":240,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012092500036#LL00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1348592400,"counter":241,"content":"<p>We are meeting to discuss the devastating humanitarian crisis in Syria and neighbouring countries.  I am heartened that Members of Seanad \u00c9ireann have taken the time and interest to request an update on the situation.  During my recent visit to Jordan, I was able to witness first-hand the enormous humanitarian consequences that the crisis is having on innocent civilians and the pressures that it is placing on host countries such as Jordan.  I am most appreciative of the opportunity to share my insights with Senators today and I look forward very much to hearing their contributions.<\/p><p>When the revolts across the Arab world began to put unprecedented pressure on long-standing authoritarian regimes, we all hoped that this would mark the beginning of a move towards democratic reform and respect for the rights of citizens.  However, progress has been varied and in Syria, the future remains highly uncertain.  All of us, I am sure, have been shocked and terribly saddened by the relentless onslaught on the Syrian civilian population in the past 18 months.  The brutally repressive actions of the Assad regime and an increasingly militant armed resistance from elements of the opposition have resulted in extraordinary human suffering.<\/p><p>It is very clear that while this is a humanitarian crisis, it is driven by politics and will only be solved with a political solution.  From the beginning, Ireland has recognised this, striving to respond to the humanitarian needs of the populations affected by the violence while working for a sustainable political solution based on accommodating the legitimate democratic aspirations of the Syrian people.<\/p><p>I would like to focus my remarks on three key areas.  First, I will provide an update on the current humanitarian situation within Syria and in neighbouring countries; second, I will summarise Ireland's response to the humanitarian crisis; and, third, I would like to touch on the highly complex and uncertain subject of what may happen in the coming months and years.<\/p><p>In regard to the humanitarian situation in Syria and neighbouring countries, the headline figures speak for themselves.  More than 19,000 people were killed in the violence, 2.5 million people in Syria are in desperate need of assistance, more than 1.2 million Syrians are displaced within their own country and approximately 283,000 Syrians are now refugees in neighbouring countries.  More than half of the refugees are children.<\/p><p>My visit to Za'atari refugee camp, 80 km north of the Jordanian capital Amman, close to the Syrian border, allowed me to hear the human stories and suffering behind such statistics.  In the camp, I heard powerful testimonies from Syrians who had recently fled the violence.  Many had been displaced up to four or five times within Syria before finally crossing the border into Jordan, with little or no possessions to their name.  I saw how the staff of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR, the agency responsible for the camp, were struggling with limited resources to provide even the most basic services such as shelter, food and water.  It is a race against time as the numbers of refugees escalates.  At the time of my visit, there were approximately 16,000 refugees in the camp.  In only a matter of weeks, this has doubled to nearly 32,000.  It is important to note that this is in addition to more than 55,000 refugees who are already living with host communities in Jordan and many more who are understood to have fled the conflict but have not registered as refugees.<\/p><p>When I met the Jordanian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Nasser Judeh, and the Jordanian Minister for Planning and International Co-operation, Dr. Jafar Hassan, they impressed on me how this refugee burden is placing a huge strain on the country which has a high pre-existing refugee population coupled with severe resource constraints.  They even went so far as to express fears that this could jeopardise a fragile political equilibrium and may pose a threat to national security and stability.<\/p><p>In Syria violence has intensified and spread across the country.  Recent weeks have seen most of the fighting centred on the country's main population centres, Damascus and Aleppo, further endangering civilians populations.  There is no safe place for those innocent civilians caught up in the conflict and protection is a major concern.<\/p><p>Recent reports have described indiscriminate shelling of densely populated areas, excessive use of force, including utterly unacceptable use of air strikes by aeroplanes and gun ship helicopters against civilian areas and random targeting of innocent civilians.  As the humanitarian situation deteriorates, there is urgent need for food, medical care and shelter.  The school term was due to start last week, yet more than 1 million people have taken refuge in schools and public buildings across the country, particularly in Jordan.<\/p><p>There is particular concern for the 500,000 Palestinian refugees in Syria who were already poorer and more vulnerable than the general population.<\/p> <p>While they have originally been spared the excesses of the violence, the camps where they reside in Dara'a and Damascus have recently been severely affected.  Any significant move of Palestinian refugees outside Syria is likely to create very serious political problems in the neighbouring countries.  <\/p><p> The aid operation in Syria is extremely complex.  During my discussions with the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross, humanitarian access, limited information and lack of funding were cited as the biggest challenges.  While the United Nations and non-governmental agencies have recently been able to considerably scale up the delivery of humanitarian assistance, the operation continues to be hampered by the administrative control of the Assad regime and by violence on the part of Government forces and the armed opposition.  The reality on the ground is that agencies respond on a day-to-day basis, delivering life-saving supplies and services as and when the security situation permits.  <\/p><p> Ireland has responded swiftly to the humanitarian crisis in Syria and the neighbouring countries.  As early as March this year, I authorised &#8364;500,000 in emergency funding for the International Committee of the Red Cross, the UNHCR and the World Food Programme.  The recent visit enabled me to see for myself how this support has provided life-saving services for refugees in Jordan.  While I was there, the humanitarian needs were escalating on a daily basis.  In response, I was able to mobilise an additional &#8364;1.6 million of humanitarian assistance to the ICRC - which includes the Red Crescent - the UNHCR, the World Health Organization and the International Rescue Committee for their response to the crisis.  This includes non-food items such as tents, mattresses, kitchen sets, water tanks and jerry cans from our rapid response stocks in Dubai worth &#8364;400,000.  Since March this year, Ireland has therefore provided &#8364;2.1 million in humanitarian assistance.  In my discussions with the Jordanian Government, the United Nations and the ICRC, they all expressed their sincere appreciation for Ireland's generosity, particularly given the difficult economic climate that we face.  <\/p><p> I have emphasised that this is a humanitarian crisis arising from an underlying political conflict.  Over the past 18 months, our efforts and those of international partners have been directed at ending the violence and repression inflicted upon the people of Syria.  Even if the reality on the ground is disheartening, we must continue to promote a peaceful settlement with the ultimate aim of political transition in Syria.  Ireland is fully supportive of the newly-appointed UN-Arab League Joint Special Representative, Lakhdar Brahimi, and his efforts to negotiate a ceasefire and chart a political path ahead.  In parallel, international pressure needs to be maintained to bring an end to the violence and compel the Syrian regime to stop its bloody repression.  Ireland, with our international partners, has been advocating for a strong UN Security Council resolution.  I believe this is long overdue.  There is a need for effective leadership and action on the part of the Security Council, imposing sanctions on those who continue to wage war on innocent civilians and who fail to meet their international obligations.  In particular, a comprehensive arms embargo remains absolutely crucial as the only real way to curb the ongoing flows of arms and ammunition making their way to Syria.  There also needs to be full accountability for what has transpired in Syria, with the clear and incontrovertible evidence presented by the UN and others of serious human rights violations committed primarily by the Assad regime and its forces but also, to a lesser extent, by certain elements of the armed opposition.  That is why Ireland continues to fully support the calls for the situation in Syria to be referred by the Security Council to the International Criminal Court.<\/p><p> The general view expressed by my interlocutors in Jordan was that while the Assad regime would eventually fall, this may not be imminent and indeed there is every possibility that Assad will hang on to power at any cost.  Possible spill\u00adover of the conflict into neighbouring states remains a serious concern, as recently reflected by ongoing clashes in northern Lebanon.  With no early political solution in sight therefore, the prospect of continued displacement and humanitarian suffering within Syria and an escalating and protracted regional refugee crisis is very real.  In Jordan alone, current predictions are that the number of refugees will reach 250,000 by the end of the year.  As winter approaches, the pressure for shelter, fuel, health services and food will multiply.  Coping mechanisms are severely depleted and vulnerability levels of both displaced populations and refugees increase as the conflict endures.  We are now facing into missed harvests, missed schooling and lost economic opportunities - all of which will have a profound impact on the affected populations in the years ahead.  <\/p><p> Without doubt, the biggest unknown is what comes after Assad.  The opposition is clearly fragmented and concern is growing that fractures among the disparate elements of the opposition may contain the seeds of further instability.  Ireland, along with its EU and international partners, has long called for all strands of the opposition to set aside their differences and agree a platform for democratic change reflective of the legitimate aspirations of all Syrians.  Engagement with leading regional players and others, particularly Russia, which are in a position to exert influence on the Assad regime will also be of key importance in the efforts to broker a solution.  This is a task which Joint Special Representative Brahimi is already clearly committed to undertaking.  In the meantime, the grim reality remains that the suffering of Syrian civilians is growing with each day.  The immediate imperative therefore is to respond to the humanitarian needs on the ground, while maintaining our international efforts to find a sustainable political solution that is so desperately needed.  Ireland is wholeheartedly committed on both fronts and the visit to Jordan was an important demonstration of our solidarity with those affected by the crisis.<\/p><p> I have received information that the UN Human Rights Council is meeting in Geneva, the Arab League is putting forward proposals in respect of the conflict and, for the first time, the Russian Federation has put forward its own package.  Therefore, there is likely to be some negotiations in respect of the proposals being put forward within the UN Human Rights Council by the Arab League and the Russian Federation.  Russia plays a key role, as we know from its disagreement, along with China, with some of the positions taken by other members of the Security Council.  I hope that by Friday, there will some progress in that respect.  <\/p><p> There will be a meeting of the UN General Assembly in New York this week, for which the Tan\u00e1iste has already left; therefore, the issue is very much on the agenda of the assembly.  Certainly there will be discussions by like-minded friends of Syria with discussions <i>en marge<\/i>of the General Assembly discussions.  I have brought the House up to date with the present situation, which is the best information I can provide.  I hope there is some possibility of the deadlock being broken and some progress being made in the not too distant future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012092500036#LL00300","speaker":"1006","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348593000,"counter":243,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State with responsibility for trade and development to the House, of which he was a Member in the past.

They are being housed in Jordan and surrounding areas, including Syria which gave them a home.  However, they are now in a vulnerable position and it is vitally important that the United Nations, China and Russia bear this in mind.  It is a catastrophe of huge proportions and the future is uncertain as the Minister of State pointed out.  <\/p><p>The Assad regime was supported and used in the past by various countries in the region but is now in a vulnerable position.  The Minister of State expressed concern about the future as there is not a united opposition.  The situation is diffuse.  There is concern about minorities in Syria such as the Christian minority.  Under the Assad regime they were given support and, as far as I am aware, were not discriminated against in any way.  If and when the new regime is put in place, their position will be vulnerable and they are concerned.  Some are viewed as being on the side of the establishment but a civil war such as this is extremely dangerous.  The position is that 90,000 people have gone into Turkey - 80,000 to camps and 10,000 to communities.  The total number of refugees expected in the country is 250,000.  Some 90,000 have gone into Iraq and it is not known how many others will travel there.  Jordan has 77,000 refugees while it expects 250,000 in due course, and Lebanon has 56,000.  Those are massive numbers of refugees as winter approaches and will create enormous pressure on the United Nations.  That is the reason it is important that the Government and the Minister of State have ensured that funding is provided.<\/p><p>The civil war in Syria has worsened and the humanitarian crisis has deepened because of the violence and refugees threatening to spill out across the region.  The instability of the Arab spring is all too apparent in the wave of violence against American embassies and the threat against French embassies, following the publication of inflammatory material depicting the prophet Muhammad.  The reaction of countries to these publications is enormous.  It was irresponsible, to say the least, knowing the effect it would have, to publish the cartoons, and the film depicting Muhammad which was made in America was outrageous.  I heard some extracts from it and, frankly, any religion would be deeply upset.  In the Christian community we have tolerated the depiction of biblical scenes in films and there has not been the same reaction but they have been condemned in a democratic way.  The way in which these inflame the passions of the Islamic community is unbelievable.  Irrespective of free speech in America, France and elsewhere, there is no excuse, knowing the effect it would have, for publishing such cartoons or making a film depicting Muhammad in a derogatory fashion. That is unforgivable and has caused an enormous number of deaths in the region, attacks and the murder of the US ambassador to Libya.  Those are serious issues and must be borne in mind.<\/p><p>Some 20,000 people have been killed in the violence unleashed by the regime of Bashar al-Assad since protests erupted more than one year ago and Syria has slipped into the chaos of civil war.  A report by the international charity, Save the Children, states that as Syria's civil war has intensified, thousands of children have died in brutal attacks and many more have been injured, traumatised or forced to flee their homes.  It warns that boys and girls continue to be killed, maimed and tortured.  These appalling violations against children must stop and those carrying them out must be held to account.  <\/p><p>Hundreds of thousands of refugees have fled the country to surrounding states.  The Free Syrian Army has moved back into an area controlled by the rebels.  At the United Nations General Assembly today, the UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, described the fighting in Syria as &quot;a regional calamity with global ramifications&quot;.  He called for action from the divided UN Security Council and said that the international community should not look the other way as violence spirals out of control.  He said that brutal human rights abuses continue to be committed, mainly by the Government, but also by opposition forces.<\/p><p>President Obama has announced to the UN General Assembly that the regime of President Bashar al-Assad should step aside.  The majority of people would call on that regime to step aside and try to put a transitional government in place.  However, the United Nations Security Council has been unable to reach agreement on the Syrian crisis and on Monday, UN envoy Lakhdar Brahimi warned that the situation was extremely bad and getting worse.  While he did not have a full plan he said he had a few ideas.  Mr. Brahimi had just visited Damascus as well as refugee camps in neighbouring Jordan and Turkey.  Diplomats have played down expectations for the mission with no sign of fundamental divisions on the Council being bridged.<\/p><p>The UN Secretary General is wary of interference with Russia and China wielding a veto over any Council mandate.  Russia regards military intervention as an infringement on the sovereignty of Syria.  The Council is further divided over whether the current regime has any role to play in a transition.<\/p><p>The deteriorating situation marks a clear failure of the United Nations which has been paralysed over the issue while thousands continue to die.  Western states have been reluctant to give unilateral military support to the Free Syrian Army in the fear that the group will become more radical and that heavy weapons will ultimately be used to enforce an Islamic regime.  The murder of the US ambassador to Libya has underlined the potential for a revolution to rebound on its supporters.<\/p><p>I thank the Leader for providing time for the debate and the Minister of State for a comprehensive response.  I wish him well when travelling to the region and assisting in the humanitarian needs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012092500037#MM00300","speaker":"1140","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348593600,"counter":245,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Costello, to the House and thank him for a comprehensive report on his recent visit to Jordan.  I compliment him on securing aid of more than \u20ac2 million which is badly needed by the people who are suffering gravely as a result of the Assad regime.  It is timely that the debate is taking place in a week when the T\u00e1naiste is attending a meeting of the UN General Assembly which will discuss the Syrian crisis and, I hope, make some progress.<\/p><p>As the Minister of State has outlined, several million people within the country and refugees in Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey are in need of help and the crisis is growing.  We have all been horrified and shocked by the scale of the crisis we have seen on our television screens and on various media outlets which have sent us information recently and we are frustrated at the lack of progress in bringing about a peaceful resolution to the conflict.<\/p><p>In a recent report on the humanitarian situation, the UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, painted a particularly grim picture when he said that the conflict has taken a particularly brutal turn with Government forces continuing their indiscriminate shelling of densely populated areas with heavy weapons and opposition groups stepping up their military activities.  Civilians have borne the brunt of the violence and large-scale human rights violations have been reported.  Prisoners on both sides have been subjected to harsh treatment, including torture, and there have been alarming reports of summary executions.<\/p> <p>Government forces and the armed opposition had failed to protect civilians and respect international humanitarian law while more than 1.2 million people have been displaced inside Syria.<\/p><p>  The UN Secretary General also said that the number of refugees registered in Turkey, Jordan, the Lebanon and Iraq was rising to above 225,000.  While primary responsibility for ending the conflict lay with the parties, notably the government, there was a collective duty to help Syrians to resolve their differences peacefully.  With that in mind, he again urged the Government and armed opposition to abandon military activities, engage in dialogue, protect civilians and abide by their obligations under international human rights and humanitarian law.  The United Nations was committed to helping them come to the negotiating table and move towards a democratic and plural political system with equal rights for all.  The Syrian people have waited too long, he declared.  We all share his sentiments and call on all international politicians to redouble their efforts to resolve the conflict before any more innocent lives are lost.<\/p><p> Amnesty International, in a recent briefing, said: <ul>Indiscriminate air bombardments and artillery strikes by the Syrian army are killing, maiming and terrorizing residents of Jabal al-Zawiya, Idlib and north Hama regions. Every day civilians are killed or injured in their homes or trying to shelter from the bombings.  Hundreds have been killed or injured in recent weeks, many of them children, in indiscriminate attacks.  <\/p><p> Some towns and villages have been virtually emptied of their residents, many of whom are now camping out in surrounding countryside or hiding in caves; others are crowding in with relatives in what they hope are safer areas, while others have sought refuge in Turkey - or are currently stuck at the border with Turkey waiting to flee the country.  <\/p><p> With the attention of the international media mostly focused on the fighting in Aleppo and the capital, hardly any news reaches the outside world about the horrors of daily life for the residents of Idlib and other Hama regions.  <\/ul>It is particularly worrying that while we there is a high profile coverage given to the atrocities in highly populated areas much is happening in the smaller regions and communities.  <\/p><p> The Irish Syrian Solidarity campaign has lobbied the Government to prioritise the distribution of aid to field hospitals in areas of Syria controlled by the opposition.  These hospitals, I am told, are the only sources of medical aid for civilians living in the areas.  Recently a Syrian consultant interviewed on RTE - he now works in Ireland - said that during his work in a field hospital over the summer almost all of his patients were injured civilians.  So far the Government has declined to assist field hospitals but I ask the Minister of State to review the situation.  Perhaps he will comment on it during his response.  A serious concern is that Irish aid may not be reaching the areas in dire need in Syria.  According to Dr. Banan, the Red Cross and other large NGOs are only able to distribute aid with the agreement of the Assad regime.  The Minister of State referred to the matter in his speech and I ask him to elaborate further on the matter.<\/p><p> The Syrian conflict is a humanitarian crisis of enormous proportions.  There is a responsibility on the international community to force a solution and the Assad regime and armed opposition groups must be held accountable for their actions.  The UN Security Council must show some muscle by referring the Syrian conflict to the International Criminal Court and I welcome the Government's support for the stance. <\/p><p> The Government will hold the Presidency of the EU from 1 January and I hope that significant progress will be made during the period to resolve the crisis.  I welcome the Minister of State's closing remark when he said that some progress may be made with the united Arab League and the Russian Federation beginning to engage in the process.   <\/p><p> As I said, we are horrified at the enormous loss of life and the displacement of so many innocent people in Syria.  It is incumbent on all of us, as politicians, to redouble our efforts to ensure that the situation can be resolved or improved.  The Minister of State indicated that the grave uncertainty about the future of the Assad regime makes the entire situation uncertain.  <\/p><p> I welcome the appointment of the Joint Special Representative Brahimi and hope significant progress will be made during the coming months.  The conflict will take a considerable amount of time to resolve and there will be a significant opportunity for Ireland and its EU partners, during our Presidency, to assist in the process.  I look forward to the Minister of State's response to the issues I have raised. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012092500038#NN00200","speaker":"1118","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348594200,"counter":247,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  He has been a regular visitor to the Seanad since he took up his portfolio, for which I commend him.  I also compliment him on securing &#8364;2 million in aid for the war torn area.  It is great that he is here to listen to our views and statements on the humanitarian crisis arising from the regrettable conflict in Syria.  The conflict appears to be intensifying  and, as a consequence, is devastating for all civilians who reside there and whose lives have been utterly changed since the catastrophe began.<\/p><p>  The conflict has taken on a particularly brutal and violent character.  We have all been privy to horribly distressing images on our television screens that show ordinary women, men and children being caught up in the midst of it all.  Lives have been, and continue to be, devastated and families are being decimated.  People are being killed at a rate of over 20 per day and well over 100,000 citizens have been arrested or detained.  The regime's totalitarian tactics have reached a pitch of unparalleled savagery in the history of the Arab world.<\/p><p>  Part of the problem in the country is due to the fact that the traditional political opposition in Syria has not been strengthened over the years and the Assad regime has squashed any such development in the three decades that it has held power.  As a consequence there is no meaningful political participation in the country given that the people and state employees, in particular, are expected to slavishly follow the rule of politics laid down by the Ba'athist regime.  For those opposed to Assad's political views they can expect to forgo their freedom and languish in prisons or in exile so it has proved difficult to garner and foster any real opposition.  There have been attempts to unite all opposition groups into a single front but given that their geographical position is outside of the country it has been hard to do anything meaningful.<\/p><p>  A beacon of hope shines in the grassroot organisation known as the people's movement.  This gathering can be confident of its achievements to date and with every passing day it grows and advances the people's cause, the citizens of Syria.  In hot spots such as Homs, Hama, Deraa and the Damascus hinterland it has won over the majority of inhabitants.  Thousands of civilians are now participating in hundreds, if not thousands, of organised demonstrations, rallies and sit-ins which aim to highlight its attempts at rebellion and speaking up for the ordinary citizen.  They have shown heroic courage and continue with their protests unabated  despite a real threat to their safety.  It is worth noting that from the first day the Assad regime has encouraged the uprising away from its non-violent principles and towards militarisation.  It was a cunning political move by the regime because it was aware that the opposition would be militarily inferior and easily squashed and at the same time it would legitimise, or attempt to legitimise, Assad's use of violence and thereby gain some degree of international support.  The move is worrying.<\/p><p>  A potential stumbling block in the desire of the grassroot popular movement to advance is the regime's remarkable cohesion.  It is in stark contrast with the Libyan crisis where significant elements declared internally that they had broken with the regime and displayed a degree of fragility, albeit behind the <i>faux<\/i> portrayal of public solidity.<\/p><p>  Syria's armed forces remain obedient to the regime to a fault. Their unwavering loyalty to a despotic regime can be explained in the context of Assad's response to any perceived lack of commitment.  Reports from the battleground mean that it is not unusual for soldiers to pay with their lives for refusing to open fire on civilians or attempting to flee clashes and demonstrators.  Moreover, all senior government employees are forbidden from leaving Syria without first obtaining special permission from the security services.  All of this means that there has been a clear and flagrant breach of international humanitarian law.  The most fundamental protection offered under these laws is the protection of civilians.  Ireland must do its bit to highlight the crisis, keep highlighting it and to raise it again with the appropriate officials within the EU and the UN.<\/p> <p>We must do something further to increase our humanitarian assistance to the men, women and children who are facing the terrible consequences of this crisis.  It is clear from international reports that the humanitarian situation has worsened considerably since it first began.  People are displaced and homes are abandoned.  According to the Syrian Government's figures, up to 1.2 million people are sheltering in public buildings.  Others are seeking refuge with their relatives and friends and all concerned urgently require humanitarian intervention by the necessary agencies due to the widening impact of the crisis on the economy and people's livelihoods.  There is a clear and present requirement for health care, shelter, food, water and sanitation.  There are serious public health issues in many of the public buildings that are being used as shelters.<\/p><p> There has been significant disruption as well to the education of thousands of Syrian children, as the Minister of State, Deputy Costello, alluded to, since the beginning of the academic year in September.  The future seems very bleak.  I commend the UN and its partners on reaching more people each month with emergency aid.  I commend the countries in Europe and throughout the world that have contributed to the aid programme.  In spite of difficulties accessing people in most need as a result of heavy fighting, the World Food Programme distributes food through the Syrian Arab Red Crescent.  The local partners reach more than 820,000 people across Syria.  While this goes some way to alleviating hunger problems, it is merely a drop in the ocean, considering there is a real and pressing need to deal with 2.5 million people.  While the current situation in Syria is becoming more severe, we must find a new solution to the issue.  I commend the efforts being made by the UN and other agencies in this regard.  As an EU country we must continue to lobby the UN and other agencies to keep the pressure on the various factions and call on them to enter talks with one another.  We must urge them to co-operate with the mediation efforts of international peace envoy, Lakhdar Brahimi. <b><i><\/i><\/b>Furthermore we must aim to get diplomatic support for an agreement between the government and opposition<b><i><\/i><\/b>for the formation of a transitional government.<b><\/b>However, as a caveat, we must fully ensure that any movement is championed by the Syrian people and is not imposed from outside.<\/p><p> The brutality associated with the war has transformed most Syrian citizens into tragic figures and it is high time that stopped.  As an Irish observer in the conflict I reiterate that Ireland must make it very clear that we reject in its totality all forms of violence and breaches of human rights.  We must ensure that we are more vocal in urging the different factions to ensure a successful ceasefire, which should include the release of all prisoners and the granting of humanitarian access unhindered.<\/p><p> I repeat my call to those engaged in the conflict to respect civilians and abide by international humanitarian law.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012092500039#OO00200","speaker":"1173","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348594800,"counter":249,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Costello, to this Chamber.  I listened on the monitor to his moving account of his visit to Jordan.  It brings home to us in the Seanad what is happening in Syria.  May I ask a personal question?  It seems there is a sense of resignation, and the sense of the impotency of the United Nations.  I read the oral update issued in June on the independent international commission of inquiry in the Syrian Arab Republic.  We are witnessing a human catastrophe in terms of human rights.  There is evidence of the sexual violation of children.  The commission of inquiry acknowledges that the joint special envoy's six-point plan, supported by the United Nations mission in Syria offers the best framework for the resolution of the conflict.  I would like to hear the Minister of State's political viewpoint.  We are looking for a non-violent resolution to the conflict but at the same time we are also bearing witness to a catastrophe and, in my view, war crimes.  I have been careful in my use of language.  I know the Minister must be careful also.<\/p><p>  I got a sense of resignation when listening to the Minister of State.  He did say, however, and we might tease out this point, that the Russian Federation was beginning to get involved.  We may look at how it might engage with the humanitarian side. <\/p><p>  I feel very helpless about what is happening.  There was a report in<i> The Irish Times <\/i>on Saturday which brought the situation home to us.  Irish citizens from the Muslim community are involved in the fighting and are implicated in the anti-Government side.  We have a moral responsibility to our citizens, which means that for all of us, Syria is not that far away.  I would like to get a sense of reassurance or qualification on my feelings that what the United Nations is trying to do is not good enough, whether there is another way of resolving the issue or that we should stick to the framework suggested by the United Nations mission in Syria. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012092500040#PP00200","speaker":"1167"},{"type":"speech","time":1348594800,"counter":250,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his presence in the Chamber.  We are all struck by what we see on the television, and what we read with regard to the Syrian catastrophe.  My reason for speaking today is as a result of my experience during my visit to Rwanda in August.  There I saw the fallout of the genocide 18 years earlier, where 1 million people were killed in 100 days and the international community failed to act, in spite of the fact it was asked to provide 5,000 troops.  Kofi Annan now admits he was wrong and did not listen.  Some 18 years later, people are still devastated.  Many of the men were killed, leaving widows and orphans.  There are families headed by children.  We are looking at a similar situation happening in Syria.<\/p><p>I support many of the views expressed by Senator Mac Conghail.  I am concerned that we are happy enough with how the UN is dealing with the situation, but I do not think it is working.  The UN is certainly not reacting fast enough.  We are fortunate that a man of the deep humanity of Deputy Joe Costello is the Minister of State at the Department dealing with this issue.  When the Minister of State responds to the debate will he outline whether Ireland is doing enough, in terms of the weight it can bring to bear on human rights abuses?  We have always punched above our weight in the area of human rights.  Some 19,000 people have been killed and 2.5 million people are in desperate need of assistance.  The Minister of State described the plight of the refugees.  To echo his comment, this is a timebomb.  The civilian population, including children, are bearing the brunt of the conflict.  The Government forces attack indiscriminately.  The indiscriminate nature of the bombardments means there is little residents can do to protect themselves.  There is clear violation of international humanitarian law.  Amnesty has urged the UN Security Council to refer the situation in Syria to the prosecutor at the International Criminal Court in order to ensure that the perpetrators of these crimes and other crimes under international law are brought to justice.  The families of their victims would then receive reparations.  In his speech, the Minister of State said he supported this call.  Has Ireland formally referred the situation in Syria to the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court?  Are we just supporting others?  We must step up to the plate and show leadership.  We must act.  If this was happening to Irish civilians, we would want the protection of the international community.<\/p><p>The killing in Syria is government-sponsored.  As the independent international commission said, the human rights abuses by the opposition groups are not comparable in scale and organisation to those carried out by the state.  This is state-sponsored war.  It is similar to what I saw in Rwanda.<\/p> <p> On the issue of why the UN is not acting more resolutely to stop this, there is the veto situation with Russia and China, and they have a great deal to answer for in this regard.  What contact has the Minister of State had with the Russian and Chinese ambassadors to Ireland to reflect the serious disappointment of the Government with the repeated vetoes used by Russia and China of Security Council resolutions on Syria to resolve this conflict?  I understand that we are trying to build trade relations with China, but that does not mean one cannot express one's deep concern about its actions in this regard.  We must be very clear about what is right and wrong.  Has the Minister raised with the ambassadors the call from Amnesty International and others for arms embargoes, referrals to the International Criminal Court and Ireland's position in that regard?<\/p><p>In summary, is the Minister satisfied that Ireland is doing enough?  Ordinary people on the street regularly ask me what they can do.  It is an interesting question from the people in Galway.  They are really asking on whom they can put pressure.  They know they can donate, but it is not enough simply to donate when there is a political crisis in this case and where political interests are put ahead of human rights.  Children are being used as human shields, people are being tortured and killed and the displacement described by the Minister means there will be fallout for many years to come.  I look forward to the Minister of State's response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012092500040#PP00300","speaker":"1131","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348595400,"counter":252,"content":"<p>I extend a hearty c\u00e9ad m\u00edle f\u00e1ilte to the Minister of State, Deputy Joe Costello, who is very familiar with this Chamber.  I applaud him for the initiatives he has taken so far on behalf of the people, particularly his recent visit to Jordan which was widely publicised.  He brought home to the people the horror of the humanitarian crisis that is unfolding just a few hours away by aeroplane.  In fact, the UN envoy, Mr. Brahimi, warned on Monday that the situation was &quot;extremely bad and getting worse.&quot;<\/p><p>  I will take up the theme of Senator Healy Eames's contribution regarding what the Government can do and the issue of the UN and its lack of capacity to move forward on this issue at the Security Council.  What political dimension is the Government bringing to this?  I compliment the Government on the fact that it moved very quickly.  As a result of initiatives taken over the last number of years we were able to move resources from within the region.  Heretofore, we would have been obliged to send them directly from Ireland, which would have taken a great deal of time.  Goods to the value of &#8364;400,000 were moved from Dubai and there has been a total donation of &#8364;2.1 million.  That is an example of joined-up thinking in terms of the manner in which we provide humanitarian aid internationally.<\/p><p>  What else is the Government doing, for example, in terms of lobbying at the United Nations?  Ireland has a proud record in the United Nations.  It is not seen as an aligned country, although the complexities of the Middle East might limit our capacity in that regard.  It should also be remembered that Ireland currently holds the chairmanship of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE.  As Russia is a leading player in the OSCE, have there been bilateral discussions with the Russian Federation regarding the stance it has taken so far at the United Nations?  Obviously, Russia has a vested interest given that its only port on the Mediterranean is in Syrian territorial waters.  China always has its own agenda and it is keeping a watching brief.  Obviously it is scared silly, as is Russia, of any type of military intervention because they say it would infringe on the country's sovereignty.  When one has the Chechen problem in one's backyard, as Russia does, and a Taiwan problem, as China has, one will obviously take that position anyway.  However, that does not help the situation.  Like Senator Mac Conghail and others, I ask the Minister of State to elaborate in his final comments regarding the Russian Federation now engaging in terms of putting forward a concrete proposal.  It would be helpful to hear if the Minister of State has any further information in that regard.<\/p><p>  The humanitarian crisis is overwhelming when one considers the numbers.  As the Minister of State outlined them, I will not repeat what he said but 2.5 million people, which is equivalent to two thirds of the population of the country, are in need of humanitarian assistance.  The biggest problem is the impact it is having in terms of the destabilising effect on neighbouring countries, particularly Lebanon.  There are more than 56,000 Syrians in Lebanon who are registered or awaiting registration.  However, there is also the Palestinian refugee issue, which has not been highlighted to any great extent.  Syria hosts nearly 500,000 Palestinian refugees.  It has offered assurances that they will not be attacked but the camps have been attacked.  As a result the Palestinians have been fleeing to Jordan and Lebanon.  In Jordan there is a real destabilising impact because of the sensitivities surrounding the Palestinians already <i>in situ<\/i> who came there following the expulsion of Palestinians from Kuwait in 1992 and the exodus from Iraq during the war.  In Lebanon it is even more problematic because those who are fleeing Syria are seeking shelter in the Shatila refugee camp, which is effectively a slum and where there are 455,000 Palestinian refugees already registered.  The question is whether that country has the capacity to absorb any more without destabilising it.<\/p><p>  I make a plea to the Minister of State in the context of humanitarian assistance.  I understand that while Syrian refugees receive assistance from the UN refugee agency, UNHCR, to which we have contributed &#8364;2.1 million, Palestinian refugees fall under the mandate of UNWRA, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, which has a smaller budget.  UNWRA has appealed for an additional &#8364;21.4 million for its consolidated regional plan but has so far received less than a quarter of that sum.  It has appealed for the &#8364;21.4 million to assist Palestinian refugees, who are falling between the cracks in this growing humanitarian crisis.  Perhaps the Minister of State has an opinion on this.  We contribute to UNWRA and as I am sure the Minister of State has already visited the UNWRA camps, he will be familiar with this matter.  Given his background he will already be aware of the important work UNWRA is doing in the Palestinian territories.<\/p><p>  I will conclude my contribution with one stark fact.  In the context of any attempt being made by Mr. Brahimi, the UN, the Government and others to try to solve this problem, it is estimated that there are more than 2,000 armed groups operating on Syrian soil.  Most of them are fragmented and disparate.  I wish the Minister of State well in his efforts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012092500041#QQ00400","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1348595400,"counter":253,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State back to the House.  I strongly welcome the information he gave the House towards the end of his statement regarding the initiatives being taken today by the Arab League and Russia.  This conflict has dragged on for 18 months and has claimed 20,000 lives, and violence continues to spread to more parts of the country.  In August alone, 100,000 people fled Syria.  The initiatives by Russia and the Arab League are a chink of light in what has been a period of utter desperation for the ordinary, innocent Syrian population.  I hope the new peace envoy, Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi, will have a more successful mission than his predecessor, Mr. Kofi Annan.  Both sides in Syria have until now rejected any type of compromise and the international community has been deeply divided.  Mr. Brahimi said recently that the support of the international community is indispensable and urgently required.  I hope, as a result of what has happened today, we will see some progress.<\/p><p>Last month's flood of refugees is certainly not a coincidence given that Bashar al-Assad appears to have upped the ante, to use a crude phrase.<\/p> <p>His regime controls the skies, although I do not believe it has control on the ground, and it uses this advantage to indiscriminately bomb towns and villages, schools, hospitals and homes with absolute impunity.  As a result of this bombardment, according to an article in <i>The Washington Post<\/i>yesterday, most people now sleep in the fields at night.  While that option was viable in warmer temperatures and while food was plentiful, cushioning the blow somewhat for the displaced, the arrival of near freezing winter temperatures will mean greater suffering and a deepening of the crisis.  Last winter was bad and this winter will be worse, in my opinion.  Last winter people had savings and food but the situation is now completely different because those savings are exhausted.  While food might be plentiful in the north of Syria, it is not affordable for many.<\/p><p> The Minister of State acknowledged Ireland's response.  I wonder, however, about the humanitarian aid hub that was mooted for Shannon Airport some time ago.  Perhaps a project like this would give a shot in the arm to the region and we could see it speeded up or realised during our Presidency of the European Union.<\/p><p> Following the European Union lead recently, the United States today has agreed to delist from a terrorist database a group styling itself the People's Mujahidin of Iran.  As far as I can gather, this group is considered suspect and has styled itself as a government in waiting.  Will the delisting of such a group by the United States have a destabilising effect on the region?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012092500041#QQ00500","speaker":"1119","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348596000,"counter":255,"content":"<p>Like other Senators, I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  The media and some commentators regularly use the term \"Arab spring\" but the reality is that each country must be looked at differently.  There are similarities and many positive things happening throughout the Arab world but in the case of Syria we should not rush to simplistic conclusions.<\/p><p>Our position in Sinn F\u00e9in is clear - we want to see Assad gone.  The regime is brutal, we have heard numerous examples of that brutality throughout this debate, and it has no respect for human rights.  That is not a recent change in the nature of the regime.  In 1982, Assad's father brutally cracked down on a rebellion, killing between 20,000 and 40,000 people.<\/p><p>We are not, however, prepared to blindly throw support behind any particular opposition group.  The aims and origins of many of these groups can be shadowy and diverse.  Both sides to the conflict have been involved in the torture and assassination of prisoners, the indiscriminate targeting of rival ethnic religious groups and we should not be naive to the fact there have been foreign influences and interests in Syria and they are not entirely benign to say the least.  It is a fractured opposition that includes Islamic fundamentalists as well as ordinary Syrians who want civil and political rights.  These groups are then further subdivided, with some funded by America, France, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Turkey, while the Government is allegedly receiving military and financial support from Iran.<\/p><p>There has been an undoubted intensification of the fighting in recent weeks, with the Syrian Government increasing its bombing of residential areas and using its superior air power to bomb the rest of the population into submission.  In addition, rebel groups have grown stronger in the north and control certain border areas with Turkey.  This points to a protracted military stalemate, the last thing the ordinary people of Syrian want or need.  There is an immediate need to end this and for peace and reconciliation to start as soon as possible but that is easier said than done.  We do, however, want to see Assad gone and the introduction of democracy and the rule of law, with respect for all ethnic, religious and racial groups in Syria.<\/p><p>Neutral countries with no strategic interest in the region have an important role in trying to broker a peace but post-war settlements should be decided by Syrians and it is up to the Syrian people to decide what government they will install when the fighting stops.  It should be done democratically.  We are against any country providing military or financial support to any side in the war but countries should use their resources to help those displaced and wounded in the fighting.  We have heard repeatedly this evening about the number of people who have been killed, injured and displaced and we call on the Syrian Government to open its borders to NGOs and humanitarian organisations to help the civilians who are drastically affected by the war.<\/p><p>We welcome the Minister of State's decision to visit the Syrian refugee camps in Jordan recently and commend the Government for its recent decision to contribute an extra \u20ac1.6 million in aid to the UN agencies and humanitarian organisations.  We call on the Government to use its influence during the Presidency of the European Union in 2013 to help broker a peace deal and to ensure humanitarian assistance continues to flow into Syria to help those affected by the humanitarian crisis and those refugees who have fled to neighbouring countries.  Senator Healy Eames talked about our human rights record and it is important we use the EU Presidency to highlight the ongoing humanitarian situation in Syria and put our weight behind it because of our credibility in the area.<\/p><p>Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi, in his first interview, said that the point he wanted to make as strongly and seriously as possible is that the situation is bad and getting worse, it is not improving.  According to him, Syrians on both sides say from time to time that victory will be won soon but that is not true, no side is winning now and the situation is getting worse, and that is a huge threat to the region.  Does the Minister of State think the new UN-Arab League envoy to Syria can help broker a peace deal and will he get any more respect from the Syrian regime and the fighters than Kofi Annan did when trying to broker a peace deal?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012092500042#RR00200","speaker":"1155"},{"type":"speech","time":1348596000,"counter":256,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and thank him for the contribution he made.  I commend him for taking the initiative to visit the refugee camps.  It is only when one visits the refugee camps that one can see the difficulties on the ground.  In 2008 I visited Chad and the Sudanese border area to see 500,000 people in refugee camps and IDP sites, where people lived in fear because within a short distance of the camps there were people carrying arms and the danger was constant.  Going to the refugee camp means we can see the difficulties.<\/p><p>The difficulty during a war is getting access to food, water and medical supplies.<\/p> <p>As for my experience back in March 2008, I recall speaking to the people who were organising the importation of food.  They needed to bring in something like 57,000 tonnes by the start of June and trying to so do was a huge effort.  The same problem arises in this case, as the refugee camps are getting bigger by the day.  As the numbers seeking a place of safety continue to grow, trying to service such sites and ensuring people who require medical treatment can get it are major problems, as are trying to bring in the required expertise to the sites and making sure those who provide that expertise are secure and protected, which also is an important issue.  The Minister of State's visit highlights the importance Ireland is placing on trying to deal with the issues involved.<\/p><p>One major concern is the American presidential election campaign will take place in the next three months.  People who wish to gain power tend to make use of this time because people in America - this is not a criticism of United States - are greatly focused on the next four years of government.  In particular, Members should consider what happened in January 2009, when Israel decided to bombard Gaza.  The interesting point is this bombardment took place during a changeover of the United States presidency, when little or no action would be taken against Israel.  Similarly, because of the aforementioned three or four-month timeframe between now and Christmas, I am concerned by what people on all sides in Syria may attempt to do in the full knowledge there will be little international response, particularly from the United States.  The Minister of State referred to the more than 500,000 Palestinians living in Syria, which is another issue of concern.  It is a huge number of people to which one can add the 900,000 people in Gaza who are being supplied from food stations at present and are reliant on getting food from them.  One thing I did as a member of the committee on foreign affairs of the European Parliament was to visit Gaza four weeks after the Israeli bombardment to see the kind of conditions in which people were living.  The difficulty with Syria is the problem is growing in that the number of casualties is growing and lack of care and access to medical treatment unfortunately is also a huge problem.<\/p><p>One issue that always is of concern to me in respect of all international conflicts is the manner in which the arms trade is the real beneficiary and how very little has been done on an international basis to place restrictions on how the arms trade behaves.  This issue has never been tackled by the United Nations or internationally.  The arms trade has been given an absolute free hand and Europe must do something in that it plays a part in contributing to that trade.  Many countries within the European Union, including Ireland, make contributions to the arms trade and I reiterate the real beneficiaries in wars and conflicts are those who manufacture the arms and provide the munitions.  People have failed to face or stand up to this issue and Ireland should examine it during its Presidency of the European Union.  While I acknowledge it is not a very popular issue to raise, I believe it can no longer be ignored.  When one considers what is happening in Syria, where arms and munitions are coming in from all directions, many people are making much profit from that trade.  This is an issue we must face up to from a European perspective.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012092500042#RR00300","speaker":"1150","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348596600,"counter":258,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his attendance.  As other Members have noted, he has given them a good account of his visit, which has brought home to them the importance of being on the ground.  I believe Senator Mac Conghail referred to how there is a sense of powerlessness.  When something of this scale involving thousands of people in such difficulty takes place, it is very hard to believe Members speaking up can make a difference.  However, of course it does because were they to stay silent, they would appear to acquiesce and, consequently, they must continue to speak up and to maintain the pressure and must continue to remind themselves, other Irish people and the world of their concern in this regard.<\/p><p>The word &quot;crisis&quot; is too small to describe the devastating situation in Syria.  However, it is extraordinary to discover the matter of Syria is not on the formal agenda of the United Nations General Assembly meeting that opened yesterday.  I find this to be beyond belief.  The Minister of State may know the reason - I do not necessarily expect he does - and may be able to tell Members the reason.  I note this did not prevent the envoy, Lakhdar Brahimi, from expressing his views and thoughts, albeit in an informal manner.  His statement that matters are bad and getting worse gave Senator Mac Conghail the opportunity to mention that feeling of resignation.  This is a man of enormous experience who has worked in Haiti, Afghanistan and Iraq and who is a member of both the Elders and the Global Economic Forum.  Even though he has only been in the job for a mere month, if such a man returns from Syria to make such a statement, he really is saying much more than that.  While there is no easy answer to this, what he did was to make a real plea and a real cry for help.  Senator Healy Eames referred to a visit to Rwanda and as she noted in respect of the events there involving 1 million people and the Hutu and Tutsi, people stood aside and let that happen.  However, 18 years later, we are doing the same thing again for the past 18 months.  Today's report from the Save the Children charity is full of stories.  They have named the children in order that people can understand this is not merely bunches of thousands or hundreds of people.  This involves real children with real parents in real places being treated appallingly in the bus queue, buying bread, in the shops or in hospitals and schools.  They are being abused, tortured, kidnapped, imprisoned, murdered or bombed.  It is the same story from Amnesty International.  As a huge quantity of material is available, we are actually doing the same thing that was done previously in Rwanda.  I refer to Senator Healy Eames's comments on the legacy there 18, 28 and 30 years on.  Moreover, I note Kofi Annan, who was Secretary General of the United Nations at the time, has acknowledged he was wrong.  He played a considerable part in the decisions that were taken in that instance to do very little or nothing.<\/p><p>In this case, Ireland's role is smaller.  While it has punched above its weight in the United Nations, as other Members have noted, not being on the Security Council leaves it with a ringside seat only.  However, we must make use of that and it is clear that Syria is a political football.  I refer to the role of China and the Russian Federation on the one side and while Lakhdar Brahimi is stating things are getting worse, he effectively is stating that while the fighting is getting worse, the relationships on the Security Council also are worsening.  I do not know whether the Minister of State is in a position to tell Members whether Ireland, during its forthcoming Presidency of the European Union, has the capacity or willingness to use it as a wider platform to take on that debate at a political level.  I acknowledge this would not be not easy and do not suggest Ireland should simply go out and do it.  The matter is far too complex and I would not insult anyone's intelligence by suggesting that but I wonder where Ireland stands or whether it would be able to do this.  I acknowledge the Minister of State and others have called for many measures in support of human rights, such as referring Syria to the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court for investigation of crimes.  This should have been but has not been done by the Security Council of the United Nations.  The Government of Syria continues to not allow proper international human rights monitors into the country.  While these measures should be taken now, they are merely part of the immediate crisis.  As for the bigger political picture, however, while Ireland is small it will be stuck right in the middle of Europe -for want of a better way of putting it - in the next six months.<\/p> <p>I would like to believe the Government will not shirk from the responsibility and find a way to play a role in this matter.  Many of us have been on our feet in this House about this issue, and we will go on.  However, as Senator Mac Conghail says, sometimes we feel very powerless in this situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012092500043#SS00200","speaker":"1129","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348597200,"counter":260,"content":"<p>I thank the Senators for their incisive and knowledgeable input.  They have given me some awkward questions which I will answer to the best of my ability.  <\/p><p>I thank Senators Leyden, Mullen, Higgins, Mac Conghail, Healy Eames, Mooney, Heffernan, Reilly, Colm Burke and O'Keeffe for their contributions.  Rather than go over what each said, I will try to cover the themes as I introduced them.<\/p><p>I will cover the humanitarian aid side and give an idea of what is facing Syria.  There is constant United Nations revision of the funding needs for the humanitarian aid response.  It is seeking \u20ac347 million for the humanitarian response as distinct from the refugee response.  It is only 30% funded.  The UN has indicated that it requires \u20ac193 million for the regional refugee response, which is 54% funded so far.  It is anticipated that by the end of this month the United Nations will again revise its figures on both the humanitarian and refugee responses and that the funding will be greatly increased.  I will give a breakdown of where the Irish money has gone.  In March 2012 we gave \u20ac500,000 broken down as follows: the UNHCR got \u20ac200,000, the International Committee for the Red Cross-Red Crescent got \u20ac100,000, and the World Food Programme got \u20ac200,000.  In August we gave \u20ac1.6 million broken down as follows: the UNHCR got \u20ac500,000 plus \u20ac400,000 for non-food items, the ICRC got a further \u20ac300,000, the World Health Organization got \u20ac300,000, and the IRC got \u20ac100,000.<\/p><p>Already the United Nations has contacted us seeking further funding, in particular indicating it will need tents and materials for the winter, including blankets.  I have asked my staff to try to arrange a further shipment of up to 300 tents, 2,500 blankets and 3,000 jerry cans for the Sasari refugee camp, which represents a value of up to \u20ac150,000.  These items will be available from the Irish Aid stocks in Dubai.  Senator Heffernan mentioned the humanitarian hub we are seeking to establish in Shannon.  I have initiated a feasibility study of Shannon becoming a humanitarian depot, using the space available there to provide supplies of materials that can be used at short notice for humanitarian emergencies.  I expect to receive that report tomorrow and will study it carefully.  In due course I will let Senators know the outcome.  Ireland is to the fore in the quest to have depots throughout the world to provide a rapid response to earthquakes, tsunamis, famines, etc.  Ireland has a rapid response unit allowing us to immediately send into the field people who have technical abilities in areas such as medicine, tents, sewerage, civil engineering, etc.  A depot would allow those supplies to be transported immediately to any part of the world.<\/p><p>Senator Mooney spoke about the Palestinian population in Syria.  That area is very much a cockpit, with Syria right in the middle surrounded by countries such as Lebanon, Jordan, Iran and Iraq, with countries such as Qatar and Saudi Arabia further afield.  All have political interests in the area.  Some of them are fragile states and some are states which feel they have strategic interests in it.  In addition, the superpowers have strategic interests there.  As it is such a complex situation, it has been impossible to get UN Security Council agreement on a resolution.  Mr. Kofi Annan's six point plan begins with a ceasefire and the Security Council could not even reach agreement on that, which is outrageous.  The Security Council has been pretty much stymied in that respect and the six point plan has been made redundant.  Mr. Kofi Annan has resigned and has been replaced.<\/p><p>The Palestinian aspect is potentially quite serious because there are already 2 million displaced Palestinians in Jordan, for example.  There are also displaced Palestinians in Lebanon, Iraq and Turkey.  However, Jordan is particularly affected, not to mention Gaza.  There are 500,000 in the Damascus area, which is not far from either Jordan or Lebanon.  If 500,000 Palestinians came into Jordan, it would result in Palestinians becoming the majority population in Jordan because Palestine is a small country.  This would create a major logistical and political issue.  There is real concern among the Jordanian population at the possibility of having such a massive influx of Palestinians and there is the real danger of them closing their borders because it would result in a disproportionate element to the population.  That is quite serious and it is equally serious for Lebanon and could have a major impact on what are fragile countries in political terms.<\/p><p>Senator Mooney mentioned the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, UNRWA, and we are in contact with it.  Representatives of UNRWA will visit the country shortly given the possibility of something along the lines of what we have been discussing arising.  Mr. Filippo Grandi, the commissioner general of UNRWA, will visit Ireland shortly to discuss matters of this nature with the T\u00e1naiste and me.  He will seek funding and support, obviously, in dealing with that sort of displacement, particularly as it might affect the Palestinian community.  There is flux in all these situations and we are addressing them as best we can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012092500044#TT00200","speaker":"1006"},{"type":"speech","time":1348597200,"counter":261,"content":"<p>It might help to stabilise the Palestinian issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012092500044#TT00300","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1348597200,"counter":262,"content":"<p>It is vital we stabilise the Palestinian issue because it could have a knock-on effect throughout the Middle East and further afield.<\/p><p>A number of Senators asked how we would address the issue of human rights.  We have raised the issue at every level, including at European Union level where we have sanctions.  We have raised it in respect of the International Criminal Court at the United Nations.  Unfortunately, as Senator O'Keeffe mentioned, we cannot get the issues relating to Syria referred to the International Criminal Court.  It can only be done through the Security Council, which must agree to it.  We are working with other countries to get such agreement.<\/p> <p> The same problems have arisen in regard to getting agreement on intervention in Syria and on the arms embargo and so on.  There are countries that are sending arms into Syria on both sides and using Syria for their own political purposes.  It is difficult to move forward while this continues.  The Security Council is not agreed on a way forward.  We will continue to raise the matter at the United Nations.  While the issue is not directly on the agenda of the United Nations, which I do not understand, <i>en marge <\/i>there will be substantial meetings in regard to the Friends of Palestine getting together to try to agree a formula for progress in that respect.<\/p><p> I have mentioned that the Human Rights Council is meeting in Geneva.  While I do not wish to be over-enthusiastic about a possible resolution it is encouraging that the Russian federation is, for the first time, engaging with the Arab League, which is the body more likely to have some clout in this area than would perhaps some other countries.  Russia is an important player in this.  In many ways, China is taking its lead from Russia.  Russia has important strategic interests and wants to see how they are going to be protected.  As far as I can gather, none of the countries are carrying a torch for the Assad regime but are all concerned about what will happen if that regime collapses.  For this reason, it is very important - we have also been calling for this - that the disparate groups in the opposition, of which there are so many, come together and agree a cohesive position which ensures they are seen as a negotiating group.  Negotiation will probably be the solution to the problem.  Substantial parts of the population of Syria and substantial other countries support the Assad regime.  As such, it is likely there will eventually be a negotiated solution.  It is important in this regard that there is a transitional process and an opposition within Syria that can negotiate that process because there will be no internal intervention.<\/p><p> There is no question of military intervention in this case because there is no agreement among the various powers.  The situation in Syria is not at all like that which pertained in Libya.  There was no problem in regard to the Security Council.  If there is any interference in Syria, Russia and China will view it as military interference in respect of which they are not in agreement.  That in itself could create its own problems.  The general opinion abroad is that unless there is a movement on the chemical weapons in Syria it is unlikely there will be military intervention.  The fear in this respect is that the situation would only go from bad to worse.  As such, that is not going to happen, particularly in the short term.  <\/p><p> While there might be  prevailing air of powerlessness, that does not mean we will not continue to argue strongly for a humanitarian exercise in Syria.  There have been improvements in this area.  Currently, 19 local and eight international non-governmental organisations are granted access by the regime.  This means that the United Nations now has much greater access than it had.  For example, the United Nations world food programme, which is by far the largest humanitarian food aid programme in the world, which deals with the humanitarian hubs and aid depots and so on, is reaching 850,000 people each month in all of the 14 governor areas in the country.  It is reaching government and opposition controlled areas and aims to reach 1.5 million people through food distribution by the end of this month.  That is huge progress on the situation which prevailed a couple of months ago, when there was virtually no access granted to any international organisation other than the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.  When we spoke to those organisations a few weeks ago, they expressed the concern that despite the fact that they had official approval by the regime to access all areas of Syria in practice that was not the case.  They said that security was a major issue for them in accessing certain areas.<\/p><p> Senator Mullins asked about the Syrian-Irish humanitarian forum.  I have met that organisation on three or four occasions and I am sympathetic to what it has to say.  There is a fine bunch of people involved, some of whom are Irish and others of whom are Syrian, including Syrian medical professionals.  In the early stages, they were anxious that mechanisms be found to get food and medical supplies and equipment to areas of greatest need because this could not easily be done by other organisations owing to the limited access being permitted by the regime.  We explored this and learned that even the mechanisms which they used in terms of mobile hospitals within Syria had been seized of their supplies.  We could not go down the road of providing supplies unless we were working with accredited organisations.  We took up this matter directly with the United Nations, which argued the case in respect of the world food aid programme and secured access points.  The supplies we provide are delivered through accredited organisations such as the United Nations and the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.<\/p><p> Mention was made of having an air, food or humanitarian corridor, which would be impossible to do because they could only be protected through military intervention, which itself was a problem.  We will continue to examine by what avenues it is possible to get aid, supplies and medicines to civilians in need of it, regardless of what part of the country they are located, be they controlled by the regime or some of the opposition free Syrian army groups and so on.  As I stated, there is currently greater access to both areas.  We hope this will continue.  It is always useful to hear what is happening from people engaged on the ground, to whom we will respond as best we can.<\/p><p> On the question of what Lakhdar Brahimi will do, Mr. Brahimi is a person with huge credentials.  He was very candid about the fact that it was an uphill struggle, that he was operating with a redundant six point plan and that the Security Council rendered him powerless.  However, he is talking to people and is endeavouring to talk to the Syrian regime.  He has been in dialogue with the Arab League in particular, including Egypt, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Iran and is seeking to leverage their influence in relation to the crisis.  Mr. Brahimi is trying to organise inclusive dialogue - he is also talking to the Russians and Chinese - on the subject.  He is a man with considerable political skills.  I hope he makes some progress in that respect.  In the meantime we will continue to do what we can.<\/p> <p>A major OSCE meeting is taking place on 6 and 7 December, with 56 countries present.  That will be a feature of the debate.  The Presidency will begin in January and it is an issue on which we hope to make progress in terms of what the European Union can do.  The EU is the only organisation with sanctions at present and we will try to extend them and introduce an arms embargo in respect of Syria.  We will also try to make progress on humanitarian aid and gaining full access to Syria in that respect.  There are other aspects that people forget.  Schools are occupied by refugees and we must then consider where children can get education.  Today, I heard that the Zaateri camp I was in will have sufficient prefab units to enable 2,000 children to start education tomorrow.  That is only a drop in the ocean.  Winter is coming and that camp was chosen because Jordan is a country with so little water and that it is one area where adequate underground water can be accessed.  It is in the desert, close to the border with Syria.  It is a bad spot in the winter and can get very cold.  It is a tough area and the same applies to Turkey and Lebanon.<\/p><p>I am delighted to come to the Seanad to deal with the major conflict and Syria.  It could become the next major world conflict and we must do whatever we can.  We will continue to monitor the situation and use every avenue at our disposal to make a contribution to dealing with it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012092500044#TT00400","speaker":"1006","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348598400,"counter":265,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to sit again?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012092500046#VV00200","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1348598400,"counter":266,"content":"<p>Maidin am\u00e1rach ar 10.30.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012092500046#VV00300","speaker":"1130"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Adjournment Matters","time":1348598400,"counter":267,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012092500046#VV00400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects","time":1348598400,"counter":268,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012092500046#VV00500"},{"type":"speech","time":1348598400,"counter":269,"content":"<p>Senators are expected to cover the whole country, not just constituencies.

It has been on the agenda for over ten years.  The current school was designed to accommodate 250 pupils in 1974 but the original design was never completed.  The school is in poor condition.  A detailed technical evaluation showed that the school building was unsuitable.  Two independent studies were carried out in 2000 and in 2003.  The second study concluded that the problems identified with the building were such that they could not be resolved except through the provision of a new building.  The conclusion was accepted by the Department of Education and Science in 2003.  The problem is not resolved.  Following on from the meeting between Community School Initiative: Clifden and the Minister, there is a new plan for special consideration for school projects in isolated areas, as opposed to areas with population growth.

With unemployment, emigration and location on the western seaboard, the existing criteria alone cannot be used.  I ask the Minister to take into account criteria other than population growth.  He should also consider the isolation of the area and outline the new criteria used.<\/p><p>I ask the Minister of State to explain the timeline of when this project will be realistic.  Plans come and plans go and five-year plans are developed.  This project is not currently included in the five-year plan.  Some projects may be cancelled or will not go ahead and if other criteria are used now that were not used in the past, perhaps the Minister can explain the timeline envisaged for the commencement or completion of the new school.  I do not want it on the back burner.  I thank the Minister for meeting Community School Initiative: Clifden but meetings are one thing whereas actions are another.  I want to see some follow-up.  I ask the Minister of State for a timeline and hope he has the information in time to respond to this Adjournment debate.  If not, perhaps he can e-mail or write to me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012092500046#VV00800","speaker":"1135"},{"type":"speech","time":1348598400,"counter":272,"content":"<p>I am responding on behalf of the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair\u00ed Quinn.  I thank the Senator for raising the issue relating to Clifden community school and welcome the opportunity to clarify the current position on the new school building project for Clifden.<\/p><p>Clifden community school is the only second level school in the Clifden post-primary feeder area.  There are 14 primary schools in the feeder area.  The enrolments at primary level have remained stable, with 656 pupils in 2001-02 and 654 pupils in 2010-11.  The Department's projected enrolments show a slight decrease over the coming years, with a projected figure of 627 primary level pupils in 2017.<\/p><p>The design of the proposed new school building for Clifden community school has been developed based on a long-term projected enrolment of 425 pupils.  The current enrolment is just over 400 pupils and enrolment levels have been relatively stable in recent years.  Full planning permission for the new school was granted in February 2011.  The school's design team have recently submitted the stage 2(b) reports that include the detailed design of the school and tender documents.  The submission is under review by the Department.<\/p><p>In view of the need to ensure that every child has access to a school place, the delivery of major school projects to meet the demographic demands nationally will be the main focus for capital investment in schools over those years.  Total school enrolments are expected to grow by around 70,000 students between now and 2018 - by over 45,000 at primary level and 25,000 at post-primary.  Second level enrolment is expected to continue to rise until at least 2024.<\/p> <p>Recent birth rate data published by the CSO show that there were nearly 20,000 births registered in the first quarter of 2011, the highest number of births registered in a quarter since the series began in 1960.  It is vital that the schooling system be prepared to cope with these increasing numbers.  Therefore, the Government's priority is now to focus on major school projects to meet these demographic demands.  In order to meet the needs of our growing population of schoolgoing children, the Department must establish new schools in addition to extending or replacing a number of existing schools in areas where demographic growth has been identified.  The delivery of these new schools, together with extension projects to meet future demand, will be the main focus for the Department's capital budget for the coming years.  In March 2012, the Minister, Deputy Quinn, announced a five-year construction programme as part of a \u20ac2 billion capital investment programme, which outlined all the major school building projects at primary and post-primary levels which had been scheduled to commence construction over the timeframe.  The project announced will account for the bulk of the capital funding available each year from 2012 to 2016.  In that context, it was not possible to advance all applications for capital funding concurrently.<\/p><p>All other schools building projects within the architectural planning process, including the project for Clifden community school, will continue to be advanced incrementally in the context of the funding available.  However, in light of current competing demands on the Department's capital budget, it is not possible at this time to progress the project at Clifden community school to tender and construction stages.  I understand the Minister attended a meeting during his summer holiday period in Clifden with members of CSI Clifden and the board of management.  Officials of the planning and building unit in the Department held a meeting last July with a delegation from the patron body and the board of management in which the current position was fully explained to the delegation.

I wish to raise the issue of ground rents, a long-standing issue for many individuals and families in the State.  Ground rents are something of an oddity and an anomaly, but they do not comprise a benign anomaly.  They are, in effect, a hangover from a colonial past.  It is shameful that, almost 100 years since the proclamation of the Irish Republic, citizens are still paying rent to absentee landlords.  I refer not only to individual citizens as I understand the Office of Public Works pays ground rent of &#8364;14.44 per annum to the Duke of Leinster for the National Library of Ireland's premises.  While this may be seen as a small amount, it is preposterous that State and Government buildings are still subject to ground rents to absentee landlords.<\/p><p>  Ground rent landlords do not need to be compensated in the event of the abolition of ground rents.  As a legacy of colonialism, ground rents have been unjust from the beginning.  Therefore, compensation would legitimise what is manifestly unjust.  Those who are bearing the real brunt of this ongoing ground rents fiasco are those private homeowners who find that their ground rent leases are about to expire and who face having to choose between buying out their ground rent lease, paying one eighth of the value of their home to the ground rent landlord or renewing the lease for a far higher rate than they had previously been paying.  People are faced with demands for huge sums from the ground rent landlords and this is causing severe hardship for many.<\/p><p>  I was motivated to raise this issue because I was contacted by the chairperson of the Lismore Park residents' association in Waterford, an association that covers hundreds of houses in Lismore Park, Lismore Heights and Lismore Lawn in Waterford city.  Many people find that their leases are up for renewal and they face bills.  The alternative for those who cannot afford to buy out the expired lease is to sign a renewal of the lease for 35 years.  Many of those who find themselves in this invidious position are elderly and have no income other than their pensions.  The rents are an unjust feudal imposition and are uncommon and unacceptable in many other countries.  Ground rents primarily affect elderly people whose leases often expire when they reach a senior age.  Ground rent landlords and their legal professionals capitalise actively on the frailty of the elderly.<\/p><p>  I will not get into the detail of the Shirley case, of which I am sure the Minister of State is aware.  Based on this case, the T\u00e1naiste and the Taoiseach once made very clear commitments that, if they ever were in government, they would legislate on this issue.  When in opposition, the Taoiseach, when supporting a Fianna F\u00e1il-led Bill following the Shirley case, stated his party shared the then Government's view on the important issue and looked forward to being in a position to act following the general election.  He was speaking about abolishing ground rents.<\/p><p>  In March 2007 when in opposition, Deputy Gilmore, now T\u00e1naiste, said:<ul>As you know, the Labour Party wishes to abolish ground rents.  As you know we brought forward a Private Members&#8217; Bill some time ago to this effect.  If in government, we intend to introduce legislation along those lines.<\/ul>Where is this legislation?  Is what I propose legislatively possible?  I believe so and the Taoiseach and the T\u00e1naiste believed so when in opposition.  We owe it to the citizens who live in Lismore Park, Lismore Lawn and Lismore Heights in Waterford and to many others across the State in the same circumstances.  It is unacceptable that this has not been fully resolved.  It is a hangover from our colonial past and we should deal with it.  We have a responsibility regarding the affected citizens.  I look forward to the Minister of State's response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012092500047#WW00500","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speech","time":1348599000,"counter":278,"content":"<p>I am standing in for my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, who is unavailable.  I thank the Senator for raising this matter on the Adjournment.  The Minister has asked me to inform the House that he is not in a position to comment on the particular situation in the Lismore Park area of Waterford but welcomes this opportunity to outline the current situation with regard to ground rents.<\/p><p>The rights of tenants occupying residential property under long leases have been under discussion since the latter half of the 19th century.  In such situations, the tenant normally pays a ground rent to the landlord.  The problem that arises is the tenant's rights on expiry of such a lease.  Under common law, the land and buildings reverted to the ground landlord leaving tenants with no right to compensation for losing the houses they, or their predecessors, had bought and no guarantee of any renewal or extension of their leases.  In the event of renewal or extension, there was no guarantee that the terms were fair or reasonable.<\/p><p>A number of changes in the law during the 20th century greatly improved the situation for tenants.  Under the Landlord and Tenant Act 1931, as amended by the Landlord and Tenant Act 1943, tenants with a &quot;long family equity&quot; became entitled to new tenancies on expiry of the original lease, or up to seven years before expiry, at rents fixed by the Circuit Court, in default of agreement.  The Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act 1967 gave tenants the right to acquire the freehold - that is, to acquire the fee simple - of the property.  The ground landlord has no option in the matter.  The Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act 1978 prohibited the creation of new ground rents in respect of dwellings, and leases after that date are only valid if they operate as a renewal of an existing lease.  The Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No.2) Act 1978 simplified procedures and gave the Land Registry, now the Property Registration Authority, responsibility for operating a special scheme for dwelling houses.  This scheme greatly reduces the costs involved for tenants and, to date, over 80,000 ground rents have been bought out under this scheme.  Of course, other ground rents may have been dealt with without recourse to the scheme.<\/p><p>In summary, the Landlord and Tenant Acts from 1967 to 2005 have improved conditions for ground rent tenants and contain provisions which permit certain tenants to acquire the fee simple, thereby ending their liability for the payment of ground rent to the ground rent landlord.  The Acts provide a general right to such tenants to acquire the fee simple and for mechanisms for determining the purchase price in order to compensate the landlord.  One further aspect of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act 1978 worth noting is that section 27 provides that a landlord cannot re-enter or take possession of a premises where the tenant is in arrears with a ground rent.  While prohibiting the creation of new ground rents on dwellings, the 1978 Act did not abolish existing ground rents and this has given rise to periodic demands for their abolition.<\/p><p>The position on the possible abolition of ground rents is that legal advice obtained from the Attorney General's office in recent years has drawn attention to possible constitutional difficulties with proposals to abolish remaining ground rents.<\/p> <p>These relate mainly to the possible infringement of property rights.  First, difficulties in respect of the rights of tenants could arise by forcing such a tenant to acquire the fee simple, that is, the act of transforming a current right into an obligation.  Such a tenant may have no wish to purchase the ground rent, or not immediately at any rate.  The current scheme is open ended.  On the other hand, a tenant might not be able to afford the purchase price despite the reasonable way in which it is calculated.  Second, removing for compensation purposes the distinction between leases with more than 15 years to run and those that have either expired or have less than 15 years to run could be seen as infringing upon the property rights of ground landlords.  Third, securing payment of the ground rent purchase price as a charge on the property, for example, in order that the tenant does not need to pay cash up front for the buy-out of the ground rent, could also create problems, in that there could be an accumulation of interest charges until the dwelling changed hands.  Payment of the accumulated debt might then require that the property be sold.<\/p><p>The Minister, Deputy Shatter, would add that the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution, which published its ninth progress report, dealing with private property, in April 2004, also noted that a ground landlord's ground rent represented a right to an income that, in principle, was constitutionally protected and that any legislation to abolish ground rents must include a scheme of adequate compensation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012092500047#WW00600","speaker":"1042","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348599600,"counter":280,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response.

The most obvious and achievable step is to pass legislation in order that the one eighth of the land's value that is due on the expiry of a lease can be reviewed downwards as well as upwards and lowered to a number close to zero so as to negate the value.  After a year or so, ground rents would become well established as not being meaningful sources of income.  The rents having no effective value, the Oireachtas could pass legislation to eradicate ground rents altogether by making them illegal.<\/p><p>A number of propositions could be put to the Attorney General to determine whether they were possible instead of simply tabling a blanket question on abolishing ground rents.  All parties have grappled with this issue.  In opposition, the Taoiseach and the T\u00e1naiste clearly supported the concept of abolishing ground rents.  Will the issue be re-examined?

My colleagues on the town council, Councillors Sean Drew, Bryan Reilly and Frankie Lynch, tabled a motion calling on the Minister to establish a primary health care centre in Kells.  The motion was passed and forwarded to the Minister.

I welcome the opportunity to outline the current position on Kells primary health care centre.  As the Senator is aware, the programme for Government sets out the Government's commitment to ensuring a better and more efficient health system and a single tier health service that will deliver equal access to health care based on need, not income.  In a developed primary care system, up to 95% of people's day-to-day health and social care needs can be met in the primary care setting.  The key objective of the primary care strategy is to develop services in the community that will give people direct access to integrated multidisciplinary teams of general practitioners, GPs, nurses, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and other health care disciplines.  This is central to the Government's objective of delivering a high quality, integrated and cost-effective health system.<\/p><p>A modern, well equipped primary care infrastructure is central to the effective functioning of primary care teams.  These teams enable multidisciplinary services to be delivered on a single site, provide a single point of access for users and encourage closer co-ordination between health providers.  The infrastructure development, through a combination of public and private investment, will facilitate the delivery of multidisciplinary primary health care and represents a tangible refocusing of the health service to deliver care in the most appropriate and lowest cost setting.<\/p><p>The intention to date has been that, where appropriate, infrastructure for primary care centres would be provided by the private sector through negotiated lease agreements.  The Exchequer will also fund the delivery of some primary care centres, particularly in deprived urban areas, small rural towns and isolated areas.  In addition, a list of 35 potential locations for development by way of PPP as part of the Government's infrastructure stimulus package was published in July.<\/p><p>The provision of a centre in Kells has been progressed to date by way of a private sector operational lease process.  Submissions were assessed by the HSE.  A preferred provider was identified that satisfied the HSE key criteria and offered acceptable accommodation, in development, at a suitable location on the Dublin road in the town.  An agreement for lease was reached with the preferred provider in 2010 and planning permission was received for the approximately 30,000 sq. ft. development.  However the preferred provider has not been able to deliver the new primary care accommodation, due mainly to funding difficulties.<\/p><p>The HSE continues to engage with the preferred provider in the hope that the facility might be delivered within the timeframes of the agreement.  While it continues to consider the possibility of delivering the centre by the private sector operational lease process, it is also considering alternative mechanisms and opportunities, including the PPP process.  Kells is included in the locations being considered by the HSE for the Government's infrastructure stimulus package.  Accordingly, the HSE is engaging with GPs in the area to assess GP interest and determine how best to deliver primary care accommodation in Kells.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012092500048#XX00600","speaker":"1042"},{"type":"speech","time":1348599600,"counter":285,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.
