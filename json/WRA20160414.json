In contrast, the State pension (non-contributory) is a means tested social assistance payment for people age 66 or over. It is a scheme to help older people with an income need who do not have sufficient PRSI contributions for the State pension (contributory), nor significant income from another source such as a private pension.  Neither of these State Pensions are payable below the age of 66, regardless of the person&rsquo;s savings and\/or private pension provision, and so non-qualification as a result of saving into a private pension scheme does not arise. Pensionable age for these schemes has been 66 years since 1977.<\/p>  <p>  The Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2011 provided that State pension age will be increased gradually to 68 years. This began in January 2014 with the abolition of the State pension (transition) available from 65 for those who satisfied the qualifying conditions, thereby standardising State pension age for all at 66 years, which is the current State pension age. This will increase to 67 in 2021 and 68 in 2028. The changes introduced in 2011 were on foot of a Government commitment included in the National Recovery Plan published in 2010. <\/p>  <p>  The purpose of these changes is to make the pension system sustainable in the context of increasing life expectancy. More people are living to pension age and living longer in retirement. In this context, the duration for which an average pension will be paid will continue to increase. The number of pensions is increasing by approximately 17,000 annually as a result of demographic change. This has significant implications for the future costs of State pension provision. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy should note that there is no general retirement age in the State, and the age at which employees retire is a matter for the contract of employment between them and their employers. <\/p>  <p>  In terms of financial supports, social welfare benefits will continue to be available to the age of 66 for those who are required to leave employment. Jobseekers whose benefit expires in their 65th year will continue to be paid benefit up until the age of 66. Where a jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit claim spans two benefit years, a new Governing Contribution Year requirement is not applied to the second benefit year of a claimant aged 65 (effectively this means that they may receive payment in both years based upon eligibility in the first year). <\/p>  <p>  Organisations participating in the JobBridge National Internship Scheme must comply with the scheme criteria.  One such criterion is that they must have no vacancies in the area of activity in which the Internship is offered.  It is not possible, therefore, for a company to hire such an intern to fill the gap when a person retires.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016041400044#WRA01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1253"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rent Supplement Scheme Data","counter":20,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016041400044#WRA01900"},{"type":"question","counter":21,"qnumday":7,"qnumall":"[6301\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016041400044#WRA02000","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the amount she spent on rent supplement in 2015; the number of households she assisted; the average monthly rent supplement she paid per household in County Dublin and outside County Dublin; and the number of households on rent supplement in January and December 2015.","asker":"1308","askee":"1253"},{"type":"question","counter":22,"qnumday":46,"qnumall":"[6904\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016041400044#WRA02100","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"to immediately raise rent supplement limits in line with market rent; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1253"},{"type":"question","counter":23,"qnumday":65,"qnumall":"[7204\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016041400044#WRA02200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the number of households to date that have had their rent supplement increased above the agreed thresholds by county in tabular form; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1227","askee":"1253"},{"type":"speech","counter":24,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 46 and 65 together.<\/p><p>Rent supplement plays a vital role in housing families and individuals, with the scheme supporting approximately 57,600 people for which the Government has provided approximately &euro;267 million for 2016 (with provisional outturn of over &euro;311 million in 2015). There were over 20,100 rent supplement tenancies awarded during 2015 and over 3,000 awarded during the first three months of 2016 showing that landlords are accommodating significant numbers of people under the scheme.<\/p><p>A county breakdown of rent supplement recipients for January and December 2015 and the end of March 2016 is provided in the attached tabular statement. There are currently approximately 22,800 tenancies in Dublin and 34,800 tenancies outside of Dublin. The average monthly cost for a tenancy supported in Dublin is &euro;560 per month, for tenancies outside Dublin the average monthly cost is &euro;310 per month.<\/p><p>In terms of rent limits, the Department undertook a review of these limits in 2015 and found that the impact of increasing limits at a time of constrained supply in the private rented market will increase costs disproportionately for the Exchequer with little or no new housing available to recipients. The Department has instead implemented a national targeted policy approach that allows for flexibility where landlords seek rents in excess of the limits for both existing customers and new applicants to the rent supplement scheme. The circumstances of tenants are considered on a case-by-case basis and rents are being increased above prescribed limits, as appropriate. In addition, the Department, in conjunction with Threshold, operates a special protocol in the Dublin and Cork areas where supply issues are particularly acute, with plans underway to extend this to other urban and commuter areas. <\/p><p>This flexible and targeted approach has assisted over 7,450 rent supplement households nationwide to retain or acquire rented accommodation through increased rent payments. A county breakdown of these cases is provided in the tabular statement.<\/p><p>I believe this targeted approach and the recent legislative reforms announced to the private rental sector provide a level of stability for those who require rent supplement support in what has become a highly volatile rental market.<\/p><p><b>Rent Supplement Recipients by

Under the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP), responsibility for the provision of rental assistance to those with a long-term housing need transfers to the local authorities.  Rent supplement will continue to play a vital role in housing families and individuals to those with a short term need, generally because of a temporary loss of employment.<\/p>  <p>  The implementation of HAP is a key Government priority and a major pillar of the Social Housing Strategy 2020.  HAP will contribute to providing a more integrated and streamlined system of social housing supports and has been designed to allow households that find full-time employment to remain in the scheme which is consistent with the Government&rsquo;s commitments under the Pathways to Work programme.  The Department is fully engaged in the roll-out of HAP and officials work closely with colleagues in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and local authorities to ensure the successful implementation of the scheme. <\/p>  <p>  Social Welfare legislation provides that persons in receipt of long term rent supplement can be requested to apply to the local authority for social housing support for their household and for a social housing assessment. This ensures that the relevant local authorities are made aware of the long-term housing needs of rent supplement tenants living within their administrative area and reflects both the responsibility of local authorities in providing long term housing supports and the temporary income support nature of rent supplement. Payment of rent supplement can be suspended where persons do not comply with the request to apply for social housing support or who do not take up an offer of HAP as a form of social housing support.  <\/p>  <p>  HAP is currently operational in 19 of the 31 local authority areas and there are almost 8,300 households in receipt of HAP. Some 2,990 (36%) of the HAP cases have been transferred from rent supplement and 5,300 (64%) are new cases. There is an overall target to achieve 10,000 HAP cases in 2016, which includes new cases and transfers from rent supplement. The numbers of those expected to transfer from rent supplement on a county basis is not available. The management of the transfer of rent supplement cases to HAP is undertaken through close engagement between Department officials and the relevant local authority. As the scheme rolls out it is envisaged that the proportion of HAP households that transfer from rent supplement will increase.   <\/p>  <p>  Households benefitting from HAP can avail of a move to other forms of social housing support, should they wish to do so, through the transfer option. Policy in relation to housing allocations is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016041400045#WRB02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1033"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Applications","counter":87,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016041400045#WRB02400"},{"type":"question","counter":88,"qnumday":28,"qnumall":"[6603\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016041400045#WRB02500","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"when she will issue a decision to a person (details supplied) in County Clare under the carer's allowance scheme; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1272","askee":"1253"},{"type":"speech","counter":89,"content":"<p>I confirm that the department received an application for carer&rsquo;s allowance (CA) from the person in question on 28 October 2015.

Mindful of the current and ongoing discussions on Government formation any further development of policy will be a matter for the incoming Government.<\/p>  <p>  The current position is that the department has a cohort of jobseeker customers who are classified as casual jobseekers. These are in-work customers who can claim a jobseekers payment for 2 to 3 days per week or who work week on\/week-off.  These customers are paid by cheque each week. Not all customers will be paid every week due to their changeable work patterns.<\/p>  <p>  I want to emphasise that these customers have been paid by cheque due to the changing nature of their work\/claiming patterns and the short turn-around time to issue payments.  It is important to note that they are not paid via post offices under the department&rsquo;s existing cash payments contract with An Post.  <\/p>  <p>  In line with the National Payments Plan, my department is seeking to reduce its usage of cheques as a payment method; this is not only a matter of decreasing the significant costs associated with cheques in the department and wider economy but also of moving to a more secure method of payment and enhancing customer convenience.<\/p>  <p>  When paid by cheque, customers have the option of lodging them direct to their accounts or negotiating them at banks or the Post Office.  The evidence available to the department is that the vast majority of the department&rsquo;s customers paid by cheque choose to lodge them direct to their accounts. <\/p>  <p>  The department has developed its payment capacity in respect of changing work and claiming patterns and is able to offer payments direct to accounts in financial institutions for casual Jobseeker customers thereby increasing customer convenience.  This is in line with wider departmental policy where the focus is on ensuring that in-work customers are paid by the most convenient method possible.<\/p>  <p>  Consequently the department has written to its casual Jobseeker customers asking them to provide their account details to enable direct payments to financial institutions.<\/p>  <p>  I want to emphasise that the department does not issue these cheque payments to Post Offices. This process does not reduce the number of existing cash payments through Post Offices under the current contract between the department and An Post. <\/p>  <p>  I want to reiterate that what the department is doing is moving customers from cheque payments to the much more secure, customer convenient and cost effective payment method of payment directly into accounts in financial institutions.  This is entirely consistent with the National Payments Plan and in line with payment methods that now prevail across the economy.  The department must consider the most efficient payment method for our customers who are in employment most of whom get their salary payment into bank accounts.  To have weekly income (work + welfare) payable in two different ways is a highly inappropriate and costly way of dealing with people in employment. The department&rsquo;s focus must be on our customers.<\/p>  <p>  Customer choice will be maintained.

I am informed by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that the specific compulsory retirement age and minimum pension age provisions which affect individual public servants will reflect their particular employment sector and time of original recruitment.  <\/p>  <p>  The Social Welfare and Pensions Act, 2011 provides that State pension age will be increased gradually to 68 years. This began in January 2014 with the standardising of State pension age for all at 66 years and the cessation of State pension transition.

Specifically, in relation to jobseekers benefit and jobseekers allowance, there are a number of transitioning provisions applying in the case of people who are aged between 65 and 66. Social welfare benefits will continue to be available to the age of 66 for those who are required to leave employment. Jobseekers whose benefit expires in their 65th year will continue to be paid benefit up until the age of 66.

In County Kildare the numbers relying on support under rent supplement will further reduce with the introduction of the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP). <\/p>  <p>  The staffing needs for all areas within the Department are continuously reviewed, to ensure that the best use is made of all available resources with a view to providing an efficient service to those who rely on the schemes operated by the Department. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016041400046#WRC04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1033"},{"type":"question","counter":174,"qnumday":57,"qnumall":"[7066\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016041400046#WRC04300","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will implement a Homeless Persons Support Unit in Counties Kildare, Meath and Wicklow to cope with the increasing number of homeless persons presenting; how the service will accommodate the interim support needs of this cohort; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1253"},{"type":"speech","counter":175,"content":"<p>The Department of Social Protection, through the Community Welfare Service (CWS) provides assistance with income maintenance to homeless persons.  The first point of contact for homeless clients to access this service is their local community welfare service. <\/p><p>Rent supplement plays a vital role in housing families and individuals, with the scheme supporting approximately 57,600 people for which the Government has provided approximately &euro;267 million for 2016. <\/p><p>The Department introduced a Divisional Framework on preventing Tenancy Loss for Rent Supplement Recipients in January 2015 to provide for a targeted approach that allows for flexibility where landlords seek rents in excess of the limits for both existing customers and new applicants to the rent supplement scheme. Each household&rsquo;s circumstances are considered on a case-by-case basis and Rent Supplement is paid to them at rates above the prescribed maximum rent limits where homelessness or the threat of homelessness is a factor.  This targeted approach has assisted over 7,450 households nationwide to retain their rented accommodation through increased rent payments, with approximately 790 households assisted in Kildare, Meath and Wicklow.  A detailed breakdown for the relevant Counties is provided. <\/p><p>The Rent Supplement Unit for Mid-Leinster administers this framework for Counties Kildare, Wicklow and Carlow.  It has a number of Designated Officers who deal with the issue of threatened homelessness and they liaise with homeless agencies and homeless representatives to provide immediate support by way of the Rent Supplement scheme to prevent homelessness. <\/p><p>The Department&rsquo;s strategic policy direction is to return rent supplement to its original purpose of being a short-term income support scheme.  In July 2013, the Government approved the introduction of the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP).  Under HAP, the responsibility for the provision of rent support to those with long-term housing needs transferred from the Department of Social Protection (DSP) to Local Authorities.  This applies both to existing and new customers of the Rent Supplement scheme, who have already been assessed by their Local Authority as having a housing need.  There are now over 8,300 persons in receipt of HAP of which over 280 are in the Kildare and Meath areas. Both Kildare and Meath Local Authorities introduced HAP as part of their suite of supports available on 2 November 2015.<\/p><p>Support is also available to assist persons under the Exceptional Needs Payments (ENPs) scheme towards rent deposits or rent in advance for both rent supplement and HAP recipients.

In line with this, NAMA is working with debtors and receivers to identify, where commercially feasible, opportunities to bring forward new residential development on this land.\u00a0 In this respect, NAMA has indicated that it expects to be in a position to fund up to 20,000 new residential units in Ireland by 2020, subject to commercial feasibility.\u00a0 This equates to approximately one-fifth of expected demand for housing over that period, which means that NAMA can make a very substantial contribution and that other sources of new output are also needed. <\/p><p>Reflecting both demand and economic viability, over 90% of the units which NAMA expects to fund will be in Dublin and the neighbouring counties of Wicklow, Kildare and Meath.\u00a0 NAMA's funding is focused in particular on the starter home market.<\/p><p>NAMA is already making significant progress in this respect:<\/p><p>-  Since 2014, it has funded the construction of 2,700 new residential units in Ireland on residential development land within its portfolio (of which, 2,400 are in the Dublin area).\u00a0 <\/p><p>-  In addition, on development land identified in Table 1 below, a further 3,300 are under construction (of which 2,700 are in the Dublin area); <\/p><p>-  Planning permission has been granted for an additional 4,800 units (of which 4,200 are in the Dublin area);  <\/p><p>-  Planning applications have been lodged for 4,300 units (of which 3,500 are in the Dublin area);<\/p><p>-  New applications will be lodged within the next 12 months for 7,237 units (of which 5,800 are in the Dublin area).<\/p><p>In some areas within Dublin and the wider Dublin area development remains unviable for commercial, planning and infrastructural reasons, with the latter being a major issue in certain areas in which development might otherwise be economically viable. <\/p><p>Outside the Dublin area, there are very substantial commercial, planning and infrastructural barriers to new development.\u00a0 Much of the development land within NAMA's portfolio outside the major urban areas is, therefore, unlikely to be viable within the next five years without substantial progress by public authorities in terms of putting in place the necessary planning frameworks and addressing public infrastructure deficits, for example, roads, water, sewerage, transport and schools.\u00a0 <\/p><p>Where such infrastructure investment takes place it should be targeted at those areas in which development is likely to become commercially viable over\u00a0the medium-term\u00a0partly as a result of this investment.\u00a0 Targeting infrastructure investment with consideration to the commercial viability\u00a0of development is extremely important due to the fact that\u00a0in many parts of the country,\u00a0residential development will not become commercially viable over the\u00a0medium-term\u00a0even if planning and infrastructural constraints are addressed due to a lack of demand

Ireland, in line with most countries, retains the right to tax profits arising from land and buildings in the State, regardless of where the owner is located.\u00a0 In contrast, taxing rights for dividends are usually divided between countries, based on tax treaty agreements. In general, Ireland allows for dividends of Irish companies to be paid to shareholders resident in treaty partner countries without any liability to Irish tax.\u00a0 This is because tax should already have been paid on the company's profits in Ireland   the dividends are paid out of the after-tax profits of the company   and the dividends received will form part of the shareholder's income for tax purposes in their country of residence. <\/p>  <p>  In the absence of any other provisions, foreign REIT shareholders would not have had any liability to Irish tax on REIT dividends, despite the fact that the REIT itself benefits from a tax exemption on qualifying profits of the rental business.\u00a0 In order to ensure that tax from foreign investors is retained, a Dividend Withholding Tax\u00a0(DWT) at the standard rate of tax was legislated for to specifically apply to REIT dividends.\u00a0 Foreign investors from treaty resident countries may be able to reclaim some part of this DWT if the relevant tax treaty allows for this.\u00a0 The taxation of dividends varies from treaty to treaty, but commonly a source state would retain the right to approximately 15% tax on dividends paid from that state. <\/p>  <p>  REITs are publicly listed companies, meaning their Financial Statements are publicly available, but the specific figures required to calculate their rental profit (the portion of profit that is exempt) is not necessarily available in these public documents. I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that for reasons of taxpayer confidentiality, it is not possible to comment on specific details of rental profit, if any, of the limited number of REITs currently operating in Ireland. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016041400047#WRD03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Relief Costs","counter":233,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016041400047#WRD03700"},{"type":"question","counter":234,"qnumday":78,"qnumall":"[6308\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016041400047#WRD03800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the annual cost of tax relief and exemptions availed of by private landlords, including mortgage interest relief, for each of the years 2011 to 2015.","asker":"1308","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":235,"content":"<p>It is assumed that the reference to private landlords in the Deputy's question refers to those letting private residential property.

This represents the entirety of vacant residential property within NAMA's portfolio that was available and potentially suitable for social housing. There is extensive detail on this initiative on NAMA's website,\u00a0and on the Housing Agency's website, www.housing.ie\/NAMA.aspx \u00a0<\/p><p>Under this initiative, NAMA identified potentially suitable properties to\u00a0the Housing Agency, who engaged with Local Authorities and Approved Housing Bodies in order to establish the areas of demand, number, and allocation of properties.\u00a0 NAMA does not have a role in\u00a0determining which properties are required by the Housing Agency, Local Authorities, and\u00a0Approved Housing Bodies, nor\u00a0the number\u00a0or allocation of properties accepted.\u00a0 The onus for determining the suitability of these properties for social housing purposes rests with the Local Authorities, the Housing Agency and the Approved Housing Bodies.\u00a0Where demand is confirmed for a property, NAMA makes whatever funding is needed,  more than &euro;84m to date, to ensure that\u00a0previously unfinished properties are completed and comply fully with all building standards.\u00a0<\/p><p>Following NAMA's identification process, I am advised that Local Authorities confirmed demand for\u00a02,531 of the 6,635\u00a0offered\u00a0units, of which 2,042 have been transferred for social housing at an overall cost to NAMA in excess of &euro;250m.\u00a0 These 2,042 units represent more than one-third of the 5,700 social housing units made available from all market participants under Part V legislation between 2002 and 2011, when over 550,000 new private housing units were built in the State.<\/p><p>Local Authorities may have a number of reasons for declining\u00a0identified properties, such as location\u00a0or wider planning and housing policy considerations.\u00a0\u00a0A further\u00a0consideration for Local Authorities, when assessing the suitability of identified houses and apartments, is the requirement to provide for an appropriate mix of housing tenures and to avoid undue housing segregation within individual developments and wider residential areas.<\/p><p>The 4,104 residential properties not taken up for social housing have been either sold or rented in the private housing market by NAMA debtors and receivers and, in that way, continue to form part of the market supply of housing.\u00a0 There were also cases where the related properties were sold or rented by their owners or appointed receivers in the time taken by Local Authorities to assess and confirm demand.\u00a0 <\/p><p>I am advised that there has been extensive engagement between NAMA and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and all the other stakeholders, including the Housing Agency, Local Authorities and Approved Housing Bodies, on this initiative and all parties have worked extremely hard to ensure that properties for which demand has been confirmed are delivered as quickly as possible, notwithstanding the substantial construction and wider compliance work that is required in many cases.\u00a0 Furthermore, NAMA will continue to work with all relevant stakeholders to ensure that the residual units, for which demand has been confirmed by Local Authorities, are delivered in line with local authorities and approved housing bodies entering into contracts to buy or rent the units.<\/p><p>To streamline delivery under this initiative, NAMA established a Special Purpose Company, National Asset Residential Property Services Limited or &quot;NARPS&quot;, to purchases suitable properties from NAMA debtors from within the existing NAMA portfolio for onward leasing to local authorities or approved housing bodies on the basis of long-term, commercial, arrangements which include an option to buy. I am advised that NAMA has spent &euro;160m acquiring properties to rent by NARPS to approved housing bodies. NAMA has developed standardised long-term leasing arrangements and attractive lease terms to facilitate this process. NAMA's contribution towards social housing via NARPS is consistent with its commercial remit and is not gifted, or subsidised, in any way. <\/p><p>The issue of social housing is, as the Deputy is aware, directly impacted by the level of housing output generally in the economy. In this regard, I welcome that the NAMA Board has recently announced, following a detailed review of sites securing its loans, that it could be in a position to fund up to 20,000 additional new homes, on a commercial basis, by end-2020. I am advised that approximately 90% of these residential units would be in Dublin and the greater Dublin area, where demand is greatest. NAMA-funded residential developments are subject to the same planning and social housing provisions, including Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended), as all other residential development projects in the State. Therefore, the corresponding Part V contribution of 10% social housing units, over the life of the funding programme, will make a significant contribution to future delivery of social housing.<\/p><p>NAMA has indicated that NARPS could be used in certain cases to facilitate the delivery of future Part V housing on new developments funded by NAMA in circumstances where this is the preferred option of the planning authorities. This would mean that NAMA would bear the up-front capital cost of delivering this Part V housing\u00a0and that such housing will be delivered on-site, in line with Government policy to ensure greater integration in housing. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016041400047#WRD05100","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":248,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016041400047#WRD05200"},{"type":"question","counter":249,"qnumday":83,"qnumall":"[6363\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016041400047#WRD05300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans to change the tax system for distressed debt and other financial assets so that speculation on distressed residential debt is penalised rather than rewarded; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1324","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":250,"content":"<p>The Irish tax code does not penalise speculation in distressed residential debt, nor does it reward such speculation: it is neutral as to the intention of the investor.<\/p>  <p>  What should give the Deputy comfort however, is that\u00a0the transfer of a\u00a0loan from one entity to another does not change the terms of the contract or the borrower's rights and obligations under the original contract.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2015 was enacted on 8 July 2015. \u00a0This\u00a0Act introduced a regulatory regime for a new type of entity called a 'credit servicing firm'. \u00a0Credit Servicing Firms are now subject to the provisions of Irish financial services law that apply to 'regulated financial service providers'.

The basis for the current taxation of married couples derives from the Supreme Court decision in Murphy v. the Attorney General (1980) which held that it was contrary to the Constitution for a married couple to pay more tax than two single people living together. <\/p>  <p>  In the case of cohabiting couples each partner is taxed as a single person and each is entitled to the tax credits and standard rate band appropriate to single persons. The same tax credits and standard rate bands are available to a married couple, with the difference being that one spouse's personal tax credit and a portion of his or her standard rate band may be transferred to the other spouse if they so choose. This can be of benefit where one spouse has low income or does not work outside the home, and therefore does not use their own credit and rate bands in full.<\/p>  <p>  From a practical perspective, it would be very difficult to administer a tax regime for cohabitants which would be the same as that for married couples or civil partners.\u00a0 Married couples and civil partners have a verifiable official confirmation of their status.\u00a0 It would be difficult, intrusive and time-consuming to confirm declarations by individuals that they were actually cohabiting.\u00a0 It would also be difficult to establish when cohabitation started or ceased.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  It should also be noted that while there may be an advantage in tax legislation for a married couple or civil partners, their legal status has wider consequences from a tax perspective, both for themselves and for persons connected with them.<\/p>  <p>  To counter tax avoidance, transactions between 'connected persons' are frequently subject to anti-avoidance provisions throughout the various Tax Acts.\u00a0 The definitions of 'connected persons' extend to relatives and children of spouses and civil partners.\u00a0\u00a0 Were the tax treatment of married couples and\u00a0civil partners to be extended to cohabiting couples, it would be very difficult to prove and enforce such anti-avoidance measures in respect of persons connected with a cohabiting couple where the cohabiting couple has no legal recognition.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The treatment of cohabiting couples for the purposes of social welfare is primarily a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Social Protection, Ms Joan Burton T.D. However, it is also based on the principle that married couples should not be treated less favourably than cohabiting couples. This was given a constitutional underpinning following the Supreme Court decision in Hyland v Minister for Social Welfare (1989) which ruled that it was unconstitutional for the total income a married couple received in social welfare benefits to be less than the couple would have received if they were unmarried and cohabiting.<\/p>  <p>  To the extent that there are differences in the tax treatment of the different categories of couples, such differences arise from the objective of dealing with different types of circumstances while at the same time respecting the constitutional requirements to protect the institution of marriage. Any change in the tax treatment of cohabiting couples can only be addressed in the broader context of future social and legal policy development in relation to such couples.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016041400048#WRE01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Renovation Incentive Scheme Administration","counter":301,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016041400048#WRE01450"},{"type":"question","counter":302,"qnumday":108,"qnumall":"[6575\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016041400048#WRE01500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"how he can assist persons who are unable to avail of the home renovation incentive scheme due to builders not signing off on the documentation needed for the Revenue Commissioners to allow persons to claim tax relief on improvement works carried out on their homes.","asker":"1229","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":303,"content":"<p>The Home Renovation Incentive (HRI) came into operation on 25 October 2013 and will run until 31 December 2016.\u00a0The incentive provides tax relief for homeowners\u00a0by way of a tax credit at 13.5% of qualifying expenditure incurred on repair, renovation or improvement work carried out on a principal private residence, or by landlords on a rental property.\u00a0Qualifying expenditure is that which is subject to the 13.5% VAT rate. \u00a0The work must cost a minimum of &euro;4,405 (exclusive of VAT) at which level it would attract a credit of &euro;595.\u00a0 Where the cost of the work exceeds &euro;30,000 (exclusive of VAT) a maximum credit of &euro;4,050 will apply.\u00a0The credit is payable over the two years following the year in which the work is carried out.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Homeowners must be Local Property Tax compliant on all properties they own in order to qualify under the Incentive, while building contractors must be tax compliant in order to carry out works.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Contractors are required to inform Revenue in advance of details of works to be carried out and are also\u00a0required to notify Revenue in relation to any payments received in respect of the works.

His central recommendation is for a revised system whereby a minimum level of LPT revenues in each local authority area would be determined by Government, ideally having regard to the apportionment between local authority areas of the historic yield. This in turn would allow for the estimation of LPT rates for each local authority area and the application of these by taxpayers and Revenue.

A number of sectoral led policy initiatives were then developed and delivered including the Flood Forecasting and Warning Service, development of Planning Guidelines, establishment of Memorandum of Understanding with the Insurance Sector and also protocol and guidance documents for flood emergencies.  The Interdepartmental Group also gave strategic direction to the national CFRAM programme.

Ireland established a Steering Group comprising relevant stakeholders under Dr. Noel Cawley to coordinate the extensive consultations that then took place over the following years.  The Commission&rsquo;s formal Reform proposals were published in 2011 and there followed two more years of intense negotiations before agreement was finally reached under the Irish Presidency in June 2013.  Throughout the entire process the Irish fishing industry were kept fully apprised on all developments and their views were reflected in Irelands negotiating position throughout.  As with all compromises, especially one involving 28 Member States and 751 MEP&rsquo;s, the final result did not please everybody and while the new CFP does certainly provide challenges for the fishing sector it also, in my view, provides opportunities.<\/p><p>The new CFP has moved away from the old system of EU wide development and application of the rules (a one size fits all approach).  This is a significant change as, previously, fisheries decision making was completely centred in Brussels and any measure required the support of a majority of the Member States, even those with no fisheries interestsin the area concerned.  The new policy provides for decision making by the Member States concerned only, with mandatory consultation with the fishing sector and other stakeholders through the Advisory Councils to devise and implement measures that work for the types of fisheries in the region.<\/p><p>A key element of the new CFP that is both a challenge and an opportunity is the setting of fishing levels on the basis of MSY (Maximum Sustainable Yield).  The opportunity is that this measure should ultimately lead to healthy fish stocks, higher quotas for Irish fishermen and lead to more sustainable fishing patterns.  The challenge is that it has to be fully phased in for all stocks by 2020 and applied where possible immediately.\u00a0 This may lead to some short term pain but I am convinced that in the long term it is measures like this that will ensure that our coastal communities can look to the future with confidence that the stocks upon which they rely will still be abundant for a long time to come.<\/p><p>Another significant challenge facing our fishing industry is the introduction of a practical and phased discards policy or landing obligation.  This has now been in effect since the 1  January 2015 and will apply to all quota stocks by 2019.\u00a0 The phasing period was a key demand by Ireland during the negotiations and was designed to ensure that fishermen would have time to adjust and implement practical behavioural changes to avoid juvenile fish in particular.  Change on this scale is always difficult, but this is a change that was essential if we are serious about ensuring the long term future of a sustainable and profitable fishing industry in Ireland.<\/p><p>In order to help our fishing industry manage the real challenges and opportunities arising from the new CFP, I<i><\/i>also <i>secured an investment of <\/i>&euro;<i>240 million for <\/i>the development of the Irish seafood industry and the coastal communities that depend upon it<i>. <\/i>This is more than double the amount that was available to Ireland during the previous round of funding and will ensure a strong fishing industry in Ireland that can grow and expand to meet its potential.  It is, I believe, the level of the investment needed to meet the challenges and opportunities facing the Irish seafood industry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016041400054#WRL02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agriculture Scheme Penalties","counter":560,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016041400054#WRL02350"},{"type":"question","counter":561,"qnumday":195,"qnumall":"[6550\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016041400054#WRL02400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"why a person (details supplied) in County Cork has not received the promised reimbursement for a penalty levied in error for the period 2009 to 2014; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1285","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":562,"content":"<p>Following a further review of penalties applied in respect of ineligible features on land declared by the person named for the period 2009-2013, I can confirm that supplementary payments are due in respect of this period arising directly from this review.

Following on last year's attacks in Paris in particular, they have highlighted once again the threat faced by open and democratic states from international terrorism.<\/p>  <p>  The threat assessment is that while an international terror attack on Ireland is possible, it is not considered likely.  However, there is no complacency where this threat is concerned.  The level of threat is kept under constant review by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and all appropriate measures will continue to be taken by the authorities here, in cooperation with their international partners, in responding to any identified threats and in seeking to prevent attacks.  There is, unfortunately, a small number of people in Ireland whose activities are a cause for concern and the Garda Authorities will continue to monitor them and, where evidence is available of criminality, they will face the full rigours of the law.<\/p>  <p>  Developing and enhancing intelligence-sharing internationally is essential in countering terrorism and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has specialist units dedicated to this.  The Garda Authorities will continue to work very closely with their EU and other international counterparts, including Europol and Interpol, in the exchange of intelligence in identifying and responding to this threat.<\/p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has developed considerable operational capacities in countering terrorism and in responding to critical incidents.  In addition, the resources and skills of the Defence Forces are available in support where needed.  I am committed to ensuring that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the necessary resources to operate effectively in this environment.  In this regard, as part of the major programme of investment in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, there will be considerable investment in Garda information and communications technology, including connecting to the European Schengen Information System.<\/p>  <p>  Increasing the effectiveness of information and intelligence-sharing and enhancing border security have been priority themes at recent meetings of the EU Justice and Home Affairs Council and they will remain at the top of the agenda for the foreseeable future.  A series of measures is being rolled out to build on and improve current operational co-operation and to develop the EU's legal framework for information-sharing, combating terrorism and controlling illegal firearms.

The waiting time for cases set down for trial in Limerick is 9 months and in Cork is 17 months.

The Courts Act 2015, which was enacted on 20 December 2015, provides for an increase in the statutory number of ordinary judges of the High Court by two, from 35 to 37.

Two areas were identified where electronic monitoring might be of benefit: (i) monitoring the crucial transition post-release period where an offender leaves custody and is adjusting to living in the community to ensure positive habits are established and to identify potential risks; and (ii) monitoring high-risk offenders to verify compliance with a sex offender order.  Provisions that will allow electronic monitoring to be ordered by a court for a maximum period of six months, where the court considers it necessary that the offender's movements are monitored to protect the public from serious harm, have been approved by the Government and will be included in the Sex Offenders (Amendment) Bill which is currently being drafted.<\/p>  <p>  It is recognised that the targeted use of electronic monitoring has the potential to be effective as a means of enhancing compliance with bail conditions in appropriate cases.

The IHREC is specifically mandated in section 18 of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014 to establish Advisory Committees and other methods of consultation with relevant agencies and with NGOs and other civil society interests.  The Department of Justice and Equality also consults with the Disability Stakeholders Group.  The group comprises both disability service users and disability service providers, and was set up to participate in monitoring and oversight of the National Disability Inclusion Strategy.  In addition, the NDA can advise on effective ways to consult with people with disabilities and, if so requested, could also undertake consultation with people with disabilities to inform the reporting and monitoring process.<\/p>  <p>  Taken together, these mechanisms provide a good basis for civil society to fully participate in the monitoring process, and consultation on the precise form of such involvement will continue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016041400063#WRU01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Stardust Fire","counter":913,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016041400063#WRU01100"},{"type":"question","counter":914,"qnumday":318,"qnumall":"[6629\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016041400063#WRU01200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"to report on the status of the ongoing investigations by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na into the Stardust tragedy of 1981; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":915,"content":"<p>I am informed by the Commissioner of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that a file has been submitted and is presently with the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions in relation to further allegations pertaining to the Stardust disaster.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016041400063#WRU01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Prison Staff","counter":916,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016041400063#WRU01400"},{"type":"question","counter":917,"qnumday":319,"qnumall":"[6636\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016041400063#WRU01500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her plans to run a recruitment competition for the post of prison officer; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":918,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Director General of the Irish Prison Service that plans for a recruitment competition for the position of Recruit Prison Officer are currently under way, having regard to factors such as the level of retirements from the Irish Prison Service this year and in the coming years.

With this objective in mind, there have been seven intakes of Garda Trainees to the Garda College since it was reopened in September 2014 giving a total intake of 700 to date.  A further 450 will be taken in during the remainder of this year, bringing to 1,150 the number of new garda&iacute; who will have been recruited since the reopening of the Garda College in Templemore in September 2014.  So far, 395 of the new Garda Trainees have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream uniform duties in communities nationwide.  I have been informed that of these, 70 have been assigned to Garda Divisions in Munster and 15 to Connacht.  It is expected that a further 300 trainee Garda&iacute; will attest this year and it will be a matter for the Garda Commissioner to assign them as she considers appropriate.<\/p>  <p>  I have made it a particular priority to strengthen our legislative provisions through the enactment of the Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Act 2015 which is targeted at repeat burglars who have previous convictions and who are charged with multiple offences of residential burglary.  I am very pleased that this new legislation is now available to support the concerted drive against crime which is being carried out by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under Operation Thor.<\/p>  <p>  The Garda authorities have reported very positive operational feedback since the launch of Operation Thor on 2 November 2015 and this has been underscored by the most recent quarterly CSO Recorded Crime Statistics.  While these show an overall reduction in burglary of 5% for the 12-month period ending on 31 December 2015, there was a very significant reduction during the last quarter of the year with a recorded decrease of 26.2% compared to the same period in 2014.  The concentrated Garda activity under Operation Thor has resulted in more than 16,000 anti-crime patrols and in the order of 20,000 targeted checkpoints nationwide.  This has led to more than 1,000 burglary-related arrests, including the arrest of particular target suspects, and charges have been brought against numerous individuals.  In addition to burglary, arrests have also been made for handling stolen property, possession of firearms and drugs offences, including arrests connected to crimes committed by mobile criminal groups. <\/p>  <p>  Operation Thor delivers on increased investment in policing by this Government and marks a significant step-up in the Garda response to burglaries and related crime.  In excess of &euro;5 million is being specifically committed to support Operation Thor and includes funding for Garda overtime which will support a combination of additional patrols, checkpoints, rapid armed response and public awareness measures.  Furthermore, since 2012, an overall amount of &euro;34 million has been invested in the Garda fleet, with over 640 new vehicles coming on stream in 2015.  This significant investment provides the Garda&iacute; with additional high-powered vehicles, marked and unmarked patrol cars, and motorcycles for high-visibility road policing which will support important anti-crime strategies such as Operation Thor.  Investment in a modern, effective and fit-for-purpose Garda fleet will continue under the Government&rsquo;s Capital Plan 2016-2021 which provides &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles, ensuring garda&iacute; can be mobile, visible and responsive on the roads and in the community.  The Government is also investing in Garda airborne surveillance and enhanced technology and ICT systems.  In fact, the Capital Plan 2016-2021 provides an additional &euro;205 million for Garda ICT over the lifetime of the Plan.<\/p>  <p>  In conclusion, I assure the Deputy that I remain in close contact with the Garda Commissioner with a view to ensuring that we continue to build on the early successes of Operation Thor and that communities in rural and all other areas of the country benefit from the improved legislation and increased investments in policing which have been put in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016041400063#WRU04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Visa Applications","counter":944,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016041400063#WRU04200"},{"type":"question","counter":945,"qnumday":328,"qnumall":"[6867\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016041400063#WRU04300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the status of an application by a person (details supplied) in County Kerry for a spousal visa; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":946,"content":"<p>I am advised by officials in the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that the visa application referred to by the Deputy was received by the INIS Visa Office in New Delhi on 17 November 2015.

In the case of Youngballymun securing such an extension would afford the organisation additional time to (i) continue to build the evidence base supporting their work - a necessary requirement specific to this organisation; (ii) explore options regarding the mainstreaming of specific evidence-based programmes, and (iii) allow the organisation to inform the national evaluation of the ABC programme which is on-going.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has met with Youngballymun and is actively working with this organisation &ndash; and also the Childhood Development Initiative Tallaght and the Preparing for Life Programme Darndale &ndash; in exploring options regarding the provision of an extension to their respective organisations within the available resources under the ABC Programme.  In addition, my Department is also actively liaising with other relevant Departments to determine possibilities in relation to the mainstreaming of the proven elements of these respective programmes. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is acutely aware of the time constraints involved in this process and is seeking a resolution on this issue in collaboration with all 3 sites.  Officials in my Department have had on-going contact with Youngballymun on this issue.  I would like to emphasise that with regard to Youngballymun the issue is not one of restoration of funding.  This organisation is contracted under the ABC Programme to deliver services for the children of Ballymun up until 31st July 2016.  My Department is actively seeking to ensure that funding is secured and an extension offered to Youngballymun and the other 2 sites within available funding.  The intention is to bring these three sites into line with all other sites funded under the ABC programme.<\/p>  <p>  The Secretary General of the Department wrote to the Board of Youngballymun on Tuesday 12 April seeking a meeting with the Board to outline the Department's position and in an effort to advance a resolution on this issue.  I regret to say that the Chair of the Board declined this request.  I would urge the Board of Youngballymun to engage directly with officials within the Department of Children and Youth Affairs who are proactively working in securing an extension of service provision for Youngballymun and the other two sites.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is fully committed in seeking to ensure that the learning from the Youngballymun organisation and the other two sites, along with the learning emerging from the 10 newer sites funded under the ABC programme, can be brought forward to inform other services and supports for children in the area of prevention and early intervention.  Such an approach would offer a greater reach, in scope and depth, which will in turn enhance outcomes for children throughout the country.  As there is effective work being done on a range of themes across all 13 ABC sites a key focus over the next year will be to determine the high-impact programmes and provision across these areas so that a more strategic approach can be taken to mainstreaming such learning. Therefore, the provision of an extension to Youngballymun, the Childhood Development Initiative Tallaght and the Preparing for Life Programme Darndale, would afford the opportunity for a more comprehensive appraisal to be carried out in the round.<\/p>  <p>  I am hopeful that the Youngballymun organisation will continue to engage with my Department  to address their more immediate issues and inform the Department's wider plans in the area of prevention and early intervention. Improving outcomes for children is a key concern for us all, and one on which we need collective and constructive engagement and effort.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016041400066#WRX01100","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Lottery Funding Disbursement","counter":1047,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016041400066#WRX01150"},{"type":"question","counter":1048,"qnumday":363,"qnumall":"[7040\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016041400066#WRX01200","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 344 of 10 November 2015, when he will announce details of the scheme from additional Exchequer funding as indicated in his reply; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

NIAC is a committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland comprising of experts in a number of specialties including infectious diseases, paediatrics and public health.  The committee's recommendations are informed by public health advice and international best practice.<\/p><p>In Ireland, the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) is the regulatory authority for medicines in Ireland.  There are 2 licensed HPV vaccines available in Ireland (Gardasil and Cervarix).  Gardasil is the vaccine used by the HSE in the School Immunisation Programme and over 200,000 girls have received this vaccine since its introduction in 2010.<\/p><p>In addition to their desired effects, all medicines (including vaccines) have the potential to cause unwanted side effects (also known as adverse reactions).  These effects may be mild and transient, or more serious necessitating treatment to manage symptoms. In the case of vaccination, reporting of experience with use is particularly encouraged, reports may represent true adverse reactions or adverse events that are coincidental to vaccination and may be due to underlying illness\/conditions that would also have occurred in the absence of vaccination.  Patients\/carers should be advised to liaise with healthcare professionals involved in their care for clinical assessment and for any investigation, guidance and advice needed to manage\/treat symptoms or conditions they consider may be associated with vaccination.<\/p><p>The HPRA encourages patients (and carers), as well as healthcare professionals to report any suspected adverse reactions experienced to HPRA, so that any possible new risks may be identified and investigated, allowing for any appropriate regulatory action, such as product information updates reflecting the current knowledge of the vaccine and the risks known to occur in association with its use to be implemented and communicated, as necessary.<\/p><p>The HSE provides information for parents about diseases, the vaccines to prevent them and side effects to allow them to choose whether or not to give consent to vaccination. All vaccination information provided to parents is prepared from the available licensed documentation for each vaccine, the Summary of Products Characteristics and Patient Information Leaflet. The information is presented in clear simple language and approved by the National Adult Literacy Agency so that it can be understood by all adults as the average reading age in Ireland is 12 years of age. <\/p><p>Prior to all school immunisation parents receive an information pack in a sealed package which contains an information leaflet, consent form and cover letter. Information packs for all immunisation are standardised nationally. The information booklets include information on the most common adverse events that can occur after each vaccination. Parents are also given contact details for their local immunisation office and advised to speak to a member of the school immunisation team if they have any further questions. <\/p><p>Should parents require additional information about vaccines the immunisation leaflet refers to the HSE&rsquo;s national immunisation website (). The national immunisation website has been accredited by the World Health Organisation for credibility, content and good information practices. The website allows members of the public to contact the National Immunisation Office to ask a question if they require further information. These questions, when possible, are answered by the staff of the National Immunisation Office within one working day.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016041400068#WRZ01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Primary Care Centres Provision","counter":1137,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016041400068#WRZ02000"},{"type":"question","counter":1138,"qnumday":393,"qnumall":"[6442\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016041400068#WRZ02100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"to urgently grant capital investment to Freshford health centre via the Health Service Executive's south development office to ensure that the highest standard of practice and the safest level of primary care is provided for Freshford, County Kilkenny and its surrounding catchment area; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1368","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":1139,"content":"<p>The development of primary care is central to the Government's objective to deliver a high quality, integrated and cost effective health care system.

This includes many areas of the practice that have been innovative and population health needs focussed. The report also identified the reduced practice in health promotion activities because of the increases in work mentioned above.

This recommendation, along with the others, will be tested as part of a pilot throughout 2016.

The Act obliges the HSE to assess whether a person is unable, without undue hardship, to arrange general practitioner services for himself or herself and his or her family, having regard to his or her overall financial position and reasonable expenditure and every application must be assessed on that basis. Under the legislation, having a particular illness, in itself, does not establish eligibility for a medical card. Where the applicant's income is within the income guidelines, a medical card or GP visit card will be awarded.<\/p><p>Every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to support applicants in applying for a medical card and, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines. In certain circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds his or her income threshold, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness. Social and medical issues are considered when determining whether undue hardship exists for an individual accessing general practitioner or other medical services. The HSE affords applicants the opportunity to furnish supporting information and documentation to fully take account of all the relevant circumstances that may benefit them in the assessment, including medical evidence of cost and necessary expenses.<\/p><p>The HSE has a system in place for the provision of medical cards in response to an emergency situation for persons with a serious medical condition in need of urgent or on-going medical care that they cannot afford and persons in palliative care, who are terminally ill. With the exception of terminally ill patients all medical cards, granted on an emergency basis, are issued on the basis that the patient is eligible for a medical card on the basis of means or undue hardship, and will follow up with a full application within a number of weeks of receiving the medical card eligibility. These cards are issued within 24 hours of receipt of the required patient details and a letter which confirms the medical condition from a doctor or consultant. For terminally ill persons, no means test applies and the cards are not reviewed.<\/p><p>The Deputy may be aware of the &quot;Keane&quot; <i>Report of the Expert Panel on Medical Need for Medical Card Eligibility<\/i>with a key recommendation that a person&rsquo;s means should remain the main qualifier for a medical card. It also recommended that it is neither feasible nor desirable to list conditions in priority order for medical card eligibility.  <\/p><p>On foot of the Keane Report, the HSE established a Clinical Advisory Group to develop clinical oversight and guidance for the operation of a more compassionate and trusted medical card system.  The Director General of the HSE, on accepting an interim recommendation of the Group, made a decision to award medical card eligibility to all children under 18 years of age with a diagnosis of cancer from 1 July 2015, with the card to be held for a period of five years.  The Clinical Advisory Group is continuing its work on the development of guidance on assessing medical card applications involving significant medical conditions. <\/p><p>It is clear that there are people with medical needs and it is important that they should be able to access necessary assistance in a straight forward manner. Greater discretion is being exercised by the HSE as evidenced by the number of discretionary medical cards in circulation, which has increased from about 52,000 in mid-2014 to over 103,000 at 1 April 2016.<\/p><p>The HSE local health offices can offer assistance to those completing their Medical Card\/GP Visit Card application form or seek clarification on any aspect regarding the process of assessing eligibility for a Medical Card\/GP Visit Card.

The report recommended that the number of critical care beds in the system should increase from 289 to 579 over the period 2010 to 2020 and the development of a  &lsquo;hub-and-spoke&rsquo; Model of Care for Adult Critical Care. Since its establishment the HSE critical care clinical  programme has been working with service providers to develop the hub and spoke model whereby the more complex work is undertaken in the larger regional hospitals and critical care services in the some of the smaller hospital have been decommissioned. The Model of Care for critical care was launched in October 2014. <\/p>  <p>  The Programme has carried out an annual census of critical care capacity and activity.  Based on the recently completed 2015 national census, there are currently 237 adult critical care beds in public hospitals. It is acknowledged that there is a need to address the overall critical care bed capacity requirements. The initial approach underway in the HSE is to work to opening 25 exiting critical care beds that are closed due to nursing shortages and difficulties in recruiting nurse for critical care. The HSE is putting in place a Critical Care Nursing Career Pathway initiative, facilitated by the Critical Care Programme, aimed at increasing the number of critical care nurses.     <\/p>  <p>  It has not been possible in 2016 to provide for additional resources for critical care within the limited envelope of additional funding and competing priorities for acute services. However, I would like to assure the Deputy that my Department and the HSE are committed to working together to try to address the capacity deficit over the coming years by prioritising this area for consideration for investment based on business cases as part of the annual Estimates process.     <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised by the Deputy regarding the cost of increasing critical care beds, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly.

Funding was allocated in 2015 for additional consultant posts including two consultant orthopaedic surgeons, anaesthetist and support staff at Crumlin.

These include Temple Street, Cappagh, Tallaght and the Blackrock Clinic.  External capacity has also been identified at the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital at Stanmore in the UK.

Therefore it cannot be  the case that an unfair burden of responsibility on the patient&rsquo;s referring doctor is created for those accessing services under the Directive by having the same pathway as is employed for those accessing such care in Ireland.  This pathway is the long established and appropriate means of ensuring patients access the appropriate care, having had a GP first make the determination of necessary care and then provide the appropriate referral.  <\/p>  <p>  The Directive does not provide for or in any way encourage Member States to alter their healthcare systems to mirror those of other Member States.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016041400076#WRHH01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"question","counter":1487,"qnumday":509,"qnumall":"[6780\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016041400076#WRHH02100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"to introduce changes to the delivery of the cross-border healthcare directive to remove the burden of prior payment for treatment costs from the patient; whether this burden constitutes a barrier to access for some patients under the directive; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1330","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":1488,"content":"<p>The EU Directive 2011\/24\/EU on Patients&rsquo; Rights in Cross Border Healthcare aims to ensure EU citizens may access safe and good quality healthcare services across EU borders.

After 31 October 2016 the title \"speech and language therapist\" will be protected following a 2 year transition\/grandparenting period to allow all speech and language therapists in Ireland register with the Speech and Language Therapists Registration Board.<\/p>  <p>  Possession of an approved qualification is one of several steps in the registration process and in this context the Speech and Language Therapists Registration Board is also designated as competent authority under Directive 2005\/36\/EC in Ireland for professional speech and language therapy qualifications. This Directive applies to all EEA nationals who wish to practise any regulated profession in an EEA Member State other than that in which they obtained their professional qualifications. This includes Irish citizens with professional qualifications obtained in any of the other EEA Member States, including the United Kingdom, who seek to return to Ireland to practise their profession.  <\/p>  <p>  There is no specific recognition of the profession of speech and language therapy at a European level; rather the Directive provides for the assessment of the qualifications\/professional training\/post-qualification professional experience of an applicant against the qualifications required to practise in the host Member State (Ireland).  The General System of the Directive, which applies in the case of speech and language therapy qualifications, provides for an assessment on a case-by-case basis of the qualifications of an applicant against those required to practise in the host member state if the professional activities covered are comparable.   If the professional activities are not comparable then the qualifications cannot be recognised.  If the professional activities are comparable but deficits in the qualification are identified, subsequent post-qualification professional experience of the applicant must be considered.  If deficits in qualifications remain, the Directive provides for the competent authority to offer the applicant a compensation measure i.e. the choice between a period of adaptation (a placement) and an aptitude test. <\/p>  <p>  I am advised by CORU that compensation measures have been applied to some applicants with non-Irish speech and language therapy qualifications which did not meet the applicable Irish standards - the Standards of Proficiency. Where compensation measures are applied and have been successfully completed, the applicant's qualification is recognised and they are eligible to apply for statutory registration.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Directive, Member States must ensure that an applicant has the possibility of taking the aptitude test not later than six months after the initial decision in which it is imposed. There is no obligation however on the host Member State to provide the period of adaptation which is a period of professional practice in the host Member State under the supervision of a qualified member of that profession, possibly being accompanied by further training.  <\/p>  <p>  I am advised that a course in dysphagia is available at Tallaght Hospital, Dublin. This course has clinical practice components and would fall within the Directive definition of a period of adaptation and hence, subject to CORU approval, would be suitable for overseas applicants who have deficits in dysphagia.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016041400078#WRKK00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Status","counter":1566,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016041400078#WRKK00650"},{"type":"question","counter":1567,"qnumday":535,"qnumall":"[6836\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016041400078#WRKK00700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a person (details supplied) in County Dublin will receive an appointment for a needs assessment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1215","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":1568,"content":"<p>As the issue raised by the Deputy relates to an individual case, this is a service matter for the Health Service Executive.

In this context, the implementation of the recommendations of the Strategic Review of Medical Training and Career Structure is a priority for my Department and the HSE.<\/p>  <p>  In July 2013, a Working Group, chaired by Prof Brian MacCraith, President, Dublin City University, was established to carry out the Strategic Review. The Working Group was tasked with examining and making high-level recommendations relating to training and career pathways for doctors with a view to:<\/p>  <p>  -  Improving graduate retention in the public health system;<\/p>  <p>  -  Planning for future service needs; and<\/p>  <p>  -  Realising maximum benefit from investment in medical education and training.<\/p>  <p>  The Working Group completed its work in June 2014 and, in all, submitted three reports and made 25 recommendations. The reports address a range of barriers and issues relating to the recruitment and retention of doctors in the Irish public health system.<\/p>  <p>  A number of our NCHDs and consultants go abroad as part of their training, and some following completion of their training, to gain experience and expertise prior to taking up posts in Ireland. A further cohort go abroad for a variety of other reasons, such as working conditions, life style, and pay.<\/p>  <p>  The Strategic Review recommendations aimed at addressing these reasons to the extent possible are being implemented through a range of structures and processes across the health system. Each recommendation has an identified business owner and progress updates are sought by my Department on a regular basis.  To support implementation of the recommendations, my Department has also established an Implementation Monitoring Group, comprising key stakeholders. To date, three progress reports on the implementation of the recommendations have been published on my Department&rsquo;s website. These allow all stakeholders to assess the progress being made across the range of Strategic Review recommendations. At this point the focus is on the implementation of these measures, to support retention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016041400078#WRKK02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Equipment","counter":1583,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016041400078#WRKK02450"},{"type":"question","counter":1584,"qnumday":544,"qnumall":"[6858\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016041400078#WRKK02500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of an application by a person (details supplied) in County Kerry for hospital equipment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":1585,"content":"<p>As the Deputy's question relates to services, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive (HSE) for direct reply to the Deputy.

The impact of the widespread contamination from explosive remnants of war is an issue of concern to Ireland and one which we have been active in addressing.  In particular, Ireland has consistently supported calls for further research to assess the health risks and environmental impact of the use of arms and ammunitions containing depleted uranium in conflict situations.  Verification and attribution of the cause of serious health and environmental impacts is complex when examining extended periods of multi-faceted conflict.  Ireland has voted in favour of resolutions on depleted uranium at the United Nations since 2007, most recently in December 2014 when General Assembly Resolution A\/C.1\/69\/L.43  was supported by 143 States.  These resolutions encourage Member States to provide assistance to countries affected by the use of arms and ammunitions containing depleted uranium, in particular, by identifying and managing contaminated sites and material.<\/p>  <p>  There is at present no international framework or treaty concerning depleted uranium munitions and therefore no internationally agreed definition or prohibition.  Ireland does not possess any weapons or ammunition containing depleted uranium.  It is the firm policy of the Government that depleted uranium munitions will not be acquired or used by the Defence Forces.<\/p>  <p>  The arrangements under which permission is granted for foreign military aircraft to land at Irish airports, including Shannon, are governed by strict conditions.  These include stipulations that the aircraft must be unarmed, carry no arms, ammunition or explosives and must not engage in intelligence gathering, and that the flights in question must not form part of military exercises or operations.  Requests to permit the landing of foreign military aircraft are considered by my Department on the basis of these conditions.  Permission would not have been granted for landings by foreign military aircraft carrying arms or ammunition, including depleted uranium munitions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016041400084#WRQQ00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Meetings","counter":1807,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016041400084#WRQQ00500"},{"type":"question","counter":1808,"qnumday":620,"qnumall":"[6422\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016041400084#WRQQ00600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he has had talks or consultations with the US Government regarding the Hibernia Atlantic cable being used as a data conduit to facilitate the operation of unmanned drones in the Middle East by its military; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1259","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":1809,"content":"<p>I have not had any talks or consultations with the Government of the United States of America regarding the Hibernia Atlantic Cable.<\/p>  <p>  As Minister, I have no role in determining the uses to which international fibre connections can be put, nor do I have any role in the monitoring of data traffic passing over fibre networks transiting the State.

I use every opportunity to raise the issue of the EU-UK relationship with them, and to outline Ireland's perspective and the need to work together with a view to helping to keep the UK in the EU.  This all contributed to the work of EU Heads of State and Government at the European Council, and by Ministers at the General Affairs Council.<\/p><p>I have regular contact with Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Theresa Villiers MP, and have discussed the issue of the UK&rsquo;s EU membership with her.

The EU and Turkey have engaged deeply on developing joint approaches and the EU&rsquo;s engagement with Turkey was the focus of the most recent European Council on 17 and 18 March 2016.<\/p>  <p>  The discussions at the European Council were framed by the set of principles agreed at the previous EU meeting with the Turkish Prime Minister, on 7 March.  In the interim, European Council President Tusk had advanced work to elaborate the details of a potential agreement, to ensure that partners&rsquo; concerns were addressed and that the proposed deal was compatible with EU and international law.<\/p>  <p>  The joint statement agreed between the two sides commits Turkey to readmit from Greece all irregular migrants and to protect them in accordance with international standards; to tackle people smugglers; and to help prevent new migratory routes to the EU opening up.  For its part, the EU will resettle Syrians currently in Turkey on a &ldquo;one-for-one&rdquo; basis where other Syrians are returned from Greece.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, visa liberalisation for Turkish citizens travelling to the Schengen countries will be accelerated, as will preparations to open new EU accession negotiation chapters &ndash; but in both cases existing criteria will continue to apply.  The EU is also committed to deciding on further financial assistance for refugees in Turkey, in addition to the &euro;3 billion already agreed.  The European Council also agreed to work together to improve humanitarian conditions inside Syria so that safe areas might be established there.  The European Union has also put in place humanitarian aid to assist with the provision for asylum seekers and refugees in Greece.<\/p>  <p>  The core intention of this agreement is to break the business model of the people smugglers who are profiting from the suffering of the vulnerable, and to stop migrants attempting the treacherous journey across the Aegean.<\/p>  <p>  It is unlikely that this agreement alone will resolve the Migration crisis.  It will not stop people leaving Syria, and it will not prevent people from wanting to come to Europe.

The UN Special Envoy for Yemen, Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed, has urged all parties to work to ensure that the terms and conditions of the truce are fully respected.  Importantly, these include commitments for the unhindered access for humanitarian supplies and personnel to all parts of Yemen.  Though there have been some reports of isolated violations of this &ldquo;cessation of hostilities&rdquo;, by and large it seems to be holding.  This cease-fire aims to create a conducive environment for peace talks scheduled to take place in Kuwait beginning on 18 April.  These talks, to be held under the auspices of the UN, include military representatives from both the pro-Government and Houthi\/anti-Government camps, who together form the De-escalation and Co-ordination Committee.  The Committee&rsquo;s discussions will focus on five areas: the withdrawal of militias and armed groups; the handover of heavy weapons to the State; interim security arrangements; the restoration of state institutions and the resumption of inclusive political dialogue; and the creation of a special committee for prisoners and detainees.  The EU Council of Ministers adopted conclusions last November expressing deep concern at the situation.  The conclusions emphasised that the solution to the Yemeni conflict must be a political one.  The Council expressed particular concern at the impact of the fighting on the civilian population, as well as on civilian infrastructure and cultural heritage.  The indiscriminate targeting of civilian infrastructure was heavily criticised and the EU appealed to all parties to respect International Humanitarian Law and International Human Rights Law.<\/p>  <p>  On 5 April, the UN Special Envoy held talks in Brussels with HRVP Mogherini, where they discussed how to support the ceasefire and the resumption of peace talks.  The HRVP emphasised at a joint press conference that \"the only sustainable solution to the conflict in Yemen is a political solution\", and pledged both political and practical support.  She also announced that the EU had mobilised technical support for the UN Special Envoy, with EU experts having conducted a capacity-building exercise with the De-escalation and Co-ordination Committee in advance of the peace talks.<\/p>  <p>  I believe that the only solution to this conflict can be a political one.

More than 260,000 people have been killed and some 13.5 million people within Syria are in need of humanitarian assistance.  The UN estimates that over 4.8 million Syrians have fled to neighbouring countries.<\/p>  <p>  The UN has appealed for over $7.7 billion in 2016 to meet the needs of those affected by this crisis.  At the London Pledging Conference on Syria in February 2016, Ireland pledged &euro;20 million in support for the Syria crisis this year, on top of the &euro;42 million in humanitarian assistance which we have already provided since 2012.  Ireland&rsquo;s humanitarian assistance is delivered through UN, Red Cross and NGO partners.  Our allocation of funding seeks to balance the needs of those inside Syria, particularly in besieged and hard-to-reach areas, with the needs of those who have fled to neighbouring countries.<\/p>  <p>  We strongly condemn the refusal to allow medical supplies to be included in convoys to besieged areas, the attacks directed against medical facilities, and the deliberate blocking of food aid to civilians, all of which have been used as tactics by the parties to the conflict in this brutal war.  There must be legal accountability for victims of the Syrian conflict.<\/p>  <p>  In 2015, Ireland provided &euro;1 million in support to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which played a key role in negotiating the delivery of aid in January 2016 to besieged towns such as Madaya, where many people were on the brink of starvation due to the blocking of aid convoys.  Ireland has also provided total support over 2014 and 2015 of &euro;1.25 million to the Syrian Arab Red Crescent (SARC), which has a unique presence on the ground in many areas which other humanitarian agencies cannot reach.<\/p>  <p>  We are very conscious of the particular strain which this crisis has placed on smaller countries such as Lebanon, where more than one in five residents is now a refugee, and Jordan.  Of the &euro;42 million we have provided in humanitarian aid since 2012, over half is flexible funding, which our partners can use in whichever country that has the greatest needs.  We have also allocated a total of &euro;4.2 million specifically for Lebanon, &euro;2.5 million specifically for Jordan, and &euro;1.5 million for the response in Turkey since 2012.  We have also provided smaller sums to support Syrian refugees in Iraq and Egypt.<\/p>  <p>  In 2016, we are providing funding of &euro;20 million to our UN, Red Cross and NGO partners to address humanitarian need both inside Syria and in neighbouring countries.

Through our international engagement on human rights at the United Nations Human Rights Council and the Third Committee of the General Assembly, Ireland advocates for gender equality and combatting all forms of discrimination.  We have used our membership of, and participation in, discussions at these UN bodies to negotiate and support resolutions on the elimination of discrimination against women; violence against women; female genital mutilation (FGM); preventable maternal mortality and morbidity; realising the equal enjoyment of the right to education by every girl; strengthening efforts to prevent and eliminate child, early and forced marriage and women human rights defenders.  We have also raised our concerns regarding the situation of women in specific countries during our interventions at the Universal Periodic Review where the human rights records of individual states are reviewed by other UN Member States.  As part of our commitment to advancing gender equality, Ireland played a key role in the establishment of UN Women, and is an active participant in the UN Commission on the Status of Women (CSW).  On 5 April 2016 Ireland was elected as a member of the CSW for the 2017-2021 term.  This will be our first term of membership of the CSW and an important opportunity for Ireland to further enhance our contribution to the promotion of gender equality and women&rsquo;s empowerment.<\/p>  <p>  We are also a longstanding advocate for the Women, Peace and Security Agenda at the UN while the promotion of gender equality and women&rsquo;s empowerment is also an integral part of our policy on disarmament.  Ireland&rsquo;s policy on UN Security Council Resolution 1325 is framed in its 2nd National Action Plan on Women, Peace and Security which is an inter- and intra-departmental policy initiative that seeks to promote the protection of the human rights of women and girls living in Ireland and abroad, the empowerment of women in decision-making and participation, the prevention of conflict including sexual and gender-based violence and the promotion of the Women, Peace and Security agenda in relevant international fora.<\/p>  <p>  Gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls are priorities in our official development assistance programme.  All recipients of Irish Aid funding are required to demonstrate their commitment to these goals.

On 20 July 2015, the EU Foreign Affairs Council (FAC) adopted the EU Action Plan for Human Rights and Democracy 2015-2019 and I welcome the commitment in this Plan to prioritising the protection of the rights of women and protection against gender-based violence.

There is a growing recognition that despite its considerable achievements and successes, there have also been a number of serious failures.  The government believes that a UN reform agenda must be put in place to make the organisation more transparent and accountable, and to ensure that the structures and procedures of the UN are effective.  I have maintained contact with the UN Secretary General since his visit to Ireland in May 2015 to commemorate the 60th anniversary of Ireland joining the UN.  In September of last year I used our bilateral meeting on the margins of the UN General Assembly to discuss the role of the United Nations in addressing a number of the major conflicts threatening international peace and security, and the need for sustained UN engagement not just in peacekeeping and responding to crisis situations, but also in terms of peacebuilding and conflict prevention.  In the latter half of 2015, the Secretary General initiated three major UN review exercises which were aimed at improving the overall effectiveness of the UN&rsquo;s response to conflict.  The high level policy reviews on (1) UN Peace Operations, (2) Peacebuilding Architecture and (3) Women, Peace and Security were published.  Each of the reviews offered recommendations on how the UN can improve and reform its functions and structures particularly in relation to the global challenge presented by conflict, war and implementing peace operations.<\/p>  <p>  My department engaged fully with all three reviews, calling for the recommendations to be discussed and implemented as part of our broader calls for UN reform.

The previous Government decided to reduce the salaries and allowances payable to all new entrants to public service recruitment grades (including teachers) by 10% with effect from 1 January 2011. This decision also required that such new entrants would start on the first point of the applicable salary scale, which in the case of teachers had the effect of reducing their starting pay by a further 4-5%. Later in 2011, the Government placed a cap on the overall level of qualification allowances that could be earned by teachers.<\/p>  <p>  Subsequently in 2012, following the public service-wide review of allowances, the Government withdrew qualification allowances for new teachers altogether. However, the Government partially compensated for this by deciding that new entrant teachers would henceforth commence on a new salary scale which had a starting point higher than the starting point of the old scale. Overall, the removal of qualification allowances had the effect of further reducing the pay of new entrant teachers by between 5 and 7 percent.<\/p>  <p>  The measures above &ndash; which applied to new entrants only and which were in addition to the pay reductions imposed on public servants generally - were implemented at a time of extraordinarily difficult financial and budgetary circumstances for the State.

An improved pay scale for post-1 February 2012 entrants was also agreed and implemented under the terms of that Agreement. The Lansdowne Road Agreement will begin the process of restoring the reductions to public service pay which were implemented over recent years.

This will normally include a pupil teacher ratio of 6 to 1 and Special Needs Assistant support normally amounting to 2 SNAs for a class of 6 children.<\/p>  <p>  Progress in developing this network has been significant and in addition to the special school placements there are now approximately 762 special classes nationwide in mainstream schools for children with Autism, 116 of which are early intervention settings, 452 at primary level and 194 at post primary level.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), for allocating resource teachers and special needs assistants to schools to support students with Special Educational Needs, including Autism.<\/p>  <p>  It is also the role of the NCSE to make appropriate arrangements to establish special classes in schools in communities where the need for such classes has been identified.<\/p>  <p>  SENOs engage with schools annually in order to plan for, and to open, new special classes each year in order to ensure there are sufficient special class placements available at primary and post primary school level to meet demand in a given area.<\/p>  <p>  The NCSE also provides information for Parents of Children with Special Education Needs through its website www.ncse.ie and Pamphlet Series which inform parents and guardians of supports and services available for children and young people with ASD and their families.<\/p>  <p>  Also for children with autism the school year is extended to include the month of July. This is commonly referred to as 'the July Provision Programme'. This is typically delivered in the child's school, but where the school is not in a position to deliver this, it can be provided as home tuition.<\/p>  <p>  My Department supports the professional development of staff working with children with special educational needs, including those with Autism, through the Special Education Support Service (SESS).<\/p>  <p>  Further support is provided to children and their families by the Middletown Centre for Autism in Co. Armagh. This centre is jointly funded by my Department and the Department of Education in Northern Ireland. The Centre provides a comprehensive nationwide training service for parents and educational professionals. Parents can view the range of courses which the Centre has available through the website www.middletownautism.com.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016041400086#WRSS02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1325"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects Status","counter":1928,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016041400086#WRSS02850"},{"type":"question","counter":1929,"qnumday":662,"qnumall":"[6339\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016041400086#WRSS02900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the status of the provision of a new location and premises for a school (details supplied) in County Dublin; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1228","askee":"1325"},{"type":"speech","counter":1930,"content":"<p>The Deputy will be aware that a project for the school to which he refers was included in my Department's 6 Year Capital Programme which I announced last November.

In circumstances where children with special educational needs require more specialised interventions, special school or special class places are also available.<\/p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), for allocating special educational needs supports including Special Needs Assistants (SNAs), resource teaching support to mainstream schools, staffing in special schools and the establishment of special classes in mainstream schools, to support children with special educational needs. The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.<\/p>  <p>  In July 2015, 610 additional SNA posts were provided to the end of 2015, while Budget 2016 provided an additional 100 SNA posts to meet additional demand to June 2016, bringing the total SNA number available for allocation to 12,040.  This is a higher level of Special Needs Assistant (SNA) support than ever before, which will ensure that children with special educational needs can continue to participate in education and be supported in a manner appropriate to their needs.<\/p>  <p>  All State-funded primary and post primary schools have a permanent allocation of additional teaching supports to provide for children whose educational psychological assessment places them in the high incidence, or less complex, disability category. There are in excess of 5,000 Learning Support Teacher posts at present.<\/p>  <p>  Separately, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) allocates additional resource teaching hours to schools for children who have been assessed within the low incidence, or more complex, category of special need. Budget 2016 made additional provision, increasing the number from 6705 at the end of 2015 to 6852 at the end of June 2016 and to 7452 Posts to the end of 2016.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, provision has been made for placement options in some 125 special schools with over 1,100 teachers and over 1,000 special classes are located in mainstream schools around the country.<\/p>  <p>  The NCSE has published details of resource teaching, SNA allocation and special classes for all schools, including schools in County Kildare, from 2012 to 2015 inclusive, on its website at www.ncse.ie.<\/p>  <p>  I will arrange for the NCSE to reply directly to the Deputy in relation to applications for support sanctioned by the NCSE prior to 2012.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016041400086#WRSS03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1325"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Third Level Data","counter":1939,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016041400087#WRTT00150"},{"type":"question","counter":1940,"qnumday":665,"qnumall":"[6368\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016041400087#WRTT00200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the amount spent by each of the third level universities on legal cases involving staff for each of the past five years; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1261","askee":"1325"},{"type":"speech","counter":1941,"content":"<p>The information requested by the Deputy is not available in my Department.

The Department adopts a holistic and integrated approach to supporting the work of schools in promoting positive mental health and to supporting those with a broad range of problems, behavioural emotional and social.<\/p><p>The process spans the curriculum in schools, whole-school ethos, quality of teaching, learning and assessment, student support and pastoral care and the provision of professional development for teachers. It also involves other supports such as educational psychological services and guidance and counselling services, and the interface with other agencies, both nationally and locally. <\/p><p>Schools are assisted by Well-Being in Post-Primary Schools: Guidelines for Mental Health Promotion and Suicide Prevention (2012), which was developed to implement Action 2.1 of Reach Out: the National Strategy for Action on Suicide Prevention 2005-2014 (HSE, 2005).<\/p><p>The Guidelines are for all members of the school community, boards of management and in-school management teams who play a central leadership role in mental health promotion. They are also useful for parents' associations, student councils, health and other personnel who are seeking an understanding of how to work in and with schools.<\/p><p>It is also important that this message is conveyed to pupils at an early age. To this end, Wellbeing Guidelines for Primary Schools have been recently produced by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive. The guidelines are informed by consultation with key Education and Health partners and by the findings of current research. They provide practical guidance to schools on how they can promote mental health and well-being in an integrated school-wide way and they also provide evidence-based advice on how to support young people who may be at risk of suicidal behaviour.<\/p><p>The Guidelines build on the significant work already taking place in primary schools, including through the Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) curriculum, the whole-school guidance plan, the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) continuum of support model and the HSE , Health Promoting Schools Process. Information is also provided on how to access support from the SPHE Support Service and other external agencies and support services.<\/p><p>The new Framework for Junior Cycle (2015) also places a clear emphasis on overall student health and well-being. This Framework is underpinned by eight principles, one of which is &quot;Well-being&quot;. It also has eight key skills which are to be embedded in every new Junior Cycle subject and short course including the key skills of &quot;Managing Myself&quot; and &quot;Staying Well&quot;. In addition, the 24 'Statements of Learning' that a student should experience during their Junior Cycle programme involve the student taking action to safeguard and promote their own well-being and that of others. <\/p><p>One of the innovative features of the Framework for Junior Cycle  is the introduction of short courses that schools can choose to implement. The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) has developed a new short course in SPHE, which may be delivered for reporting  purposes and will involve an increase in the time allocation for SPHE at Junior Cycle up to 100 hours over the three year cycle. The new short course is now available to implement in post-primary schools, should they wish to do so, as part of their Junior Cycle programme. It includes strands such as &quot;Minding Myself and Others&quot; and &quot;My Mental Health&quot;, and deals with issues such as mental health and mental ill-health, dealing with tough times, loss and bereavement.<\/p><p>My Department is also working with the Department of Health to promote participation by primary and post-primary schools in the 'Health Promoting Schools' initiative, which is supported by the Department of Health. This European-wide programme aims to strengthen schools' capacity to be a healthy setting for learning and working by focusing at whole-school level on all the conditions that affect health and well-being.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016041400089#WRVV02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1325"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Patronage","counter":2051,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016041400089#WRVV02050"},{"type":"question","counter":2052,"qnumday":702,"qnumall":"[6818\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016041400089#WRVV02100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the status of the implementation of the recommendations in the report by the Forum on Patronage and Pluralism; if there is a roadmap for furthering the recommendations; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1291","askee":"1325"},{"type":"speech","counter":2053,"content":"<p>The Forum on Patronage and Pluralism in the primary school sector, which issued its report in 2012, recommended steps that could be taken to ensure that the education system can provide a sufficiently diverse number and range of primary schools to cater for children of all religions and none.<\/p><p>The Report's recommendations covered four broad areas:  - those dealing with planning towards future patronage arrangements and having a more diverse range of patronagetypes for new schools in areas of rising population;<\/p><p>-  those dealing with the practicalities of achieving divesting of patronage where there is a stable population and a demand for diversity of school types;<\/p><p>-  those dealing with Irish language provision; and<\/p><p>-  those dealing with the creation of more inclusive schools.<\/p><p>An Action Plan in response to the Forum report was produced in June 2012 and work on implementation has been advanced by my Department in consultation with relevant stakeholders.<\/p><p>A follow-up paper, entitled &quot;Forum on Patronage and Pluralism in the Primary Sector: Progress to Date and Future Directions&quot;, was published in 2014.  The paper gave an update on the progress made to date on implementing the Forum's recommendations, with a particular focus on the issue of inclusion and diversity in schools.  The paper outlined good practice and options for promoting diversity in schools, in particular in relation to:<\/p><p>-  The right to opt out of religion classes;<\/p><p>-  Scheduling of Religion Classes and other Religious Activities;<\/p><p>-  Options for Pupils in relation to Religious Ceremonies of the Ethos of the School;<\/p><p>-  Celebration of Religious Festivals; and<\/p><p>-  Display of Religious Artefacts<\/p><p>Officials in my Department have continued to engage with stakeholders on these matters.<\/p><p>It has been a priority for a number of years to expand diversity of provision in the primary school network. Since 2011, twenty-four new primary schools have been established in areas of demographic need and all of these have involved consultation with parents as to their preferred type of school. Of these new schools, twenty-three have a multi-denominational ethos, and the remaining school has an inter-denominational ethos.<\/p><p>In line with the recommendations of the Forum, it has also been a priority to expand diversity of patronage in the existing primary school network. Given that most of the existing primary schools are under the patronage of the Catholic Church, there has been an ongoing engagement with the Catholic Church with regard to transferring patronage of schools in particular areas. <\/p><p>Following surveys of parents in 43 areas of stable population, which aimed to establish the level of parental demand for a wider choice in the patronage of primary schools, including the demand for Irish medium schools, there was sufficient parental demand supporting change in 28 of these areas. To date, eight new primary schools have opened under the patronage divesting process. Work is on-going to deliver further options for school patronage diversity in other areas as quickly as possible and I have undertaken a round of consultations with the principal patron bodies over the last number of months with the aim of reinvigorating the process in an effort to achieve greater diversity of school provision.<\/p><p>Since 2008, a new model of primary school patronage, Community National Schools (CNS), has been piloted in response to the increasing demand for parental choice in the patronage of primary schools.  The distinguishing feature of CNSs is that they are multi-denominational schools which allow for the provision of faith formation during the school day.  The aim of the model is to cater for the diversity present within the community in a single school setting, rather than in more than one school.  There are now a total of eleven Community National Schools.<\/p><p>In relation to the development of a curriculum for Education about Religions and Beliefs (ERB) and Ethics in primary schools, as recommended by the Forum, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment recently completed a consultation process on proposals for such a curriculum.

Under this scheme schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.<\/p>  <p>  In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service. The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution focused consultative approach to maximise positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment.<\/p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.

It is a matter for the Board of Management of a school to ensure that SNAs in the school are in a position to effectively meet the care needs of the pupil\/pupils for whom the SNAs have been appointed.  <\/p>  <p>  Where specific training may be required, the board should liaise with the Health Service Executive (HSE) in order to ensure that the HSE provides guidance and\/or training that enables the SNA to meet the care needs of the pupil in an appropriate manner.<\/p>  <p>  Circular 30\/2014 states that students with special educational needs, including Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), can have very complex learning needs and should be taught by qualified and experienced teachers who are equipped with the necessary skills to meet the needs of these students. It is the responsibility of the classroom teacher to ensure that each pupil is taught in a stimulating and supportive classroom environment where all pupils feel equal and valued.<\/p>  <p>  The Circular also notes that many children with significant special educational needs require additional teaching support in schools. In such circumstances, the classroom teacher will be supported by a resource teacher\/ \/learning support teacher, who are fully qualified teachers who will have access to additional training in the area of special education. Such additional teaching support allocations are made to schools in addition to any SNA provision.<\/p>  <p>  The Circular therefore notes that although the SNA can provide useful assistance to the teacher in ensuring that the pupil is able to access education, it is the role of qualified learning support\/resource teachers to assist the class teacher to provide additional teaching to pupils with special educational needs.<\/p>  <p>  My Department provides for a comprehensive system of continuing professional development (CPD) for teachers in the area of special educational needs including teachers of children with ASD. Central to this is the Special Education Support Service (SESS). The brief of the SESS is to enhance the quality of learning and teaching of students with special educational needs through the provision of CPD and support for teachers in mainstream schools, primary and post-primary, special schools, and special classes. <\/p>  <p>  Reflective of the important role of CPD, my Department, through SESS, has put in place a training programme for teachers in autism-specific interventions including Treatment and Education of Autistic Communication Handicapped Children (TEACCH) and Picture Exchange Communications System (PECS).<\/p>  <p>  The SESS also provides whole school training at the request of schools. At the principal's discretion, SNAs can also access courses during whole school training. There are no current plans to extend the remit of the SESS to provide for SNA training in the future.<\/p>  <p>  Further support is provided to children and their families by the Middletown Centre for Autism in Co. Armagh.  This Centre is jointly funded by my Department and the Department of Education in Northern Ireland.  The Centre provides a comprehensive nationwide training service for parents and educational professionals. Parents can view the range of courses which the Centre has available through the website www.middletownautism.com.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016041400092#WRYY00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1325"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Teachers' Remuneration","counter":2148,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016041400092#WRYY00800"},{"type":"question","counter":2149,"qnumday":737,"qnumall":"[7162\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016041400092#WRYY00900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the cost of restoring qualification allowances to newly qualified teachers; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1325"},{"type":"speech","counter":2150,"content":"<p>I will arrange for the information that is available in my Department in relation to the cost of restoring Qualification allowances to be forwarded to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016041400092#WRYY01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1325"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Accommodation","counter":2151,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016041400092#WRYY01100"},{"type":"question","counter":2152,"qnumday":738,"qnumall":"[7189\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016041400092#WRYY01200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the extent to which she continues to monitor requirements in respect of primary level and secondary level schools in County Kildare, with particular reference to the need to provide facilities and accommodation in line with demographic trends; the extent to which she has identified any particular prioritisation in this regard; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1325"},{"type":"speech","counter":2153,"content":"<p>In identifying the requirement for additional school places, my Department uses a Geographical Information System to identify the areas under increased demographic pressure nationwide.

These procedures include notification to the Authority prior to the commencement of works, the appointment of competent persons to build, inspect and certify the works, the lodgement of drawings and particulars demonstrating how the particular building or works has achieved compliance and the registration of notices and certificates by the Authority on the statutory register of building control activity. <\/p><p>Statutory certificates of compliance, where relevant, must be given at commencement (design only) and completion and must be signed by a registered construction profession (i.e. an Architect or a Building Surveyor or a chartered Engineer who is included on a statutory register maintained respectively by the Royal Institution of Architects of Ireland, the Society of Chartered Surveyors of Ireland or Engineers Ireland).

HAP provides for the transfer of responsibility for long-term recipients of rent supplement who have a recognised housing need from the Department of Social Protection to the local authority sector, thus bringing all long-term social housing supports provided by the State together under the local authority system. Upon its introduction in a local authority area, HAP will replace rent supplement for those with a long-term housing need and who qualify for social housing support; rent supplement will no longer be an option for applicants in such cases. Local authorities are taking an incremental approach to the transfer of recipients from rent supplement to HAP in their own areas. This involves close co-operation with local Department of Social Protection offices and individual tenants. An existing rent supplement recipient who has been determined as eligible for the HAP scheme may transfer to HAP and remain in their current accommodation where the landlord is in agreement, and subject to the terms and conditions of the scheme being met.

The Electoral Act 1992 provides that local authorities, in making polling schemes, shall endeavour to appoint polling places where at least one polling station is accessible to wheelchair users and requires that the returning officer shall, where practicable, provide polling stations which are accessible to wheelchair users. The returning officer must, where practicable, give public notice of all polling stations which are inaccessible to wheelchair users, not later than eight days before polling day. If an elector considers that he or she might have difficulty gaining access to a polling station, he or she may apply in writing to the returning officer for authorisation to vote at another polling station in the same constituency or local electoral area. In addition, the returning officer is required to put in place arrangements at each polling station to facilitate the marking and placing in the ballot box of ballot papers by voters who may be wheelchair users.<\/p>  <p>  While I have no immediate plans to change these provisions in the electoral Acts or to make it mandatory that all polling stations and booths are fully accessible to all persons, my Department will continue , in co-operation with returning officers, local authorities and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform , to seek to improve voting facilities for all voters.<\/p>  <p>  In this regard, my   Department issues guidance to returning officers in advance of elections and referendums. The guidance advises returning officers when selecting buildings to be used as polling stations, that consideration should be given to accessibility issues and the needs of voters with a range of disabilities. Returning Officers have also been advised, where possible, to use more recently built premises as these are likely to have been built to more exacting standards of accessibility under Building Regulations. <\/p>  <p>The guidance also provides information on accessible voting in the form of an accessibility checklist. The most recent checklist &ndash; that was used at the D&aacute;il election on 26 February 2016 and which was drawn up in consultation with the National Disability Authority (NDA) and the Irish Wheelchair Association (IWA) - was   developed using the NDA publication Building for Everyone &ndash; a Universal Design Approach and the IWA publication Designing Accessible Environments for All. While the checklist does not constitute a   legal interpretation of any statutory provision, it provides returning officers with a general guide on the issues that should be considered in planning for and checking the accessibility of polling stations.   <\/p>  <p>  In relation to polling booths, the guidance advises returning officers to provide at each polling station an appropriate table and chair, located in such a position as to ensure secrecy in voting, at which electors such as wheelchair users, persons with a physical disability or the elderly can mark their ballot papers if they find it more convenient. Returning Officers are advised to consider, where feasible, the installation of a low height voting compartment to facilitate voters who use wheelchairs or those who are short of stature.<\/p>  <p>  If a person has a physical illness or physical disability which prevents him or her from going to the polling station, the person can vote by post if he or she applies to be included in the postal voters list which is drawn up each year as part of the register of electors. In order to be entered on the postal voters list, the person must apply to the appropriate local authority by 25 November each year. After that date, an application for inclusion in the supplement to the postal voters list may be made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016041400095#WRBBB01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1349"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Spatial Strategy","counter":2292,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016041400095#WRBBB01850"},{"type":"question","counter":2293,"qnumday":785,"qnumall":"[6879\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016041400095#WRBBB01900","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the status of a new national spatial strategy; if he will consult the public and request submissions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1329","askee":"1349"},{"type":"speech","counter":2294,"content":"<p>In December 2015, Minister Kelly and I published a roadmap document entitled Towards a National Planning Framework - A Roadmap for the delivery of the National Planning Framework 2016.

This survey measured the total amount of lands whether owned privately or by the local authority that have been identified for housing development in the various local authority development plans and that are the highest priority for development.<\/p><p>The area of such lands amounts to 17,434 hectares, which given a range of densities appropriate to whether the areas are in small villages or larger towns and cities and as determined by the relevant local authorities, could theoretically enable the construction of over 414,000 dwellings.<\/p><p>The Residential Land Availability Survey 2014 is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at:<\/p><p><i><\/i><\/p><p>Statistics on planning permissions granted on a county basis are published by the Central Statistics Office; see .

For example, implementation of the Strategy is being supported through the provision of &euro;4 billion in funding and the sanctioning of more than 450 new housing staff for local authorities. The funding of &euro;1.7 billion already provided for under Budgets 2015 and 2016 has supported the delivery of 13,000 social housing units in 2015 and is supporting the achievement of an ambitious target of 17,000 units in 2016. The 2015 output represents an increase of 86% on the circa 7,000 units delivered in 2014, as can be seen in my Department&rsquo;s 2015 Social Housing Report which I published on 26 January 2016 &ndash; available at the following link: <\/p><p>The funding available under the Strategy has facilitated substantial new social housing projects which I announced in May 2015, in July 2015 and in January 2016. These projects are in areas with a proven social housing need and we now have a strong pipeline of new social housing construction, acquisition and turnkey approvals in place. It is important that all social housing construction that has been sanctioned is implemented in line with my Department&rsquo;s guidelines, Quality Housing for Sustainable<i><\/i>Communities. Those Guidelines state that site selection for social housing and the size of developments relative to other housing in an area are important to the future development of self-sustaining communities. <\/p><p>Between the three major announcements on new social housing projects that I have made, almost &euro;680 million has been allocated for over 3,900 social housing new builds and acquisitions. It is these projects that will form the vast majority of the social housing units to be constructed between now and 2018. All of these projects are now being advanced by the relevant local authorities. In some cases, they will need to proceed through the local authority planning process under Part VIII of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001, as amended. This and other factors can have an impact on the timeline for the advancement of construction projects. Details of these approvals are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following links:<\/p><p>Delivery of new social housing is also being advanced via my Department&rsquo;s Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme (SHCEP). This is funding both local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) to expand their social housing stock by leasing new units directly from private owners and developers for social housing use. The programme also allows for the long-term leasing of units secured by AHBs through acquisition and construction.<\/p><p>The Capital Advance Leasing Facility (CALF) assists AHBs in accessing private or Housing Finance Agency (HFA) finance for the purchase, construction or refurbishment of units for social housing purposes. Amendments were made to the scheme recently to further facilitate a shift in investment by AHBs towards construction and acquisition of new builds. Effective from 1 January 2016, AHBs can drawdown approved CALF funds at an earlier stage in a project&rsquo;s completion. This accelerated drawdown provides working capital to the AHB and delays the drawdown of more expensive bridging finance, in the early stages of construction projects. In addition, a mechanism is also being introduced that will allow for the agreement of two-year multi-annual CALF funding programmes with AHBs. The objective is to provide more certainty to AHBs with regard to their funding requirements. This initiative will operate on a pilot basis with five AHBs in 2016 with the objective of broadening the initiative in 2017.<\/p><p>While construction activity is ramping up, local authorities are using other approaches to deliver new social housing units in the more immediate term, including acquiring properties - with over 1,000 new social housing units acquired through that approach in 2015 alone - and working with developers to build and acquire new Turnkey developments. The Rapid Build Housing Programme will also provide solutions, in the shortest possible time-frame, to support families who find themselves in emergency accommodation. The houses in question are high quality, A-rated homes, which, if delivered on a sufficient scale, offer real hope for people in the immediate term.<\/p><p>Overall, through the range of actions that have been implemented under the Social Housing Strategy and the funding provision that has been made, local authorities have been empowered to deliver social housing in the areas of highest demand, consistent with the important, long-term objective of developing and supporting sustainable communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016041400095#WRBBB02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1349"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Housing Funding","counter":2301,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016041400095#WRBBB02450"},{"type":"question","counter":2302,"qnumday":788,"qnumall":"[6902\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016041400095#WRBBB02500","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the monetary limits to be spent on refurbishing local authority units; the reason these limits are set; the number of voids that have not been upgraded due to these limits; the length of time they have been empty; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1349"},{"type":"speech","counter":2303,"content":"<p>Dealing with vacancies that occur within existing social housing stock is a normal part of the management function of local authorities. My Department places no monetary limits on what a local authority spends on refurbishing such units. However, in 2014 my Department recognised that a backlog of such units had built up over several years and, accordingly, introduced a funding programme to support the efforts that local authorities make through their own resources in this regard. The programme is co-funded by the exchequer and the EU Structural and Investment Funds 2014-2020. This programme provides support to local authorities for a range of remediation works, including insulation, heating works, window\/door replacement, kitchen installation, electrical and plumbing, painting and gutters\/waste services. In the case of each property, the amount funded to local authorities depends on the works they undertake and that varies in every case. As the funding from my Department is a support to local authorities in carrying out their work on stock maintenance and re-letting vacant units, it is open to local authorities to carry out additional works if they so decide. The funding from my Department and the EU in these cases is at a combined, overall total of &euro;30,000 per social housing unit. In the two years since this funding programme was introduced, over 5,000 units have been supported nationally and returned to use at a cost of some &euro;60 million.<\/p>  <p>  To complement the funding under the programme for vacant units, my Department has also initiated a new programme to support local authorities dealing with social housing units that are in need of a greater level of remediation and that are, in some cases, derelict properties. The ongoing maintenance of social housing carried out by local authorities means that there will not be high numbers of such units, but where such properties are repairable and lettable, local authorities will be supported to remediate them with exchequer allocations which will be made shortly.<\/p>  <p>  Feedback from local authorities in respect of the programme to support the return of vacant units is that the funding made available since 2014 has provided valuable assistance in dealing with such units and that significant progress has been made in tackling the backlog. In the same vein, the programme to tackle more derelict units will also provide key support for local authorities to maximise the use of their stock for those on the waiting list and I am confident, therefore, that social housing units that are lettable and repairable are not restricted from being returned to use by virtue of the range of supports my Department provides.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016041400095#WRBBB02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1349"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Assistance Payments Administration","counter":2304,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016041400095#WRBBB02650"},{"type":"question","counter":2305,"qnumday":789,"qnumall":"[6903\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016041400095#WRBBB02700","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the uptake of the housing assistance payment across the local authorities; the reason local authorities are not taking the initiative in sourcing housing assistance payment residential units but, instead, vulnerable prospective tenants are attempting to source landlords for the housing assistance payment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1349"},{"type":"speech","counter":2306,"content":"<p>The Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) is a major pillar of the Social Housing Strategy 2020.

The Act also provides that responsibility for the independent economic regulation of the water sector is assigned to the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and the CER has been given statutory responsibility for protecting the interests of customers.  <\/p><p>Section 3 of the Water Services Act 2014 provides that where a dwelling in receipt of services from Irish Water is unoccupied that the dwelling shall be liable to a charge of not more than &euro;260 for<b><\/b>receipt of both water and wastewater services, i.e. the supply of water to a dwelling and the removal of wastewater from it.  The Water Charges Plan approved by the CER sets the minimum<b><\/b>rate at &euro;125 per annum and the maximum rate at &euro;260 per annum<b><\/b>for both water and waste water services where a not permanently occupied dwelling has been registered with Irish Water.  A lower minimum<b><\/b>charge of &euro;62.50 andmaximum charge of &euro;125<b><\/b>applies if the dwelling is in receipt of a single service.<\/p><p>The use of capped charges rather than a flat charge supports water conservation as metered users of water services can beat the capped charge through efficient use of water.  In the case of not permanently occupied dwellings, metered users through conservation measures can ensure that their annual charge does not exceed the minimum charge of &euro;125 for both water and wastewater services.  More generally, it is estimated that over 40% of metered households are currently beating the relevant capped charge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016041400096#WRCCC01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1349"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Housing Funding","counter":2321,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016041400096#WRCCC01100"},{"type":"question","counter":2322,"qnumday":796,"qnumall":"[6994\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016041400096#WRCCC01200","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the funds he has allocated to Kilkenny County Council and Carlow County Council for purchasing houses for those on the housing list and for families with special needs; if he is satisfied with the progress being made in each county; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1248","askee":"1349"},{"type":"speech","counter":2323,"content":"<p>In April last year, I announced over &euro;1.5 billion in funding allocations in respect of social housing to be provided by all local authorities via a combination of building, buying and leasing schemes.

A number of specific measures have been, and will continue to be, introduced to reduce the amount of waste generated in the State and to increase the segregation of waste which cannot be prevented, in line with Government policy.  The introduction of pay-by-weight (PBW) charges for the collection of household waste is one such measure.  <\/p>  <p>  From 1 July 2016 , collectors of household waste are required to apply PBW charges for the collection of the recyclate, food waste and residual bins.  Requiring that a &lsquo;visible&rsquo; charge is applied to the three bins removes the &lsquo;hidden&rsquo; charge for collecting recyclate which is often concealed in other fees.  There is a net cost associated with collecting and managing mixed dry recyclate.  Waste operators do not currently collect recyclate &lsquo;for free&rsquo; as such; some already charge on a per- lift or PBW basis, while other companies include the cost of collecting the recyclate bin in their charges for collecting the residual bin or as part of a flat fee or service fee.  The introduction of PBW for the 3 bins will remove waste companies&rsquo; ability to conceal the charge of managing recyclate and incentivise the householder to reduce waste, including recyclable waste. <\/p>  <p>  The Waste Management (Collection Permit) (Amendment) Regulations 2016 also require that the PBW charges reflect the waste hierarchy in terms of incentivising the use of the recyclate and food waste bins over the residual bin.   Under the new charging system, the per kilogramme charges for recyclate and food waste must be lower than the &lsquo;per kilogramme&rsquo; charge for residual waste.  The Regulations further require that a minimum price per kilogramme be charged for the collection of each waste stream, so as to cover the cost of managing the waste after it has been collected and brought back to a facility.  The minimum costs to be charged for collecting household waste are: recyclate 2 cent; food waste 6 cent; and residual waste 11 cent per kilogramme, to ensure that the polluter pays principle applies, in that at least the cost of treating the waste is being charged.  A service fee may also be applied by an operator.   <\/p>  <p>  The PBW charging mechanism gives households more control over their waste costs.  However, it is important that all households prevent waste where possible and ensure that they correctly use the food waste and recycling bins to minimise costs.  The less waste you generate and the more you recycle, the less you will pay under PBW: an awareness and education campaign will be rolled out shortly which will assist householders in this regard.   <\/p>  <p>  It is also important to note that waste management costs may vary over time due to market factors such as fluctuations in labour, fuel, treatment or export costs, regardless of the charging mechanism used to collect waste.  However, as set out above, under PBW, householders will now have more control over their costs and will have an opportunity and incentive to minimise such costs. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016041400096#WRCCC01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1349"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Wind Energy Guidelines","counter":2327,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016041400096#WRCCC01700"},{"type":"question","counter":2328,"qnumday":798,"qnumall":"[7016\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016041400096#WRCCC01800","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the actions he has taken since his Department sought submissions on the review of the wind energy guidelines; when these submissions will be assessed; and when he will publish the new wind energy guidelines.","asker":"1250","askee":"1349"},{"type":"question","counter":2329,"qnumday":811,"qnumall":"[7113\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016041400096#WRCCC01900","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"about the current stage regarding the provision of guidelines on wind turbines; if the reason for delay of the provision is a case of a policy decision; if not, whether further background work is to be completed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1225","askee":"1349"},{"type":"speech","counter":2330,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 798 and 811 together.<\/p><p>In December 2013, my Department published proposed &ldquo;draft&rdquo; revisions to the noise, setback distance and shadow flicker aspects of the 2006 Wind<b><\/b>Energy Development Guidelines. <\/p><p>These draft revisions proposed:<\/p><p>- the setting of a more stringent day and night noise limit of 40 decibels for future wind energy developments,<\/p><p>- a mandatory minimum setback distance of 500 metres between a wind turbine and the nearest dwelling for amenity considerations, and<\/p><p>- the complete elimination of shadow flicker between wind turbines and neighbouring dwellings. <\/p><p>A public consultation process was initiated on these proposed draft revisions to the Guidelines, which ran until 21 February 2014.

This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investments and a State led intervention in areas where commercial services will not be provided.<\/p><p>The commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2 billion in network upgrades and enhanced services in the last four years, and is continuing to invest. These very significant investments represent a step change in the quality of broadband services available. <\/p><p>On 22 December 2015, I formally launched the procurement process for the State intervention to provide high quality, high speed broadband to all premises in Ireland that may not be served through commercial investment.  The formal procurement process commenced with the publication of the Pre-qualification Questionnaire and Project Information Memorandum.  Five responses were received from prospective bidders to this stage of the competitive procurement process by the deadline of 31 March. The responses are now being assessed in line with criteria set down by the Department with a view to selecting qualified provider(s) to proceed to the next stage of the procurement.This second stage in\u00a0 process will be a formal Invitation to Participate in Dialogue (ITPD) to shortlisted\u00a0 bidders. <\/p><p>The High Speed Broadband Map 2020, which is available at shows the extent of the State Intervention area.

The Map shows that there are currently 20,536 premises in the AMBER area in Kildare,\u00a0\u00a0representing 23% of the total of premises in Kildare. The remaining 77% of premises are in the BLUE area and are expected to be served by commercial operators. <\/p><p>The intention is to build out the network in the AMBER area as quickly as possible.

Some community projects used a small proportion of this funding to purchase equipment to facilitate digital skills training.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016041400098#WREEE02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","counter":2423,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016041400099#WRFFF00200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Roads Maintenance","counter":2422,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016041400099#WRFFF00150"},{"type":"question","counter":2423,"qnumday":835,"qnumall":"[6330\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016041400099#WRFFF00200","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the schemes or options for funding available at local government and Department level to commence urgently needed repair works at a location (details supplied) in County Kilkenny; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1368","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":2424,"content":"<p>The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads in Kilkenny\u00a0is the statutory responsibility of Kilkenny County Council, in accordance with the provisions of Section 13 of the Roads Act 1993.
