The Public Service Reform Plan, published in November 2011, provides for the development of a new policy framework for procurement. This work is now being led by the newly appointed Chief Procurement Officer, Paul Quinn. Under his leadership a new national procurement office for the public sector is being established. Paul is currently working with officials across the public sector to put in place new sectoral and centralised procurement arrangements.<\/p><p>  My colleague Minister Howlin has highlighted the importance of ensuring that the public sector is achieving maximum value for money and operational efficiency in its approach to public procurement. Centralising the procurement of commonly used goods and services can deliver significant benefits which include: cash savings; administrative savings from reduced duplication of tendering; greater purchasing expertise; improved consistency and enhanced service levels.  In addition, given the financial constraints within which we must all now work, cost reductions and savings can go some way to helping Exchequer funded bodies, such as schools, manage within reducing financial budgets. <\/p><p>  The Deputies may be aware that the National Procurement Service (NPS) is supporting Small and Medium Business Enterprises (SMEs) to participate in public sector procurement competitions through its education and guidance strategies. All of the NPS tender documents explicitly seek to encourage the participation of SMEs in competitions, by encouraging them to explore the possibilities of forming relationships with other SMEs or with larger enterprises.<\/p><p>  I understand that Irish SMEs have been successful in winning NPS frameworks and about three quarters of existing NPS contracts\/frameworks are held by SMEs. These SMEs may, in turn, source many of their services and products from local manufacturers and agents.  However, I do appreciate the concerns being raised by small school supply companies and I have asked relevant officials here in the Department, who are coordinating procurement reform in the Education and Training sector, to take these concerns into consideration in the context of the work being undertaken on procurement reform. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700065#WRE01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":70,"content":"<p>Question No. 29 answered with Question No. 16.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects Applications","counter":71,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700065#WRE01275"},{"type":"question","counter":72,"qnumday":30,"qnumall":"[17448\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700065#WRE01300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if changes to the school building programmme will be made based on exceptional circumstances of accommodation needs of schools which were not fully evident at the time of publication of the programmme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1058","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":73,"content":"<p>As the Deputy may be aware, it was anticipated in the announcement of the five year construction programme in March last year that adjustments might be made in relation to the scheduling of projects included in the programme on a year to year basis within the lifetime of the Plan.

It provides a direct entry access route to further and higher education and the labour market.  This is no longer true of the Junior Certificate for the vast majority of students.  Just as we reached a point in 1967, where there was no longer a need for a state examined Primary Certificate, I believe we have now reached that point in relation to the Junior Certificate.<\/p><p>  The abolition of the Primary Certificate did not change primary school teachers from advocates for their students to judges of them.  It removed a narrow external assessment, and paved the way for the introduction of a child-centred curriculum for pupils.  The Framework will create interested, independent learners who will be better prepared to meet the challenges of life beyond school.  I believe these reforms will enable the educational system to deliver a junior cycle that places the needs of students at the core of quality learning, teaching and assessment.<\/p><p>   Extensive quality assurance measures are being built into the new Junior Cycle.  These include subject specifications with clear learning outcomes; a comprehensive professional development programme for teachers, principals and deputy principals in, inter alia, educational assessment, including processes of moderation; the introduction of standarised tests for all schools and students in English reading, Mathematics and Science and in Irish reading for Irish-medium schools; and the development of an assessment and moderation toolkit.<\/p><p>  Assessment for learning will have a key role and will enhance learning throughout the 3 years of Junior Cycle.  It will be complemented by the 2 components of assessment of learning.  There will be the school work component which will be based on work undertaken by students in their 2nd and 3rd years and there will also be a final assessment component at the end of 3rd year.  There will be a school report.  The report will include a School Certificate of results in 8 to 10 subjects or their equivalents.  The report will also include a student profile which will reflect their other learning experiences.  Subjects and short courses with their new modes of assessment are being introduced on a phased basis from September 2014 so that capacity in the system can be built up incrementally.<\/p><p>  Additional quality assurance measures in relation to assessment of learning at end of junior cycle include the following:<\/p><p>- The State Examinations Commission (SEC) will provide final assessment papers and marking schemes for subjects until the new school-based system of assessment is fully established;<\/p><p>- For English, Irish and Mathematics, the SEC will initially mark these papers.

In line with this approach the policy is to promote a child-centred approach to education of all children with special educational needs including those with autism.

Some children are capable of being fully integrated into mainstream schools without additional teaching or care supports.  Others are able to attend mainstream schools but need additional teaching and\/or care assistance.  Many are best enrolled in autism-specific classes where more intensive and supportive interventions are required.  Some may move from one setting to another as they get older and differing needs\/strengths\/abilities emerge.<\/p><p>  The preferred policy of my Department is that children with autism are educated in school settings where children may have access to individualised education programmes, fully-qualified professional teachers, special needs assistants, the appropriate school curriculum with the option, where possible and appropriate, of full or partial integration and interaction with other pupils.<\/p><p>  Autism classes are established with a staffing ratio of 1 teacher and a minimum of 2 Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) for every 6 children.  Other SNAs may be allocated if required to meet the care needs of the children.  Start-up grants are provided to the schools to enable special equipment to be purchased.  Enhanced capitation is paid in respect of each child and assistive technology is funded where this is recommended.<\/p><p>  This approach promotes the maximum level of inclusion which accords with the intent of the EPSEN Act.  While some children may be able to attend a mainstream class, for others the most appropriate provision may be in a special class or unit in the school or in a special school.<\/p><p>  My Department supports provision in mainstream schools, some 540 special classes for autism attached to mainstream and special schools and 18 special schools for children with autism throughout the State which cater for the educational needs of some 5,000 children with autism, all of which operate within the policy parameters.

However, my proposals do go further in relation to assessment &ndash; and the move away from a terminal exam to school based assessment. <\/p><p>  Evidence has repeatedly shown that \"unless the examination changes, nothing else will.\" Ireland is an outlier in international terms in having externally set, moderated and marked examinations at the end of lower secondary school. As some 90% of students now complete senior cycle, the Junior Certificate is no longer a high stakes examination for the overwhelming majority of students; treating it as such has been shown to have an unintended negative backwash effect on teaching, learning and assessment in the classroom. <\/p><p>  The Leaving Certificate is a high stakes examination. It provides a direct entry access route to further and higher education and the labour market. This is no longer true of the Junior Certificate for the vast majority of students. Just as we reached a point in 1967, where there was no longer a need for a State examined Primary Certificate, I believe we have now reached that point in relation to the Junior Certificate.<\/p><p>  The abolition of the Primary Certificate did not change primary school teachers from advocates for their students to judges of them. It removed a narrow external assessment, and paved the way for the introduction of a child-centred curriculum for pupils. The Framework will create interested, independent learners who will be better prepared to meet the challenges of life beyond school. I believe these reforms will enable the educational system to deliver a junior cycle that places the needs of students at the core of quality learning, teaching and assessment.<\/p><p>   I can assure the Deputy that funding has been ring-fenced for the implementation of the new Junior Cycle. The combined costs of curriculum and CPD support in a full year will be of the order of &euro;10 million. A Junior Cycle Support Service will be established under the directorship of Dr. P&aacute;draig Kirk, currently CEO of Co. Louth VEC.<\/p><p>  In addition the ASTI and the TUI are represented on the Council of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment and on its Subject Development Groups. At these meetings the future shape of the curriculum is considered and their findings are presented to the Minister. <\/p><p>   Extensive quality assurance measures are being built into the new Junior Cycle. These include subject specifications with clear learning outcomes; a comprehensive professional development programme for teachers, principals and deputy principals in, inter alia, educational assessment, including processes of moderation; the introduction of standarised tests for all schools and students in English reading, Mathematics and Science and in Irish reading for Irish-medium schools; and the development of an assessment and moderation toolkit.<\/p><p>  Assessment for learning will have a key role and will enhance learning throughout the 3 years of Junior Cycle. It will be complemented by the 2 components of assessment of learning. There will be the school work component which will be based on work undertaken by students in their 2nd and 3rd years and there will also be a final assessment component at the end of 3rd year. There will be a school report available the autumn after completion of the three years. The report will include a School Certificate of results in 8 to 10 subjects or their equivalents. The report will also include a student profile which will reflect their other learning experiences. Subjects and short courses with their new modes of assessment are being introduced on a phased basis from September 2014 so that capacity in the system can be built up incrementally.<\/p><p>   Additional quality assurance measures in relation to assessment of learning at end of junior cycle include the following:<\/p><p> - The State Examinations Commission (SEC) will provide final assessment papers and marking schemes for subjects until the new school-based system of assessment is fully established<\/p><p>- For English, Irish and Mathematics, the SEC will initially mark these papers. This arrangement will continue until standardised testing becomes established in junior cycle<\/p><p> - For the school work component, schools will undertake internal moderation in accordance with the guidelines on moderation for Junior Cycle assessment. This will be formally confirmed by the principal<\/p><p> - The results awarded on every School Certificate of Learning will be sent to the Department. The Department will monitor the national and school patterns along with the results in the standardised testing of reading, Mathematics and Science. This monitoring will provide further quality assurance and identify any local or national anomalies. A report on overall trends will be published regularly. In the event of an unusual pattern of achievement, the Inspectorate of the Department will be advised, and support and evaluation measures will be provided for the school. <\/p><p>  In addition, national monitoring of standards will be complemented by continued participation in national and international assessments. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700069#WRJ00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"F&Aacute;S Training Courses","counter":154,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700069#WRJ00450"},{"type":"question","counter":155,"qnumday":61,"qnumall":"[17565\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700069#WRJ00500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the reason that he decided not to allocate those participating in CPL Momentum Courses, which are being administered by F&Aacute;S, the training, travel and lunch allowances normally allocated to those on a F&Aacute;S course.","asker":"969","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":156,"content":"<p>The awarding of travel allowances to participants on the Momentum Programme was discussed between the relevant Government Departments when the Programme was being designed last year. <\/p><p>  In the design of the scheme, consideration was given to the question of additional payments but in the current difficult economic circumstances, it was decided that no additional payments, other than the retention of social welfare benefits, was warranted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700069#WRJ00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1042"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Further Education and Training Programmes Funding","counter":157,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700069#WRJ00650"},{"type":"question","counter":158,"qnumday":62,"qnumall":"[17582\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700069#WRJ00700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"his plans for the development of the further education sector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1001","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":159,"content":"<p>SOLAS, the new education and training authority, is being established as a funding and oversight body under the aegis of my Department to ensure the provision of 21st century high-quality further education and training programmes to learners.

This is one of the few exemptions from the LPT.  Limiting the number of exemptions keeps the rate of the tax low for those who are liable to it.  Based on the information provided by the Deputy it appears that the individual would not qualify for this exemption.<\/p><p>  While exemption cannot be claimed under section 10B of the Act, an incapacitated person may qualify for a reduction in the market value of their property under section 15A of the 2012 Act.  This section provides for a reduction in the market value of a residential property that has been adapted for occupation by a disabled person where the adaptation has been grant-aided or approved for grant aid, by a local authority.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that this relief only applies where the adaptation work increases the market value of the property.  Furthermore, the person with the disability must occupy the property as his or her sole or main residence after the adaptation is completed.  The reduction in value is limited to the lesser of the chargeable value attributable to the adaptation work carried out on the property and the maximum grant payable under the relevant local authority scheme.  The relief ends on the sale or transfer of a property that has been adapted, unless the person with the disability continues to reside in the property.  <\/p><p>  Given the Budget constraints that exist, and in order to be in a position to keep the rate of tax as low as possible, I decided that an upper limit would be imposed on the reduction in the chargeable value that is allowed.  This means that where the chargeable value attributable to the adaptation work carried out on the property exceeds the maximum grant payable under the relevant local authority scheme, the reduction in the chargeable value will be capped at the maximum grant payable.  <\/p><p>  This relief is linked to the grant scheme for such adaptations that is administered by the local authorities so that there would be some independent verification of the necessity to have particular adaptations carried out.  The additional value that is attributable to adaptations carried out to a property can only be deducted from the overall chargeable value where a grant towards the cost of the adaptation has been made by a local authority.  This effectively means that tax relief for local property tax purposes is determined by decisions that have been made by a local authority about whether a person with a disability requires the property in which he or she resides to be adapted to cater for the particular disability.  Therefore, the Revenue Commissioners will not be required to make such decisions. <\/p><p>  Provisions are also made for deferral of LPT for individuals whose income is under certain limits.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700071#WRL01000","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Liquor Licence Applications","counter":209,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700071#WRL01050"},{"type":"question","counter":210,"qnumday":82,"qnumall":"[17751\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700071#WRL01100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 84 of 6 March 2013, if he will clarify that the Revenue Commissioners did in fact issue an intoxicating liquor licence on foot of a draft court order only without sight of the final signed court order; the way the Revenue Commissioners came to issue a liquor licence on the basis of a draft document; if the investigation of this illegality was undertaken; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1070","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":211,"content":"<p>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the procedure following the grant of a Licence by Court Order is for the Licensee to obtain a Court Certificate from the Court Office.

Where AVCs are subject to a pension adjustment order, both parties to the order may exercise the option independently in respect of their respective &ldquo;share&rdquo; of the AVCs.   <\/p><p>  The procedures set out in the legislation for exercising the AVC access option are straight forward and I have outlined these hereunder. However, in addition to these procedures, I am aware from discussions which my Department and the Revenue Commissioners have had with various pension industry representative bodies, that the administrators of AVC funds will also be putting administrative procedures and systems in place to facilitate the access option at an operational level. I understand that these administrative and systems procedures are in the process of being finalised. <\/p><p>  The likelihood is, of course, that an individual contemplating availing of the option will firstly contact his pension fund administrator by phone or email to establish what he or she needs to do. In that regard, the legislation requires the individual to give an irrevocable written instruction to the administrator of the fund that he or she wishes to avail of the option. Provided the individual qualifies for the encashment option, the administrator acts on the instruction by determining the value of the AVC fund and paying an amount, not exceeding 30% of the value, to the individual subject to deduction of the appropriate amount of tax. The amount paid is treated as emoluments to which Schedule E applies and tax is collected at source under the PAYE system. The legislation requires the administrator to deduct tax at the higher rate of 41%, unless the administrator has received from Revenue a tax credit certificate in respect of the individual. The payments are specifically exempt from USC and PRSI.<\/p><p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, in advance of any payment of AVCs being made, the individual exercising the option should contact his or her Revenue Office for a Certificate of Tax Credits and Standard Rate Cut-off point in respect of the AVC payment. It may be the case that the pension fund administrator will contact Revenue on behalf of the individual, but where the individual is applying directly to Revenue he or she would need to advise Revenue of the pension fund administrator's registered number (i.e. employer number) so that Revenue can forward the Certificate to the correct administrator. The Certificate will indicate the Standard Rate Cut-off Point and tax credits, if any, appropriate to the AVC access payment and facilitate the deduction of the correct amount of tax by the administrator. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700071#WRL01600","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Property Taxation Exemptions","counter":218,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700071#WRL01650"},{"type":"question","counter":219,"qnumday":85,"qnumall":"[17754\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700071#WRL01700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the basis on which owners of properties with pyrite will be asked to verify the presence of pyrite in order to qualify for an exemption of the local property tax; the prevalence thresholds of pyrite that will apply in order to qualify; if all residents of for example an apartment block will be asked for separate verification if the prevalence of pyrite is proved in common areas in such a development; the action that he is taking to ensure that in meeting the verification criteria that costs and administrative burdens to property owners are minimised.","asker":"1178","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":220,"content":"<p>Section 10A of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) provides for a temporary exemption of at least three consecutive years from the charge to  Local Property Tax (LPT) for residential properties that have been certified as having &ldquo;significant pyritic damage&rdquo;.<\/p><p>  The methodology for the assessment of dwellings to establish significant pyritic damage will be prescribed in regulations to be made by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.

In September the European Commission presented legislative proposals for a single supervisory mechanism (SSM) conferring powers on the ECB for the supervision of all banks in the euro area, with a mechanism for non-euro countries to join on a voluntary basis.  The SSM is a key element of the Banking Union along with a common resolution framework and national deposit guarantee schemes.  The Member States have reaffirmed their commitment to the urgent completion of all elements of Banking Union as set out by the European Council.<\/p><p>  The Banking Union package is a priority of the Irish Presidency of the EU Council. An important step to a European Banking Union to break the link between sovereigns and banks was agreed by Ecofin Ministers in Dublin last week when they reached agreement on the creation of the Single Supervisory Mechanism.  This is a major step towards ensuring financial stability, and thus facilitating growth.  Earlier in 2013 the Irish Presidency concluded negotiations with the European Parliament to finalise the Capital Requirements Directive IV which is another essential element of the Banking Union programme.  Another important element of the Banking Union package is the development of an operational framework for the direct recapitalisation of banks by the ESM which should include the definition of legacy assets.  A Task Force of Member States has been meeting regularly since October 2012 and it expected that the ESM instrument guidelines will be finalised by end June.<\/p><p>  The Commission&rsquo;s proposal for a common resolution framework mentioned above includes provision for resolution funds to be used for supporting orderly resolution of banks in distress.  It proposes that national resolution funds would interact, notably to provide funding for resolving cross-border banks.  The proposal also suggests giving national resolution funds a right to borrow from their counterparts in other Member States in the event that there are insufficient funds in their own resolution fund.  This right to borrow would be complemented with an obligation to lend to other funds within the Union.  Safeguards would be in place to ensure that no national fund would be obliged to lend in circumstances where it wold not have sufficient funds to finance a resolution in its own territory in the foreseeable future or where the loan required would exceed more than half of the available funds in the lending Member States resolution fund.  The Commission&rsquo;s proposal is currently being examined intensively at Council under the Irish Presidency.<\/p><p>  In the domestic area the Programme for Government included commitments to introduce a comprehensive special resolution regime for banks and a bank levy.  The Government has fulfilled these commitments through the Central Bank and Credit Institutions (Resolution) Act and the Resolution Fund established under it.  The Resolution Fund provides a source of funding for the resolution of financial instability in, or an imminent serious threat to the financial stability of, an authorised credit institution.  The levy contributions by credit institutions under Regulations made under the Act feed into the Resolution Fund.  The Resolution Fund will primarily be made up of contributions from credit institutions.  The overall objective is to minimise taxpayers&rsquo; exposure to future financial sector difficulties.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700072#WRM01000","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Banking Sector Staff Issues","counter":229,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700072#WRM01050"},{"type":"question","counter":230,"qnumday":88,"qnumall":"[17796\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700072#WRM01100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on correspondence (details supplied) from ordinary bank workers in response to the Mercer Report; if he will acknowledge the importance of separating the treatment of ordinary bank workers from senior executives; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1064","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":231,"content":"<p>When publishing the Review of Remuneration Practices and Frameworks at the Covered Institutions, on 12 March 2013, I indicated that the Government had formed the view that with the remaining covered institutions still incurring losses it was an inescapable conclusion that the cost base of the institutions needs to be reduced further.  This is essential if they are to return to profitability, be in a position to support the economy and repay the State&rsquo;s investment through a return to private ownership.  On behalf of the Government, I have now directed the banks to come up with plans as to how they intend to address this issue in a manner that can help meet the State&rsquo;s objectives.  I expect the value of those plans to mean a saving of 6% - 10% of total remuneration costs, through reductions in payroll and pension benefits, new working arrangements and structures that deliver efficiency gains.

This legislation provides for tax relief for health expenses incurred in the provision of health care.  Health care is defined for the purposes of that legislation as the prevention, diagnosis, alleviation or treatment of an ailment, injury, infirmity, defect or disability and includes care received by a woman in respect of pregnancy.  Health care does not include routine ophthalmic or dental treatment.  The section provides that tax relief must be either for the costs of the services of a practitioner, defined as a person registered on the register established under the Medical Practitioners Act 2007, or diagnostic procedures carried out on the advice of a practitioner, which includes &ldquo;physiotherapy or similar treatment prescribed by a practitioner&rdquo;.  Eligibility for tax relief is limited to expenses relating to treatment considered necessary and appropriate by a qualified practitioner.<\/p><p>  Section 469 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 consolidated all previous legislation pertaining to relief for health expenses, in particular section 12 of Finance Act 1967 which introduced the relief in the first instance.  This section also required that physiotherapy or similar treatment be prescribed by a practitioner before qualifying for relief.  This requirement has, therefore, been part of the qualifying criteria since the introduction of relief for health expenses and I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that guidance and instructions to staff have remained unchanged in this regard.<\/p><p>  For 2010 the cost of tax relief for health expenses was &euro;127 million and was availed of by 36,000 individuals who had sufficient income to benefit from a claim.  There is no specific breakdown in these figures of the costs related to physiotherapy.<\/p><p>  If self-referral for physiotherapy were allowed, an estimate of the additional cost would be unquantifiable, but, undoubtedly, it would increase the overall cost of health expenses relief to the Exchequer.  While the Government supports measures to lower the cost of medical treatment which should in turn lower the costs of health care provision by the State, an extension of the relief along the lines proposed would inevitably lead to calls for other treatments to similarly qualify for relief, which would greatly increase the overall cost of the scheme.<\/p><p>  I would point out that this issue was raised during the debates in the Seanad on Finance Bill 2013 during which I agreed to re-examine the matter during the course of this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700072#WRM01700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Property Taxation Collection","counter":239,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700072#WRM01750"},{"type":"question","counter":240,"qnumday":92,"qnumall":"[17875\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700072#WRM01800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if consideration has been given to a matter (details supplied) in respect of the local property tax; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1027","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":241,"content":"<p>The requirement for owners of multiple properties to file and pay their Local Property Tax (LPT) electronically is contained in section 44 of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended).

It provides a direct entry access route to further and higher education and the labour market.  This is no longer true of the Junior Certificate for the vast majority of students.  Just as we reached a point in 1967, where there was no longer a need for a state examined Primary Certificate, I believe we have now reached that point in relation to the Junior Certificate.  The abolition of the Primary Certificate did not change primary school teachers from advocates for their students to judges of them.  It removed a narrow external assessment, and paved the way for the introduction of a child-centred curriculum for pupils.  The Framework will create interested, independent learners who will be better prepared to meet the challenges of life beyond school.  I believe these reforms will enable the educational system to deliver a junior cycle that places the needs of students at the core of quality learning, teaching and assessment.<\/p><p>  Extensive quality assurance measures are being built into the new Junior Cycle.  These include subject specifications with clear learning outcomes; a comprehensive professional development programme for teachers, principals and deputy principals in, inter alia, educational assessment, including processes of moderation; the introduction of standarised tests for all schools and students in English reading, Mathematics and Science and in Irish reading for Irish-medium schools; and the development of an assessment and moderation toolkit.  Assessment for learning will have a key role and will enhance learning throughout the three years of Junior Cycle.  It will be complemented by the two components of assessment of learning.  There will be the school work component which will be based on work undertaken by students in their second and third years and there will also be a final assessment component at the end of third year.  There will be a school report.  The report will include a School Certificate of results in eight to ten subjects or their equivalents.  The report will also include a student profile which will reflect their other learning experiences.<\/p><p>  Subjects and short courses with their new modes of assessment are being introduced on a phased basis from September 2014 so that capacity in the system can be built up incrementally.  Additional quality assurance measures in relation to assessment of learning at end of junior cycle, to maximise impartiality, include the following:<\/p><p>- The State Examinations Commission (SEC) will provide final assessment papers and marking schemes for subjects until the new school-based system of assessment is fully established<\/p><p>- For English, Irish and Mathematics, the SEC will initially mark these papers. This arrangement will continue until standardised testing becomes established in junior cycle<\/p><p>- For the school work component, schools will undertake internal moderation in accordance with the guidelines on moderation for Junior Cycle assessment which will be formally confirmed by the principal<\/p><p>- The results awarded on every School Certificate of Learning will be sent to the Department.<\/p><p>  The Department will monitor the national and school patterns along with the results in the standardised testing of reading, Mathematics and Science.

These Guidelines provide practical advice to primary and post-primary schools on how rental schemes can be established and operated.  The aim of the Guidelines is to help as many schools as possible to start such book rental programmes.  The publication of these Guidelines follows a survey of schools by the Department.  This had a 99% response rate at primary level, and showed that 76% of primary schools operate a book rental scheme.  At second level, the response rate was lower, at 44%.  Of those which did respond, 88% of those in the VEC sector and 73% of those in the Community and Comprehensive sector operated a book rental scheme.  I believe these results show that we have a good foundation to build on across the country.  I hope that schools that are not yet operating book rental schemes will be encouraged to use the Guidelines to introduce them.  If they do, it will result in substantial savings for parents.<\/p><p>  Schools which already have rental schemes can save parents up to 80% of the cost of buying new books.  A special &quot;Guide for Parents&quot; was also published, to inform them of how the schemes operate and how parents can help schools to establish and run them.  I have been very clear in my support for book rental schemes.  All of us who are parents know how expensive textbooks can be and what a burden it places on already hard pressed families at the start of every school year.  I am pleased to see the high level of book rental schemes in operation at primary level and I believe that these Guidelines will encourage this practice across all schools in our education landscape.  I also published a Report on Textbook Rental Schemes in Schools and the Allocation of Textbook Grants by the Department of Education and Skills in May 2012.  This report presented four policy options to encourage schools to establish textbook rental schemes.  None of the options are ideal, each one involves a trade-off of advantages and disadvantages.  I will continue to monitor the number of schools operating book rental schemes, and if it proves necessary consider further steps to encourage schools to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700073#WRN01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":266,"content":"<p>Question No. 101 answered with Question No. 46.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Educational Disadvantage","counter":267,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700073#WRN01350"},{"type":"question","counter":268,"qnumday":102,"qnumall":"[17886\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700073#WRN01400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the steps he intends to take to address the increasing numbers of disadvantaged children within the education system in view of the reduction in funding to support such children; the psychological supports being provided to children from grossly indebted families; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1177","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":269,"content":"<p>Evidence has shown that disadvantage associated with poverty and social exclusion assumes a multiplier effect where the levels are highly concentrated in schools.  DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) the Action Plan for Educational Inclusion remains my Department's policy instrument to address educational disadvantage which focuses on addressing and prioritising the educational needs of children and young people from disadvantaged communities, from pre-school through second-level education.  It is important to note that over 50% of disadvantaged students do not attend DEIS schools.  Therefore while the majority of schools include, among their pupils, children with disadvantaged backgrounds, in general most schools address the individual needs of these children without recourse to additional targeted resources.<\/p><p>  A key focus of the Government's education policy is to prioritise investment in favour of those most at risk and to optimise access, participation and outcomes at every level of the system for disadvantaged groups.  Therefore it is my intention that the additional resources available to DEIS schools are utilised to optimum benefit to achieve identified outcomes for the most at risk pupils.  All primary and post- primary schools have access to psychological assessments either directly through the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) or through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA).  Schools that do not currently have NEPS psychologists assigned to them may avail of the SCPA, whereby the school can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.  NEPS psychologists are assigned schools based on a weighting process which takes into account school size, DEIS status, gender mix and geographical spread.  DEIS schools are both afforded a priority in the assigning of a NEPS psychologist and a premium in time allocated by the psychologist to the school over non-DEIS schools.<\/p><p>  It is also important to note that poverty is one of wide range of issues which impacts on the learning capacity of pupils and in respect of which interventions are made by a number of Government Departments and agencies.

The ability of the investor to source the very best quality people, with appropriate levels of training and experience, is a prime consideration and a real location differentiator.  Attracting skilled Irish emigrants back to Ireland is an important component in creating this skill base.

This report recommended increasing the flexibility of the existing jobseeker schemes by moving from the current days based system to a system of entitlement based on hours.<\/p><p>  However, increasing flexibility in the system could potentially, depending on the behavioural response, increase the number of people claiming a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment thereby increasing the total cost of the schemes to the Exchequer. <\/p><p>  Other issues which are under active consideration are, aligning the jobseeker&rsquo;s week to the calendar week and compensating for the loss of employment only or stated availability, whichever is the lesser.<\/p><p>  This work is complex and is taking place in the context of other social welfare reforms including the recognition of Sunday working for jobseekers, the current economic situation, and the considerable administrative change that implementation of reform to the jobseeker&rsquo;s schemes will require.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700078#WRS00800","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pensions Legislation","counter":382,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700078#WRS00850"},{"type":"question","counter":383,"qnumday":145,"qnumall":"[17927\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700078#WRS00900","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the action that she has taken to amend the law governing pensions to provide a more equitable outcome form members of defined benefit schemes who have contributed to a fund that is now in deficit but will mean ongoing contributions do not receive a fair share of the fund; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1033","askee":"946"},{"type":"question","counter":384,"qnumday":147,"qnumall":"[17929\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700078#WRS01000","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if the changes to the defined benefit pension schemes has been implemented (details supplied); if not, when she plans to bring in such changes; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1033","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":385,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 145 and 147 together.<\/p><p>  As you are aware, there are significant structural and affordability problems with DB schemes due to a range of factors such as an underestimation of longevity, poor investment decisions and the impact of the downturn in financial markets.<\/p><p>  A range of both administrative and legislative measures have been put in place since 2008 to assist trustees and employers respond to the impact that the downturn in financial market has had on the funding of defined benefit pension schemes.

Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth.<\/p><p>In addition to promoting economic recovery, the Government recognises the need for interim measures to support the unemployed and keep jobseekers close to the labour market. These actions range across a number of Departments and Agencies. Given the scale of the unemployment crisis, the key objective of labour market policy is to keep those on the Live Register close to the labour market and prevent the drift into long-term unemployment. Persons from the Live Register availing of activation measures will get an opportunity to engage in employment, training and work experience and so be in a position to avail of employment opportunities as the economy improves. As such, the policy objective is to prioritise scarce resources on those on the Live Register so as to increase their chances of leaving it thereby ensuring a reduction in Exchequer costs over time<\/p><p>In this context, the major elements of this Department&rsquo;s response are set out in the Pathways to Work policy which is aimed at ensuring that as many as possible of the job vacancies that are created are filled by people from the Live Register, with a particular focus on those who are long term unemployed or at risk of long-term unemployment.<\/p><p>The Pathways to Work approach involves more regular and on-going engagement with people who are unemployed through active case management and profiling. There were almost 130,000 referrals of unemployed welfare recipients to the employment service in 2012. Employment services are delivered through the Department&rsquo;s own offices and through a number of Local Employment Services funded by the Department.<\/p><p>My Department operates a number of programmes to support job seekers in moving towards employment. They range across a number of types of support:- work experience, temporary employment, self-employment, subsidised recruitment by employers, and financial support for unemployed people undertaking certain training and education courses.<\/p><p>In relation to work experience, some 5,900 people are currently participating on JobBridge (the National Internship Scheme). The total number of starters on JobBridge during 2012 was 9,575. The findings of the interim evaluation of JobBridge, by Indecon International Economic Consultants (published &ndash; 5th October 2012) found that 61% of finishers secured employment within five months of completing their internship. These progression rates compare favourably with European averages in this area and represent very significant progress in a short period of time.<\/p><p>The Department also manages a number of schemes providing temporary employment for the long-term unemployed on works and services of value to the community. There are currently 26,000 people participating on Community Employment and T&uacute;s. In addition, the Department also has responsibility for the Rural Social Scheme (RSS) which is aimed at low-income farmers and fishermen\/women. There were just under 3,000 participants on the scheme in 2012. As part of Budget 2013, the Government approved 10,000 new places across CE, T&Uacute;S, JobBridge and a new social employment scheme (Jobstart) with the Local Authorities.<\/p><p>In relation to moving into self-employment, currently, almost 12,000 people are being supported under the Back to Work Allowance Enterprise Scheme (BTWEA) scheme and the Short-term Enterprise Allowance (STEA) scheme. BTWA is designed to encourage the long term unemployed to take up self-employment opportunities by allowing them to retain a reducing proportion of their social welfare payment plus secondary benefits over three years. STEA provides immediate support for someone in receipt of Jobseekers Benefit who wants to start a business.<\/p><p>In relation to subsidised recruitment by employers, the Department supports persons with disabilities entering employment through the Wage Subsidy Scheme and the Supported Employment Programme. The Wage Subsidy Scheme provides financial incentives to employers, outside the public sector, to employ disabled people who work more than 20 hours per week. The Supported Employment Programme is an open labour market initiative providing disabled people with supports to help them access the open labour market. It is implemented on behalf of the Department by sponsor organisations that employ Job Coaches to provide a range of supports tailored to the individual needs of a jobseeker. The ultimate outcome is that the employee becomes independent of Job Coach support. Over 4,500 persons benefited from this scheme in 2012.<\/p><p>In July of this year, the Government will launch The JobsPlus incentive scheme which will encourage employers to recruit long-term unemployed people. The new incentive will be payable monthly in arrears, over a 2-year period. There will be 2 levels of incentive: &euro;7,500 for recruits unemployed for more than 12 but less than 24 months and &euro;10,000 for recruits unemployed for more than 24 months. This new incentive will replace the Revenue Job Assist and the Employer PRSI Incentive schemes.<\/p><p>In terms of financial support for those undertaking up-skilling, the Back to Education Allowance (BTEA) scheme run by my Department provides income maintenance for unemployed people returning to further or higher education. Almost 26,000 people participated in the BTEA in the last academic year.  Some 61% of recipients pursued third level courses while 39% pursued courses described as being at second level. A majority of these second-level courses are Post Leaving Cert (PLC courses) undertaken in the further education sector.<\/p><p>Two further up-skilling options available are the Part-time Education Option (PTEO) and Education Training and Development Option (ET&amp;D). In each case, jobseekers who wish to engage in part time day, evening or weekend courses or more intensive short duration courses of education and training may do so while retaining their jobseeker&rsquo;s payments.<\/p><p>BTEA and PTEO have been used as a means of facilitating the participation of unemployed job seekers in a range of special programmes implemented by the Department of Education and Skills over the last few years under the Labour Market Activation Fund, Springboard, and Momentum. The last of these, Momentum, is currently being rolled out and will support the provision of free education and training projects to allow 6,500 long-term unemployed to gain skills and to access work opportunities in identified growing sectors<\/p><p>Up-skilling options are also supported by my Department under TESG (Technical Employment Support Grant) and TATS (Technical Assistance and Training scheme). There were just under 17,000 beneficiaries of TATS\/TESG in 2011. Both TESG and TATS are designed to allow DSP to offer flexible additional help (in the form of access to training, advice, or support for the purchase of certain goods and services) to a number of categories of unemployed people. TESG support can be for purchase of training (where this cannot be provided by a state provider within a reasonable time) or for certain other expenditures such as purchase of tools, travel costs to job interviews. Training, with limited exceptions, must be on certified courses. TATs is more focused on jobseekers with an interest in self-employment, and can assist with the purchase of training\/education\/mentoring, equipment, advertising, and public liability insurance.<\/p><p>The Department&rsquo;s budget for employment support schemes for 2012 and 2013 is set out in the table below. The total budget for employment support schemes is set to increase by &euro;102.4m (10.7%) to &euro;1,056.3m in 2013.<\/p><p><table><tr><th>Expenditure Breakdown of Employment Support Schemes<\/th><th>2012 Provisional Outturn<\/th><th>2013 Estimates<\/th><th>Change<\/th><th>Change<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>-<\/td><td>&#8364;'000<\/td><td>&#8364;'000<\/td><td>&#8364;'000<\/td><td>%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>\u00a0<\/td><td>\u00a0<\/td><td>\u00a0<\/td><td>\u00a0<\/td><td>\u00a0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Community Employment Programme<\/td><td>330,399<\/td><td>351,550<\/td><td>21,151<\/td><td>6.4%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Rural Social Scheme<\/td><td>45,242<\/td><td>45,000<\/td><td>-242<\/td><td>-0.5%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>TUS - Community Work Placement<\/td><td>67,055<\/td><td>96,200<\/td><td>29,145<\/td><td>43.5%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Job Initiative<\/td><td>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 25,794<\/td><td>25,100<\/td><td>-694<\/td><td>-2.7%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Jobstart<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>15,740<\/td><td>15,740<\/td><td>n.a.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Community Services Programme<\/td><td>45,391<\/td><td>46,060<\/td><td>669<\/td><td>1.5%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Back to Work Allowance (BTWEA &amp; STEA)<\/td><td>127,156<\/td><td>126,400<\/td><td>-756<\/td><td>-0.6%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>National Internship Scheme - JobBridge<\/td><td>54,739<\/td><td>81,760<\/td><td>27,021<\/td><td>49.4%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Back to Education Allowance<\/td><td>199,565<\/td><td>189,300<\/td><td>-10,265<\/td><td>-5.1%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Local Employment Services (including Job Clubs)<\/td><td>23,573<\/td><td>25,100<\/td><td>1,527<\/td><td>6.5%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>TESG\\TATS<\/td><td>7,807<\/td><td>10,500<\/td><td>2,693<\/td><td>34.5%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wage Subsidy Scheme<\/td><td>10,566<\/td><td>10,850<\/td><td>284<\/td><td>2.7%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Supported Employment programme<\/td><td>8,104<\/td><td>8,840<\/td><td>736<\/td><td>9.1%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Miscellaneous Other Employment supports<\/td><td>8,591<\/td><td>23,950<\/td><td>15,359<\/td><td>178.8%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total Working Age - Employment Supports<\/td><td>953,983<\/td><td>1,056,350<\/td><td>102,367<\/td><td>10.73%<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700079#WRT01400","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Supplementary Welfare Allowance Expenditure","counter":409,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700079#WRT01450"},{"type":"question","counter":410,"qnumday":156,"qnumall":"[17996\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700079#WRT01500","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the background to the decision to cut grants for religious ceremonies such as first communion and confirmation costs; if these grants will be reinstated in the future to help the poorest in society; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1019","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":411,"content":"<p>Under the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme, the Department may make a single exceptional needs payment (ENP) to help meet essential, once-off, exceptional and unforeseen expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income.

The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August last, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed services of at least 30 Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses, well in advance of the EU&rsquo;s target date of 2020, and that significantly higher speeds are available to as many homes and businesses as possible.<\/p><p>  During the preparation of Ireland&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, the commercial market operators indicated that they expect to provide 70 Mbps to 100 Mbps services to 50% of the population by 2015.  Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway in both fixed line and mobile high speed broadband services, particularly in urban and semi-urban areas.<\/p><p>  The Government is also committed in the Plan to investing in areas where high speed services are not commercially viable and will not be provided by the market.  In an important milestone towards delivery of this commitment in the Plan, my Department has identified, following the evaluation of tender responses to a request for experts, the preferred bidder to assist in the design, planning and procurement of the State-led investment. Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations including stakeholder engagement will be ongoing throughout 2013 with a view to the launch of a procurement process in 2014.<\/p><p>  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, we are committed to increasing the availability of next generation speeds significantly, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in a digitally enabled society.<\/p><p>  I would reiterate that the Government remains committed to ensuring that all parts of Ireland, including all of County Monaghan, will have at least 30 Mbps connectivity, through public or private sector investment, as outlined in the National Broadband Plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700081#WRV00300","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","counter":444,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700081#WRV00400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social and Affordable Housing Provision","counter":443,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700081#WRV00350"},{"type":"question","counter":444,"qnumday":168,"qnumall":"[18132\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700081#WRV00400","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will outline the articles of association affecting the operation of L&eacute;im an Bhrad&aacute;in Housing Association, Leixlip, County Kildare; the extent of any changes since its inception; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"967"},{"type":"question","counter":445,"qnumday":169,"qnumall":"[18133\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700081#WRV00500","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the extent to which a register of members of association can be made available to the tenants of L&eacute;im and Bhrad&aacute;in Housing Association, Leilip, County Kildare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"967"},{"type":"question","counter":446,"qnumday":183,"qnumall":"[17977\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700081#WRV00600","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the current status of the L&eacute;i man Bhrad&aacute;in Voluntary Housing Association, Leixlip, County Kildare, originally a creation of the capital allowance scheme; if any changes have taken place affecting the structure of the association administratively or otherwise in or since 2008; the extent, if any, to which approval was sought or received for any such changes including local authority or departmental approval; if any such changes have taken place in respect of similar voluntary housing schemes throughout the country; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":447,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 168, 169 and 183 together.<\/p><p>  I refer to the reply to Question No. 169 of 7 March 2013 which sets out the position with regard to the current status of the Approved Housing Body (AHB), L&eacute;im an Bhrad&aacute;in, and the roles and responsibilities of my Department and the housing authorities in relation to the voluntary housing capital funding schemes and the management and maintenance of properties provided by AHBs.<\/p><p>  Copies of the original Memorandum and Articles of Association  were submitted to my Department in December 1996 by the L&eacute;im an Bhrad&aacute;in Housing Association in accordance with the requirements for the granting of Approved Status under Section 6 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1992.

Prior to this the LEADER elements were co-funded at a rate of 55% by the EU, with the remaining 45% coming from national Exchequer sources. The 2011 agreement reduced the national exchequer input to 15% on a net basis for 2012 and 2013 without a concomitant increase in the amount of funding to be provided by the EU. This resulted in a reduction in the overall Programme complement from &euro;427m to approximately &euro;314m on the basis of the Programme achieving full spend by the end of 2013.<\/p><p>  However, given the levels of spending by the Local Development Companies (LDCs) from 2009 to date, it is very unlikely that full spend will be achieved by the end of 2013, at which time the co-funding rate will revert to 55% for all expenditure beyond that date. As a consequence of this the overall Programme requirement will change. In the context of these changes to the co-funding rate the original project allocations given to each LDC contracted to deliver the LEADER elements of the RDP require readjustment.  <\/p><p>  An exercise is currently being carried out to determine the level of project commitments across all LDCs and all RDP measures in order to rebalance the programme in as equitable a way as possible, and indicate the remaining funding available for project commitments.

A key objective is to rationalise the cost of the current service delivery and ensure more efficient operation of water services by moving from 34 water services authorities to a single body; following enactment of comprehensive legislation later this year,   Irish Water will, therefore, become the water services authority from 1 January 2014. <\/p><p>The transfer of assets from the existing water services authorities to Irish Water supports the overall objective of delivering efficiencies within the sector by allowing Irish Water to control assets, revenues and costs, thereby supporting better economies of scale in terms of both capital investment and operating costs, and optimise borrowing capacity.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The identification and valuation of the relevant asset base and the development of policy and legislation for the transfer of these assets is being progressed. W ork is also underway on the boundary issues between functions which will transfer to Irish Water and those remaining with local authorities. The financial implications for the local govern ment sector following the transfer of functions are   also under consideration including the treatment of rateable assets which are transferred to Irish Water. <\/p><p>  The implementation strategy is being rolled out under a range of workstreams which involve local authority, Departmental and Bord G&aacute;is personnel and using the range of skills and experience in these organisations. Bord G&aacute;is are also in the process of seconding 80 to 90 staff from local authorities and the Department to support work on the Irish Water programme. External service providers, appointed by Bord G&aacute;is by way of public procurement processes, will be involved in various aspects of the programme including company establishment, customer service and billing and the water metering programme. It would be expected that all expenditure incurred by Bord G&aacute;is would be subject to rigorous assessment prior to being incurred and to strict control procedures with a view to ensuring that the required work is undertaken in the most economically advantageous way.<\/p><p>  It will be a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation in due course to satisfy itself in relation to the appropriateness of costs incurred in the operation of Irish Water.<\/p><p>  A Local Authority Transition Office has been established by the City and County Managers Association to coordinate local government input into the water reform programme.

The Courts Service is happy to support its extension to other venues around the country subject to the availability of on site facilities, e.g. sufficient consultation rooms.  The mediation service that is being provided is provided by the Family Mediation Service and the Legal Aid Board.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy may already be aware the Dolphin House mediation initiative commenced on 21 March 2011. The project&rsquo;s objective was to offer an alternative to a courts determined outcome and a more appropriate means of resolving certain family disputes through, in the first instance, offering mediation information to persons who have made contact with the Courts Service with a view to issuing proceedings in relation to access, custody or guardianship matters.  A formal mediation process is then offered to parties willing to engage. Legal advice is also available.<\/p><p>  The net annualised saving from the initiative comes to over &euro;113,000 largely from the overall savings to the courts as a consequence of such cases being re-directed.  To date there have been over 500 mediated agreements resulting from the process.  The Steering Group overseeing the initiative concluded as follows:<\/p><p>- There are clear cost benefits arising from the initiative and there is potential for further capacity and further savings solely from the current initiative;<\/p><p>- These cost benefits would be increased significantly if the initiative were extended;<\/p><p>- There are considerable individual, system and societal benefits to this approach;<\/p><p>- Based on international experience this approach has the potential to have a significant impact for people involved in family disputes.  Benefits extend beyond the parties to the dispute, notably to children, families and even to society;<\/p><p>- It also has the potential to impact quite significantly on the administration of justice in family law cases. Notably, it can impact on the number of cases going through the courts system;<\/p><p>- It has real potential to speed up the resolution of disputes and to do so more cheaply than through the courts process;<\/p><p>- It generates considerable &lsquo;down-stream&rsquo; savings on other State services;<\/p><p>- It is an excellent example of the benefits of State bodies providing related services taking an integrated approach.<\/p><p>  I am particularly conscious of the potential benefits accruing from an integrated approach to seeking to resolve certain family law matters.  This was the main reason for the Family Mediation Service being merged with the Legal Aid Board.  There is a recognition that considerable synergies can be achieved through the merger and in order to further facilitate achieving these the Board is now funded through a single grant in aid.  This allows the Board to make adjustments in spending within its overall budget that it feels will take best advantage of the two areas of work now sitting within the same organisation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700084#WRY01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Investigations","counter":520,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700084#WRY01250"},{"type":"question","counter":521,"qnumday":201,"qnumall":"[17943\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700084#WRY01300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the reason the computer and DVDs taken 10 months ago from a person (details supplied) in County Galway have not been returned; the legislation under which An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are entitled to hold this private property","asker":"1084","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":522,"content":"<p>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the home of the person referred to was searched under warrant pursuant to Section 10 of the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1997.

The immediate and ongoing needs of separated children seeking asylum (SCSA) as well as their application for refugee status are the responsibility of HSE in accordance with the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) and the Child Care Act, 1991.  Where children are identified by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, at the point of entry, the circumstances are investigated and where concerns about the safety and welfare are identified, the child is placed into the care of the HSE. The numbers of separated children has fallen from 1085 in 2001 to 71 in 2012.  Of those 71 children, 48 were placed in the care of the HSE. <\/p><p>  The HSE has a national policy on the standards and services to be provided to separated children seeking asylum.  The policy seeks to achieve equity and equality of services to separated children seeking asylum vis a vis all children at risk and to ensure that there is no differentiation of care provision, care practices, care priorities, standards or protocols until the young person reaches 18 years.  <\/p><p>  Upon reaching 18 years, the HSE refers these young people to the Reception and Integration Agency of the Department of Justice and Law Reform for transfer to adult accommodation and service provision under the direct provision system.  <\/p><p>  The HSE and the RIA have an agreed policy in relation to the accommodation of separated children seeking asylum who reach the age of 18 years and there is regular liaison between the two agencies.

RIA provides these young adults with full board and accommodation in a direct provision centre.  In practice and with the agreement of the Department of Justice, the HSE has retained young adults in after care for various durations and in very exceptional circumstances, for example where there is severe disability or serious mental or physical health issues.  In addition, the HSE is committed to ensuring continuity of care for all young people who are undertaking their leaving certificate and therefore interprets &quot;18th birthday&quot; as the end of a school year\/leaving certificate year following their 18th birthday.

In addition, there are special capitation rates for persons over 70 residing at home and for persons over 70 residing in private nursing homes.  There are also a number of additional payments, e.g. in respect of out-of-hours consultations, temporary residents, special items of services (including suturing of cuts and lacerations, recognised vein treatment, etc.), practice support allowances and payments in respect of locum expenses.<\/p><p>  In addition, medical indemnity insurance premia are refunded to contracted GPs based on the size of each GP's GMS panel.  The HSE also pays into a superannuation scheme a sum equivalent to 10% of total capitation fees payable to contracted GPs.<\/p><p>The PCRS publishes a Statistical Analysis of Claims and Payments for each year in respect of payments which it makes to contracted health professionals, including GPs.  These are available on line at: http:\/\/www.pcrs.ie\/  PCRS Publications.<\/p><p>  Clause 11 of the current GMS Contract states as follows:<\/p><p>&ldquo;The medical practitioner shall provide for eligible persons, on behalf of the relevant Health Board, all proper and necessary treatment of a kind usually undertaken by a general practitioner and not requiring special skill or experience of a degree or kind which general practitioners cannot reasonably be expected to possess.  This will include such preventive and developmental services as are currently provided or may be developed in the new style of practice which this agreement facilitates, some of which services may be included on the list of special items of service for which specific payments shall be made.  &rdquo;<\/p><p>  It is the contracted responsibility of GPs to provide proper and necessary treatment to eligible persons.  If part of that proper and necessary treatment includes routine phlebotomy, GPs must provide such services free of charge under the terms of their contract.  <\/p><p>  The monitoring and appropriate care of patients receiving anti-coagulation therapy with Warfarin comes within the scope of competence of general practice.  Warfarin testing is carried out by some general practitioners as a matter of course in their practices and I welcome this.  This provides their patients with an option of receiving this service locally in a primary care setting rather than attending an acute hospital for this service.<\/p><p>  Under the GMS contract, fees are not paid to GPs by the HSE in respect of certain medical certificates which may be required, for example, under the Social Welfare Acts or for the purposes of insurance or assurance policies or for the issue of driving licences.<\/p><p>  Consultation fees charged by general practitioners to patients outside the terms of the GMS contract are a matter of private contract between the clinicians and the patients.  While the Minister for Health has no role in relation to such fees, it would be expected that clinicians would have regard to the overall economic situation in setting their fees.<\/p><p>  The Programme for Government provides for the introduction of a new GMS GP contract with an increased emphasis on the management of chronic conditions, such as diabetes and cardiovascular conditions.  It is envisaged that the new contract, when finalised, will focus on prevention and will include a requirement for GPs to provide care as part of integrated multidisciplinary Primary Care Teams.  The arrangements in relation to the various services provided to GMS patients, including phlebotomy services and anti-coagulation therapy will be reviewed as part of this process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700088#WRCC01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legislative Programme","counter":625,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700088#WRCC01150"},{"type":"question","counter":626,"qnumday":235,"qnumall":"[17774\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013041700088#WRCC01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the role of the Junior Ministers in his Department in constructing abortion legislation; the number of meetings he has had with them; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1019","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":627,"content":"<p>I wish to inform the Deputy that, given the sensitivity of the topic, the complex constitutional and legal issues involved, and the political interest in this area, I have established a dedicated Oversight Committee to supervise this process.
