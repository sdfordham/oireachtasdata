The meeting was addressed by two international experts in the area: Laura Martinez-Mora who is head of the intercountry adoption unit at the Hague Conference on Private International Law and Nigel Cantwell who is an international consultant on child protection policy and an author of a Unicef&rsquo;s report into adoption practices.<\/p><p>  The seminar was a very useful way to communicate to prospective adoptive parents and other stakeholders and provide them with an understanding of the challenges and the changing landscape of intercountry adoption. The implementation of the Hague Convention internationally and the changing economic and social environments in  sending countries has led to a change in the age and needs of children eligible for adoption. It is important to note that this trend is not specific to ireland or Irish adoption procedures but rather reflects the international context.  Of particular note, Ms. Martinez-Mora confirmed and detailed the decreasing number of children available for adoption internationally and the fact that increasingly the children in need of intercountry adoption are children with special needs.<\/p><p>   These trends reflect the significant decline in recent years in the number of children, particularly infants, available for adoption, as child protection safeguards have improved in developing countries which previously placed large numbers of children for adoption.   In many cases these reforms in countries of origin have been given expression and impetus by their ratification of the Hague Convention.  The Convention requires members to strengthen protections for children, birth parents and prospective adoptive parents in the adoption process and to prioritise the improvement of systems for the care and adoption of children domestically.  This requirement is in line with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, in particular Article 21. <\/p><p>  The issue of adoption of children with specials needs, medical or disability related, or with needs related to the transition from long term foster care, are issues that must be considered as part of the entire adoption process. The assessment of the needs of these children must be comprehensive and transparent if their needs are to be effectively served by the intercountry adoption process and fully met by the receiving country and the adoptive parents.  Prospective adopters also need guidance, advice and assistance both before and after such an adoption to ensure they can successfully meet these challenges.  My Department is working with the Adoption Authority of Ireland and the Child and Family Agency in relation to the preparation and support of prospective adoptive parents.  The enhanced provision of accurate, objective information to the community of potential or prospective adoptive parents is very important and I welcome the recently convened information seminar and other such mechanisms for informing those involved and the public generally. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051300053#WRA01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Care Services Funding","counter":13,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051300053#WRA01200"},{"type":"question","counter":14,"qnumday":111,"qnumall":"[21037\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051300053#WRA01300","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the efforts he has made and will make to help ensure the financial viability of Darndale Belcamp Integrated Childcare Service Limited; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"969","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":15,"content":"<p>Firstly, I would like to acknowledge the importance of the services delivered by Darndale Belcamp Integrated Childcare Service Ltd. to some 260 children across the areas of Darndale, Belcamp and Moatview.

The Centre employs approximately 100 staff, including Community Employment participants.  I understand that the Centre has been experiencing cash flow difficulties over recent weeks and that this has given rise to concerns regarding its future operation.  The Centre has been in discussions with the Child and Family Agency, as one of a number of state agencies which provides funding to support the provision of services at the Centre.  In order to alleviate the immediate cash flow difficulty the Agency prepaid funding due to the Centre in May and June.  I would expect that the Agency will be open to providing some further pre-payments to the Centre if this is of assistance.  <\/p><p>  The Chairperson of the Centre has also been in correspondence with my predecessor, Minister Fitzgerald, regarding the current difficulties.  Minister Fitzgerald advised, inter alia, that in her view the wider solution to the current difficulties would need to have regard to the overall provision of early years services in the area.  This is important as we need to ensure that all available resources to support these key services are maximised.  The Minister also expressed the view, with which I concur, that this will require some time and space.<\/p><p>  The Deputy will appreciate that I am still in the process of familiarising myself with the issues involved.  In this context, I have asked my officials to meet with the Child and Family Agency and with Pobal (which administers a number of childcare schemes on behalf of my Department) to explore all possible solutions to the current difficulties having regard to the overall provision of early years services.

The draft Bill will also provide for the voluntary placement for adoption of any child irrespective of the marital status of his or her parents.

The Young People's Facilities and Services Fund transferred to my Department on its establishment in 2011 and the Fund along with the Special Projects for Youth scheme, which also targets young people who are vulnerable and at risk of disadvantage, is now the subject of a comprehensive Value for Money and Policy Review which is nearing completion in my Department.<\/p><p>  In 2014,  almost &euro;18.4m will be made available under the Young People's Facilities and Services Fund to over 230 established youth projects.

In the interests of children, they turned down the opportunity to make money. They have to be congratulated for that, as does the Irish Hotels Federation for opposing child beauty pageants in Ireland. This is yet another demonstration of the role of public opinion and awareness in avoiding inappropriate interference with childhood..<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051300054#WRB02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Adoption Legislation","counter":36,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051300054#WRB02100"},{"type":"question","counter":37,"qnumday":118,"qnumall":"[20868\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051300054#WRB02200","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the changes that have been made to adoption legislation during the course of this Government&rsquo;s lifespan.","asker":"953","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":38,"content":"<p>In order to resolve the difficulties that Irish families who were in the process of adopting from Russia experienced due to changes in Russian adoption legislation that took place in July 2013, the Government introduced, and the Oireachtas approved, the Adoption (Amendment) Act 2013.

Given the range and complexity of the issues this will require scoping and preliminary examination after which decisions will be made on the extent and time scale for the review to see if proposals for legislative change emerge from this review or the nature of such proposals.  Based upon the many domestic and international legal aspects to adoption the issue of further legislative development will certainly be considered.

I wish to assure the House that this will be at the top of my agenda, as it was for my predecessor.  The transfer of responsibility for 16 year old boys has already taken place and this Programme for Government commitment will be met in full later this year when the extension of the Oberstown campus results in the transfer of responsibility for 17 year old boys from the adult prison system to the children detention schools.  <\/p><p>  Following the appointment of a main contractor and a number of sub-contractors, construction on the Oberstown development project started on site on 23 September 2013.  The project will increase the number of children detention places available on the Oberstown campus to a total of 90 places and will enable the extension of the child care model of detention to all under 18 year olds ordered to be remanded or committed by the courts on criminal justice charges.  The first 3 units of residential accommodation are scheduled to be delivered in the third quarter of this year, in order to facilitate the transfer of responsibility for 17 year old boys from the adult prison system.  A further 3 residential units, to be delivered in 2015, will replace existing detention buildings used by Oberstown Boys School which have reached the end of their useful life.  The Office of Public Works (OPW) is overseeing the delivery of the project with the contractor involved, BAM Building Ltd.  I understand some weeks delay has been encountered in the construction programme due to weather and other issues but the OPW and my Department continue to emphasise the need to make up any time possible in order to meet the agreed project timeline for delivery of the first 3 units later this year.<\/p><p>  While the operation of the adult prison system is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, there is of course a need for policy cooperation between our respective Departments in relation to issues affecting young offenders.  In advance of the opening of the expanded Oberstown development, in December 2013 all sentenced 17 year old boys were transferred from St Patrick's Institution to a dedicated unit in Wheatfield on an interim basis. To facilitate this transfer, Wheatfield was re - designated as a Place of Detention.  I understand that for legal reasons, all 17 year old remand prisoners continue to be detained at St Patrick's Institution.  My predecessor visited the Wheatfield facility in February 2013 and while I do of course share the view that no child should be detained in the adult prison system, I am advised that to date, the transfer to Wheatfield has operated in a satisfactory manner.   <\/p><p>  In October 2013 a Working Group was established comprising representatives from my Department, the Department of Justice and Equality, the Irish Prison Service, the Children Detentions Schools, the Child and Family Agency and the Probation Service.  The Working Group was asked to compile a report on all issues arising from the planned transfer of responsibility for detention of 17 year old males from the prison system to the Oberstown children detention school (CDS) campus.  The position of 17 year olds on remand in St. Patrick's Institution and any options that should be considered in advance of the opening of the expanded Oberstown campus is currently one of the issues under review by the group. Legal advices sought by my Department on this issue are being considered at the moment. I expect the report from the Working Group with recommendations on how to proceed with the full transition of 17 year olds to the Oberstown Campus in the coming weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051300054#WRB02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Early Years Strategy Publication","counter":45,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051300054#WRB03000"},{"type":"question","counter":46,"qnumday":121,"qnumall":"[21040\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051300054#WRB03100","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if he will provide an update on the development of the early years strategy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"969","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":47,"content":"<p>The Early Years Strategy is one of a number of detailed strategies being developed under the National Children and Young People&rsquo;s Policy Framework 2014-2018.

Of the children in care, 505 (7.8%) were without an allocated social worker and 811(12.5%) did not have an up to date written care plan.  It is important to note that statistics on written care plans may refer to those that have not been revised in line with specified time frames outlined in the Child Care Regulations 1995.  This means that in some cases social workers have developed written care plans in consultation with children in care and their families but they need to be updated in line with the Regulations. <\/p><p>  Of course, the legislative framework requires that all children in care should have an allocated social worker and written care plan and I am confident that the Child and Family Agency is working towards this goal.

The objective is to create an innovative and dynamic blueprint for the future development of Ireland&rsquo;s early years sector and a coherent approach to seeking to improve the lives of children from birth to 6 years.  The Department of Childen and Youth Affairs is committed to ensuring high standards in early years service provision, both in terms of care and curriculum. The role of quality provision is critical in contributing to childhood development and this key objective will be reflected fully in the Early Years Strategy.<\/p><p>  One of the specific issues of policy which has been identified for consideration in the preparation of the new Strategy is the future role and regulation of the childminding sector, which is already an important component of early childhood care and education.  At present pre-school services are subject to the Child Care (Pre-School Services) (No.2) Regulations 2006, as provided for under Part VII of the Child Care Act 1991.<\/p><p>  Services providing care for children who have not yet commenced primary school are required to notify their service to the Early Years Inspectorate of the Child and Family Agency and are subject to inspection and report by the Inspectorate on a regular basis.  Services covered by the Regulations include full-time, part-time and sessional services as well as childminders taking care of more than three pre-school children from different families in the childminder&rsquo;s home.  <\/p><p>  Childminders who are not subject to the requirement to notify are, however, encouraged to voluntarily notify their service to their local City or County Childcare Committee which provides a range of supports to enable them to improve the standards of their childcare service. These supports include the Childminders Tax Exemption scheme which provides for a tax exemption for those childminders who have satisfactorily participated in the Voluntary Notification process and whose annual income from childminding does not exceed &euro;15,000.<\/p><p>  Some &euro;10 million of funding, allied to these supports, was invested over a period of 10 years to encourage childminders to notify.  This was seen as a potential first step to bringing all non family childminders under the Regulations. This stepped approach has worked in some countries, such as Scotland.  However, only 1250 childminders voluntarily notified here and a further 2,000 to 3,000 participate in training.  It is clear that there are barriers specific to Ireland in bringing childminders under the regulatory framework.    The Early Years Strategy will include consideration of how this complex issue might be addressed in the future.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051300055#WRC02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Protection","counter":83,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051300055#WRC02300"},{"type":"question","counter":84,"qnumday":134,"qnumall":"[20948\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051300055#WRC02400","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the current status of the national audit of neglect cases; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1177","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":85,"content":"<p>The Audit Report on neglect cases and its recommendations have informed the ongoing development of services to ensure improved wellbeing and outcomes for children.

I welcome the offers of support to the Nigerian authorities from a number of our EU partners and from the US, to help find the missing schoolgirls.

Unfortunately, many of these often small and vulnerable communities are coming under increasing pressure due to a range of factors including low birth rates, emigration and, in some cases, increased sectarian persecution and violence.  This has led to a significant reduction in their numbers in the region over recent years.  In Iraq for instance, it is estimated that more than half of the Christian community may have emigrated over the past decade.  The political turmoil which has overwhelmed many countries in the Middle East in recent years has led to increased international concerns about the safety of Christians first in Iraq and Egypt and now most pressingly in Syria.  The descent of Syria into violence and disarray has left small Christian communities very exposed and sometimes subject to direct attack.  Ireland raises the issue of the safety of Christians through its official bilateral contacts with the countries in question, stressing the responsibility of the government to protect all its citizens and minorities. In situations of general instability and insecurity, such as Iraq some years ago or Syria today, this is of course especially difficult.  Ireland also works with our partners in the EU to raise the issue in multilateral fora such as the UN Human Rights Council, as part of the EU&rsquo;s human rights policy.  The EU has taken a number of steps in recent years in support of Freedom of Religious Belief, including issuing Council Conclusions on the matter, most recently in February 2011.  On the broader international plane, Ireland has worked at UN and EU level to promote resolutions and actions on the principle of freedom of religious belief, notably during our 2013 EU Presidency, and now as a current member of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva. I have raised the issue of protection of Christians in the Middle East in discussions at the Foreign Affairs Council, and supported stronger EU statements on the issue, for instance in the Council Conclusions on Egypt issued on 21 August last and the FAC Conclusions on Syria which were agreed in January and April 2014.<\/p><p>  Ireland attaches great importance to combating all forms of discrimination based on religion or belief and incitement to religious hatred.  Ireland was elected to the Human Rights Council in November 2012 and will serve for the 2013-2015 term.  Amongst our priorities as a member of the Council is the issue of freedom of religion or belief, and we have played a central role in the negotiation of two important resolutions on this issue in the past year.<\/p><p>  Officials from my Department have met frequently with local Christian leaders from the Middle East region, and discussed the issues affecting their communities.  It should be noted that many of these groups request that any efforts made on their behalf be carried out very discreetly, as any special attention from western countries might only increase their difficulties.<\/p><p>  While some individuals from the region have found refuge in Ireland, asylum in Ireland or in Europe cannot provide the solution to this problem, because the numbers are too great, because there are others also at risk, and because this would spell the end for ancient Christian communities who have survived in the region since the earliest days of Christianity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051300056#WRD03000","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Humanitarian Aid","counter":137,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051300056#WRD03100"},{"type":"question","counter":138,"qnumday":152,"qnumall":"[21542\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051300056#WRD03200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will raise at the EU Foreign Affairs Council the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Angola; if this matter will be raised at the Human Rights Council of the UN; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":139,"content":"<p>Despite oil revenues and high economic growth rates, Angola continues to experience drought-related humanitarian emergencies.

The effects on food supplies and drinking have had a significant impact on the population&rsquo;s nutritional health, particularly among children under five. Last month, the Government of Angola reported that over 400,000 people are being affected by drought in provinces in the west of the country. It is the fourth consecutive year of abnormal rainfall in these provinces and it is reported that river levels have dropped or even dried up completely, with a negative impact on cultivation.  In addition to the problem of drought, Angola continues to grapple with the legacy of 27 years of conflict and civil war, and in particular massive use of land mines, which has held back its agricultural development.<\/p><p>  Working with our EU partners, Ireland takes a strategic approach to post-conflict countries like Angola.  The EU is working to develop long term solutions to assist Angola in diversifying its economy, especially its agriculture sector.  Between 2010 and 2013 just under &euro;2.6 million was provided by Irish Aid to civil society organisations working in Angola, including Christian Aid Ireland, Tr&oacute;caire and Concern, to address inequality, access to services and land rights. Under the 10th European Development Fund, the EU allocated &euro;227.9 million to Angola, for institutional reform, human and social development as well as rural development, agriculture and food security and demining between 2008 and 2013.  EU assistance is designed to contribute to the sustainable development of the country and to support the Angolan Government&rsquo;s strategy to combat poverty and to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. Under current EDF funding, the EU is also supporting projects to support regional integration, biodiversity and the private sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051300056#WRD03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1006"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Millennium Development Goals","counter":140,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051300056#WRD03400"},{"type":"question","counter":141,"qnumday":153,"qnumall":"[21544\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051300056#WRD03500","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if Irish representatives will raise at the Human Rights Council of the United Nations the recently published estimates that only 62 out of 168 countries will achieve gender parity in secondary education by 2015; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":142,"content":"<p>Ireland is advocating strongly for a continued focus on a good quality education, at primary level and beyond, for all children, in the context of the intergovernmental discussions on the follow-up framework to the Millennium Development Goals post-2015.The third Millennium Development Goal (MDG 3) aims to eliminate gender disparity in primary and secondary education at all levels by 2015. Since the agreement of the Millennium Declaration in 2000, progress has been made on increasing investments in education, and there are now more children in school than ever before in human history. However, girls still lag behind boys in terms of primary school completion and enrolment in secondary school. This is particularly so in conflict affected states where girls are often kept at home for their own safety. It is also true in the poorest regions in the world where girls may be kept out of school to engage in domestic chores.  <font color=\"#212100\">Ireland recognises the transformative power of girls&rsquo; education, both for girls themselves, and also for their families and communities. Every girl and woman has a right to a quality education. And ensuring that right makes sense, as educating girls leads to healthier and more productive families and communities. Evidence of this fact abounds. UNESCO estimates for example, that 2.1 million lives of children under 5 were saved during the first ten years of the MDG time frame between 1990 and 2009, because of improvements in girls&rsquo; and women&rsquo;s education.<\/font><\/p><p>A commitment to improving access to education for girls at primary and beyond primary, consistent with the second and third Millennium Development Goals, has been very strongly represented across the Irish Aid programme. Ireland&rsquo;s new policy on International Development, <i>One World, One Future,<\/i>affirms Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to education, with girls&rsquo; education, at primary and beyond primary, singled out for special focus. In 2012, Irish Aid allocated &euro;33.9 million to education programmes in developing countries. This amount represented approximately 8% of bilateral ODA.<\/p><p>Ireland will continue to support national governments in our partner countries in their efforts to address drop-out rates of girls and low enrolment in their education plans.  We also work with civil society partners to raise awareness at community level of gender based violence in schools, and support the Global Partnership for Education, an international funding mechanism which targets girls that have been left behind.<\/p><p>Ireland recognises that the enjoyment of all human rights is essential for development, and this is reflected in our engagement with the UN Human Rights Council (HRC) as a member for the term 2013-2015. Ireland has supported two separate resolutions at the HRC which recognised the right to education.  The most recent resolution in this regard, adopted by the HRC on 13 June 2013, reaffirmed the human right of everyone to education, and called upon all States to take all measures to implement the HRC resolutions on the right to education with a view to ensuring the full realisation of this right for all.  The resolution also emphasised the need to ensure that the right to education is central in the context of the post-2015 agenda.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051300056#WRD03600","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":143,"content":"<p>Question No. 154 answered with Question No. 148.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Bodies Data","counter":144,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051300056#WRD03800"},{"type":"question","counter":145,"qnumday":155,"qnumall":"[21795\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051300056#WRD03900","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the number of State agencies and public bodies that have been merged or abolished in each year since 2011, under the remit of his Department; the annual savings associated with each body; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1100","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":146,"content":"<p>There are no State Agencies under the remit of my Department.

Trade promotion and economic messaging are key elements in all visits abroad undertaken by Government Ministers. Every effort is made to ensure that, as far as is practicable, appropriate opportunities are taken for a substantive economic and promotional dimension to all official visits.<\/p><p>Delivering an intensive programme of Ministerial-led trade missions is a key commitment in the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Jobs in 2013. The number of Ministerial-led Enterprise Ireland trade missions conducted with the active support of the Embassy network has more than doubled over the past three years, up from eight in 2011 to eighteen this year.  During my recent visit to Paris - in addition to formal meetings with President Hollande, Prime Minister Ayrault and Foreign Minister Fabius and other engagements - I undertook seven trade promotion activities in conjunction with the State agencies, starting with an IDA Ireland breakfast event with 50 existing and potential investors in Ireland. I led a visit of 12 Enterprise Ireland client companies to the Beauvais plant of AGCO, the multinational owner of Massey-Ferguson and France&rsquo;s top exporter of agricultural machinery, to develop opportunities for Irish engineering companies to supply components. In November I will travel to London to speak at an Enterprise Ireland Financial Services networking event.  It is also possible that I may undertake other official travel in 2014, in which case I will of course avail of all suitable opportunities to promote trade, tourism and investment.<\/p><p>My colleague Joe Costello T.D, Minister of State for Trade and Development, will lead an Enterprise Ireland trade mission to Qatar and Oman from 31 May to 4 June. The mission will focus on supporting Irish companies in the construction and engineering sectors as well as exploring opportunities for Irish education institutions.  From 6 to 8  October Minister of State Costello will lead an Enterprise Ireland exploratory trade visit to Mexico to support Irish companies in exploring business opportunities there.  This will reinforce Ireland&rsquo;s interest in developing and expanding political and trade relations with Mexico and build on the visit of An tUachtar&aacute;n there in 2013.  In mid-October, Minister Costello will lead an Enterprise Ireland trade mission to West Africa which will focus on mining, oil and gas opportunities for Irish companies and in late-November he will lead another EI trade mission to Australia, focusing on the construction and engineering sectors.<\/p><p>My colleague, Paschal Donohoe T.D., Minister of State for European Affairs, has, since taking office almost ten months ago, undertaken sixteen bilateral visits across Europe, including visits to Albania, Bosnia, Germany and Poland this year. This is in addition to Minister Donohoe's engagements at EU level, which includes representing Ireland at the General Affairs Council, at Informal Ministerial meetings, European Parliament Plenary sessions, other high-level EU engagements as they arise and accompanying the Taoiseach to the European Council. In both his bilateral and EU engagements, the Government's priorities of promoting Ireland and creating the conditions, as well as opportunities, for stability, jobs and growth are always to the fore. It is envisaged that Minister Donohoe will continue to undertake an extensive programme of bilateral visits for the remainder of the year and planning is currently underway, including for a trip to Belgrade in June to further bilateral economic and political relations as well as to demonstrate Ireland's support for Serbia's EU accession negotiations.<\/p><p>Other official visits abroad will include the following: I will travel to New York in late September 2014 to participate in the General Assembly of the United Nations and to address to that body on Irish foreign policy priorities. There I will meet with Foreign Ministers and UN leaders. Such meetings will provide a crucial opportunity to discuss a range of international issues, as well as bilateral issues and Ireland&rsquo;s candidature for election to a non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council in 2020.  Naturally, given the importance of our economic relationship with the United States I will, as on previous visits, prioritise opportunities to advance our economic interests and will work closely with the IDA, Enterprise Ireland and Tourism Ireland on an appropriate economic promotion programme.  My colleague, Minister of State Costello, will attend a Global Summit in London on 12 June aimed at addressing the issue of sexual violence in conflict.  He will also attend the Third Decennial Conference of Small Island Developing States in Apia, Samoa, from 1 to 4 September.  The Conference will bring together Heads of Government and their representatives from 38 small developing island UN member states. The problems which many such states face due to the effects of climate change and rising sea levels can increase state fragility and, in some cases, the risk of conflict, and therefore their issues are of particular interest to Ireland in terms of our development policy, <i>One World, One Future<\/i>.  He may also attend the Global Partnership on Education Replenishment meeting in Brussels on 25 and 26 June and the UN General Assembly in September. In early October, Minister of State Costello is expected to travel to Paris for the OECD Development Assistance Committee&rsquo;s review of Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme.

The cross referencing of the two registers confirmed that the HHC was paid in respect of 1.27 million properties from a total of 1.69 million properties listed on the LPT Register (other than Local Authority\/Social Housing). Revenue has, as part of its extensive communications strategy, repeatedly confirmed that the database could not be 100% accurate, the main reasons being that:<\/p><p><i>- The LGMA Register captured the name of the person who physically paid the HHC rather than the owner of the property, for example, where a son or daughter paid the liability on behalf of a parent.<\/i><\/p><p><i>- The legislative basis for both the HHC and LPT are different. Some properties that are liable for LPT were exempt from the HHC and, unlike LPT, property owners were not actually required to make a claim for exemption from HHC.  For that reason, Revenue could not identify every property that was exempt from HHC through the cross-referencing process.<\/i><\/p><p><i>- Certain payments made directly to Local Authorities were omitted from the LGMA Register.<\/i><\/p><p>The Deputy will appreciate that it is absolutely essential from a fairness perspective to the vast majority of house owners who have paid both the HHC and LPT that Revenue follows through on those who have not and that is why it issued the letters in question. Revenue has confirmed to me that the letters were specifically worded to achieve four separate objectives:<\/p><p><i>- advise the property owner that the property is on the arrears database,<\/i><\/p><p><i>- advise any property owner (on the database) who had paid the HHC or whose property was not liable for the HHC to contact Revenue to correct the information on record,<\/i><\/p><p><i>- advise correctly liable persons to pay the outstanding charge thereby preventing additional interest accruing, and<\/i><\/p><p><i>- advise correctly liable persons, of the next steps that Revenue will take to collect the charge in the event of continued non-compliance.<\/i><\/p><p>To assist people in making payment or amending inaccuracies in the information, Revenue has developed a new online service that can be accessed using the Property ID and PIN codes included on the letters in question. The system, which is an extension of the LPT online facility, is available 24 hours a day and is very intuitive and easy to use. It includes the full range of payment options that are available for LPT and allows people to record any entitlements to exemptions or waivers from the HHC. Alternatively, for property owners who prefer direct contact, Revenue has extended its LPT Helpline service at 1890 200 255 from a 9am\/5pm basis to an 8am\/8pm basis.<\/p><p>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioner that it is not possible at this stage of the campaign to provide data on the number of letters which were sent to people who had already paid the HHC.

These surveys are undertaken for Revenue and the National Tobacco Control Office of the Health Services Executive by Ipsos MRBI. The analysis of the results of the\u00a0 survey for 2013 are not yet fully finalised but\u00a0 preliminary analysis indicates that 11% of cigarettes consumed in Ireland in 2013 were illicit and a further 5% of cigarettes were non Irish duty paid which were legally brought into the country. The comparable figures for 2012 and 2011 were 13% and 14% respectively with the legally imported non Irish duty paid cigarettes at 6% and 7%. This would suggest that the extent of the problem is being contained, as a result of the extensive action being taken against the smuggling and sale of illicit product.<\/p><p>  I am satisfied that the Ipsos MRBI survey is the best indicator of the extent of the market in illicit cigarettes. This is because of the methodology used and the consistent manner in which the survey has been undertaken over a number of years.\u00a0 It is geographically representative and surveys population samples that are statistically robust and can be extrapolated with a reasonable degree of reliability to the population at large.\u00a0 In addition this methodology, in contrast to other methodologies such as empty pack surveys, is capable of distinguishing between illicit cigarettes and legal personal imports, which is a very important consideration.\u00a0 The Revenue Commissioners are not in position to levy Irish taxes on products which are already taxed in other EU member states.<\/p><p>  I am aware that some other surveys, including The Illicit Tobacco Trade Review 2013 by Japan Tobacco International, indicate a higher level of illicit cigarette consumption. However, I do not accept the validity of those other surveys, as they are not representative of the entire smoking population, do not take into account legal personal imports from other jurisdictions and are frequently based on empty pack surveys.\u00a0 I am advised that empty pack surveys are unreliable as robust estimates of the scale of non-Irish duty paid cigarettes. With empty pack surveys, it is impossible to know if the location surveyed is in any way representative (an extreme example would be Temple Bar or international sporting event). Even if there was a representative location, publicly discarded packs are not likely to be representative of packs overall.<\/p><p>  In looking at higher estimates of the level of illicit consumption that come from other sources, it also needs to be borne in mind that the tobacco industry claims must be viewed in terms of their interest in minimising tax increases while imposing significant price increases of their own.<\/p><p>  Combating the illegal tobacco trade is a high priority for the Revenue Commissioners. Their work against this illegal activity includes a wide range of measures designed to identify and target those who are engaged in the supply or sale of illicit products, with a view to seizing those products and prosecuting those responsible. This multi-faceted strategy includes ongoing analysis of the nature and extent of the problem, developing and sharing intelligence on a national, EU and international basis, the use of analytics and detection technologies and ensuring the optimum deployment of resources at points of importation and within the country. The commitment to acting against all stages of the supply chain for illicit products will be maintained and Revenue will continue to make every effort to ensure that those involved in the illicit trade are brought to account before the Courts for their criminal activities.

For the Deputy's information, the main reasons are:<\/p><p><i>- The LGMA Register captured the name of the person who paid the HHC rather than the owner of the property, for example, where a son or daughter paid the HHC on behalf of a parent thereby making matching very difficult in some instances.<\/i><\/p><p><i>- The legislative basis for both the HHC and LPT are different.

The exemptions include certain unfinished housing estates, which are prescribed (as unfinished) by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government in Statutory Instrument (SI) No. 91 of 2013. The 'prescribed list' was published in March 2013 and can be viewed at . It is important to be aware that, in line with Government policy, only properties appearing on the 'prescribed list' are entitled to exemption from LPT and Revenue has no discretion in this regard.<\/p><p>Revenue has confirmed to me that contacts were recently made with LPT Branch by the Deputy's office in respect of the two properties to which his Questions refer. The contacts arose from the owners receiving HHC arrears letters, which issued in both cases because the data, which Revenue received from the Local Government Management Agency (LGMA), gave no indication of exemptions being in place. As a result of the Deputy's contact, the properties were subsequently confirmed as being entitled to exemptions (from HHC) and the records were amended to reflect that status.<\/p><p>As a general comment on exemptions, the Deputy should be aware that it does not follow that properties, which are exempt from the Household Charge (HHC) are automatically included in the 'prescribed list' for LPT, as the qualifying criteria in respect of both exemptions are not the same. For example, certain properties and estates that were listed as exempt from HHC on the basis of being 'unfinished' and which were subsequently further developed in the period up to March 2013 were excluded from the LPT 'prescribed list'. This had the effect of very significantly reducing the number of exemptions in respect of LPT in comparison to HHC. <\/p><p>For the Deputy's information, with effect from 1 July 2013, Section 156 of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) converted HHC to LPT, increased all outstanding liabilities from &euro;100 to &euro;200 and made Revenue responsible for the collection of those outstanding amounts.\u00a0 <\/p><p>In regard to the LPT status (as distinct from HHC) of the properties, Revenue has informed me that it has confirmed that parts of the two estates mentioned by the Deputy in his Questions are listed as exempt on SI 91, but from preliminary analysis it appears as if the actual properties in question may not be included. The inclusion or exclusion of individual properties on the 'prescribed list' are issues for the property owners and the relevant Local Authorities to agree upon and Revenue has no role in those decisions.For the reasons just outlined it is very important that before any person claims an exemption from LPT they check to ensure their actual properties are included in the 'prescribed list' regardless of whether they already had exemption from HHC or not and where there is any doubt they should contact the relevant Local Authority to confirm. Once a person has confirmed entitlement to an exemption from LPT with their Local Authority, and can produce the necessary supporting documentation when requested, Revenue will amend the record as appropriate.<\/p><p>Finally, Revenue has assured me that it intends carrying out compliance checks on exempt properties to ensure the property owners in question are entitled to the concessions claimed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051300057#WRE02100","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Rebates","counter":203,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051300057#WRE02150"},{"type":"question","counter":204,"qnumday":176,"qnumall":"[21056\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051300057#WRE02200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the reason persons who pay their local property tax by monthly direct debit are unable to receive revenue refunds unless they pay the remainder of their liability; if the Revenue Commissioners will review this practice; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":205,"content":"<p>I am informed by Revenue that property owners who are due a refund of tax and who are currently paying their 2014 LPT liability by direct debit (over the course of 2014) are entitled to receive their tax refund, provided that the direct debits have been honoured, and that the rest of their tax affairs are in order.

Members of the Economic and Financial Sub-Committee on EU Sovereign Debt Markets have stated that the introduction of the FTT would have a significantly negative effect on Sovereign Debt Markets and may impair the good-functioning of secondary markets for sovereign debt resulting in reduced liquidity, reduced investor demand and therefore higher financing costs for States.<\/p><p>  Our concerns are widely shared amongst the Member States, including some of the participating countries.\u00a0These concerns have led to the issuing of a communique by the\u00a0participating Member States\u00a0last week, announcing that they have agreed to implement a financial transaction tax in a progressive manner, with the first step being a charge on shares and some derivatives. However, significant technical and legal discussions will continue to be required at the Council Working Party before\u00a0the text of the proposed Directive can be finalised. With this in mind, the targeted implementation date for the FTT has been rescheduled to 1 January 2016.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, Ireland already has a tax on financial transactions, a Stamp Duty on transfers of shares in Irish incorporated companies, which currently stands at 1%. It now appears that this will be the form of the initial tax measure that is being considered by the participating countries. This means that in effect these countries, some of which do not apply any financial transactions tax currently, are now considering a tax along the lines of that which already applies in Ireland, the UK and certain other countries. The rate at which such transactions would be charged remains to be finalised but it was proposed in the draft Directive that transactions in shares would be subject to a charge of 0.1%, which is\u00a0lower than that which currently applies in Ireland.<\/p><p>  Assurances were given at ECOFIN\u00a0last week that all Member States will be kept fully informed in the Council Working Party that is developing the proposals. I understand that the participating Member States hope to conclude discussions on the draft text of the proposal by the end of this year.

Property owners could have avoided paying the &euro;200 had they paid the original &euro;100 when it was due, or had paid the charge plus accrued interest any time prior to 1 July 2013.\u00a0 Furthermore, the Deputy will be aware that Revenue offered an opportunity which was well publicised to pay the &euro;200 charge without further interest.<\/p><p>  As I previously informed the House in my reply to Questions 168 and 169 on 6 May, the Revenue Commissioners undertook a comprehensive data matching exercise between the Local Property Tax Register and the Household Charge Register and identified a database of some 400,000 properties for which the Household Charge (HHC) was outstanding. The Commissioners have confirmed that work on verifying this database of non-compliant HHC property owners is continuing. <\/p><p>  The House was also informed that it is accepted that the database may not be 100% accurate for a number of reasons, including:<\/p><p>  - The LGMA Register captured the name of the person who paid the HHC rather than the owner of the property, therefore, for example, where a son or daughter paid the HHC on behalf of a parent and particularly where the address of the property was a 'non-unique' rural address, Revenue may not have been able to match the HHC payment to the right property;<\/p><p>  - The legislative basis for both the HHC and LPT are different. Some properties that are liable for LPT were exempt from the HHC and, unlike LPT, property owners were not actually required to make a claim for exemption from HHC.\u00a0 For that reason, Revenue could not identify every property that was exempt from HHC through the cross-referencing process;<\/p><p>  - There are some examples where the LGMA register did not fully record situations where the HHC was paid to a Local Authority directly.\u00a0 In all its communications with property owners during the current compliance campaign, the Revenue Commissioners have highlighted that these inconsistencies exist and have outlined the action that owners need to take if the HHC is not due.The Commissioners have also confirmed that to date they have written to some 227,000 property owners who, according to their records, had not paid the &euro;200 arrears in respect of about 273,800 properties. The Commissioners are continuing to examine the remaining cases on their database of HHC arrears and further letters will issue in due course. The published forecasted yield for LPT in 2014 of &euro;550m took full account of the work to be done by the Revenue Commissioners in relation to HHC. This figure includes estimates for LPT payments received in 2014, which are likely in the normal course to include current tax, arrears and prepayments, and HHC arrears collected this year.<\/p><p>  The Commissioners advise that it is not possible at this stage to confirm how much they will collect in 2014 in relation to HHC arrears or if the forecast of &euro;550m will be achieved. This will depend on the outcome of their Household Charge compliance campaign, bearing in mind the database issues set out above.\u00a0 However, while the HHC receipts will be recorded as LPT in the Revenue data, the amount of HHC paid will be identifiable, and will be capable of being reported on. <\/p><p>  I am also informed that, to date, about &euro;2m was collected in 2013, &euro;13.8m has already been collected in 2014, of which &euro;8.2m was paid since Revenue's compliance campaign began on 17 April 2014.\u00a0 The Commissioners continue to receive approximately 3,500 to 4,000 payments of HHC arrears every day.<\/p><p>  I am further advised by Revenue that they will shortly begin to take appropriate enforcement action against any property owner that they have written to in connection with HHC arrears and the property owner has not responded.\u00a0 Such enforcement action may include deduction at source from salaries, occupational pension and certain Government payments as well as sheriff or solicitor action.\u00a0 I strongly encourage any property owner, therefore, who has not dealt with their arrears of HHC to do so as a matter of urgency.<\/p><p>  As regards allocation of LPT, the legislation provides that, in each financial year commencing with 2014, the Minister shall pay from the Central Fund or the growing produce thereof into the Local Government Fund (LGF) an amount equivalent to the LPT, including any interest paid thereon, paid into the Central Fund during that year.

This means their pensions are integrated with the State contributory pension (meaning in particular that the calculation of their civil service pension reflects an offset in respect of assumed entitlement to the State contributory pension). By contrast, pre-1995 civil servants who in general pay a lower modified rate of social insurance, do not qualify for most social welfare benefits and receive occupational pensions which are not integrated with the State contributory pension.<\/p><p>USC is charged on all occupational pensions, both public and private sector, whereas social welfare pensions are exempt.

It was also estimated that to treat non-integrated public sector pensions as exempt from USC would have cost &euro;90 million.

The CCMA is issued under Section 117 of the Central Bank Act 1989 and lenders covered by the Code are required to comply with it as a matter of law.\u00a0 The Central Bank has the power to administer sanctions for a contravention of this Code.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p><p>  On the BTL mortgage aspect, the Residential Tenancies Act 2004, which falls within the remit of the Minister for Housing and Planning, provides the main regulatory framework for the private rental sector and prescribes the statutory rights and obligations of landlords and tenants.<\/p><p>  The Central Bank published the revised CCMA in June 2013.\u00a0 As part of the financial institutions' delivery of full implementation of the revised CCMA, the boards of directors of all mortgage lenders were required by the Central Bank to sign off that all of the provisions of the revised CCMA had been fully implemented and tested and that staff training had been completed.\u00a0\u00a0 Compliance with the CCMA will continue to be central to the Central Bank's work programme throughout 2014 and an inspection of mortgage lenders to test compliance with the revised CCMA will be conducted later this year.\u00a0 <\/p><p>The CCMA provides a strong consumer protection framework to ensure that borrowers struggling to keep up mortgage repayments are treated in a fair and transparent manner by their lender, and that long term resolution is sought by lenders with each of their borrowers. If a borrower is not happy with the way that their lender is dealing with them or if they think the lender is not complying with the CCMA, the borrower can make a complaint to their lender.

Such a mechanism is in place since June 2011 and the Air Pollution Act (Marketing, Sale, Distribution and Burning of Specified Fuels) Regulations 2012 specify the environmental standards for coal placed on the market and provide the regulatory framework in relation to the distribution and sale of coal in the State.<\/p><p>  In particular, the Regulations require that all bituminous coal sold and used outside smoky coal ban areas for residential use outside those areas must have a sulphur content of no more than 0.7%, which is lower than that in Northern Ireland and therefore bituminous coal supplied to Northern Ireland standards for sale on that market may not be sold in the State. Compliance with the Regulations is be enforced by local authorities. A verification mechanism, SWiFT 7, has been developed by the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) for the verification of sulphur content in coal. This provides for a robust mechanism to verify the sulphur content of coal to national standards. <\/p><p>  Suppliers who produce and supply solid fuels in contravention of the Regulations are subject to investigation and prosecution under the Air Pollution Act by local authorities charged with enforcing the regulations and preventing such supply.<\/p><p>  The application of the carbon tax to solid fuels was further postponed in 2012 given the overall tax increases in Budget 2012 including in the standard rate of VAT.<\/p><p>Budget 2013 commenced the application of carbon tax to solid fuels but\u00a0I chose not to introduce this until after the 2012\/2103 winter period and opted to introduce the tax in two phases i.e. &euro;10 per tonne of CO2 from 1 May 2013 and a further &euro;10 per tonne of CO2 from 1 May 2014 thus bringing the carbon tax on solid fuels in line with that on all other fossil fuels i.e. at &euro;20 per tonne of CO2. <\/p><p>  The introduction of Carbon Tax was about sending a price signal that there is a cost associated with the consumption of fossil fuels to the detriment of the environment. It should also be noted that solid fuels have the highest carbon content of all fossil fuels. As a result they are considered the dirtiest fuels and given the environmental impact it is important that they are taxed.<\/p><p>  While tax increases are unpopular, where Member States are under fiscal pressure, it makes sense to increase taxes in areas where some benefits can arise, in this instance a carbon tax promotes energy efficiency, reduces emissions and reduces our dependence on imported fossil fuels.<\/p><p>  Accordingly I do not intend to reverse the\u00a0Carbon Tax increase on solid fuels from 1 May 2014.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051300058#WRF03900","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":297,"content":"<p>Question No. 208 answered with Question No. 206.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"IBRC Liquidation","counter":298,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051300058#WRF04050"},{"type":"question","counter":299,"qnumday":209,"qnumall":"[21389\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051300058#WRF04100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 23 of 8 April 2014, the total number of restitution payments made to relevant parties and the total value of all restitution and miscellaneous charges; if any creditors from outside this jurisdiction are yet to claim restitution; and the number of Irish Credit Unions that have been classed as unsecured creditors by the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation Special Liquidators.","asker":"1015","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":300,"content":"<p>Unfortunately I\u00a0am not in a position to provide a response in relation to the first part of this question as it appears to be outside my area of responsibility as Minister for Finance.<\/p><p>In relation to the number of Irish Credit Unions that have been classed as unsecured creditors in the liquidation of IBRC I understand that there are 16 Credit Unions\u00a0that held tracker bonds in IBRC that will now stand as unsecured creditors.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051300058#WRF04200","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Household Charge Collection","counter":301,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051300058#WRF04250"},{"type":"question","counter":302,"qnumday":210,"qnumall":"[21424\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051300058#WRF04300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the options open to a person (details supplied) in Dublin 11, to appeal or in any way request a review of the arrears charges that have been applied to their household charge demand as a result of a genuine misunderstanding about the application of the exemption criteria; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1178","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":303,"content":"<p> I am advised by Revenue that the record provided to it by the Local Government Management Agency (LGMA) in respect of the property in question indicated that the Household Charge (HHC) was not paid and that an exemption or waiver certificate had not issued. <\/p><p>  Revenue is satisfied from its own review of the case that the person in question is the registered owner of the relevant property since prior to 2012 and is therefore liable for the HHC.\u00a0 While Section 4 of the Local Government (Household Charge) Act 2011 provides for exemptions from the HHC for some categories of properties, no such exemption applies in cases where a property was acquired prior to 2012 under the Local Authority Purchase Scheme and Revenue has no discretion in this regard.\u00a0 <\/p><p>  However, notwithstanding the above, Revenue recognises that the person in question acted in good faith based on the information he received.

Discussions are scheduled to take place this week.  The measure will have no tax cost until 2017 at the earliest and is tentatively estimated to have a tax cost of &euro;20 million in 2018. The measure is intended to encourage entrepreneurship and the number of jobs created will be dependent on the success or otherwise of the enterprises created with the support of the measure.<\/p><p>  A tax scheme for the construction or refurbishment of certain aviation services facilities, as provided for in Finance Act 2013, is subject to EU approval.

These schools have had appeals to the Primary Staffing Appeals Board provisionally upheld and will not lose their posts pending actual enrolments in September 2014.<\/p><p>The Government recognises that small schools are an important part of the social fabric of rural communities. They will continue to be a feature of our education landscape. How best to sustain provision for widely dispersed and small local communities does present as a particular challenge, especially in any locality where enrolment is declining to single figures. In these extremely challenging times, all public servants are being asked to deliver our public services on a reduced level of resources and teachers in small schools cannot be immune from this requirement.<\/p><p>My Department and I will continue to engage with the relevant education sector stakeholders in relation to education provision for all areas.<\/p><p>Our current configuration of small primary schools has been examined by the Department in a value for money (VFM) review. This review took account of the ethos of schools and the locations of small schools relative to other schools of a similar type. I am currently considering this review in consultation with my Government colleagues and I intend to publish the report on completion of this consideration process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051300060#WRH02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Summer Works Scheme Applications","counter":401,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051300060#WRH02150"},{"type":"question","counter":402,"qnumday":244,"qnumall":"[21075\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051300060#WRH02200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"to explain the reason a school (details supplied) was not successful in the recent summer works scheme; if consideration will be given to an emergency works application; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1071","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":403,"content":"<p>The Deputy will be aware that I recently announced details of the schools that will receive Summer Works Scheme funding in 2014 in respect of applications submitted for Categories 1 to 6 i.e. Gas, Electrical, Mechanical, Toilet Facilities and Roof Works projects.

As the Deputies will be aware, the overriding objective of Education capital expenditure is to meet the demographic challenge facing the education system, whereby total pupil enrolment in both primary and post-primary schools is expected to grow by around 107,000 additional pupils between 2012 and 2019 - over 70,000 at primary level and over 35,000 at post primary - and will continue to rise at post primary level to the year 2026, at least.  A priority therefore for my Department is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places.  My Department is not in a position to develop one school where this may negatively impact on other schools in the area. <\/p><p>  In the case of Sligo, it is projected that whilst overall pupil numbers across the 13 schools in the Sligo catchment area will be relatively stable up to 2019, it is anticipated that overall pupil enrolment numbers will decline thereafter.  In terms of school accommodation, there is sufficient capacity available within existing schools to cater for the demand for school places.  In that regard, an additional 8 classrooms catering for up to 224 pupils in the case of the school, in question, has the potential to have a significant impact on other schools in the same catchment area.  In light of the above, the school authority has been advised that my Department is not in a position to accede to the school's request in respect of an additional class of junior infants in September 2014. <\/p><p>  However to assess further the pupil enrolment trends in the Sligo area including information on school pre-enrolments for the 2014\/2015 academic year, my Department will be contacting the Patron and school authorities of the 13 primary schools in the Sligo area.  When this data has been obtained and reviewed, my Department will communicate further with the Patron and school authority in question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051300061#WRJ03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs Staffing","counter":489,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051300061#WRJ03850"},{"type":"question","counter":490,"qnumday":278,"qnumall":"[21541\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051300061#WRJ03900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the widespread concerns in relation to the new requirement that persons providing tuition for children with special needs during the month of July, commonly referred to as the July provision, have to be registered with the Teaching Council of Ireland; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that many parents are concerned that this requirement will deny some special needs assistants the opportunity to continue working with those children; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The OPW allocated funding to Kerry County Council of &euro;180,000 under the Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme in 2012 for works to embankments at Cromane and Incherea. This funding has been drawn down by the Council and the works in question have been undertaken.<\/p><p>The Government decided on 11 February, 2014 to make available funding of up to &euro;69.5 million for a programme of repair and remediation works to roads, coastal protection and flood defence and other public infrastructure damaged in the storms from 13 December, 2013 to 6 January, 2014 based on estimates provided by the local authorities concerned. Of the total amount being made available, up to &euro;19.6 million is available via the Office of Public Works (OPW) for the repair of damaged coastal protection and flood defence infrastructure. The allocation of funding to local authorities under the Government Decision was to specifically address the repair of existing damaged infrastructure as a matter of priority.<\/p><p>The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government (DoECLG) wrote to Kerry County Council indicating, based on the estimate submitted by the Council to that Department, that up to &euro;1,226,920 is being made available to the Council via the OPW to undertake the necessary repair works to damaged coastal protection and flood defence infrastructure. The estimates submitted by Kerry County Council to the DoECLG included strengthening works at Incherea and Glenbeigh and both repair and strengthening works at Cromane Lower. Strengthening works fall outside of the scope of the Government Decision, and the Council will need to address this separately and outside of the current process aimed at repairs and emergency works. <\/p><p>The Council must submit overall programmes of works to the DoECLG detailing how it proposes to spend the total allocation that is being made available. The Council must also submit the relevant elements of its programme to each Department from whom funding will be made available for consideration of technical aspects of the proposed works. When the Council's programme of coastal protection and flood defence projects is received by the OPW it will be reviewed having regard to related guidance issued by the DoECLG to the local authorities. <\/p><p>The OPW has informed the local authorities that in order to assist them in a practical way and to avoid any potential cash-flow issues, it will consider requests for advance funding of up to 80% of the estimated cost of approved projects where a contract for works has been made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051300063#WRL00800","answer":true,"speaker":"958"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Redeployment","counter":574,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051300063#WRL00850"},{"type":"question","counter":575,"qnumday":307,"qnumall":"[21156\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051300063#WRL00900","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if a direct transfer with another willing employee can be facilitated under the redeployment scheme.","asker":"1065","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":576,"content":"<p>The Public Service Agreements (PSAs) covering the period 2010-16 (the Croke Park and Haddington Road Agreements) provide for agreed redeployment arrangements to apply in the Civil Service and in other parts of the Public Service.\u00a0 The Agreements\u00a0facilitate the transfer of staffing resources from organisations where activities have assumed lesser priority arising from changing business needs, or as a result of\u00a0the rationalisation, reconfiguration or restructuring of public service bodies, to organisations that are facing increasing demands for its services and consequential resource pressures.

As is standard in such cases, the CRO was requested to supply a Letter of &quot;no objection&quot; to the restoration and it issued such a letter in April 2007 stating it would have no objection to the restoration provided the company delivered in advance to the CRO all of its outstanding Annual Returns and Accounts for the period 1991-2007 in this case. <\/p><p>The requested Annual Returns and Accounts were delivered to the CRO and as they appeared in order on their face and were duly signed by officers of the company, as notified to the CRO they were accepted by the CRO in April 2007 and are available as registered documents on the public register of companies.<\/p><p>I am further advised by the CRO that two B10 Forms (&quot;Notification of appointment\/resignation of director\/secretary or change in details of director\/secretary&quot;  ) were submitted to the Office on 14 February 2007.  As these Forms appeared on their face to be in order and duly signed, they were subsequently registered by the CRO.  The CRO was the recipient of further statutory filings and non-statutory correspondence from the company between its restoration in 2007 and 2010. The CRO is satisfied that the register now reflects accurately the position of appointment of directors and secretaries as notified to the registrar by the company. The onus rests with companies and their officers to ensure that accurate information is filed with the CRO.<\/p><p>It would appear that there is a dispute between a number of parties attached to the company. One of the parties has alleged that the B10 filings of February 2007 were &ldquo;fraudulent&rdquo; and the CRO advised the complainant to refer the complaint to the appropriate authorities for investigation. <\/p><p>I should stress that the CRO does not have an adjudication role in relation to the determination of who was, or who was not, a director or secretary of a company at a particular point in time. The role of the CRO is to register the various statutory forms submitted by companies that on their face comply with the statutory requirements. It would be a matter for the Courts to determine a dispute as to who, in fact, the directors of a particular company were on various dates.  The CRO would immediately comply with any direction issued by the Court in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051300063#WRL03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Bodies","counter":606,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051300063#WRL03050"},{"type":"question","counter":607,"qnumday":319,"qnumall":"[20908\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051300063#WRL03100","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the number of commercial semi-State companies under the aegis of his Department; the current value of the pension fund assets held by each commercial semi-State company; the latest funding position of each; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1100","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":608,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Deputy that none of the bodies under the aegis of my Department is a commercial semi-State company.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051300063#WRL03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Jobs Data","counter":609,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051300063#WRL03250"},{"type":"question","counter":610,"qnumday":320,"qnumall":"[21073\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051300063#WRL03300","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if his Department tracks the correlation between the number of job announcements by Industrial Development Agency Ireland and the numbers created within the time period projected at the time of the announcement; if he will make available his analysis of jobs announced versus jobs created; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1071","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":611,"content":"<p>For a variety of reasons not all projects won by IDA Ireland are publicly announced.

In section 6(4) the Acts provide for potentially fair reasons for dismissal, including the conduct of an employee.  The Acts state that, in determining whether the dismissal of an employee was an unfair dismissal or not, it shall be for the employer to show that the dismissal resulted wholly or mainly from one or more of the matters specified in Section 6(4) or that there were other substantial grounds justifying the dismissal.  The Acts further provide that in determining if a dismissal is an unfair dismissal, regard may be had, if the Rights Commissioner, the Employment Appeals Tribunal or the Circuit Court, as the case may be, consider it appropriate to do so to, amongst other things, the reasonableness of the conduct of the employer in relation to the dismissal.  Each case is adjudicated upon on its merits and the facts of the case.<\/p><p>  An employee who has been dismissed may take a case under the Acts within 6 months of the date of dismissal (this can be extended to 12 months in exceptional circumstances).

This investment is critical to support Ireland&rsquo;s Innovation ecosystem, to ensure we are an attractive location for investment and to develop high value human capital for our economy. In addition to these benefits the commercialisation of research represents one of the most direct ways a return from this investment can be seen and this return is most recognisably evidenced by the number of commercially valuable technologies transferred from the higher education sector to industry and the number of spinout companies created that are based on academic research. Enterprise Ireland is the State agency with responsibility for the commercialisation of all research funded in the State. Enterprise Ireland employs two main approaches in commercialising Irish research; it funds the commercialisation &amp;amp; technology transfer infrastructure in the State and it operates a commercialisation funding programme.<\/p><p>The aim of the technology transfer infrastructural support is to increase the level and quality of Intellectual Property (IP) from research, and to help create effective systems to transfer this valuable knowledge into companies in Ireland. This transfer of technology to companies results in the creation of new products, processes and services which can be scaled-up for export. Enterprise Ireland supports technology transfer through its Technology Transfer Strengthening Programme (TTSI), which supports the Technology Transfer Offices in the third levels sector in bringing fresh ideas from the research environment to the attention of existing industry in a useable format. A review of the initial TTSI programme is due to be completed early this year. Results to date show that this programme has performed well.  In 2005, before Enterprise Ireland technology transfer support existed, 12 technologies were licensed to industry. This figure has increased significantly since then, with 119 licenses to industry in 2013. The second phase of the Technology Transfer Strengthening Programme (TTSI 2) was launched in 2012. TSSI 2 is a &euro;22 million initiative (&euro;5.5 million per annum from 2013-2016), which will significantly boost interaction between industry and higher education institutions. This work represents a key part of the process of unlocking the creative potential of researchers to support innovation in industry, leading to jobs and economic growth. Building on the investment to date, the overall objectives of phase 2 of the Technology Transfer Strengthening Initiative are to develop the Irish technology transfer system such that it will respond quickly and flexibly to industry, deliver direct economic benefits, and radically enhancing the culture of commercialisation among researchers in the Irish HEI sector.

The KTI will make it easier for companies to access and use ideas developed through publicly-funded research and to develop new products and services and ultimately create jobs and exports. The KTI will also ensure that the IP Protocol launched in 2012 is delivering to the needs of business and stakeholders. The remit of the KTI will include promoting, enabling and monitoring HEI\/business engagement across a wide range of intellectual assets. Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Commercialisation Fund Programme aims to improve the competitiveness of the Irish economy through the creation of technology based start-up companies and the transfer of innovations developed in Higher Education Institutes and Research Performing Organisations to industry in Ireland. The programme funds the development of innovations at all stages of the commercial pipeline to the point where they can be commercialised.<\/p><p>The following number of projects received support from the Commercialisation Fund in each of the last three years:<\/p><p>- 2011: 65 projects<\/p><p>- 2012: 105 projects<\/p><p>- 2013: 64 projects<\/p><p>The number of academic-industry research collaborations is also a relevant indicator of commercialisation performance in the system. In 2013, Ireland was ranked 13th out of 132 countries in the 2012\/13 Global Competitiveness Report. This improvement is driven by Government policy and by ongoing Enterprise Ireland and Science Foundation programmes aimed at driving collaboration. In 2013, EI supported 839 collaborative innovations between industry and third level. This figure is comprised of the redeemed Innovation Voucher figure, the Technology Gateway projects, Innovation Partnerships and supported FP7 collaborative projects. When this is added to the circa 300 companies in Technology Centres, this gives a figure of over 1,100 companies were engaged in collaborative research projects in 2013 via Enterprise Ireland schemes. In 2013, SFI researchers were involved in over 1,000 linkages with industry working directly with over 700 companies. This represents a significant increase over the 2010 figure of 534 and the 2009 figure of 389.<\/p><p>Ireland is scoring top of the class in Europe in terms of knowledge transfer. In the European Commission Knowledge Transfer Study 2010-2012 (published June 2013) Ireland is ranked first (out of 23 countries) in terms of knowledge transfer performance of public research organisations in individual countries. Ireland has also been ranked third in the EU according to the new &quot;Indicator of Innovation Output&quot; which measures the extent to which ideas from innovative sectors are able to reach the market, providing better jobs and making Europe more competitive. This provides strong evidence that our research investment is delivering on economic growth and the jobs agenda.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051300064#WRM00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Bodies Data","counter":631,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051300064#WRM00350"},{"type":"question","counter":632,"qnumday":327,"qnumall":"[21797\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051300064#WRM00400","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the number of State agencies and public bodies that have been merged or abolished in each year since 2011, under the remit of his Department; the annual savings associated with each body; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1100","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":633,"content":"<p>There is a substantial programme of reform underway within my Department in relation to Agencies and public bodies.

The Industrial Development (Forf&aacute;s Dissolution) Bill 2013 was passed by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 9th April 2014 and has now been referred to the Seanad with an expected commencement date of 20th May.

As Forfas is likely to be dissolved mid year 2014, the Forfas Board will no longer exist and the anticipated saving in 2014 would be approximately &euro;88,000.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Transfer relevant enterprise functions from Shannon Development to IDA, EI and Bord F&aacute;ilte and merge Shannon Development with Shannon Airport<\/td><td>Shannon Development&rsquo;s functions and the associated staff in relation to indigenous enterprises and foreign direct investment have been transferred to Enterprise Ireland and IDA respectively.

The restructuring of Shannon Development has been completed.  The Government recently approved legislation &quot;State Airports (Shannon Group) Bill 2014&quot; to establish the Shannon Group as part of a drive to establish an International Aviation Services Centre in the mid-west with the aim of delivering new routes and new jobs for the region.<\/td><td>This is a restructuring and merger of Shannon Development and Shannon Airport.

The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer.  There are currently approximately 77,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;344 million for 2014. <\/p><p>The Department continues to monitor trends in the private rental market to determine the impact on rent supplement recipients.  Following the most recent review of the private rental market revised maximum rent limits were introduced from Monday 17 June 2013 until 31 December 2014.  Despite the overall pressures on the social protection budget, there were increases in the rent limits in Dublin, Galway, North Kildare and Bray areas.  <\/p><p>Any further changes to the rent limits would have to be considered in a budgetary context.  A full rent limit review will be commenced shortly and will be completed in time to feed into the budgetary process.  <\/p><p>All prospective tenants, including those seeking to access rent supplement, are now finding it increasingly difficult to secure appropriate accommodation due to the reduced availability of rental properties.  The market shows no sign of reaching its equilibrium and increasing the maximum rent limits for rent supplement will not resolve the current difficulties due to the reduced level of supply, and would result in further increases in rental costs for all persons renting including those on reduced incomes and students.  <\/p><p>The Community Welfare Services, including through its work in the Homeless Persons Unit and the Asylum Seekers &amp;amp; New Communities Unit, works closely with local authorities and other stakeholders to facilitate homeless persons to access private rented accommodation.  This ensures that where possible, people are diverted away from homeless services and towards community-based supports.  Department officials have discretionary powers to award a supplement where it appears that the circumstances of the case so warrant and is of an exceptional nature.<\/p><p>In addition and in view of the current supply difficulties,<b><\/b>the Dublin local authorities are currently engaging with the Department in finalising a further interagency intervention system to identify vulnerable families who are in receipt of rent supplement and at risk of becoming homeless due to the imminent loss of their tenancy to ensure that the necessary supports can be put in place.  These cases will be assessed on an individual basis having regard to the individual circumstances and families requiring additional support will receive the necessary assistance, financial or otherwise. <\/p><p>The Department is represented on the Homelessness Implementation Team, chaired by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, which will ensure greater integration between the key agencies involved in the area of homelessness as recommended by the First Report of the Homelessness Oversight Group. <\/p><p>The Department's strategic policy direction is to return rent supplement to its original purpose of a short term income support.  In July 2013 the Government approved the introduction of the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP).  Under HAP, responsibility for recipients of rent supplement with a long-term housing need will transfer from the Department of Social Protection to local authorities.  Officials in the Department are working closely with those in the lead Department of Environment, Community and Local Government, in piloting HAP in Limerick City and County Council with further roll out to a further six selected local authorities during the year. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051300065#WRN02600","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Appeals","counter":727,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051300065#WRN02650"},{"type":"question","counter":728,"qnumday":359,"qnumall":"[21059\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051300065#WRN02700","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the progress to date in respect of determination of appeal for carer's allowance in the case of a person (details supplied) in County Meath; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

The programme is not intended to represent full-funding for any operation. Some &euro;45 million has been provided for the programme in 2014.<\/p><p>  Each contract holder is responsible for their own budgets, income, financial and other liabilities.

The operations were reviewed as part of a re-contracting process undertaken by Pobal in respect of proposed activities for the period 2014-16.  The process involved the submission of business plans by the company and an evaluation of performance by Pobal before recommendations were made to the Department.  The business plan submitted by the company was considered weak and did not articulate the need for the service or the value to be gained from the expenditure of public funds.  Contrary to the requirements of the programme, the company&rsquo;s business plan was predicated on near full reliant on CSP to fund its activities.  The company is unable to generate sufficient income to fund overhead and activity costs<\/p><p>  In the circumstances, the Department considered that the expenditure of public funds could no longer be justified.  The company was advised of the outcome of the evaluation of the business plan.  Pobal staff met with this company on the 5th of March to give feedback on why the decision was made.  While the company was also given the opportunity to lodge a review of the decision, they have not done so to date.

In this regard, my Department conducted a critical examination of the structure and operation of the institutions included in the Public Service Reform Plan and developed a comprehensive and practical approach to the implementation of the various Government Decisions in this area. This was endorsed by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.

As all lakes are stocked from the rearing-on facility at Inchigeela on a weekly basis, the cost of continuing to stock Lough Caum, which is the furthest lake away from this facility, is prohibitive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051300068#WRQ01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1069"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Semi-State Bodies","counter":886,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051300068#WRQ01550"},{"type":"question","counter":887,"qnumday":425,"qnumall":"[20901\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051300068#WRQ01600","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the number of commercial semi-State companies under the aegis of his Department; the current value of the pension fund assets held by each commercial semi-State company; the latest funding position of each; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

This will be achieved by providing a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment; and a State-led intervention for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.<\/p><p>During the preparation of the Next Generation Broadband Taskforce report, which concluded its deliberations in 2012, service providers noted the importance of planning and consent processes in facilitating the roll out of infrastructure to support the provision of telecommunications services. I would point out that the Local Authority has a strong role to play in facilitating the roll-out of the necessary infrastructure to help enable service availability throughout the Country. In the case of County Kerry, I note that the County Development Plan recommends against siting a mast within 1km of dwellings. I understand that this is contributing to difficulties in providing good quality broadband and telecommunications services generally in the county.<\/p><p>The Government's National Broadband Plan which I subsequently published, commits to addressing barriers to deployment in order to maximise investment by the commercial sector and assist in enhancing the quality of services. Local Authorities have an important role to play in this regard, particularly in facilitating the provision of infrastructure that supports wireless and fixed line services.<\/p><p>Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway and in some instances have been accelerated in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services. Commercial operators combined have either invested, or committed to invest, over &euro;2 billion in their Irish networks, delivering high speed broadband to homes and businesses. For example:<\/p><p>-  Eircom is rolling out a &euro;400m investment in a Next Generation Access Fibre Network that offers speeds of up to 100Mbps. Service is already available to over 800,000 addresses, with planned coverage to reach 1.4m addresses by 2016.<\/p><p>-  UPC has invested over &euro;500m in upgrading its cable network. Over 700,000 homes can already access minimum broadband speeds of 120Mbps and up to 200Mbps. Businesses can access speeds of 500Mbps.<\/p><p>-  ESB is engaged in a new project allowing a fibre network to be rolled-out on its existing electricity infrastructure. It is understood that discussions between ESB and Vodafone to form a new Joint Venture Company are at an advanced stage. The company has initial plans to construct a fibre network directly to 450,000 premises outside of Dublin and it is expected that details will be announced over the coming weeks.<\/p><p>-  Mobile operators have launched 4G high speed mobile broadband services following ComReg&rsquo;s multiband spectrum auction. There has also been continued investment by all operators in enhancing and broadening 3G services and network improvements.<\/p><p>-  Fixed wireless operators are continuing to invest in high speed point-to-point wireless broadband.<\/p><p>-  The broadcaster Sky has entered the broadband market, increasing choice for consumers.<\/p><p>Of the estimated 2.3 million premises in Ireland, approximately 1.4m are expected to be served by these commercial next generation broadband services over the coming years.<\/p><p>This accelerated roll out of high speed services by the commercial sector means that the addressable area required by the State intervention has been reduced by 30% since the National Broadband Plan was launched. While the commercial developments are welcome the acceleration of investment is largely contained to cities and towns. The speeds that are available in these areas are demonstrably better than those that are available in more rural areas.<\/p><p>On 25 April, I signalled the Government's commitment to a major telecommunications network build-out to rural Ireland, with fibre as the foundation of its investment under the National Broadband Plan.

It is intended that the fibre will be delivered directly to access points for homes and businesses, where service providers can utilise the fibre to provide high speed services to end users. The fibre build-out will also ensure that fibre is deployed to strategic locations on each route such as schools, business hubs and health facilities. The fibre build out will be part of an end-to-end strategy that will address all parts of Ireland that cannot access commercial high speed broadband services.<\/p><p>I have published a county-by-county list of towns and villages which have already been identified for a fibre build-out. This is an indicative list and is subject to the completion of the comprehensive mapping process currently underway. Further locations may be identified as this process continues. Similarly, it may be determined that some locations on the list will be addressed by the commercial sector and will therefore not require State intervention. Currently I envisage that a total of 59 areas in County Kerry will be included in the proposed fibre build-out. The list is available on my Departments website .<\/p><p>In tandem with the fibre build-out, the Strategy will include measures to respond to aggregated community demand for services, and the provision of access services in the most remote areas where fibre roll out may be insufficient to stimulate commercial investment or may be cost-prohibitive.  Intensive design work is ongoing in the Department with a view to publishing an end-to-end implementation strategy later this year, together with the outcome of the mapping exercise which will identify the areas that require intervention. A full public consultation will take place once the strategy is published and EU State Aids clearance will be required for the intervention strategy once finalised.

I intend to ensure that rural Ireland enjoys similar opportunities to urban areas by ensuring an end-to end market intervention with fibre as a core component.

Commercial operators combined have either invested, or committed to invest, over &euro;2 billion in their Irish networks, delivering high speed broadband to homes and businesses. For example:<\/p><p>-  Eircom is rolling out a &euro;400m investment in a Next Generation Access Fibre Network that offers speeds of up to 100Mbps. Service is already available to over 800,000 addresses, with planned coverage to reach 1.4m addresses by 2016.<\/p><p>-  UPC has invested over &euro;500m in upgrading its cable network. Over 700,000 homes can already access minimum broadband speeds of 120Mbps and up to 200Mbps. Businesses can access speeds of 500Mbps.<\/p><p>-  ESB is engaged in a new project allowing a fibre network to be rolled-out on its existing electricity infrastructure. It is understood that discussions between ESB and Vodafone to form a new Joint Venture Company are at an advanced stage. The company has initial plans to construct a fibre network directly to 450,000 premises outside of Dublin and it is expected that details will be announced over the coming weeks.<\/p><p>-  Mobile operators have launched 4G high speed mobile broadband services following ComReg&rsquo;s multiband spectrum auction. There has also been continued investment by all operators in enhancing and broadening 3G services and network improvements.<\/p><p>-  Fixed wireless operators are continuing to invest in high speed point-to-point wireless broadband.<\/p><p>-  The broadcaster Sky has entered the broadband market, increasing choice for consumers.<\/p><p>This accelerated roll out of high speed services by the commercial sector means that the addressable area required by the State intervention has been reduced by 30% since the National Broadband Plan was launched. While the commercial developments are welcome the acceleration of investment is largely contained to cities and towns.

This commitment is a clear expression of Government&rsquo;s determination to address the connectivity challenge in rural Ireland in a meaningful and sustainable way.<\/p><p>Central to the strategy will be a fibre build-out to locations in every county in the State identified as having no existing or planned enabling fibre network. It is intended that the fibre will be delivered directly to access points for homes and businesses, where service providers can utilise the fibre to provide high speed services to end users. The fibre build-out will also ensure that fibre is deployed to strategic locations on each route such as schools, business hubs and health facilities. The fibre build out will be part of an end-to-end strategy that will address all parts of Ireland that cannot access commercial high speed broadband services.<\/p><p>I have published a county-by-county list of towns and villages which have already been identified for a fibre build-out. This is an indicative list and is subject to the completion of the comprehensive mapping process currently underway. Further locations may be identified as this process continues. Similarly, it may be determined that some locations on the list will be addressed by the commercial sector and will therefore not require State intervention. The list is available on my Departments website . Currently I envisage that a total of 59 locations in County Kerry will be included in the proposed fibre build-out.  In tandem with the fibre build-out, the Strategy will include measures to respond to aggregated community demand for services, and the provision of access services in the most remote areas where fibre roll out may be insufficient to stimulate commercial investment or may be cost-prohibitive.<\/p><p>Intensive design work is ongoing in the Department with a view to publishing an end-to-end implementation strategy later this year, together with the outcome of the mapping exercise which will identify the areas that require intervention.

It is my intention to ensure that rural Ireland enjoys similar opportunities to urban areas by ensuring an end-to-end market intervention with fibre as a core component.

The Water Services (No.2) Act 2013 assigns responsibility for the independent economic regulation of Irish Water to the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER). In performing this role, the CER must ensure, inter alia, that Irish Water provides water services in an economical and efficient manner, that it operates in a commercially viable manner and that it can meet all reasonable demands for water, both current and foreseeable. <\/p><p>As part of their role, the CER will approve a water charges plan submitted by Irish Water. The CER has commenced the process leading to the submission of the first water charges plan of Irish Water, with public consultation underway on the approach to tariff structures and design. They plan to engage in public consultation on Irish Water&rsquo;s proposed water charges plan and the underlying operational and capital costs in June 2014. As part of this process, the detailed costs and revenue proposals for Irish Water for the first regulatory period to end 2016 will be outlined. Details of the public consultation plans of the CER are set out on their website ().   <\/p><p>As the free allowance and the level of funding to be provided by the Government to Irish Water will have a strong bearing on the net charges to be met by households, recent Government decisions on these matters provide greater visibility on the expected level of charges in advance of the final determination of all aspects of the water charges plan by the CER. The Government have decided to provide the following funding to Irish Water in 2015 and 2016:<\/p><p>-  An average subvention of &euro;537m in each of the two years, conditional on the annual average domestic water charges to end 2016 for households with both supply of water and treatment of waste water not exceeding &euro;240; and<\/p><p>-  Provision of just over &euro;400m in 2015 and 2016 to support increased investment in public water services, including the provision of a &ldquo;first fix scheme&rdquo; by Irish Water.   <\/p><p>The Government decisions on levels of funding and the approach to free allowance were informed a high level financial model prepared by NewERA, which was based on inputs provided by my Department and Irish Water. This model envisages that the total amount to be billed to domestic customers in 2015 will be approximately &euro;300 million, which factors in properties with only one service and holiday homes. The high level funding model is based on average operational costs, excluding interest costs and depreciation, over the period 2014 to 2016, estimated to be in the range of &euro;775m to &euro;800m per annum. The proposed operational costs by Irish Water will be the subject of careful scrutiny by the CER to ensure that only efficient costs are incurred. Similarly, they will review the proposed capital plans of Irish Water, which entail almost &euro;1.8 billion in proposed capital projects over the 3 year period, as well as the metering programme and establishment costs. Irish Water are considering the appropriate financing package to fund these costs, taking into account the capital funding which will amount to just over &euro;640m over the period 2014-2016, in addition to the operational subvention. The detailed plans in this regard will form part of the water charges plan, which will be published by the CER for public consultation in June 2014.   <\/p><p>Irish Water&rsquo;s Water Charges Plan as approved by the CER will take account of these Government Decisions and nisterial policy directions. This plan will provide the detailed position on costs and proposed revenues from different sources, and will have to be developed on the understanding that the average annual tariff for domestic customers with both supply of water and treatment of waste water will not exceed &euro;240. The CER will announce its decision on the approved water charges plan in August 2014. <\/p><p>It is proposed that from its inception, Irish Water should be classified as a Market Corporation under Eurostat rules and, as a result, will not, other than in relation to Government operating subvention, be included in the calculation of the General Government Balance. This is determined through the application of the Market Corporation Test which requires that income from customers (ex VAT where applicable) be greater than 50% of production costs (including consumption of fixed capital and including interest). The operational subvention agreed by Government for 2015 and 2016 is set in this context and represents just under 50% of the anticipated production costs of Irish Water. <\/p><p>This funding package for 2015 and 2014 builds on the funding being provided to Irish Water in 2014, which includes a proposed &euro;240 million equity investment from the Central Fund which subject to Eurostat confirmation\u00a0would not impact the General Government Deficit as this amount would be treated as an acquisition of equity rather than a capital transfer. The investment will be used to primarily fund the core capital expenditure programme of Irish Water.     <\/p><p>In addition, Irish Water will receive a subvention of &euro;486.5 million from the Local Government Fund in 2014 which will fund water related expenditures incurred heretofore by local authorities and met by local authorities from their own resources, non-domestic water charge revenues and general purpose grants from the Fund. It is anticipated that Irish Water will finance other costs from non-domestic water charge revenues of some &euro;190m and from borrowing, which will be the subject of appropriate nisterial consents in due course. As subvention and equity provision is based on funding provided to Irish Water, a breakdown by county of proposed expenditure is not available. <\/p><p>The first regulatory cycle is viewed as an interim regulatory cycle, with a full six year regulatory cycle to commence from 2017.  The CER will engage in full and detailed public consultation on the proposed water charges plan, and associated costs and revenues of Irish Water well in advance of that cycle commencing. As it is anticipated that Government subvention to Irish Water will continue beyond 2016, decisions will have to be made in a budgetary context on the level of Government support to Irish Water beyond 2016.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051300069#WRR01700","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Regeneration Projects Funding","counter":950,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051300069#WRR01750"},{"type":"question","counter":951,"qnumday":448,"qnumall":"[20831\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051300069#WRR01800","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will provide in tabular form the funding his Department has allocated to each regeneration project here in the current year; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1032","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":952,"content":"<p>The National Regeneration Programme targets the country&rsquo;s most disadvantaged communities; those defined by the most extreme social exclusion, unemployment and anti-social behaviour.

The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that Irish Water can collect charges from its customers in receipt of water services provided by it. The Act also provides that responsibility for the independent economic regulation of the water sector is assigned to the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and the CER has been given statutory responsibility for protecting the interests of customers.\u00a0   <\/p><p>Under the European Communities (Drinking Water) Regulation, 20 14 , a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas library, suppliers of drinking water are required to ensure that the water supplied is wholesome and clean. Water which is wholesome and clean is defined as water which is free from any micro-organisms and parasites and from any substances which in numbers or concentrations constitute a potential danger to human health, and which meets the quality standards specified in the Schedule to the Regulations. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is the supervisory authority with responsibility for monitoring Irish Water&rsquo;s compliance with these regulations.      <\/p><p>In the event of non-compliance with the quality standards set out in these Regulations, the water supplier will investigate the cause and, in consultation with the EPA and, if a potential risk to human health may exist, the Health Service Executive, ensure that the appropriate remedial action is taken. <\/p><p>The Water Services (No.2) Act 2013 requires the CER to perform its functions in a manner that best serves the interests of the customers of Irish Water. This is similar to the CER&rsquo;s statutory role in respect of the gas and electricity sectors. I fully expect that the CER will consider compliance with statutory standards by Irish Water in the discharge of its functions.   <\/p><p>The Government has decided, following consideration of proposals in relation to the funding model for Irish Water and taking account of the work of the Inter-Departmental Working Group, which was established to advise the Government on the appropriate method for addressing affordability issues which may arise with the introduction of domestic water charges , to provide a free allowance of 30,000 litres of water supplied and waste water treated per annum for a primary residence on a public supply. The Government has also decided to provide for an additional free allowance to cover the normal usage of water services by every child in their primary residence based on the same qualifying conditions as child benefit, such that water charges will in effect only apply to adults in such households. The normal consumption is estimated at 38,000 litres annually per child of water supplied and waste water treated and so the allowance being provided will be up to 38,000 litres per annum. This level of consumption will be verified over time through actual data from metering. There are no plans to provide additional allowances, other than those announced in the Government decision.   <\/p><p>I intend to use my powers under the Water Services (No.2) Act 2013 to issue a policy direction to the CER in relation to a number of matters relating to domestic water charges, including to ensure the water charges plan makes provision for circumstances where the quality of water services provided by Irish Water to customers is impaired or where services are reduced or restricted (e.g. customers with boil water notices). I also intend to provide   in the policy direction that for social and environmental reasons, there will be no standing charge for domestic customers . Owners of holiday homes who are customers of Irish Water will be required to pay water charges when they ar e introduced in October 2014 ; while there will be no standing charge, a minimum charge may apply to properties such as holiday homes which are not permanently occupied . Currently, if holiday homes are used commercially, they are already subject to non-domestic water charges.   <\/p><p>The approach to charging will be outlined by Irish Water in a water charges plan to be submitted by it to the CER in line with the provisions of the Act. The CER will be responsible for approving the water charges plan which will set the approaches to charging domestic and non-domestic customers . Irish Water funding will be conditional on the average charge for households being &euro;240 per year   . <\/p><p>In making its decision on the approval or otherwise of the first water charges plan, the CER will take into account the decisions made by Government on th e funding model for Irish Water and the policy direction issued under the Water Services (No.2) Act . The tariffs for 2015 and 2016 will be announced by the CER in August 2014.  It is estimated that Irish Water will have some 1.35 million domestic customers and the projected bills for different customers will depend on the volumetric charges and assessed charges set by the CER within the parameters of the Government decisions. <\/p><p>The CER has already undertaken public consultations on the development of the economic regulatory framework for water services . It   is also carrying out a number of public consultations on the water charges plan.   Currently, consultation is taking place on the approach to the design of domestic water tariffs for both metered and unmetered properties and the draft Irish Water customer handbook . Further consultations are planned for June in relation to other aspects of the water charges plan to be submitted to the CER by Irish Water. Full details of the CER&rsquo;s public consultation plans are available on its website ().<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051300069#WRR04500","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Water Charges Exemptions","counter":987,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051300069#WRR04550"},{"type":"question","counter":988,"qnumday":459,"qnumall":"[21130\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051300069#WRR04600","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if a person has dug their own well and there are no services available such as piping, lighting and so on, does this person have to pay the water charge; the reason for same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1004","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":989,"content":"<p>I refer to the reply to Question Nos. 119 and 127 of 1 May 2014.

Under the shared ownership scheme, a house is acquired by a local authority and leased to a shared owner, who purchases at least 40% of the value of the house and rents the remaining equity from the local authority. The local authority finances the transaction by borrowing from the Housing Finance Agency. The shared owner must purchase full ownership within 25 years. The Pre 2003 Index Linked Loan was introduced in 1991.\u00a0 The loan is split between annuity and rental portions.\u00a0 The annuity loan is repaid on the prevailing variable interest and capital basis. \u00a0Rent is charged at 4.3% on the rental equity balance.\u00a0 The rental equity balance is adjusted in line with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) each year.<\/p><p>  In January 2003, the Shared Ownership scheme was changed for all loans taken out from that date.\u00a0 The loan continues to be split between annuity and rental portions.\u00a0 Again, the annuity loan is repaid on the prevailing variable interest and capital basis.\u00a0 Post 2003, rent was charged as follows: <\/p><p>  - Rental Equity is treated as a capital loan <\/p><p>  - The Rental Equity reduces or increases according to the amount of rent paid over the amount payable on the going interest rate.\u00a0 <\/p><p>  - Initially rent is charged at 4.3% on the rental equity balance   and is increased by 4.5% on 1 July each year thereafter. <\/p><p> The rent is used to repay the cost of the local authority equity to the Housing Finance Agency and, depending on the level of mortgage interest rates obtaining, may also increase or decrease the capital outstanding on the local authority share at the end of each year. These arrangements represent a significant improvement on the previous terms of the scheme for the shared owner.  The main differences in the schemes are in the treatment of the rental equity. In the Pre 2003 scheme, the   rental equity balance is index\u00a0linked to the CPI. In the Post 2003 scheme, the rental equity balance is treated as a capital loan and can be paid down over time if the rent repayments exceed the interest amount due.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051300069#WRR05450","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1003,"content":"<p>Question No. 464 answered with Question No. 457.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Community Development Projects","counter":1004,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051300070#WRS00250"},{"type":"question","counter":1005,"qnumday":465,"qnumall":"[21212\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051300070#WRS00300","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if it is possible for there to be more than one local community development company set up in a local authority area; the procedure for this; the criteria for approving such an arrangement; if the decision to have more than one LCDC is one for him or the local authority in question to decide upon; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":1006,"content":"<p>The Local Government Reform Act 2014, which provides <i>inter alia<\/i>for the establishment of Local Community Development Committees   in all local authority areas, allows for the establishment of more than one Committee per local authority area.<\/p><p>The need to establish more than one Committee will be primarily a matter for the consideration of the relevant city or county council.

The Government considers that charging based on usage is the fairest way to charge for water and it has, therefore, decided that water meters should be installed in households connected to public water supplies. The Water Services Act 2013 provided for the establishment of Irish Water as an independent subsidiary within the Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann Group and assigned the necessary powers to allow Irish Water to undertake t he metering programme. In common with meters for other utility services, the meters will be the property of Irish Water which will also be responsible for meter repair and maintenance. The 2013 Act also provides that, for the purposes of the domestic metering programme, Irish Water is exempt from the requirement to obtain the consent of the relevant local authority. <\/p><p>Irish Water has confirmed to my Department that the meters it has procured comply with all relevant European and international standards designed to protect the health and safety of customers and the public.  Irish Water has also confirmed to my Department that it has a Quality Management System in place designed in accordance with the ISO 9001 standard. Additionally the regional contractors working for and on behalf of Irish Water on the metering programme all have Quality Management Systems designed in accordance with the ISO 9001 standard.<\/p><p>In designing the technical specification for the Metering Capital Programme, Irish Water has drawn both from international standards and from extensive local experience of the installation of both Grade B and Grade C meter box covers over the last 12 years.   Irish Water monitors the installations by its contractors and can require the installation of a Grade B meter box if it is deemed necessary. Irish Water regularly undertakes technical reviews of the metering programme with the aim of making improvements. <\/p><p>With effect from 1 January 2014, Irish Water is responsible for public water services. The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that Irish Water can collect charges from its customers in receipt of water services provided by it. The Act also provides that responsibility for the independent economic regulation of the water sector is assigned to the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and the CER has been given statutory responsibility for protecting the interests of customers.  Section 71 of the Water Services Act 2007 provides that Irish Water may require any consumer of water to take such supply through a water meter. Section 21 of the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that Irish Water shall not disconnect the supply of water to a household. However, Irish Water may reduce the supply of water to a property, where charges remain unpaid.<\/p><p>The 2013 Act also requires that Irish Water will prepare codes of practice, on a range of matters, including standards in relation to the performance by Irish Water of its functions and billing by Irish Water of persons in respect of water services provided. Irish Water will also be required to prepare a code of practice on any matter considered necessary by the CER. Consultation is currently being undertaken by the CER on the requirements for Irish Water in relation to the codes of practice, customer charters and terms and conditions.

More recently, a scheme was introduced that provides an up-front capital payment of up to 30% of the property value to facilitate AHBs in raising private finance to acquire or build new social housing units. The capital advanced is repayable at the end of a payment and availability agreement, usually after 30 years. <\/p><p>Under the terms of these various funding schemes, AHBs are the <i>de facto<\/i>owners of the properties and are required to make them available for social renting for the duration of the mortgage or, as the case may be, the availability agreement.\u00a0 My Department cannot unilaterally make provision for their sale to tenants.

International evidence has shown that where meters have been installed, significant reductions have been achieved in the level of consumption and this is also borne out by the water savings achieved with metering in the group water sector.

These inspections are mandatory and there are certain minimum numbers and types of inspections that must take place annually.<\/p><p>  The rate of inspections for cross-compliance is 1% of applicants to whom the Statutory Management Requirements (SMRs) and Good Agricultural Environmental Condition (GAEC) apply. However, 3% of farmers must be inspected under the bovine identification and registration requirements while 3% of sheep\/goat farmers must be inspected covering 5% of the flock.  <\/p><p>  EU regulations governing the Cross Compliance regime prescribe a range of penalties to be applied where a non-compliance with the relevant legislative provisions has been identified. Where the non-compliance is due to negligence the penalty is 3%, which can be reduced to 1% or increased to 5% depending on the extent, severity and permanence of the non-compliance. Where the non-compliance is determined as intentional, the standard reduction is 20%, but this can be reduced to 15% or increased to 100% depending on the extent, severity and permanence. <\/p><p>  While a red or yellow card procedure is not provided for, a tolerance system has been developed and implemented. Where a non-compliance is deemed to be minor in nature, tolerance may be applied resulting in no financial sanction and the applicant is advised to remedy the problem. However, where the minor non-compliance is not remedied within a certain period a penalty of at least 1% is applied. <\/p><p>  A comprehensive appeal mechanism is also in place in order to protect the interests of farmers who have difficulties with the inspection findings or who consider that the inspection has not been conducted in accordance with legislative requirements. This appeal system incorporates the option for a farmer to initially seek to have the inspection outcome reviewed internally by an officer more senior than the inspecting officer. Where the farmer remains dissatisfied, the decision can be appealed to the independent Agriculture Appeals Office and ultimately to the Office of the Ombudsman.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051300073#WRV00900","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Animal Welfare Expenditure","counter":1193,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051300073#WRV00950"},{"type":"question","counter":1194,"qnumday":537,"qnumall":"[21498\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051300073#WRV01000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the number of stray horses that have been seized by Department officials in each county in the first four months of the year and the total cost involved.","asker":"968","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1195,"content":"<p>My Department provides funding under the Control of Horses Act, 1996 to assist local authorities in implementing the provisions of the Act in relation to stray, abandoned and wandering horses.

It broadly describes a range of non-violent crimes that people in positions of responsibility and trust commit for their own personal gain. It can cover fraud, embezzlement, insider trading on the stock market, bribery, corruption and regulatory offences in specialist fields such as financial activity, occupational health and safety, environmental protection, and food safety.  My Department has responsibility for legislation addressing some aspects of white collar crime including fraud and corruption.  Other aspects, such as insider trading, Companies Acts offences and environmental offences fall within the responsibility of other Government Departments.<\/p><p>There is extensive legislation on the statute book addressing white collar and corporate crime and amendments to this legislation are also considered in the light of the experience of law enforcement agencies such as the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions in operating the legislation and in light of relevant court rulings.  Where there is an identified requirement for additional legislative provisions to further enhance existing provisions in the law, I will not hesitate in bringing forward proposals.  <\/p><p>I would draw the Deputy's particular attention to the Criminal Justice Act 2011, as a recent example of such developments in white collar crime legislation, and one which represents an important step in delivering on the Government&rsquo;s commitment to tackle white collar crime.  Its main purpose is to facilitate the more effective investigation of white collar crime and to reduce associated delays.  The Act provides for new procedures to facilitate Garda access to essential information and documentation to assist in current and future investigations of white collar crime.  The Act is targeted at specified serious and complex offences (&ldquo;relevant offences&rdquo;) attracting a penalty of at least 5 years imprisonment, including offences in the areas of banking and finance, company law, money laundering, fraud and corruption. The Act will provide vital assistance to the Garda&iacute; in the completion of current investigations as well as providing assistance to them in investigations undertaken in the future.<\/p><p>Another recent provision of relevance to white collar crime is Part 5 of the Courts and Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2013.  It makes provision for the selection of up to 15 jurors to serve in a criminal trial which is likely to last more than 2 months, with 12 jurors to be selected to consider the verdict.  These provisions, which give effect to a recommendation of the Law Reform Commission&rsquo;s recent Report on Jury Service, are of relevance to lengthy trials involving fraud or other complex financial matters where there is a risk of jurors becoming unavailable during the course of a protracted trial.<\/p><p>While the breadth and diversity of the issues faced in addressing serious, organised and white collar crime are such that no one piece of legislation could effectively address it in all its facets, the overall body of legislation in place is comprehensive and, as I have outlined, is continuously under review and development in light of operational experience and other relevant considerations.   <b><\/b><\/p><p>In terms of forthcoming legislation, the Prevention of Corruption Acts 1889 to 2010 will be replaced by the Criminal Justice (Corruption) Bill which will be published in the coming months.  The Bill will:<\/p><p>- replace and update the offences of giving and receiving bribes contained in the old legislation<\/p><p>- address the bribery of foreign public officials<\/p><p>- provide for the liability of corporate bodies for the corrupt actions of their directors, employees and agents<\/p><p>- include discrete offences outlawing trading in influence<\/p><p>- take account of the Mahon Tribunal recommendations to criminalise the making of payments knowingly or recklessly to athird party who intends to use them as bribes<\/p><p>The Bill is also intended to enhance the ability of the DPP to bring prosecutions by providing presumptions of corrupt gifts or payments such as:<\/p><p>- where an interested party makes a payment to a public official;<\/p><p>- where a public official has a lifestyle or property out of proportion to their official income and declared interests; and<\/p><p>- where an official accepts a gift in breach of ethical or disciplinary codes.<\/p><p>Penalties of up to 10 years&rsquo; imprisonment and unlimited fines are envisaged for persons convicted on indictment.  It is also intended to allow a judge to order a public official convicted of an offence to forfeit their office and exclude them from seeking public office for a period of years.  These forfeiture provisions will apply to all elected and senior office holders as well as a wide range of civil and public servants.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051300073#WRV03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"question","counter":1227,"qnumday":548,"qnumall":"[20982\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051300073#WRV03200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will consider the establishment of a Criminal Assets Bureau-style agency specifically empowered to help fight white collar crime; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

Likewise the total number of committals to prison has also risen sharply during the same period, from 11,934 in 2007 to 17,026 in 2012 &ndash; an increase of over 43%.  2013 saw the first significant decrease in prison numbers since 2007.  There were 15,735 committals to prison in 2013 which was a decrease of 7.6% on the 2012 figure.  However given the current number of prisoners in custody - 4,013 on 12 May 2014 - the Irish Prison Service is not in a position to provide single cell accommodation to all prisoners.  Single cell occupancy across the system would result in a bed capacity of approximately 3,200 and would not be possible to achieve without releasing sizeable numbers of prisoners considered to represent a threat to public safety.  However, I can advise the Deputy that on 1st April 2014 almost 50% of all prisoners in custody on that day (4,103) were accommodated in single cell accommodation.  In addition, 1,528 or 37% were accommodated in double occupancy cells with the remainder, (531) accommodated in cells with 3 or more persons.  Of this 56 were accommodated in dormitory style accommodation in Shelton Abbey.  The majority of those housed in double cells are housed in our newer prisons where the cells are larger and conform to the standards for double occupancy as set out by the Inspector of Prisons.<\/p><p>As the Deputy is aware the Irish Prison Service is in the process of redeveloping all wings in Mountjoy Prison with refurbishment work on the A, B and C Wings now complete.  Following the refurbishment of each wing, all cells are being returned to single occupancy status.  In this regard, the Deputy will note from the figures set out in the table below that on 1 April 2014, 543 prisoners, or 92% of those in custody in Mountjoy prison, were in single cells.  It should be borne in mind that in certain cases prisoners are housed together for reasons other than lack of capacity.  Family members and friends often elect or are assigned a shared cell.  Shared cell accommodation can be very beneficial from a management point of view particularly for those who are vulnerable and at risk of self-harm.  There will always be a need for certain prisoners to be accommodated together.<\/p><p>As outlined in the Irish Prison Service Three Year Strategic Plan, it is intended to align the capacity of our prisons with the guidelines laid down by the Inspector of Prisons by 2014, in so far as this is compatible with public safety and the integrity of the criminal justice system.

Of the 334 currently slopping out, 226 prisoners are accommodated in Cork Prison with 46 and 59 prisoners accommodated in Limerick and Portlaoise Prisons respectively.<\/p><p>In April 2012, the Irish Prison Service published a 3-Year Strategic Plan which included a 40 month capital plan to provide in-cell sanitation in all cells and radically improve prison conditions in the older parts of the prison estate.  The construction of a new prison in Cork, to replace the existing outdated facility, commenced in late January 2014, and is expected to be completed by July of 2015.  Allowing for fit-out, systems commissioning and training of staff, it is expected that the new prison will be ready for operational use by December 2015.  This project marks the largest single investment ever in the prison estate and in these times of continuing financial difficulty it represents a very important commitment on the part of Government to the modernisation of the prison estate and in particular to the elimination of slopping out.<\/p><p>In addition to the substantial commitment to Cork prison, the modernisation of Mountjoy prison continues with the  refurbishment of the A, B and C wings now complete.

Every prisoner in Mountjoy now has access to in-cell sanitation.  A contract for the refurbishment work on the D wing will be signed shortly and the works will be completed by March 2015.

The restriction of a prisoner's regime can occur due to a number of factors including, the protection of vulnerable prisoners.  This is provided for under Rule 63 of the Prison Rules 2007 which states that a prisoner may, either at his\/her own request or when the Governor considers it necessary, in so far as is practicable and subject to the maintenance and good order and safe and secure custody, be kept separate from other prisoners who are reasonably likely to cause significant harm to him\/her.<\/p><p>The fact that prisoners seeking protection are immediately separated from the general population or from specific prisoners identified as presenting a threat, clearly demonstrates the commitment of the Irish Prison Service to ensure their safety and security.  The status of each prisoner on restricted regime within the prison system is regularly reviewed.  If possible, prisoners can be transferred to other institutions where a restricted regime would not be necessary.<\/p><p>In addition, the Governor may decide, for the maintenance of good order in the prison, to remove a prisoner from general association or structured activity to reduce the negative effect that a prisoner or prisoners may have on the general population.  This is provided for under Rule 62 of the Prison Rules 2007.  There may also be a smaller number of prisoners who would be restricted for medical (Rule 64) or discipline reasons (Rule 67).  In July last year, the Director General of the Irish Prison Service established a high level group to look at measures which can be introduced to reduce the number of prisoners currently held on restricted regimes with a view to ensuring that all receive, as a minimum standard, out of cell time of 3 hours per day, to engage in exercise or activity.<\/p><p>Since July 2013, the number of prisoners on a restricted regime has reduced from 339 to 261, a reduction of 23%.  Of the 261 currently on a restricted regime, 228 were for protection reasons (of which 226 were there at their own request).  26 prisoners had there regime restricted on grounds of order (Rule 62).  In addition the number of prisoners restricted to 22 or 23 hour lock up has reduced from 211 in July 2013 to 43 in April 2014, a reduction of 168 or almost 80%.

We have commenced a process of closer engagement with the Department of Education and the Education and Training Boards in order to bring a more coordinated approach to prison education including reviewing the curriculum being provided to prisoners.<\/p><p>Educational services are available at all institutions and are provided in partnership with a range of educational agencies including notably the Education and Training Boards and Public Library Services.

In 2011 a review by the European Union Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risk (SCHER) concluded that there are no known negative health implications from fluoridating water at levels used in the EU.  The balance of scientific evidence worldwide confirms that water fluoridation, i.e. the adjustment of the natural concentration of fluoride in drinking water to the optimal recommended level for the prevention of dental caries, does not cause any ill effects and protects the oral health of the population.<\/p><p>  There are no plans to cease fluoridation.  Nevertheless, the Department of Health keeps this policy under constant review.  As part of this ongoing work, a review of evidence on the impact of water fluoridation at its current level on the health of the population and on the environment is being conducted by the Health Research Board on behalf of the Department.  The Department is also collaborating in a University College Cork-led research project, \"Fluoride and Caring for Children's Teeth\" (FACCT).  The study will consider the impact of changes on the oral health of children, following policy decisions relating to toothpaste use by infants and young children made in 2002 and the reduction in the level of fluoridation in drinking water introduced in 2007.  In addition, the pilot phase of a study on general and oral health findings in adults linked to the duration of exposure to fluoridated water as part of the Irish Longitudinal Study on Aging (TILDA) is underway.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051300074#WRW03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Graduate Nursing Scheme Issues","counter":1307,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051300074#WRW03850"},{"type":"question","counter":1308,"qnumday":575,"qnumall":"[20832\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051300074#WRW03900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of nurses that are leaving after graduation; and if there is any incentive for them to stay in this country; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1017","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1309,"content":"<p>There is no precise data on the numbers of nurses who leave after graduation.

Notwithstanding the need to reduce public service numbers the HSE has the capacity to recruit where it is necessary to do so in order to ensure patient safety and quality care and to support service delivery.  Nursing posts continue to be filled on this basis.  In addition, the Haddington Road Agreement provided for the recruitment of up to 1,000 Nurse Graduates on a 2 year programme.  Nearly 500 nurses and midwives have commenced employment in recent months on the graduate scheme, with over 200 others currently going through the recruitment process.<\/p><p>  Fourth year undergraduate student nurses undertake a 36 week rostered placement as a key part of their degree programme.

Nurses participating in the Nurse Graduate Initiative earn 85% of the starting pay of a Staff Nurse in the first year and 90% in the second year.  In addition these nurses would also be in receipt of allowances and other premium payments.

Under the Act, the Irish Medicines Board (IMB) is responsible for the assessment of interchangeability of medicines.<\/p><p>  In deciding whether to add a group of medicinal products to the List of Interchangeable Medicinal Products, the IMB  must be satisfied that each medicinal product which falls within the group:<\/p><p>  (a) has the same qualitative and quantitative composition in each of its active substances as each of the other medicinal products which fall within the group; <\/p><p>  (b) is in the same pharmaceutical form as, or in a pharmaceutical form that is appropriate for substitution for, each of the other products in the group; and<\/p><p>  (c) has the same route of administration as each of the other medicinal products which fall within the group. <\/p><p>  In addition, the Act provides that the IMB is not permitted to add a group of medicinal products to the List of Interchangeable Medicinal Products where:<\/p><p>  - there is a difference in bioavailability between the medicinal products and the interchangeable medicinal products which currently fall within the group of interchangeable medicinal products which may lead to a clinically significant difference in efficacy between them, and<\/p><p>  - any of the medicinal  products cannot be safely substituted for any one or more of the other medicinal products in the group. <\/p><p>I would like to emphasise that in making a decision to add a medicinal product to a group of interchangeable medicinal products or a group of medicinal products to the List of Interchangeable Medicinal Products, the IMB is obliged to have regard to the criteria as set out in the Act.     <\/p><p>  To further enhance the patient safety aspect of generic substitution, Section 13 of the Act allows a prescriber to indicate on a prescription that a branded interchangeable medicinal product should, for clinical reasons, not be substituted.<\/p><p>  It is also important to point out that generic medicines must meet exactly the same standards of quality and safety and have the same effect as the originator medicine. All of the generic medicines on the Irish market are required to be properly licensed and meet the requirements of the IMB.<\/p><p>  A key objective of the Act is to enable patients to opt for lower cost interchangeable medicines. In general terms, when a pharmacist is presented with a prescription for an interchangeable medicine, which is not the subject of a clinical exemption, the pharmacist is obliged to offer the patient the opportunity to agree to substituting the prescribed product with an interchangeable medicine which is in stock in the pharmacy and is of lower cost to the patient or the HSE, as the case may be. The patient may either accept the interchangeable medicine offered by the pharmacist or opt to receive the branded interchangeable medicine where prescribed. Alternatively, the patient may opt to go to a different pharmacy to receive a less expensive interchangeable medicine. <\/p><p>  The Act also allows the HSE to set a reference price for groups of interchangeable medicines. Eligible persons under the community drug schemes, including the Drug Payment Scheme, will only face an additional charge where a reference price has been set for a group of interchangeable medicines and the medicine dispensed is priced higher than the reference price and is not the subject of a clinical exemption.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051300078#WRAA01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Eligibility","counter":1546,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051300078#WRAA01350"},{"type":"question","counter":1547,"qnumday":654,"qnumall":"[21536\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051300078#WRAA01400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will consider introducing a third tier of medical card to deal specifically with medical condition rather than means.","asker":"968","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1548,"content":"<p>HSE data shows that the number of medical cards issued, where discretion was involved has fallen in recent years.

Of the discretionary cards in circulation in 2011, less than one-tenth have subsequently been found to be ineligible for a medical card on review.<\/p><p>  At the request of Minister Reilly, the HSE is currently examining how individuals, who are not entitled to a medical card, could still receive services that meet their needs.

It is intended that improved published information and local information points will be established at major health centres around the country, where members of the public can obtain comprehensive information and support in accessing their full range of supports and entitlements from the Health Services.

This project model approach gives local communities the autonomy to devise creative and innovative approaches to address the needs of local young people most at risk of early school leaving. <\/p><p>In 2014 an allocation of &euro;24.756m has been provided to the Child and Family Agency to deliver this programme.

I am advised that this project has a budget of &euro;185,000 for the 2013 \/ 2014 school year to provide targeted supports to   students in one post-primary school and five primary schools. <\/p><p>The Agency is responsible for the strategic and operational direction of the School Completion Programme.

I am advised that proposals have yet to be formulated by the Child and Family Agency in relation to funding for the 2014\/2015 academic year. As an initial step, the Agency has recently invited all SCP Projects to commence planning for the next cycle of the programme within the available funding parameters. Within the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure the SCP is required to achieve cumulative savings of &euro;5.5m over the period 2012 to 2014, of which &euro;1.7m in savings is to be found in 2014. <\/p><p>  A briefing on the 14\/15 planning template was provided to Local Coordinators at recent Network meetings.

In addition, projects have been requested to examine means of maximising the capacity of the totality of schools&rsquo; DEIS resources, and linkages with area-based supports available through other relevant providers, to realise SCP objectives in the most efficient and economical way possible. The Agency will continue to work closely with management committees, schools and local SCP co-ordinators to assist projects through this process. <\/p><p>  The Deputy will wish to note that a planned programme review of SCP has commenced. The objectives of the review are to identify best practice, to clarify roles and responsibilities and to build upon the valuable learning and experience to date across the programme.

Where callers require assistance outside the scope of the services provided by the Hotline, they are referred to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or whichever branch of the emergency services is appropriate.

This advice and support may also be accessed by the extended family of a child who is missing or, indeed, by the child themselves. A key component of the service is an awareness programme. It is vital that those who could benefit from the service know that it exists and that users are aware of the scope of the service.  <\/p><p>  During the initial set up phase of the service, the ISPCC focused on community based promotion of the service.  This included presentations to local community groups.

In line with the National Policy Framework, my Department is developing a new youth strategy for later this year. The new youth strategy will aim to enhance the role of youth services in contributing to the achievements of the five national outcomes for children and young people i.e that they are active and healthy, achieving, learning and developing, safe and protected from harm, economically secure, and connected, respected and contributing to society.

The key Departmental Sponsor for this Outcome area is the Department of Health. Under this outcome, 15 key commitments are listed, each with a lead Department responsible for implementation. These commitments aim to reduce the risk factors and improve the resilience factors associated with the health and well-being of children and young people. My Department works closely with the Department of Health, the HSE other relevant departments and agencies to progress these issues.

The context within which our child welfare and protection services operate today is very challenging.  The number of child welfare and protection referrals to social work departments increased by nearly one third to over 40,000 in 2012.  My Department has a range of systems in place to ensure it  is informed of risk to children and the measures in place to minimise these risks.

Reports from the Ombudsman for Children, and the National Review Panel where risk to children is noted, are reviewed to identify issues that require input and progress in the area of  policy and operations.  I am satisfied that in establishing Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, we now have in place the necessary structure to ensure the provision of a more responsive and integrated service to children and young people at risk.<\/p><p>With regard to bullying, we know from data from the Growing Up in Ireland Longitudinal Study that 40% of nine-year-olds reported being victims of bullying in the past year with boys and girls experiencing similar rates of victimisation.  I the case of children who reported victimisation in the previous year, only 39% of their mothers appeared to have been aware that their child had been the victim of bullying. This emphasises the importance of parents talking to their children about bullying and schools having policies on bullying which are disseminated to parents.  The Action Plan On Bullying published by the Minister for Education and Skills in January 2013 clearly recognised the need to tackle bullying, including cyber-bullying, in a holistic way through schools but within a much wider social context. Amongst the actions which are being taken are the development of a single national anti-bullying website to provide information for parents, young people, youth workers, sporting and cultural associations and school staff on types and methods of bullying and how to deal with bullying behaviour.<\/p><p>Under my own Department, the Child and Family Agency has a statutory function to ensure that &lsquo;<i>each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education<\/i>&rsquo; which it delivers through its Educational Welfare Services.

Targeted support for disadvantaged, marginalised and at-risk young people are provided through the Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young People's Facilities and Services Fund (Rounds 1 and 2), Local Drugs Task Force Projects and certain other programmes such as the Local Youth Club Grant Scheme and Youth Information Centres.  In addition, some 31 national and major regional youth work organisations are supported under my Department's Youth Service Grant Scheme. The funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 380,000 young people and involve approximately 1,400 youth work staff in 477 projects, and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country. In 2014, current funding of &euro;49.78 million has been provided to my Department for these schemes.<\/p><p>  My Department is developing a new youth strategy for later this year. This new strategy will aim to enhance the role of youth services in contributing to the achievement of the five national outcomes for children and young people set out in &ldquo;Better Outcomes - Brighter Futures&rdquo;  i.e. that they are active and healthy, achieving, learning and developing, safe and protected from harm, economically secure, and connected, respected and contributing to society.  The strategy will, inter alia, promote co-ordination between Government departments and youth sector organisations with a view to maximising the effectiveness of the State funding available to support services for young people in future years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051300080#WRCC03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Care Services Funding","counter":1711,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051300080#WRCC03750"},{"type":"question","counter":1712,"qnumday":712,"qnumall":"[21606\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014051300080#WRCC03800","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if he will consider extra supports for parents on the costs of child care.","asker":"968","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":1713,"content":"<p>My Departments implements a number of child care support programmes to assist parents with the cost of child care.
