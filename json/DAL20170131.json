That said, the events of the past seven days have left people extremely concerned about what is happening.  Apart from the casual attempt to humiliate the Mexican President, there has been an executive order essentially arbitrarily banning from the United States millions of people from seven different nations on the basis of religion and nationality.  This is completely unacceptable.  It stigmatises an entire religion and associates it with terrorism and mayhem.  It is also dangerous in that it emboldens others to act against people of the Muslim faith.  The ban contravenes the Geneva Convention and offends our concept of human decency, our values and religious liberty.<\/p>  <p>  It is striking to note the contrast between how the world reacted to the refugee question after the Second World War and how the world today, particularly democracies, is reacting.  After the Second World War, we had open doors whereas democracies are now closing their doors to genuine refugees from war-torn areas.  In that context, it is very heartening to see the Jewish community standing shoulder to shoulder with their Muslim brethren in defending them against this particular ban.<\/p>  <p>  There is no logic to the ban in terms of what it sets out to achieve.  As a matter of fact, US born citizens have been responsible for the majority of the heinous terrorist acts that have occurred on US soil.  America was built on immigration and refugees, which have been an essential ingredient in the entrepreneurial flair and economic development that occurred in the United States.  It is interesting that many of the major companies in the technology industry, for example, Google, Facebook, Lyft, Airbnb and Viber, have given large donations to the American Civil Liberties Union to fight cases and defend those who have been affected by the ban.  The ban is damaging to America and the world. <\/p><p> I believe the Taoiseach should proceed with his visit to the United States.  It is important in terms of the historical relationship I mentioned earlier.  It is not just about a bowl of shamrock.  I also believe the pre-clearance facility should be maintained because to get rid of it would be to disadvantage the more than 1.5 million who travel on an annual basis.<\/p> <p> We need a commitment from the Taoiseach that he will state publicly that the ban is morally wrong and violates the Geneva Convention in respect of refugees and discriminates on the basis of religion and nationality.  Does the Taoiseach accept that and will he say so in those terms?  Has the Taoiseach written to President Trump conveying the Government's opposition to this executive order and has he asked him to repeal it?  If not, will he commit to so doing?  Will the Taoiseach agree to an all-party motion strongly opposing this ban and conveying our Parliament's unified and unanimous opposition to it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100003#A00200","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1485871500,"counter":8,"content":"<p>On 27 January the President of the United States signed an executive order expressed to be done under the powers vested in him under the US Constitution and the laws of the United States, including the Immigration and Nationality Act, INA.  The precise meaning of a number of the provisions of the executive order are uncertain.  Federal judges in Brooklyn, Massachusetts, Virginia and Washington have issued rulings preventing persons claiming refugee status being sent back to their home countries and the removal or deportation from the United States of persons claiming refugee status pending full court hearings.  The legal position is evolving, as we are now aware.  On Sunday, 29 January, the Chief of Staff stated that green card holders from the seven banned countries would not be prevented from returning to the United States, going forward.  This appeared to be a reversal of one of the key components of the executive order made the previous Friday.  In the case of holders of dual nationality and dual passports, clarifications have issued from the USA in the past 24 hours to the effect that if the holder uses his or her passport from the country not listed in the executive order he or she will be entitled to be admitted to the USA.  The legality of the executive order and US immigration rules are entirely a matter for the US courts.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Martin will be aware that Ireland has granted citizenship to approximately 5,000 people from the seven countries involved.  Therefore, they have Irish passports and, for instance, Syrian passports.  Clarification has now been received to the effect that if one of those persons presents an Irish passport at the point of pre-clearance either in Dublin or Shannon, it is on that passport he or she will be judged and will not be refused entry to the United States.  There are a number of important points to be made on this issue.  The rights available to refugees or persons wishing to seek asylum in Ireland remain unchanged.  Those applying for asylum having arrived in this country or having been transit passengers withdraw from or do not succeed in getting pre-clearance will be considered in each case under the International Protection Act 2015.  In other words, if they are turned back at US immigration in Dublin or Shannon and they come back into the Irish setting they are then dealt with under the International Protection Act 2015.  As I said, the situation with regard to dual Irish-prohibited states nationals has been clarified.  On presentation of an Irish passport they will not be hindered from entering the United States.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to consider any immigration matters arising from the executive order in line with Irish law.  I intend to go to the United States to speak directly to the US President.  This morning, the Cabinet was fully in favour of retaining our pre-clearance facility and the Attorney General has confirmed that the issue in so far as the legality is concerned is a matter for the United States courts.  In so far as Ireland is concerned, we are in compliance with human rights legislation and in accordance with our own Constitution.  Pre-clearance is an important element for Ireland and it is available in Shannon and Dublin.  Many other airports have sought it.  I have already condemned torture and breaches of human rights in any country around the world and will continue to do so very vociferously.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100004#B00200","speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1485871500,"counter":9,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach has not answered any of the specific questions I put to him.

This executive order is a breach of EU and UN obligations, in addition to being a subversion of acceptable standards of decency and equality.<\/p>  <p>  It is disappointing that the Taoiseach has yet to raise this matter with the US Administration.  He should have expressed his opposition to the blanket 90-day travel ban for nationals from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.

In particular, in rural Ireland when few other supports were at hand, the community and voluntary sector came to the forefront in delivering local services such as meals on wheels, tidy towns projects and maintaining towns and villages throughout the countryside.  For many voluntary groups to survive, they need a workforce such as those that can be provided by work schemes, for example, the rural social, RS, scheme, community employment, CE, scheme and the T&uacute;s scheme.  Workers on those schemes have worked diligently, many of them carrying out work usually done by local authorities which they can no longer do due to embargoes on recruitment of road maintenance staff.<\/p>  <p>  In the past 12 months, it has become more difficult for community and voluntary groups to access workers, especially in rural areas where rules and guidelines are taking over from what was previously work on the ground.  It cannot be more simple.  A person who is in receipt of a social welfare payment and who cannot get another type of employment should be able to go on a work scheme and stay on it until employment is found for him or her.  Instead of that being the case many people who are called to go on CE, T&uacute;s or RS schemes in rural areas in particular have been told they are on JobPath and although they do not have a job they are not allowed to go on any other work scheme until JobPath finds them a job.  That is causing a nightmare for community and voluntary groups in filling positions to carry out works in the community, leaving many of them without a workforce, especially as many CE workers are now only allowed to stay on a scheme for 12 months and have to go back on welfare after that period.<\/p>  <p>  It could not be more simple.  If a worker is on a work scheme working while in receipt of a welfare payment, he or she should be commended on doing so and should be left on it until he or she finds employment.  All those problems are not intended by the Department of Social Protection to undermine community and voluntary groups but that is the effect they are having.  That is the case in particular in rural communities where a pool of suitable workers has to meet with such criteria and people find it almost impossible to get on a scheme.  The new obstacles are creating nightmares for groups and leaving local communities without a workforce in many cases.  I called in the programme for Government for separate rural and urban work schemes because one hat does not fit all.  It is becoming more clear that rural issues such as low employment, low population and rural isolation are not entering into the mindset of those city-based individuals in the Department of Social Protection.  I urge the Taoiseach to set up separate rural and urban work schemes and immediately reverse the rules which prevent a person on JobPath from being able to work on any other scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100007#E00800","speaker":"1263"},{"type":"speech","time":1485873300,"counter":24,"content":"<p>The Deputy should look at the rural development programme launched recently by the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, which, for the first time in many years, is a comprehensive plan that is realistic and can be achieved.  The CSO figures today show that unemployment is down to 7.1% from 15.2% just a few years ago.  Last week, the Minister for Social Protection announced an extra 550 places under the rural social scheme for those on farm assist or fish assist depending on the areas in which they live.  There are plans to look at community involvement and extensions of time for people who have been working on community schemes and who cannot be replaced that easily so I do not accept that there is no opportunity for every community around the country to benefit from this programme.  This, together with the programme for Government, which impacts across the country and every spectrum, was evidenced in the response from communities all over the country last year in the centenary commemorative events for 1916 where communities came out and demonstrated their own power and potential.  I believe very strongly in that.  <\/p>  <p>  The programme launched last week covers a range of opportunities for communities all over the country and the money is in place between now and 2020 for communities to make that happen.  Whether it is through the local enterprise office or the Intreo office, the systems have changed so that people looking for employment or opportunity now have the chance to sit down with somebody directly to see what might be appropriate for them or in their best interests to allow them to get off social protection and get into a better system by having a job and a wage.  While the Deputy's point can be valid in any area, I have to say that arising from the publication of the plan last week, there is the opportunity for every community to benefit from a range of things, many of which were identified in the Commission for the Economic Development of Rural Areas report a number of years ago and which are now embellished in this programme for rural development and the achievement of rural potential.

The set up of JobPath was poorly thought through, in my own view and the view of many in the community.  Schemes like community employment schemes, T&uacute;s and the rural social scheme need further support.  There should be no more instances where good workers are sent home after 12 months when there is no other employment in their community.  There should also be no more instances of a person having to wait on social welfare for 12 months if on welfare.  There should be an immediate work start in the community.  There should be no more strict guidelines leading to more and more community and voluntary groups finding it impossible to fill positions.  It is wrong to require individuals from peninsulas like Mizen Head, Sheep's Head and Beara throughout west Cork and throughout the country to have to travel possibly 25 miles in some cases to meet JobPath requirements.  This shows little or no respect for individuals on welfare.<\/p>  <p>  The need to set up a rural and urban works scheme is critical, in my view and in the view of the community and voluntary sector, as is a clear understanding of the needs in those communities like employment and travel.

The British Irish Chamber of Commerce estimates there is some &euro;1.3 billion in weekly trade between the two countries, which supports approximately 400,000 jobs across the two islands.  The fall in sterling is already putting agrifood companies out of business.  If the United Kingdom defaults to World Trade Organization tariffs, particularly on food, that will put many more Irish companies out of business.  As well as these serious risks, however, there also significant opportunities.  One estimate from the City of London is that some 35,000 jobs could be relocated in financial services alone.  The chief executive of Lloyds Banks has said he has shelved plans for new job creation in financial services in the UK.  The chief executive of JP Morgan said, before the referendum, that some 4,000 of its jobs might have to be relocated to elsewhere in the EU.  Last week, in Davos, he said it was likely there would be more job movement at JP Morgan that was hoped would be the case.  The chief executive of UBS has indicated the company is looking at moving some 1,500 jobs.  The chief executive of HSBC has said Brexit is likely to see that company moving more than 1,000 jobs.  The list goes on.  Despite these opportunities, the word I am getting from senior executives working in financial services in London and elsewhere in the UK is that they have had neither sight nor sound of Irish politicians or officials.  On the other hand, they tell me, they are being actively courted by the French, Germans, Belgians and many other EU nations.  The Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly have contacted them to discuss moves within Britain.  These companies are looking at their options for moving jobs because of the need to have a presence within the EU.  They cannot understand why the Irish authorities have not been in contact with them.<\/p>  <p>  Yesterday's meeting between the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister, Ms Theresa May, is clearly to be welcomed, as is the fact the Minister of State, Deputy Dara Murphy, is in London this week to engage with financial services.  Welcome, too, is the launch today of a new Action Plan for Jobs which specifically highlights Brexit.  However, what matters is what is happening on the ground.  The business leaders I am hearing from both in the UK, particularly in London, and in this country are saying that when it comes to action on the part of the Irish authorities, not much is happening.  There are plenty of words and good sentiments but not much is actually being done.  Why is Ireland not actively reaching out to our expatriate community in areas like financial services in London, as IDA Ireland has done successfully in the United States for decades?  Why are business leaders in London saying they are yet to hear from Ireland when it comes to Brexit?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100009#G00200","speaker":"1230"},{"type":"speech","time":1485873900,"counter":29,"content":"<p>The Deputy needs to go back to the people to whom he has spoken.  He referred to what he has been hearing.  I assure him that Ireland is very active in this field, and not just by way of the Minister of State, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, who is dealing with financial services.  The Minister for Finance, many other senior Ministers and I, together with IDA Ireland and everybody else, are quite active in talking to interests in London who may wish to change location.  We have a unique opportunity arising out of the many difficulties and challenges Brexit is presenting and will present.  Our position is good on account of being in the eurozone, being so close to London, having an English-speaking population, and having at our disposal a proven track record and competence developed over the years in the area of financial services.<\/p><p>The Deputy will be aware that many queries have come into the Central Bank as financial houses or elements of financial houses decide where they will move to, and it might be to Frankfurt, Amsterdam, Paris, Dublin or New York.  However, I assure Deputy Donnelly that we are not behind the scenes in talking to anybody who is interested in coming here or in presenting our case as an attractive location with a vibrant, energetic workforce, and with the capacity to continue to attract the \"churn\" of talent needed here and access to the Single Market and the European system, which is so important for financial services.<\/p> <p> People I have met have very varied views about Brexit as far as London is concerned, but we will fight our corner hard and fairly.  I can confirm to the Deputy that it has been confirmed to me that particular companies wish to move to this country, and in due course they will make their decisions formally, but we are right in there; we are not behind the scenes.  With respect to the people who are giving the Deputy that information, it is not true to say that Ireland is not taking action and involving itself in serious conversations with people in London and elsewhere in the United Kingdom.  With regard to what Deputy Donnelly pointed out, it is true to say from Bord Bia's assessment that in terms of value, the reduction due to currency fluctuations in the agrifood sector has been &euro;500 million.  That is why the Minister has brought in low interest, long-term credit for small firms.  I notice some Irish agri-firms are acquiring others to be available and ready to rebound when the currency situation levels itself out.  I spoke to Prime Minister May about a number of elements last night.  In conclusion, we are very active in this field and we will fight our corner hard and fairly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100009#G00300","speaker":"1245","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1485874200,"counter":31,"content":"<p>In terms of Brexit, a new increasingly protectionist United States and the European Commission now retargeting our corporation tax regime, I believe jobs in Ireland are more at risk now than they were due to the banking collapse.  That is why the Taoiseach's answer is so concerning.  I accept that actions are being taken.  I take the Taoiseach at his word when he says Ireland is doing things but the sense from business leaders and from the public is that while actions are being taken, too few actions are being taken.  They are being taken too slowly and with too much deference to the European Union.<\/p>  <p>  As an example, we keep hearing from Ministers that Brexit has not happened yet.  I heard it said on a radio programme about two nights ago, but Brexit has happened.  For the small and medium enterprises, SMEs, that are struggling, and the ones that have been put out of business, it is happening.  For the people who are living and working around the Border regions, it is happening.  For the Irish ex-pats who are looking at moving jobs back into the EU post-Brexit, it is happening.  While I accept absolutely that there are conversations going on, senior Irish executives are saying that while they are being courted by numerous EU nations, they are not hearing anything from Ireland.  My sense is that while actions are being taken, they are being taken too slowly and without a clear vision for success.  Does the Taoiseach accept that there is an ex-pat community in London that we should be targeting and are not and that more needs to happen very quickly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100010#H00200","speaker":"1230"},{"type":"speech","time":1485874200,"counter":32,"content":"<p>The Government deliberately beefed up Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland, which are very active in this field.

One would have to have been living under a rock to be completely unaware of the increasing fears regarding freedom of the press and the escalation of fake news and dubious facts.  One of the safest ways to mitigate against fake news or partisan reporting is to do everything in our power to protect the diversity of ownership in the media landscape.  This issue has raised its head for decades.  In 1973, the National Union of Journalists expressed concerns with regard to media plurality and various flashpoints have arisen over the years.  However, nothing has been done to change the ever increasing concentration of media ownership in an ever declining number of hands.<\/p><p>We are awaiting a decision on whether Independent News and Media, INM, will be allowed to proceed with the acquisition of the Celtic Media Group, a move which would result in INM increasing its substantial dominance of the print media by effectively controlling the bulk of regional newspapers across the island of Ireland.  The Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, in what can only be described as a curious move, approved the acquisition and the Minister has put the decision out for public consultation before making a final decision.  The reason I describe the BAI's decision as curious is that the media merger guidelines of 2015 make reference to a significant interest test on the notion of the public interest not being served by allowing any one individual or undertaking to hold more than 20% of a stake in the media business.  Despite this, the majority shareholder in INM holds in excess of 20% because the guidelines were to be applied for future shareholdings only.  It is worth noting that the majority shareholder in INM is also the owner of the Communicorp Group, the company which owns the vast majority of radio stations outside the public service broadcaster. <\/p><p>My experience during the Siteserv controversy and the ensuing media blackout of my speech, with the exception of <i>broadsheet.ie<\/i>, <i>The Sunday Times <\/i>and <i>Village<\/i>magazine, brought home to me the acute need for impartial and fearless media.  That someone with such dominance of ownership could also chill other outlets outside his control made a stark point to me.  There have been stories from former employees of INM and Communicorp about ownership influence on editorial content and so on.  These are the very reasons this issue is of utmost importance. <\/p><p>The Bill seeks to rebalance the media landscape by reconstituting media plurality in Ireland.  Media plurality has the potential to be compromised by the ability of some key players and a small but increasing number of others to gain a stake of more than 20% in media businesses.  We cannot be complacent in assuming that what has happened in other countries and is currently happening with regard to fake news and powerful interests controlling the public debate could not happen here.  It most certainly could unless we take significant and forceful steps to ensure it does not.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100017#P02900","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1485877800,"counter":157,"content":"<p>Is the Bill being opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100017#P03000","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1485877800,"counter":158,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100017#P03100","speaker":"1245"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1485877800,"counter":159,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1485877800,"counter":160,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100017#P03300","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1485877800,"counter":161,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100017#P03400","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1485877800,"counter":162,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"National Famine Commemoration Bill 2017: First Stage","time":1485877800,"counter":163,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100017#P03600"},{"type":"speech","time":1485877800,"counter":164,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to provide for the commemoration of the Great Famine; to provide for the establishment of a National Famine Commemoration Day; and to provide for related matters.<\/blockquote><p>This is a small, compact Bill.  We should have a national day marked in the calendar to commemorate the greatest tragedy that has ever befallen the country.  The Bill proposes to designate this day the second Sunday in May.  I will refer to some of the arguments I have made previously on this issue, on which I have spoken in the Chamber previously.  I had my first opportunity to speak on it shortly after I was elected and, subsequently, on 5 July 2015.  Some of the topics I raised then are critical reasons for making this proposal. <\/p><p>The Famine has shaped modern Ireland more than any other event and this needs to be recognised in the same way we mark other days of national commemoration.  We commemorate the Easter Rising every year and we have other significant dates fixed in the calendar to mark those from this country who lost their lives in war.  That we do not have a fixed date in the calendar marking the Famine is a major mistake.  We should place the Famine on the same level as the other commemorations to which I referred.<\/p><p>I advocate this change for a number of key reasons, which I will repeat today.  We should embed in the national consciousness the importance and significance of the Famine.  Having a fixed date would enable us to work with children, schools and the next generation because they would be able to clearly see the Famine marked every year.  This would enable the State to provide a much more rounded commemoration and to mark the Famine in away that fully integrates the generations, particularly the next generation because schoolchildren would play a part.  <\/p><p>The Famine is probably the greatest event that internationalised Ireland in terms of what followed it and the emigration that flowed from it.  In setting a fixed date for the Famine commemoration day in the calendar we would be giving an opportunity to the diaspora throughout the world, and to all the people who claim descent, to note this date as the date on which they will have an opportunity to join with people in this country in marking what is the greatest national tragedy ever to befall the island of Ireland.<\/p> <p> The Bill is at its heart a straightforward and simple Bill.  I do not believe it is divisive and I hope it will receive widespread support.  I would like at this point to pay tribute to those people who have worked on the national Famine commemoration days held thus far.  The small but significant change proposed in this Bill, in terms of setting a fixed date in our calendar as the forever Famine commemoration day, is what we need to do at this stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100017#P03700","speaker":"1310","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1485878400,"counter":166,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100018#Q00200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1485878400,"counter":167,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100018#Q00300","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1485878400,"counter":168,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1485878400,"counter":169,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100018#Q00500","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1485878400,"counter":170,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100018#Q00600","speaker":"1310"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1485878400,"counter":171,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Prohibition of Above-cost Ticket Touting Bill 2017: First Stage","time":1485878400,"counter":172,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100018#Q00800"},{"type":"speech","time":1485878400,"counter":173,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to render it unlawful for any person to sell or offer for sale tickets for major sporting, musical or theatrical events for a price in excess of the officially designated price.<\/blockquote><p>I propose to share my time with Deputy Stephen Donnelly.  I welcome the opportunity to co-propose this Bill to the House alongside Deputy Donnelly who has worked with me on it.  I understand from some of the longer serving journalists and other people around the House that it is a little unusual for people to co-propose a Private Members' Bill, particularly so when there is a member of a party and an Independent member involved.  Perhaps this epitomises new politics in a positive way.<\/p><p>I would like to outline the potential solution proposed in this Bill and how it will impact on people.  The nature of the problem is straightforward and easy to understand.  For too long now, music and sports fans have been gouged, effectively paying multiples of face value for tickets to both music events and sports events.  A small cottage industry has developed around this issue and this industry has become more automated, industrialised and more formalised than ever before, with the result that normally the primary seller would perhaps regulate but in this instance it appears that the primary seller, the well known entity, Ticketmaster, is also a controlling stakeholder in one of the largest secondary selling entities, Seatwave.  It is clear there is a potential conflict of interest arising, including the potential for the primary ticket seller not to regulate in the best interests of the consumer, as it would usually do in a normally functioning market.  Deputy Donnelly will outline how the market is not functioning in an effective way.  It is, therefore, felt that Government regulation is necessitated because the market is not functioning in a normal way for sports fans or music fans.<\/p><p>The Bill is based on the Belgian model which sought to outlaw the above-cost selling of tickets.  In other words, it seeks to outlaw ticket selling at above-cost face value plus a small service fee.  This provision was implemented in Belgium, which is a fellow EU member state, and as such it is compatible with all relevant EU laws on competition and consumer protection.  It is clear that it has had a very positive halo effect within Belgium and the ticket selling industry in Belgium.  This is a positive move for consumer protection and competition.  I pay tribute to Deputies Naughten, Shatter and Ring who have all previously proposed similar legislation over the last two decades.  I believe now is the time to take action on this issue.  I also believe this is one of the most symbolic examples of what is called &quot;nominative determinism&quot;, which means that a person's surname reflects the work he or she is doing, which in my case, my surname being &quot;Rock&quot;, speaking on behalf of music fans in the country, is most fitting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100018#Q00900","speaker":"1304"},{"type":"speech","time":1485878400,"counter":174,"content":"<p>I regret I cannot claim any nominative determinism in terms of my surname.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100018#Q01000","speaker":"1230"},{"type":"speech","time":1485878400,"counter":175,"content":"<p>There are many good ballad singers with the surname &quot;Donnelly&quot;.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100018#Q01100","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1485878400,"counter":176,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Rock for his work on this Bill.  It seeks to address an issue in what is a complicated market in respect of which some very serious comments were made recently in the House of Commons, including allegations of complicity by re-sellers working with organised touts who are breaking the law and very serious allegations about links between profits being made in this industry and Dublin-based paramilitaries and armed organisations in Israel.  As such, we need to take this issue very seriously.<\/p>  <p>  The power of the Bill is in its simplicity in that what it essentially provides is that in most cases a ticket must be resold at the original cost.  In other words, a person is not permitted to purchase 20, 100 or 1,000 tickets at a cost of &euro;80 each and then re-sell them to fans at a cost of &euro;1,000 each.  My understanding is that the Government is supportive of the direction of the Bill but that there are technical issues that will need to be addressed on Second and Committee Stages, including re-sellers moving out of this jurisdiction and how that can be addressed.  However, this Bill will send out the very clear signal that it will be illegal for anyone to engage, in an organised way, in the block-buying of tickets for music or sports events and to re-sell them with a profiteering motive.  I look forward to the Bill's passage through the House.  <\/p>  <p>  I draw the attention of the Taoiseach and the Government Chief Whip, Deputy Regina Doherty, that while ticket touting relative to some of the issues discussed in this Parliament in the last few weeks and to be discussed today is a niche issue, having heard the testimony from the UK House of Commons that the profits from this are being linked to Dublin-based to paramilitaries I would ask that this Bill be given a higher level of consideration by the Business Committee than it would otherwise be given.

We know this is happening.  We saw it happen most recently in Independent News &amp;amp; Media.  If a company is profitable as Independent News &amp;amp; Media is, then it cannot be allowed to walk away from its pension commitments to its employees.<\/p><p>In reviewing our pension system in 2012, the OECD clearly identified healthy sponsors being allowed to walk away from DB pension plans and shutting them down as another weakness of Irish legislation.  Back then, the OECD recommended that Irish legislation should be strengthened to ensure that healthy sponsors are not allowed to walk away from DB plans unless assets cover 90% of pension liabilities.  If, as legislators, we do not address what Independent News &amp;amp; Media has done we will be allowing other companies to do the same.  We are saying that this is okay and we are actively leaving the door open for other companies to do the same.  We cannot allow healthy companies to decide they no longer want to fund employees&rsquo; pensions and to then consciously commence wind down of DB pension plans.<\/p><p>This Bill is about ensuring that employers' obligations are honoured.  It is about protecting schemes and employees.  The Bill directly addresses the issue of healthy companies walking away from DB pension schemes.  It strengthens legislation and it ensures that employees are protected.  It also implements a key recommendation from the OECD, which, if implemented at the time, would have prevented the issue at Independent News &amp;amp; Media arising.  According to the Irish Association of Pension Funds, the number of active DB schemes has fallen from just over 1,200 at the end of 2006 to fewer than 500 today.  The number of active members in those schemes has dropped from 270,000 to 126,000 as of the end of last year.<\/p><p>These schemes and members must be protected.  There is an onus on all legislators to ensure they are.  With cross-party support for this Bill, we can send a clear message to companies that they will not be allowed to wind down consciously their defined benefit pension plans and renege on their pension commitments to members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100018#Q02000","speaker":"1252","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1485879000,"counter":186,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100019#R00200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1485879000,"counter":187,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100019#R00300","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1485879000,"counter":188,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1485879000,"counter":189,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100019#R00500","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1485879000,"counter":190,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100019#R00600","speaker":"1252"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1485879000,"counter":191,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Eighth Report of Standing Committee of Selection: Motion","time":1485879000,"counter":192,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100019#R00800"},{"type":"speech","time":1485879000,"counter":193,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approves the Eighth Report of the Standing Committee of Selection in accordance with Standing Order 27F, copies of which were laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 26th January, 2017, and discharges a member and appoints a member to a Committee accordingly.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100019#R00900","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1485879000,"counter":194,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Drug Trafficking Proposal: Referral to Joint Committee","time":1485879000,"counter":195,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100019#R01100"},{"type":"speech","time":1485879000,"counter":196,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>That the proposal that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approves the exercise by the State of the option or discretion under Protocol No. 21 on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in respect of the area of freedom, security and justice annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, to take part in the adoption and application of the following proposed measure:Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Framework Decision 2004\/757\/JHA of 25 October 2004 laying down minimum provisions on the constituent elements of criminal acts and penalties in the field of illicit drug trafficking, as regards the definition of drug,a copy of which was laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 26th January, 2017, be referred to the Joint Committee on Health, in accordance with Standing Order 84A(4)(<i>k<\/i>), which, not later than 9th February, 2017, shall send a message to the D&aacute;il in the manner prescribed in Standing Order 90, and Standing Order 89(2) shall accordingly apply.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100019#R01200","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1485879000,"counter":197,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Ceisteanna -

We discussed the recent political developments in Northern Ireland and the implications that Brexit will have for the North and for relationships across these islands.  We reiterated our joint and continuing commitment to the Good Friday Agreement and its institutions and our shared desire to see a fully functioning Executive back in place as soon as possible.  We agreed on the importance of our two Governments working together to ensure that the frameworks of the Good Friday and successor agreements are fully preserved in the upcoming Brexit negotiations and outcomes.  We discussed the necessity of ensuring the continued free flow of trade on the island and the need to avoid a hard Border.  I made clear to the Prime Minister that, in my view, any manifestation of a hard Border would have very negative consequences.<\/p>  <p>  We agreed that we both want to see a close, friction-free economic and trading relationship between the UK and the EU, including Ireland.  Prime Minister May and I also reaffirmed our commitment to maintaining the common travel area and agreed to continue working together to this end.  I emphasised to the Prime Minister the importance of finding a way forward on outstanding commitments, particularly on issues such the legacy institutions under the Stormont House Agreement, and the Irish language.  Our discussions also covered the importance of our future co-operation in key areas, such as agriculture and food, energy, security and criminal justice, education and culture.  Our two Governments are agreed that a close, trouble-free, economic and trading relationship between the UK and the EU, including Ireland, is in our best interests. <\/p>  <p>  I had previously spoken with Prime Minister May on the evening of Monday, 16 January, when we discussed the situation in Northern Ireland and repeated our desire to see the institutions established under the Good Friday Agreement operating effectively, and in particular to have a fully functioning Executive in place as soon as possible following the election.  We also discussed her speech on Brexit, scheduled for the following day.  In that speech, the Prime Minister provided some important clarity on the proposed approach of the British Government to the Brexit negotiation process.  I note, however, that there is still a lot of detail that remains to be set out as we move towards those negotiations commencing.<\/p>  <p>  From our perspective, our overall negotiation priorities remain unchanged.  These are our economy and trade; Northern Ireland, including the peace process and Border issues; the common travel area; and the future of the European Union.  I am under no illusion about the challenges that remain to be addressed.  Ministers and I will continue to meet and engage with our EU counterparts over coming weeks to emphasise Ireland&rsquo;s concerns and to ensure they are fully reflected in the EU position once negotiations commence.  This activity is reinforced by extensive engagement at diplomatic and official levels.  The Government is acutely aware of the potential risks and challenges for the Irish economy and will remain fully engaged on this aspect as the negotiations proceed.  I believe that, from my discussions with other members of the European Council and the EU institutions, there is a good understanding of the significant implications for Ireland arising from Brexit.  While this does not, of course, guarantee that it will be possible to mitigate against all the negative consequences of the UK's eventual departure from the EU, it is vital that we continue to engage with our EU partners and the EU institutions in order to defend our interests to the greatest extent possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100019#R02150","answer":true,"speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1485879000,"counter":208,"content":"<p>It is seven months since the Brexit referendum.  The failure to go beyond generalities has now gone from frustrating to causing widespread concern.  In past negotiations, such as those on the fiscal treaty and EU debt terms, the Taoiseach perfected a strategy of refusing to say what he was looking for until the negotiations were over, after which he would declare the negotiations as a major triumph for Ireland.  The worst example of this was, of course, when he said we were about to get billions for bank recapitalisation.  We both asked for this and received exactly nothing.  The Taoiseach will remember that famous meeting.  This cannot go on.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach keeps on saying everybody is in favour of maintaining the common travel area and protecting the Good Friday Agreement but nobody has spelled out what that means.  The common travel area has always been about more than just presenting passports at the border; it is about an automatic right to work, claim social protection payments, use the health service, vote and gain access to the education system on the same terms as citizens of the relevant jurisdiction.<\/p>  <p>  There are three major urgent matters requiring clarification.  Has the Taoiseach said to Prime Minister May that we will not agree to diluting the role of the European Convention on Human Rights in Northern Ireland's peace settlement?  Second, has he said to her that any amendment to the role of the European Union in the Northern Ireland Act 1998 must be subject to previous negotiation?  Finally, has he said to her and the European Union negotiators that Northern Ireland residents must retain their core rights as EU citizens?  Northern Ireland will have the largest bloc of EU citizens living outside the European Union after Brexit.  These are very basic questions.  These are fundamental points that should not be open to negotiation.

These are subject to many of the sectoral committees that we are now engaged in, which will come to a head again on 17 February when we have another all-island forum dealing with a whole range of sectoral issues where options have been put forward by voices from business and different sectors that are very useful for us as we prepare.<\/p>  <p>  There will be another question, I am sure, a Cheann Comhairle.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100020#S00700","speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1485879600,"counter":218,"content":"<p>I listened intently to the Taoiseach's report and to what he and the British Prime Minister stated yesterday.  I saw no mention of the Taoiseach defending the vote of the people in the North to stay within the EU.  If he will be straight about this issue, I want to know whether he argued for the North to be given a specially designated status within the EU.  As I have often told him, there is a logic behind this.  It is the only way to ensure that there is no land border on this island between the EU and the British state.  Did the Taoiseach make this proposal to the British Prime Minister?<\/p>  <p>  A report of the policy department of the citizens' rights and constitutional affairs of the European Parliament published a report that specifically warned that Brexit would affect the Good Friday Agreement.  It claims: \"The impact (of Brexit) will be political, in particular since the Good Friday Agreement - an international agreement - will require alteration\".  It also warns about \"the re-establishment of a hard border between the north and the south\" and the \"reversal of improvements in cross-border trade.\"  While it acknowledges the positive impact of EU funding streams in the past, it states that will not be the case in future and there will be a negative financial impact.<\/p>  <p>  The weekend saw the British Secretary of State deciding, on the anniversary of Bloody Sunday, that investigations by the PSNI and others into past events were too greatly focused on the actions of the British Army and other state forces.  That followed a whole series of attacks on the Public Prosecution Service and the Lord Chief Justice.  None of these claims is true.  What is true is a desire on the part of the British state and some Unionist parties to provide immunity to British soldiers and others.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100020#S00800","speaker":"1330"},{"type":"speech","time":1485879600,"counter":219,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100020#S00900","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1485879600,"counter":220,"content":"<p>Did the Taoiseach challenge the Prime Minister on this?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100020#S01000","speaker":"1330"},{"type":"speech","time":1485879600,"counter":221,"content":"<p>Before I call the Taoiseach, we have just a little over a minute left, so can we take ten minutes from the remaining groups of questions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100020#S01100","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1485879600,"counter":222,"content":"<p>Agreed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100020#S01200","speaker":"1330"},{"type":"speech","time":1485879600,"counter":223,"content":"<p>Will we take ten minutes from the second group?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100020#S01300","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1485879600,"counter":224,"content":"<p>From the third group.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100020#S01400","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1485879600,"counter":225,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100020#S01500","speaker":"1254"},{"type":"speech","time":1485879600,"counter":226,"content":"<p>Sorry.

Due to his constitutional powers the Taoiseach also has the ability to block the Oireachtas from even voting on most legislation, including amendments.  What he has never done is to outline his approach to using those powers or to discuss what reforms are required.  As a minority Government which says that it understands that it cannot impose its will on the majority, the Taoiseach's actions concerning the legislative agenda have become increasingly unacceptable.  The blocking of Deputy Jim O'Callaghan's Judicial Appointments Commission Bill on the grounds that it supposedly created a charge on the Exchequer was a very clear abuse and it involved the Taoiseach taking upon himself the right to effectively veto all legislation.  It was an unprecedented manoeuvre which was mean and petty.<\/p>  <p>  The simple question I put to the Taoiseach is if he intends honouring his commitment to allow non-governmental Bills to be voted on and enacted?  There was significant discussion on the issue prior to the formation of the Government and the reform of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, the balance between the Executive and the Legislature and it was accepted that there needed to be far more practical facilitation of legislation from the Opposition and that the issue of a charge on the Exchequer had been abused in the past, had been used excessively and that it would end and greater flexibility would be shown.  Is the Oireachtas going to be allowed to act as a proper legislative body or does the Taoiseach intend to maintain his personal right to veto anything he does not like?  There were clear political reasons why the Taoiseach tried to kill off the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100021#T02400","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1485880200,"counter":350,"content":"<p>Deputy Martin's question is in respect of the Bills in preparation in the Department.

The policy of appeasement in the 1930s of Hitler and the fascists was a disaster.  Anybody would recognise that.  He should have been recognised for the dangerous threat he was back then.  Trump is echoing those far-right and extremist policies and I put it to the Taoiseach there can be no appeasement of somebody like that.  Such a person has to be challenged, not have his hands shaken or be in any way legitimised or endorsed by the Taoiseach, particularly on a national day of celebration.

It has 38% of the population of the State.  By contrast, London has about 13% of the population of Britain.

Like all cultural institutions, it suffered during the economic difficulties of recent years, but is now looking to prepare for the future in a strategic fashion.  I have been pleased to have been able to increase the resources provided to the board in recent years.  The museum has also commissioned a master plan to provide for its future development.  This should be a valuable contribution to steering the museum's development in the years to come.  I appointed a new board to the museum in June 2016 under a dynamic new chair, Catherine Heaney, and I am confident it has a wide range of skills to address the challenges facing the museum and to ensure that the staff and management continue to deliver an excellent service to the public across the museum's four locations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100028#AA00900","speaker":"1249"},{"type":"speech","time":1485884400,"counter":506,"content":"<p>I understand that two finance staff of the museum, including the former financial manager, have taken personal injuries cases to the High Court for bullying within the National Museum of Ireland and that these cases were settled out of court by the museum.

The key objectives of this pillar are to increase access to the arts and enhance cultural facilities in rural communities, further develop and enhance culture and creativity in rural Ireland through the establishment of culture teams and creativity hubs as part of the Creative Ireland programme and promote the Irish language as a key resource in Gaeltacht and other rural communities.  These objectives will be delivered as part of the work programme across my Department, in particular, as part of the Creative Ireland programme which the Taoiseach and I launched in December. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100030#CC01700","speaker":"1249","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1485886200,"counter":538,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for her reply.

The victims, who fought their case long and hard against almost insurmountable odds, find there are two quite arbitrary and artificial barriers placed in their way by the State when trying to gain access to the State redress system.

Leaving aside the difficulty in acquiring evidence of a prior complaint back in the 1960s, the requirement requires a grotesque and deliberate misinterpretation of the judgment in the Louise O'Keeffe case.  Second, the victims are supposed to have sued the Minister for Education and Skills, which proceedings are no longer statute barred, or were no longer statute barred at a certain time.  The requirement to take proceedings against the Minister for Education and Skills flew in the face of all the legal advice the victims got at the time.

She went on to be vindicated by the European Court of Human Rights, which found that the State was liable for the abuse she faced in school.  At that time, the Taoiseach was forced to issue an apology to her.<\/p>  <p>  Despite this, the Government has thus far tried to avoid the consequences of the O'Keeffe ruling.  The focus on the need for prior complaints is completely bogus, as is hiding behind the suggestion that the case is statute barred.  The man responsible pleaded guilty to serious sexual assault.  There is no doubt about or question mark over the fact that the abuse occurred.  Despite this, the victims feel they are being persecuted for a second time 50 years on.  There are being told they do not qualify for the redress scheme through no fault of their own but through the actions of the State.  This is about the State accepting responsibility and apologising.  The least the Government could do in this regard would be to allow the victims into the scheme, which was set up precisely for this sort of circumstance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100033#FF00800","speaker":"1308"},{"type":"speech","time":1485887400,"counter":574,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for raising this issue.  I am very much aware of the stress suffered by individuals who have suffered from sexual abuse.  I have met such people and understand the concerns expressed by the Deputies.  The historical legacy of sexual abuse in Ireland is appalling.<\/p><p>The redress scheme, established under the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002, was intended to deal with very particular circumstances, namely, the abuse of children that occurred while the State was acting to a significant degree <i>in loco parentis<\/i>, that is, where children had been removed by the State from their parents and placed in institutions for their protection and welfare.  The redress scheme has not been extended to any institutions since 2005 and it has been closed for applications since September 2011.<\/p><p>The school referred to by the Deputies was not a residential institution, was not listed on the schedule of institutions covered by the legislation and, because it was a day school, was not eligible for inclusion within the redress scheme.  While there were calls for the redress scheme to be extended to other types of institutions and to day schools, the Government decided not to extend it.  The redress scheme was set up for particular types of institutions where children were placed in the care and protection of the State and did not have access to parental guidance or influence.<\/p><p>In the Louise O'Keeffe case, the European Court of Human Rights has found that the State has liability in these cases in specific circumstances, namely, where there was a prior complaint against the abuser in question and where the case is not statute barred.  In its response to the O'Keeffe judgment, the Government agreed that out-of-court settlements should be offered in those existing cases of school child sexual abuse being brought against the State where the cases come within the terms of the ruling and are not statute barred.  The State Claims Agency, which manages such cases on behalf of the State, has made settlement offers in six such cases, which have been accepted.  Subsequently, in July 2015, the Government approved proposals on the same basis to offer <i>ex gratia<\/i>payments up to a maximum of &euro;84,000 to those who initiated legal proceedings in cases of school child sexual abuse against the State but who subsequently discontinued their claims against the State.<\/p><p>Persons who believe their cases come within the criteria can contact the State Claims Agency and provide supporting evidence.  At this stage, I cannot say how many cases in this category will satisfy these criteria.  Where there is a disagreement between the State Claims Agency and the individual as to whether his circumstances come within the terms of the European Court's judgment, provision is being made for the application to be reviewed by an independent assessor.  In these settlements, the State will not be covering the liabilities of the perpetrators, school managers or patrons, or other co-defendants.  A person who suffered abuse or injury in school had recourse to report the matter to the relevant school or statutory authorities.  While the redress scheme has been closed since 2011, victims of sexual assault, like other injured persons, may bring personal injury cases for compensation through the courts for the injuries and loss they have suffered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100033#FF00900","speaker":"1293"},{"type":"speech","time":1485887400,"counter":575,"content":"<p>The Minister referred to an independent assessor to whom people can refer in the event of a disagreement between the claimant and the State Claims Agency.

That is how the residential institutions incurred State liability - the State had removed young people from their parents, set itself up to regulate the institutions where they were to be cared for, and failed in its duty.<\/p>  <p>  The situation with a day school is different, in that those schools were managed and run under school patrons and the State did not go to court, as it were, to place people in those institutions.  I understand that the court found liability on the part of the State in the Louise O'Keeffe case because the abuser had been identified and was known to the State and, as such, the State should have taken greater action to protect the child.  That is where the State's failing occurred.  This is the basis on which the Government's legal advice has interpreted the European court ruling.  The State must have known that an abuser was in place and did not take the steps required of it to protect children.  Unfortunately, this is the basis on which the State can be held liable.

I have been highlighting the need to fast-track the appointment of a child psychologist in north County Roscommon for a number of months.  It was one of the main points that I raised with the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, during a recent Oireachtas briefing for Members from Roscommon and Galway in light of the 36 Syrian children who will be seeking refuge in Ballaghaderreen in the coming weeks.  An immediate appointment is also necessary for the children of County Roscommon who have been languishing on an ever-growing waiting list since last summer.  I have tabled parliamentary questions on this matter and have had this matter listed for a Topical Issue debate.  In recent days, the Department of Health has approved a replacement post and a panel is in place.  This is welcome.  The pressure paid off in the end.  However, it is important that this vacancy be treated as a priority and filled as soon as possible.<\/p><p>Since many of the Syrian children coming to Ballaghaderreen will undoubtedly have suffered untold traumas, it is vital that the post be filled before they arrive in the first week of March.  Thirty-six children will be included in the group of 82 Syrians.  Of these, 13 are under four years of age, 19 are aged between five and 12 years and four are over 13 years of age.  There is a child psychologist covering the south of the country, but none is covering the remainder.  The child psychologist who was covering north Roscommon is on sick leave and the post has been vacant since before last summer.<\/p><p>Many Roscommon children are on the waiting list but are unable to access child psychological services.  For example, a six year old boy was referred by his GP.  After several weeks of phone calls, his parents finally received a call informing them that the psychologist looking after school-aged children had been on sick leave since last March and that a <i>locum<\/i>could not be found.  Officials could not say when the service would become available again, but they indicated that no children had been assessed since March and that the waiting list would be significant.  The school decided that it would use the single assessment that it was allocated each year to secure services for the child.  His school spent several weeks trying to find out when the assessment would take place, only to hear a few days before the Christmas break that no assessments would be offered to the school, as the psychologist was still on sick leave and no arrangements were being made for the post.  The family is not asking for preferential treatment or to skip the queue.  His parents just want to see him have access to the services that they contribute towards and that are supposed to be available in the public health care system.<\/p><p>Many of the Syrian children arriving in the county will have suffered a great deal of heartache and brutality.  They will need the support of child psychological services.  This issue must be addressed.  While I welcome the panel's creation, we must fill the vacancy urgently for the young people of County Roscommon who desperately need this service.  The list is growing.  We must deal with that, as we do not want long lists in situations such as this one.  The Minister of State will agree on the importance of having child psychological services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100034#GG00900","speaker":"1342"},{"type":"speech","time":1485888000,"counter":585,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue.  I am advised by the HSE that there is a vacancy in the psychology service in Roscommon arising from an extended sick leave and that a replacement post has been approved.  I understand that there is a basic grade psychology panel in place and that the vacancy is being treated as a priority and will be filled as soon as possible, taking account of the recruitment process.<\/p>  <p>  Primary care services are usually the first point of contact for families seeking help.  With appropriate information and training, GPs are best placed to recognise risk factors for mental health issues, provide treatment or advice where appropriate and refer to more appropriate services or specialist services when this is indicated.  Issues of a mild to moderate degree benefit from intervention at primary care level.  Many children and adolescents experience mild emotional difficulties, which are often transient and do not require specialist intervention, but require support from other services.<\/p><p>The HSE's national service plan provides &euro;5 million to address psychology services in primary care.  This allocation aims to support services to work more effectively through increased resources and the development of new ways of working both within primary care and between primary care and mental health services.  Primary care and mental health divisions in the HSE prepared joint plans for a more integrated primary care-based psychology service to focus on providing better access and using a multidisciplinary and multi-method approach.  The approach would address existing deficits and target areas of greatest need.<\/p> <p> From the funding, the HSE proposes to provide more than 100 assistant psychologist posts to deliver rapid access, low-intensity psychological interventions for young people with mild to moderate mental health problems.  That is currently being considered in the Department.  In addition, 20 additional staff grade psychologists for children in geographical areas, where there are no or an inadequate numbers of posts in place, are currently being recruited.<\/p> <p> The dedicated funding will also provide for the delivery a computerised cognitive behavioural therapy, cCBT, programme for young people.  The additional posts will provide services to service users under 18 years of age to address those waiting for treatment in the mental health and primary care divisions, while the online resource will also be developed for adolescents with mild to moderate mental health presentations.<\/p> <p> Resources are allocated to work towards ensuring there is a consistent baseline in terms of staffing across primary care services with the areas of greatest need being addressed in the first instance.  Working in partnership with other service provision stakeholders, primary care psychology services will adopt a stepped care model of service provision in child and adolescent services.  These services will include rapid assessment for all referrals, a single point of contact to the health care system for all non-crisis and non-complex emotional or behavioural referrals, and a continuum of care through integrated working with primary care and secondary care professionals and with community agencies.  Service provision will be monitored and evaluated regularly to ensure the resources are providing the new model of stepped care provision for young people.  The Deputy may rest assured that my Department, in conjunction with the HSE, will continue to closely monitor planned service improvements for this key care area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100034#GG01000","speaker":"1339","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1485888600,"counter":587,"content":"<p>I acknowledge the Minister of State's response.

I was informed the psychologist for the area is on long-term leave and national HSE approval is awaited for the temporary backfill of the post but, unfortunately, until such time as this position is filled there are insufficient resources within psychology to cross cover for this vacancy.

Some time will be available in the school come September but the centre of excellence in Athenry which deals with autism cases has a two-year waiting list.  We have significant problems within the system.  I am sure the Minister of State will acknowledge that.

One of the objectives of the structures is to ensure there is a co-ordinated approach to addressing the health care and support needs of the people arriving under the programme.  A number of health-related initiatives are already in place to support refugees.  In that context the Health Service Executive is working to assess the overall care needs of the group that is due to arrive in Ballaghaderreen, both at local level and with Tusla, and expects to put appropriate measures in place to address those needs.

The background information and supporting documentation refers to the need for services to be provided early in life to ameliorate a disability.  They set out the procedure for the application for the assessment of needs.  It states that the Act provides that the assessments must be started within three months of the application and also provides that the HSE must complete the assessment within three months.  That is a legal requirement of the HSE as set out in the Act.  Unfortunately, that is not the situation that pertains in south Tipperary and the legal entitlement is being breached.  Children are not being assessed within the three-month period.  There are huge delays in the assessment of needs of children.  The service is broken and we need an immediate solution.

The HSE recognises that it faces significant challenges in respect of meeting the statutory timeframes which apply to the assessment of need process.  The number of applications for assessment under the Act has increased each year since the Act was introduced.  More than 6,000 applications were received countrywide in 2016.  However, as of 31 December 2016, 100% of applications for south Tipperary, had commenced within the statutory timeframe.  At 31 December, there were a total of 42 applications overdue for completion with 14 of these overdue by less than one month and 32 overdue by less than three months.  In some individual assessments, it is more challenging to adhere to the statutory timelines, for example.  Where a psychology assessment is required, this may necessitate a number of visits over a prolonged period of time.  This would be true for instance regarding borderline cases on the autism spectrum.<\/p> <p> The Disability Act 2005 makes allowances for these exceptional circumstances in individual assessments as regards the timeline for completion of assessments.  In south Tipperary, it is acknowledged that there is currently a deficit in psychology services, a function which is essential for the completion of the assessment of need report.  However, recruitment is under way to fill an additional post for a senior psychology post for the early intervention team.  I know the Deputy will welcome this news.  Interviews are to be held in February.  The current Programme for a Partnership Government commits this Government to improving services and increasing supports for people with disabilities, particularly for early assessment and intervention for children with special needs.<\/p> <p> The HSE has recognised that early intervention services and services for school aged children with disabilities need to be improved and organised more effectively.  To this end, a major reconfiguration of therapy resources for children with disabilities aged up to 18 years is well under way.  This involves bringing staff from different service providers together into network teams and is called the national programme on progressing disability services for children and young people, nought to 18 years.  Since 2014, the roll out of the national programme on progressing disability services for children and young people, nought to 18 years, has entailed targeted investment of &euro;14 million and the provision of 275 additional therapy staff to increase services for children with all disabilities.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100035#HH00600","speaker":"1339","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1485889200,"counter":593,"content":"<p>I acknowledge the Minister of State's reply and welcome the statement that a senior psychology post for the early intervention team is to be filled and that interviews will take place in February.

This scheme is operated by local authorities and gives tenants the opportunities to buy their homes.  As the Minister of State will be aware, certain categories of houses under the ownership of local authorities cannot be sold to tenants under legislation.  These include properties that have been transferred to a planning authority in accordance with and agreement under section 96 of the Planning and Development Act - in other words, Part V houses.  If a developer builds a private estate, a certain percentage of houses in it are handed over to the local authority.  If someone is a council tenant living in one of those properties, they are unable to buy their homes under the legislation.<\/p>  <p>  I raise this issue for two reasons.  The first is because I wonder whether the Department has any plans to review the policy and make a once-off offer to those tenants.  I am dealing with a constituent who has been a tenant in one of these properties for the past ten years.  She qualifies under all of the other criteria - in other words, she has been a tenant for ten years and is within the income limits but, unfortunately, she is in this category of houses which under the legislation cannot be sold or transferred.  The sad thing is that these tenants will probably never have the opportunity to buy their own homes unless there is some review of the legislation.  They do not earn enough to get mortgages to buy brand new homes.  The point of a tenant purchase scheme is to give tenants who have been living in a local authority the opportunity to buy their homes at a reduced price.<\/p>  <p>  The second issue I want to raise concerns local authorities.  The lady to whom I referred got a letter in June 2011 asking for expressions of interest under the 2011 scheme.  At that moment in time, she did not go ahead with it because she did not meet the other criteria - in other words, she had not been a tenant for ten years.  She received another letter requesting an expression of interest in August 2016.  I have no issue with the letter because it clearly stated on behalf of Cork County Council that a tenant was only qualified for the scheme if they had been occupying a property which was available for sale from the council.  The letter referred to the tenant handbook which outlines the properties which are tenants are unable to buy.  Unfortunately, the tenant did not refer to the handbook.  My issue is that the council has a list of these properties and should not send out letters to tenants by name and address when it knows very well from the outset that these tenants cannot buy one of these houses under the scheme.  She received the letter on 17 August 2016 and made her expression of interest.  The council asked for a set of accounts for herself and her husband.<\/p><p>She went through all that rigmarole and paid a &euro;100 deposit.  It took the council three months to write back to inform her she was not eligible under the legislation.  This family's hopes were raised that they would finally be in a position to buy their own home, only to be informed that this was, in fact, not possible.  Are there any plans to introduce a once-off derogation to allow tenants in that position the opportunity to buy their homes?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100036#JJ00500","speaker":"1280","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1485889800,"counter":598,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  The Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Coveney, cannot be here and has asked me to respond on his behalf.<\/p>  <p>  The incremental tenant purchase scheme came into operation on 1 January 2016 and is open to eligible tenants, including joint tenants, of local authority houses that are available for sale under the scheme.  The Housing (Sale of Local Authority Houses) Regulations 2015 governing the scheme provide for a number of specified classes of properties to be excluded from sale, including units provided to local authorities under Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, houses designed for occupation by older people, group Traveller housing, and houses provided for persons with disabilities making the transition from congregated settings to community-based living.  Local authorities may also exclude houses for reasons of proper estate management of stock, on account of their structural condition, or on the basis of proposals the authority may have to carry out remedial works in the estate concerned or regenerate the area in which the house is located.<\/p>  <p>  The provisions of Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, are designed to enable the development of mixed-tenure, sustainable communities.  Part V units are excluded from the incremental tenant purchase scheme to ensure units delivered under that mechanism remain available for people in need of social housing support and that the original policy goals of the legislation are not eroded over time.  The continued development of mixed-tenure communities remains very important in promoting social integration.  In addition, Part 3 of the 2014 Act obliges tenants to meet certain criteria in order to be eligible for the scheme.  These include having a minimum reckonable income of &euro;15,000 per annum and having been in receipt of social housing support for at least one year.<\/p>  <p>  In the determination of the minimum reckonable income, housing authorities may include income from a number of different sources and classes, such as employment, private pensions, maintenance payments and certain social welfare payments, including pensions, where the social welfare payment is secondary to employment income.  I understand there may be some tenants whose application under the scheme was refused on the basis they do not meet this income criterion.  This element of the scheme rules was introduced to safeguard the sustainability of the scheme itself.  It is essential that an applicant's income is long term and sustainable in nature.  This is necessary to ensure the tenant purchasing the house is in a financial position, as the owner, to maintain and insure the property for the duration of the charged period, in compliance with the conditions of the order transferring the ownership of, and responsibility for, the house from the local authority to the tenant.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100037#KK00200","speaker":"1307"},{"type":"speech","time":1485889800,"counter":599,"content":"<p>I acknowledge the regulations were put in place to ensure communities were of a mixed tenure and to enable integration.

I would understand if the property in question was designed for somebody with a disability, in which case it would be in the best interests of the council to retain it in the longer term given the huge shortage of properties suitable for persons with disabilities.  However, we are talking about a three-bedroom semi-detached house which has not been upgraded or refurbished to make it accessible.  The tenant and her family have been living there for ten years and, under the current legislation, will never have the opportunity to purchase it.

The enactment of the Bill will strengthen the position of people in this section of society even further.  I have long been a supporter of rights for persons with disabilities and ratification of this convention is one my own key priorities.  I appreciate there are many Members of the House who are also committed to this issue and have sought the ratification of the convention for some time.  It has taken longer than expected to get to this stage and I am disappointed we were not in a position to ratify by the end of 2016, as we had committed to do in A Programme for a Partnership Government.  However, the Bill before us will, when enacted, bring about changes to a range of legislation that will have a real effect on the lives of persons with disabilities.<\/p>  <p>  The ratification of the convention is the first action listed in the soon to be published National Disability Inclusion Strategy 2011-2020.  The process to get to this point has been complex and drawn out.  I accept the criticisms of colleagues in this regard.  It has been difficult to deal with the many complex issues.  However, when we ratify, we will be doing so in the knowledge there is no legislation on the Statute Book that contradicts the convention, as is the case in some other countries.  It is essential that the State is in a position to meet the obligations it assumes under the terms of any international agreement from the moment of its entry into force for Ireland.  For us, ratification is the end of the preparation and implementation process, not the beginning.  That was a crucial aspect of our preparations in bringing forward this Bill.<\/p><p>Ratification of a convention before we have amended domestic legislation that contradicts it makes no sense and does nothing to ensure compliance or to actually protect the people for whose benefit the convention exists.<br\/><br\/>The Bill covers a range of legislation covering very different areas of Irish life.  I thank the Attorney General's office and the many other Departments that have been involved in the development of the Bill because it is not limited just to the Departments that I have responsibility for, but has a much wider reach.  Despite the hard work of all involved, it was not possible to include all the heads as set out in the general scheme, which was approved by the previous Government in March of last year.  I will outline shortly what remains to be completed.  While the primary aim of the Bill is to remove the statutory barriers to ratification of the convention, the opportunity is also being taken to progress a number of other miscellaneous amendments to equality and disability legislation.  I will now put on the record of the House the main provisions of the Bill.<br\/><br\/>Section 1 provides for amendment of the Juries Act 1976 to provide that a person who is deaf shall not be ineligible for jury service by reason only of his or her requiring the services of a sign language interpreter and that the existing prohibition on a person with a mental illness or disability and is receiving medical treatment or is resident in a hospital or similar institution from serving is replaced with a functional capacity test.  Section 2 provides for amendment of the Electoral Act 1992 to repeal the prohibition on a person of unsound mind from standing for election to the D&aacute;il and thereby also removing the disqualifications for membership of the Seanad and for election to the European Parliament.<br\/><br\/>Section 3 makes two amendments relevant to the National Disability Authority, NDA, legislation.  It makes provision for the role of the authority as part of the monitoring mechanism for the convention and provides that staff of the authority become civil servants of the State.  The NDA is the only body within the justice Vote whose staff are not civil servants.  I thank the staff on the team at the NDA for the magnificent work they have done since I took over as Minister of State.  Aside from the impact this anomaly has on the management of human resources within the justice Vote, by limiting the Department's flexibility to move staff to fill priority needs, that the NDA's staff are public servants means the board must meet pension liabilities as they arise from its annual allocation.  This is a serious burden for a small body with a relatively small financial allocation.  Civil servant of the State status would mean that pension liabilities are met from the Vote for superannuation, and that was the approach adopted regarding the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission when it was established in November 2014.<br\/><br\/>With regard to section 4, the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, provides for reasonable accommodation, that is, practical help to ensure that the person with a disability can, for example, access a service provided for people with disabilities in the areas of employment and provision of services, provided the cost does not exceed a disproportionate cost.  The Supreme Court decided in an Article 26 referral of the Employment Equality Bill 1996 that it would be unconstitutional to impose such a requirement where the cost exceeds a nominal cost.  The Supreme Court decision hinges on the private property protection provisions of the Constitution.  Clearly, these do not arise in regard to the provision of public services.<br\/><br\/>The Attorney General has advised that the &quot;not exceeding a disproportionate burden&quot; standard is also appropriate in the case of commercial bodies whose activities are regulated for quality of service <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>banks, insurance companies, telecommunications and transport providers and credit unions.  We are then left with a range of smaller businesses, such as shops and restaurants.  The provision of the higher standard in the case of the remaining private sector providers can be considered in the light of developments with regard to EU anti-discrimination legislation and will need to be subject in the interim to a reservation.<br\/><br\/>Section 5 brings civilian staff of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na back within the terms of Part 5 of the Disability Act, providing for a 3% public sector employment quota for people with disabilities.  This group of Civil Service staff were inadvertently removed from the scope of Part 5 by the enactment of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.  I have also set myself a target to try to get that figure of 3% employment for people with disabilities up to 6% over the coming years.  We should be ambitious and have a vision, and we also have a strategy.<br\/><br\/>Section 6 makes two amendments relevant to the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission legislation.  It provides for the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission to act as <i>arnicas curiae<\/i>before the Court of Appeal, as well as before the High Court and the Supreme Courts as already provided for, but for technical and timing reasons it was not possible to include a reference to the Court of Appeal in the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014, or to insert a cross-reference in the Court of Appeal Act 2014.  The opportunity is being taken now to resolve that anomaly.  It also creates a statutory basis for the IHREC's role in the monitoring framework in regard to the UNCRPD.<br\/><br\/>Section 7 provides for citation and commencement.  I would also like to highlight the heads that are to be included in the Bill as Committee Stage amendments but which were not ready in time for inclusion in the published Bill.  The main head that is\u00a0outstanding deals with deprivation of liberty.  That is a very important issue and a number of my colleagues have raised it.  A draft text for the deprivation of liberty part of this Bill has been prepared by the Department of Health, but it requires further work before it can be submitted to the Government.  The Department of Health will sponsor a separate memorandum for the Government on this aspect as soon as the text is at a sufficiently advanced stage and it is intended that these provisions will be brought forward as Committee Stage amendments.  I suspect that this aspect of the outstanding work will take the longest to bring to finality.  Clearly, depriving a person of his or her liberty can only be accepted as a last resort.  An appropriate balance needs to be struck between protecting individuals who may be a danger to themselves or others by ensuring that we can provide social care in suitable settings for vulnerable individuals, and recognising that citizens should be free to make decisions for themselves except where the person&rsquo;s decision-making capacity is lacking.<br\/><br\/>With regard to the other heads on which work is ongoing, head 6 proposes to amend section 4 of the Criminal Law (Insanity) Act 2006 to provide that in the circumstances that existed in G. <i>v.<\/i>District Judge Murphy, the District Court will have jurisdiction to determine whether the accused person is in fact fit to be tried.  What is at issue here is to ensure that if a person is deemed to be not fit to be tried by the District Court and is sent on to the Circuit Court, and if the second court forms the view that the person is in fact fit to be tried, the lower limit on penalties available in the District Court should still apply to that person.  That explanation is in layman&rsquo;s language, and I have a more detailed legal explanatory text if Deputies have any questions later.<br\/><br\/>Head 7 provides for the replacement of a number of references in statute to &quot;lunatics&quot; or &quot;persons of unsound mind&quot; where the reference makes the person ineligible for membership or ceases to be a member of certain bodies or offices in so far as those amendments may be required for ratification.  This head has an impact on a number of items of legislation.<br\/><br\/>Head 10 provides for amendments to the Equal Status Acts 2000 to 2015.  Following the enactment of the Gender Recognition Act 2015, it is desirable to make explicit the prohibition of discrimination against transgender persons under equality legislation to reflect the significance of the establishment of a system of legal recognition of the acquired gender or transgender persons and of intersex persons.<br\/><br\/>Head 11 provides for amendments to the Employment Equality Acts 1998 to 2015.  It follows head 10 in making a corresponding amendment to the Employment Equality Acts.<br\/><br\/>Head 12 amends the Employment Equality Acts to encompass prospective employees, employers, vocational training bodies, professional bodies and trade unions in the definition of victimisation.  At present, the text of the definition of victimisation refers only to an employer-employee relationship.<\/p><p>This is out of line with EU legislation and the jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice.<\/p> <p> Head 13 deals with amendment of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  This amendment was intended for inclusion in the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act but for timing reasons it was not possible to include it.  The opportunity is being taken to make the amendment now.  The amendment to the Taxes Consolidation Act will include the categories of decision-making representatives and attorneys as persons authorised to handle tax matters on behalf of incapacitated people.<\/p> <p> Head 15 is an amendment of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005.  This is a new head which was not included in the general scheme as approved by the Government in March 2016.  The existing legislative provisions in the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 empower the Minister for Social Protection to make regulations to appoint a person to act on behalf of a recipient or beneficiary of social welfare payments in circumstances where the recipient or beneficiary is certified by a registered medical practitioner to be a person who is, or is likely soon to become, unable for the time being to manage his or her own financial affairs.  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 sets out guiding principles that are intended to safeguard the autonomy and dignity of the person with impaired capacity and it is vital the social protection arena takes full account of these principles.<\/p> <p> The Bill will be progressed to enactment at an early date to facilitate ratification of the UN convention as soon as possible.  The precise timing of ratification now depends on how long it takes for the Bill to progress through the enactment process and on issues relating to commencement of the deprivation of liberty provisions, which will be included in the Committee Stage amendments, and of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015.  Considerable progress has already been made to overcome the other legislative barriers to ratification that are not being addressed in the Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.<\/p> <p> The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 was signed into law on 30 December 2015 and is a comprehensive reform of the law on decision-making capacity.  The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill 2015 completed Committee Stage in December 2016 and is scheduled to return to the D&aacute;il for Report Stage on 1 February 2017.  When enacted, the Bill will reform section 5 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 to facilitate the full participation in family life of persons with intellectual disabilities and the full expression of their human rights.  Achieving the necessary balance between these rights and ensuring appropriate protection is crucial.<\/p> <p> The legislation is good news not just for those who are directly affected by disability, but for all members of society, as it seeks to make society more equal and inclusive.  Equality and inclusivity are issues I want to push.  I look forward to engaging further with Deputies from all sides of the House to ensure an effective Bill is passed and enacted as soon as the outstanding work has been completed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100037#KK01000","speaker":"1359","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1485891000,"counter":609,"content":"<p>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this important and very long awaited Bill.  It is a crucial milestone towards creating a more inclusive society.  For my part and that of my party, we are committed to creating a more inclusive society and to dismantling barriers in a range of sectors that prevent people with disabilities from fully participating in society.  We need to ensure that people with disabilities are given equality of opportunity so they can participate in society to the best of their abilities.  For people with a disability, their challenge is often compounded not because of their disability, but because of how society treats people with disabilities.  During Fianna F&aacute;il's time in Government, we contributed to moving disability policy from a model that was based on management, charity, pity and, in some cases, neglect towards a social care model, recognising that people with disabilities are full and equal citizens entitled not only to dignity and respect, but also to independence, choice and control over their own lives.<\/p>  <p>  We are committed to the removal of barriers that prevent people with disabilities from fully participating in society and exercising their rights and entitlements as citizens, but there cannot be any complacency as the latest HIQA reports show very clearly.  Fianna F&aacute;il welcomes and broadly supports the provisions of the Bill, the primary aim of which is to address the remaining legislative barriers to Ireland's ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  However, we are disappointed that the Bill as published is incomplete, with many significant sections to be provided through Committee Stage amendments.  The Bill as published contains six substantive sections, and judging by what is proposed for Committee Stage, at least another six sections are in the offing.  It would appear that in order to meet the programme for Government commitment on ratification, it was imperative to publish a Bill come what may.  However, to publish what is essentially half a Bill is hardly the best way to honour the ratification of this very important United Nations convention.<\/p>  <p>  While the Bill has received a broad welcome, its content, and the absence of other content, has generated some concern among those who campaign for disability rights and inclusion.  I will take this opportunity to raise some of these concerns with the Minister of State, and I hope he will reply to them when he is responding to this Second Stage debate.  As I stated, while publication of the Bill is welcome, its incomplete nature has generated much concern.  The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission is worried that a significant number of provisions in the Bill are due to be introduced through Committee Stage amendments, which significantly limits the scope for detailed analysis on which the commission can provide meaningful commentary.  The commission states this problem is especially acute with regard to the deprivation of liberty aspect of the Bill.  It states the human rights and equality implications of how deprivation of liberty is regulated are highly dependent on the processes and safeguards which will accompany the provision.  To carry out meaningful analysis of the adequacy of safeguards from a human rights and equality perspective it is necessary to consider the particulars of the proposal including, for example, the scope of the reform, how detention will be reviewed and the particulars of an appeal mechanism together with the remedies proposed to allow a person obtain appropriate redress and reparation.  The commission also states that in the absence of published draft legislation it is difficult for it to discharge its function to examine legislative proposals and make concrete recommendations which can be of use to the Legislature, particularly on this aspect of reform.<\/p>  <p>  It should be noted this concern is also shared by Inclusion Ireland, which states that legislative clarity is required on the issue of deprivation of liberty.  Inclusion Ireland points out how in the UK deprivation of liberty is defined as when a person is under continuous supervision and control and is not free to leave, the person lacks capacity to consent to these arrangements, and, conversely, that any care that restricts a person's liberty is appropriate and in the person's best interests.  If a UK facility wants to detain someone, it must get permission first and the care facility processes the safeguards.<\/p>  <p>  The Centre for Disability Law and Policy has also expressed concern about key amendments, including those on the deprivation of liberty of persons with disabilities being introduced on Committee Stage.  It states these are key human rights issues for people with disabilities, mental health service users and older people, but to date there has been no public consultation with these communities about the proposed legal changes.  It also states that because amendments are only being introduced on Committee Stage, there will be less opportunity to debate the provisions.  The centre is calling on the Department of Health and the Department of Justice and Equality to immediately publish their proposals for legal reform in this area and to engage in meaningful consultation with those who will be directly affected by this part of the law.  In light of these concerns, it may be worthwhile for the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality to hear in public from interested parties when the amendments are published and prior to Committee Stage.<\/p>  <p>  I will now turn to what is in the Bill.  Section 1 deals with jury service.  While the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission welcomes the proposed reform to amend the ineligibility condition for participation on a jury, it states the best approach involves an explicit presumption of capacity and that a person should not be ineligible by reason of his or her requiring reasonable accommodation.<\/p><p>The commission states that persons should be presumed to have capacity to serve on a jury and that reasonable accommodation should be provided to secure maximum participation in jury service.  Inclusion Ireland is concerned that the section on jury service is not consistent with the functional approach of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015.  It states that a person&rsquo;s capacity is assessed functionally and on the basis of his or her ability to understand, at the time that a decision is to be made, the nature and consequences of the decision to be made by him or her in the context of the available choices at that time.  A person will also enjoy a presumption of capacity to make decisions.  A person lacks capacity if he or she cannot understand information, retain information, use information and communicate a choice.  The Centre for Disability Law and Policy echoes this by stating: \"A more human rights-compliant approach would be to disqualify a person who does not, in the opinion of the court, have the ability to perform the functions required of a juror, following the provision of reasonable accommodation.\"<\/p> <p> With regard to a monitoring framework for the implementation of the Act when passed, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, welcomes confirmation of its proposed role in the monitoring framework required to be established.  The Bill proposes to give the commission the role to keep under review the adequacy and effectiveness of law and practice in the State relating to the protection of persons with disabilities.  However, the commission points to the heads of the Bill which would have provided that it is a function of the commission to act as the independent mechanism to promote, protect and monitor implementation of the convention.  The IHREC states that the function proposed under the Bill should be clearly linked to the commission&rsquo;s designation as the independent mechanism under Article 33 of the CRPD.  This would better align with the view of the UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities that states must \"adopt the necessary legal measures to clearly establish the independent mechanism\".  The Minister might clarify why the reference to an independent mechanism, which was contained in the heads, did not feature in the Bill as published.  Furthermore the Centre for Disability Law and Policy has said it is concerned that the Bill does not provide any additional funding to the commission to carry out this work.<\/p> <p> Inclusion Ireland highlights another issue which the Minister should address.  It states that the proposals relating to an advisory committee are concerning.  The Bill states that \"at least half of the number of persons appointed... shall have, or have had, a disability\".  Inclusion Ireland believes that any advisory body should wholly comprise persons with personal, lived experience of disability and that this committee should be representative of all forms of disability.  It should be adequately resourced and facilitated and its members accommodated and supported.<\/p> <p> Turning now to the issue of reasonable accommodation, both Inclusion Ireland and the Centre for Disability Law and Policy signal some concerns here.  The former states that it is deeply regrettable that Ireland will enter a reservation in regard to reasonable accommodation and that different levels for reasonable accommodation, such as nominal cost for private services and disproportionate burden for public services in employment law, will operate in tandem.  The Centre for Disability Law and Policy states that it is gravely concerned that the Department of Justice and Equality proposes to enter reservations or declarations on Articles 12 and 14 relating to equal recognition before the law and liberty.  These articles are core to the spirit and purpose of the convention and we urge the Government to commit to their full implementation in line with the guidance provided by the UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.<\/p> <p> I have raised these concerns because I believe it is critical for the Government to address them.  While Fianna F&aacute;il welcomes and broadly supports the provisions of this Bill, we will be tabling some constructive amendments to the published Bill.  We welcome the fact that the Bill has finally appeared but its abridged state means that we have to temper our response somewhat.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100039#MM00200","speaker":"1262","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1485891600,"counter":611,"content":"<p>I welcome the progression of the Bill to this Stage.  I am pleased to speak on the legislation and am glad my party will support it to ensure Ireland can finally move to ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  We engaged with the Minister on Committee Stage and the Minister is trying to meet a self-inflicted timeline.  Interaction has been complicated and it has been difficult at departmental level to get it drafted.<\/p>  <p>  It is unfortunate we have not seen the full Bill and that we have to table amendments on Committee Stage.  That undermines what the Minister and this House are trying to do as regards full oversight capacity on Second Stage.  It covers issues such as adequate standard of living and social protection, independent living, inclusivity, access to services, including health and education and privacy, among a host of other rights.  Ireland signed this convention in 2017, ten years ago.  We remain the only EU country not to have ratified it.  I look forward to the Bill being brought before the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality, of which I am a member, for further detailed scrutiny and constructive amendments which I and my colleagues, Deputies Murphy O'Mahony and O'Callaghan, will table.  The committee has already conducted pre-legislative scrutiny on the general scheme of the Bill, which has proven very helpful in understanding the strengths and weaknesses reflected by the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  It is crucial the required legislation is enacted so that the convention can be ratified.  This will ensure greater rights and dignity for the 600,000 people in Ireland who have a disability.  It will remove unfair and discriminatory provisions against people and will provide for better safeguards.  It will give people with disabilities a voice and will enable them to become more active players in decision-making around what services and supports they need and receive.  It is not only a matter of rights but how those rights are implemented, resourced and reflected in every part of our community, as well as at the departmental level.  When the committee engaged I asked the Minister what engagement the Department had had at a cross-departmental level and that has to be a focus.  This is the formal part but if it is not given life by the Department and put front and centre from the point of view of resource allocation then it will not deliver on its rights-based and codified approach.<\/p>  <p>  Regular reviews of procedures and process are also to be welcomed.  Ratifying the convention will also provide proper mechanisms of oversight and accountability and will allow for complaints to be made and heard where people feel their rights are not being recognised.  It is a great shame that it has taken all this time, and will take more, to achieve these basic and fundamental rights and entitlements.  Given the incomplete nature of the Bill before us, many questions remain as to how it will progress.  How will people with experience of disabilities be resourced and facilitated to play a crucial role in monitoring the implementation of the convention?  How will people with lived experience be key constituents in monitoring the UNCRPD in Ireland, as outlined in the convention?  These are among a multitude of concerns that I know are held by many human rights groups and stakeholders.  I understand and I am acutely aware of the frustrations felt by many over the slow pace of change.  I will take these concerns and considerations on board in my own work in ensuring this legislation is properly developed and enhanced and we will table a number of amendments on Committee Stage to deliver the best legislation for people whom it is meant to positively affect.<\/p>  <p>  I am cognisant of the lack of engagement felt by key stakeholders and by the people and families directly affected by this legislation.  This, too, is a missed opportunity because the Department had time to properly reach out to those groups which have not been consulted.  The Minister is shaking his head but it is not I who say this - it is the groups and stakeholders who are saying it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100040#NN00200","speaker":"1255"},{"type":"speech","time":1485891600,"counter":612,"content":"<p>I meet them regularly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100040#NN00300","speaker":"1359"},{"type":"speech","time":1485891600,"counter":613,"content":"<p>They have publicly said that they feel they should have been consulted in a more wholesome way.  It is an unfortunate reflection of the public debate.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the many disability groups, including the Disability Federation of Ireland and the Equality Rights Alliance, for their work and advocacy in fighting for the rights of people with disabilities.  I pay tribute to the many centres for independent living, including the Blanchardstown centre in my own constituency, which do phenomenal work for people with disabilities.  I have been privileged to witness, at first hand, the important work they undertake to support disabled people and I have seen the incredible progress people can make with the right measure of encouragement, support and understanding.<\/p><p>By adopting a rights-based approach, it is important this is imposed on every resource allocation.  Before Christmas, in Mulhuddart in my constituency, there was an issue about the angle of a path and how someone was unable to cross the road to access the centre for independent living.  In fairness to Fingal County Council, it is trying to rectify the matter but without its positive approach people would be left behind.  It is important we couple what we are doing now and in the coming weeks with a real implementation of this approach across every level of Government and every resource allocation.<\/p> <p> My party has always been committed to fighting injustice and discrimination in all forms and to creating a more equal and inclusive society.  We are dedicated to removing restrictions that inhibit people with disabilities and ensuring that everyone can fulfil his or her potential to participate and contribute to a diverse society.  I am proud that Fianna F&aacute;il was the first party to outline a detailed commitment to address the needs and rights of those with disabilities.  The first national disability strategy was developed and commenced as a result of the party's work in this area.  This saw the creation of more residential and respite care places, the passing of important disability legislation and the setting of targets to ensure this was delivered.<\/p> <p> This continues to be followed in our national policy today as we move from an institutionalised approach to a community-based one.  The Bill before us is another important step in our support for people with disabilities.  It is a significant shift from a medical model to a rights-based system and it is welcome.  However, a number of important provisions will be required on Committee Stage.  Clarity is required on who has statutory responsibility for a decision on a patient leaving a residential care facility.  The absence of a statutory provision regarding deprivation of liberties in such cases means we are unable to comply with the UN convention as drafted.  The point is that there is no statutory law here.  Other provisions that will need to be brought forward relate to a person's fitness to be tried and the prohibition of discrimination against transgender persons, as well as the definition of victimisation.<\/p> <p> I wish to mention an excellent article by Mr. Paddy Connolly, the CEO of Inclusion Ireland, in which he said that people with disabilities are not a diagnosis, they are human.  In fairness to the Minister of State, the Department and everyone else involved, we are trying to remove a dehumanised approach that labels people.  We should value lives so that those with disabilities are given full resource allocations.  An inclusive decision-making approach is required so that people are not seen as a process of existence, but are put at centre stage.  They must be given the full capacity to live the life they want within our society.  <\/p> <p> We must address matters such as the quality of life of those within our communities.  This Bill will go some way towards achieving that.  An interdepartmental and intersectional approach is crucial to embracing the spirit of what the Minister of State is trying to achieve.  The Government should fully commence the Education of Persons with Special Needs Act 2004, the Citizens Information Act 2007 and the Disability Act 2005.  These measures were mentioned by Mr. Connolly in his article.<\/p> <p> I look forward to working constructively with the Minister of State on this legislation to ensure that Ireland ratifies the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, in order to protect the rights of people with disabilities in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100040#NN00400","speaker":"1255","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1485892200,"counter":615,"content":"<p>I wish share time with my colleagues, Deputies John Brady and Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100041#OO00200","speaker":"1280"},{"type":"speech","time":1485892200,"counter":616,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

In the past 12 months, I have tabled a number of questions to the Minister of State concerning his timeline for publishing legislation which will enable us to ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  The Minister of State put a tight timeline on himself last year when he said he would publish the Bill before the end of 2016.  He has slipped by a couple of weeks and probably a couple of heads as well going by the legislation before us.<\/p>  <p>  It is certainly a good day, but not a great day unfortunately.  I have to be honest with the Minister of State about that.  I am concerned that he indicated he will bring forward a raft of amendments on Committee Stage to address some of the heads that were contained in the general scheme of the Bill, but which were not in the Bill as published.  When will we have Committee Stage?  I suspect that the debate on Second Stage will conclude quickly because everyone wants to move forward with this.  Everyone wants to see full ratification but there are some doubts as to whether we will see that.  It is my understanding that a number of reservations will be put in by the Government, although we can deal with them at a later stage.<\/p>  <p>  One suspects that we will not see Committee Stage in the short term.  I am sure that despite the Minister of State's own timelines, he would have preferred to hold off on debating this and instead finalise the amendments he will bring on Committee Stage and get them into the Bill.  In that case, we could all discuss what needs to be done.  Unfortunately, so far, the debate has been about what is not in the Bill, rather than what it contains.  <\/p>  <p>  Previous speakers mentioned the issues we need to address.  I echo what Deputy Jack Chambers said about the groups and NGOs in this field.  They feel they have not be sufficiently consulted.  The Minister of State talks to those groups regularly.  I talk to lots of people every day but that is not the same as consulting them.  Saying that he will talk to them is one thing, but it is quite another to bring them to the table as equals and consult them on this legislation.  Some of those groups have expressed reservations and feel they were not fully listened to.  They say that their concerns were not taken on board.  We need to examine that.<\/p>  <p>  I take Deputy Murphy O'Mahony's point about amendments on Committee Stage.  Given the way the legislative process works, those groups will not have an opportunity to appear before the Select Committee on Justice and Equality, which will be dealing with these amendments on Committee Stage, and give their viewpoints on it.  If that could happen, however, it would be excellent.<\/p>  <p>  I remind the Minister of State that Article 33.3 of the UN convention outlines how people with a lived experience of disability will be facilitated in the role of monitoring the implementation of the convention within this State.  The Minister of State should outline how that will be addressed.  The deprivation of liberty will not be addressed on Committee Stage, although that is one of the core aspects that needs to be included in order for this State to comply with the UNCRPD.  The fact that it will only be included on Committee Stage, rather than on Second Stage, is a mistake.<\/p>  <p>  Article 14B of the UNCRPD clearly states that persons with disabilities should not be deprived of liberty unlawfully or arbitrarily, that any deprivation of liberty is in conformity with the law, and that the existence of a disability shall in no case justify a deprivation of liberty.  That must be put into a statutory provision.  I know it is the Minister of State's intention to do so, but we have not seen how that will happen.  I encourage the Minister of State to publish the amendments as quickly as possible.  When he replies to this debate he should outline the timeframe for taking Committee Stage and the publication of those amendments.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill deals with jury service, the Electoral Acts and an expansion of regional accommodation, which is welcome.  It also provides an opportunity to include persons with a disability in a meaningful way in the advisory committee to the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, in a monitoring capacity.  That has not been included in the Bill, so it needs to be addressed on Committee Stage.<\/p><p> Deputy Chambers touched on the recent remarks of the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to the effect that the focal point of the convention should be close to the heart of government such as in the office of a president or prime minister or cabinet office.  I understand we have a \"super junior\" in the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, but some would argue that the equality division within the Department of Justice and Equality is too narrow and too siloed and that it would be better to put this within the Department of the Taoiseach.  I remain open to argument on that but Deputy Chambers touched on the interdepartmental collaboration which will be needed and the leadership at Cabinet level.  If this came under the Department of the Taoiseach, the Minister of State would probably put himself out of a job.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100041#OO00400","speaker":"1280","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1485892800,"counter":619,"content":"<p>It is tough enough.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100042#PP00200","speaker":"1359"},{"type":"speech","time":1485892800,"counter":620,"content":"<p>I am not suggesting he do that, but that he at least look at what the High Commissioner's office has said.

We need to look at all of that in the round, which is why I would welcome the publication of the amendments as quickly as possible.  While we will support what is in front of us today, without those amendments we have to ask when we will see the full ratification, which is what people want to know.  We cannot see full ratification in this Bill alone.  If the Minister of State is talking about just having amendments, I ask him to outline the timeframe.

They have waited a long time to listen to this debate.  Unfortunately, a number of them told me that the timing of the debate has meant a number of people could not be here this evening.  The example of disability activists from Galway was cited.  They would have had to travel here on a Tuesday evening, stay overnight and use up all their critical and hard-won personal assistance hours in the process.  They feel very excluded whereas the key to the legislation is inclusion.  They would have liked to be here for this critical debate but, unfortunately, it was not to be.<\/p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in welcomes any positive move to ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  This is long overdue.  It is a real shame that we are reaching the tenth anniversary of the signing of the convention in March 2007 without having ratified it.  It is clear evidence that people with disabilities have not been a priority for successive Governments whether led by Fianna F&aacute;il or Fine Gael.  Indeed, the deadline for ratification set out by the previous Government in October 2015 has come and gone and Ireland remains the only country in Europe which has failed to ratify the convention.  Other countries have ratified without having to change legislation.  It is the view of many disabled people and disability activists that there is no legislative barrier to Ireland's ratification of the convention.<\/p>  <p>  The most alarming aspect of the Bill, as cited to me by many people with disabilities and those who have been active over many years, is the sudden absence of the word \"equality\".  Only last month, the Minister of State referred to the Bill at the joint committee as the \"equality\/disability (miscellaneous provisions) Bill\".  However, the word \"equality\" has been removed from the Short Title of the Bill.  At the very least, this is questionable and it has raised many concerns among those who have been actively involved in disability rights over many years.  Concerns have been put to me directly by many people and I am echoing them here this evening.  The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission has also voiced concerns about that omission from the Bill.  People with disabilities have not waited ten years to face a Bill which does not have \"equality\" at its core.  I ask that the reference to \"equality\" be reinstated in the Title of the Bill to take into account the wider reforms proposed in it because equality must be the cornerstone of the legislation.  People have been out there fighting long and hard for equality for those with disabilities and they must get equality in the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  The term \"disproportionate burden\" must be removed.  It reflects the Disability Act 2005 and puts the economy above and before the rights of persons with disabilities.  If we are to ratify the convention, we cannot have conditions alongside these rights.  It will mean that rights are dependent on available resources and that there is, in fact, no absolute right.<\/p>  <p>  I ask the Minister of State to clarify who will be in charge of the implementation of the ratification of the convention.  Many have called for this role to be independent of the State and it is important that the Minister of State outlines his plans in this regard.  It is also essential that people with disabilities are included on any advisory committee set up to oversee the ratification of the convention.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this era of so-called \"new politics\", we see that many of the most significant provisions of the Bill have yet to be published.  Some of my colleagues have outlined that point.  The provisions will not be set out until Committee Stage when they will be published as amendments, which is crazy.  It is absolute madness.  It impedes any proper discussion of the Bill and provides little opportunity for public debate and even less opportunity for provisions once introduced on Committee Stage.<\/p>  <p>  Ratification without real change in our laws and policy of the kind demanded by people with disabilities is meaningless and undermines the hard work of many campaigners and organisations.  We cannot rush this legislation through just for the sake of it.  We owe it to those with disabilities who have been sidelined by successive Governments to ensure that the ratification of the convention means that those with disabilities are no longer and will never again be sidelined.  We support the passage of the Bill on Second Stage but there are key areas which need to be addressed.  Deputy Jonathan O'Brien has outlined a number of them and we will be putting forward a number of amendments on Committee Stage.  It is clear that the Minister of State needs to address all of those issues which have been touched on here this evening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100042#PP00400","speaker":"1252"},{"type":"speech","time":1485892800,"counter":622,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an mBille seo agus t&aacute;im sasta deis a bheith agam labhairt ar.  Although it is not before time to have the Bill, it goes a considerable way towards addressing many issues and opens the door to the ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, considers a priority.  However, there are very considerable gaps in the legislation.  I will not dwell on that any further except to underline the point, which has been well made at this stage, that these gaps are a considerable concern for my party.  A great many significant legislative sections remain to be added at a later date and it is questionable whether that is the best way to legislate.  I underline also the point made by Deputy Brady.<\/p><p>When the Bill was first published, or at least the heads, the word \"equality\" was contained in the Title and it has since been removed.  I wish to know the explanation or rationale for that change.<\/p> <p> As it happens, on 14 December last, I raised the issue of ratification directly with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Katherine Zappone.  I once again asked that she call on her Cabinet colleagues to ratify the UN convention as a matter of urgency.  This was in the context of children facing discrimination due to disability, to a large extent, and, in particular, reports that children in the care of the State were being let down or put at risk in terms of child protection.  On that occasion, it had been almost ten years since the publication of the convention.  During that period, countries with fewer resources than Ireland, such as Togo, Uganda and Vietnam, along with 153 other countries, ratified the convention.  The point has been made about how isolated and unique Ireland is in a European context for its failure to ratify the convention.<\/p> <p> Gaps in how statutory authorities deal with children with disabilities were raised in the public domain before Christmas.  It was stated that the HSE believed that Tusla was failing on child protection measures for children with disabilities.  This applied in particular to children in the care of the State.  Serious concerns were raised.  I hope that these failings have been rectified and that child protection is now robust, and safeguards now exist and will continue to exist in the future.<\/p> <p> My party has campaigned on the ratification of the convention for a considerable number of years, and it is something that we consider a necessity.  This is a small victory for all those who have campaigned on the issue, even if its ratification will be so belated.  Perhaps final judgment will wait until the later Stages of the Bill.  However, there is much to be done.  My colleagues have already articulated that much greater steps can be taken.  My colleague, Deputy O'Brien, will table a number of amendments to strengthen the Bill in a number of areas, in particular the deprivation of liberty or, to put it simply, independence for people who happen to reside in residential care centres, something which may require further legislative clarity.<\/p> <p> Reference was made to the changes that will be made to the Electoral Act 1992.  I want to draw attention to the Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2016, which was published by Deputy Gerry Adams.  It so happens that it was the first Bill I co-signed on entering the House.  It provides that any location designated a polling station must be wheelchair accessible, something which is not currently legislatively required.  While the number of such locations that are not wheelchair accessible is limited, absolutely none should be.<\/p> <p> Likewise, I believe action should be taken to ensure independent voting by persons with impaired vision.  Much of the convention and the Bill is about ensuring that people have equal rights in terms of employment, education and a wide variety of areas.  That must be absolutely safeguarded in terms of the fundamental right to participate in the democratic process.<\/p> <p> T&aacute; daoine faoi mh&iacute;chumas tar &eacute;is a bheith faoi mh&iacute;bhunt&aacute;iste sa t&iacute;r seo ar feadh i bhfad agus leatrom d&eacute;anta orthu i go leor slite.

It is now almost ten years since it was signed but, as of yet, Ireland has failed to ratify the convention.<\/p>  <p>  Over 150 countries around the world have ratified the convention since its conception.  Many people find the length of time it has taken to comply and ratify a convention that stops discrimination on the basis of ability quite extraordinary.  Other countries have ratified the convention without adhering to every single piece of legislation.  The very principles of ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities will be a major step forward for the 600,000 people with disabilities in Ireland, who comprise 13% of the population.  It will also send a very clear signal that their rights are respected and vindicated.<\/p>  <p>  There has been a decade of delay or, more aptly, a lost decade during which persons with disabilities were discriminated against disproportionately in terms of health, poverty, education and employment.  Part of the Bill is to be welcomed as it will amend outdated legislation and include people with disabilities who were excluded.  The hard of hearing have been excluded from jury duty.  We need to introduce a standard in regard to reasonable accommodation.  The quota for the employment in the public sector of people with disabilities needs to be extended to Garda civilian staff.

We welcome the Bill as a step forward in the ratification of the convention.  Disability campaigners have been seeking ratification for almost ten years.  The only reason we are here now is because of their work which involved dragging successive reluctant Governments along the road.<\/p>  <p>  While the Bill is to be welcomed, we do not feel it goes far enough.  There is need to go further and reverse all austerity measures that have impacted on those with disabilities.  To its shame, Ireland is the last of the 28 EU states to ratify the convention.  This has been a disgrace and illustrates where disability lies in terms of Government priorities.  It is not just the current Government that has delayed the process for ten years.  The convention was signed in March 2007, when a Fianna F&aacute;il and Progressive Democratic Government was in power, followed by almost four years of a Fianna F&aacute;il and Green Party Government and over five years of a Labour Party and Fine Gael Party Government.  All of the establishment parties have been hesitant about the rights of people with disabilities.<\/p>  <p>  There have been savage cutbacks to services for people with disabilities.  The Disability Federation of Ireland has illustrated that those with a disability are at a high risk of poverty.  The at risk of poverty rate is 22.8% for disabled people.  There is a 51.8% deprivation rate and the rate of involvement in the workforce is just 30%.<\/p><p>This is not just because of an absence of rights, but is the result of decisions by Governments to make targeted cuts that affect those with disabilities.  There have been targeted attacks on people with disabilities by the Fianna F&aacute;il, Green, Labour and Fine Gael parties which I will outline, but, before I do so, I point out that the general austerity measures have impacted disproportionately on those with disabilities.  When the Government cuts transport services, people with disabilities are more affected than many other groups.  When there are general cuts to education, health and housing, it is those with disabilities who often feel the pinch the most.  The targeted cuts that were aimed at those with disabilities were extensive and, despite the so-called recovery, are far from restored.<br\/><br\/>Between 2008 and 2015, there was a &euro;159.4 million cut to disability health services.  The disability allowance, blind pension, invalidity pension and carer's allowance were cut by an average of 8% from 2009.  The budget for 2017 provided for a delayed &euro;5-a-week increase.  In responding to the budget in October, the Anti-Austerity Alliance outlined that this was inadequate after years of cuts and poverty.  The &euro;5 increase does not go nearly far enough in terms of keeping in touch with the rise in the cost of living.  It is calculated that the extra cost of living per week for a person with a disability is somewhere between &euro;207 and &euro;276.<br\/><br\/>Those with a disability have a right to access education but the funding to make it a reality is not in place.  The number of special needs assistants was capped in 2011 and, although altered, is still in place.  This shows that the Government is unwilling to take a rights-based approach.  Instead of looking at each child's educational needs and providing for them, it prefers to give a minimal service and pass it off as meeting the right to education.  A real right to education, like all rights, needs to be underwritten with finance.<br\/><br\/>The cuts made are too numerous to list in the limited time available but those with disabilities paying attention to the debate will be acutely aware of the 10% cut in the blind tax credit, the incapacitated child tax credit and the home carer tax credit; the change in the threshold for medical cards and the reduction in the number of discretionary cards granted; the 19% cut in the respite care grant in 2013 under the Labour Party; the cut to the household benefits package that massively hit the disabled; the 21% cut in the budget for the National Council for Special Education in 2011; and the 56% cut in housing adaptation grants in 2010, the restrictions on eligibility in 2014 and the very long assessment waiting times that many applicants for the grant experience.  Since 2007, there has been a reduction of 2.5 million in home help hours.  Thousands are waiting for occupational therapy and speech and language therapy and we have had the increase in the threshold for the drugs payment scheme while prescription charges for medical card holders have also risen significantly.<br\/><br\/>The UN convention is concerned with establishing a rights-based model as opposed to a medical model.  The idea behind it is to recognise the rights of people and then to provide the resources to deliver on those rights.  This should be welcomed and implemented fully.  There are two reforms in the Bill that implement change, but they do not go far enough.  This illustrates the general approach of the Government which is to go so far but then to stop short.<br\/><br\/>The Bill will change the Juries Act and change the blatant discrimination of disallowing all deaf people from serving on a jury.  It will also end the current practice of disqualifying those with a mental illness.  However, there should be careful attention to the wording as there should be a presumptive capacity to serve on a jury, as called for by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.  The other reform I welcome is the removal of the &quot;unsound mind&quot; disqualification from being a public representative under the Electoral Act.  However, the Act is not changed in a way that it introduces a rights-based approach to voters who are disabled.  There should be an explicit right to secrecy of the ballot for blind people with, for example, returning officers being obliged to provide for stencils in polling stations.  This would be a minor change, but it is not provided for in the Bill.<br\/><br\/>The major omission from the Bill relates to the deprivation of liberty.  I refer to both actual deprivation and de facto deprivation of liberty which can take place in the State.  The convention prohibits detention on the grounds of disability and requires a process outlined in law and a right of review and appeal.  I understand that the Minister may bring forward amendments on Committee Stage to deal with this, but that is not acceptable.  The purpose of the debate on Second Stage is to discuss the principles and identify problems with the approach of the Bill.  Deprivation of liberty is a major issue that should be debated fully in this House and the discussion should not be curtailed by having it in a committee.  It also means that Deputies have less time to advance amendments to what is being proposed.<br\/><br\/>Many people who have a mental illness feel coerced by the system that is now in place.  There is a power imbalance for many patients, even voluntary patients, and others in residential care.  The Bill should have explicit rights in place for people with disabilities and those with diminished capacity, such as the right to ongoing review of their situations, independent oversight of deprivation of liberty and access to redress.<br\/><br\/>The Bill does not go far enough in terms of the provisions on reasonable accommodation, which has disappointed many of those with a disability.  At present, there is a get-out clause for service providers.  If they can show that there is a cost other than a nominal one with it, they can get away with not providing access to those with a disability.  The Bill strengthens the position <i>vis-&agrave;-vis <\/i>the public sector and in important areas such as the position of financial institutions, but it remains weak <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>the private sector.  There should be a far stronger wording that gives rights to those with disabilities to access services.  Large private operators should be obliged by law to provide access to their services.  There should, of course, be some consideration for the size of the provider, as there is a difference between a small family-owned corner shop and a large retail outlet or supermarket.  However, if the Government contends there are constitutional issues with such provisions, we should have a referendum to secure these rights to reasonable accommodation for those with disabilities.<br\/><br\/>The Anti-Austerity Alliance welcomes the Bill but we would like to see its provisions strengthened.  Those campaigning for rights for people with disabilities should increase their campaign work in the crucial weeks ahead, while the Bill is going through the various Stages, in order to secure the strongest possible Bill from what is a hesitant Government that is accustomed to delay on the issue of rights for people with disabilities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100043#QQ00300","speaker":"1281","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1485894000,"counter":627,"content":"<p>The Independents 4 Change have 20 minutes.

The Bill has been widely accepted.  It is quite a straightforward Bill that deals with the issue of capacity to serve as a juror, removes references to \"unsound mind\" for persons standing for election, provides for the Department of Justice and Equality to be a focal point for implementation of the convention and deals with, among others, the issues of reasonable accommodation costs and the deprivation of liberty.  These relatively achievable goals are not without problems, however.  I will deal with them in more detail, but I first wish to make the point that the Government has had ten years to get the drafting and consultative process right for the Bill.  This is why I find it difficult to understand how it is that the Bill is still incomplete, with the Government proposing to introduce a swathe of amendments on Committee Stage.<\/p><p>Did we not see this previously when Report Stage amendments to the rent legislation introduced by the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Simon Coveney, rendered the Bill unrecognisable?  Most worryingly, however, was that this left a democratic deficit in the D&aacute;il because many Members could not analyse or decipher the Bill before it was pushed through the House and into law.<\/p> <p> Why has it taken ten years to introduce such a mediocre Bill?  Last month, during Leaders' Questions, I raised the personal hardship caused by the failure to ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities for people such as Frank Larkin, a disability activist in County Donegal.  I read out Mr. Larkin's letter which highlighted the frustration he has experienced during this long wait.  People such as Frank Larkin deserve nothing less than completed, tightly written legislation which ties together all the loose ends blocking the process of ratification. <\/p> <p> I will repeat some of the concerns about the Bill expressed by many disability advocacy groups.  One curious change was the removal of the word \"equality\" from the original general scheme.  The word should be reinstated, as advised by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, to recognise the wide-ranging aspects of the UN convention, including the protection of transgender individuals from discrimination.<\/p> <p> While the Bill aims to fix most of the outstanding obstacles to the ratification of the convention, many issues are not addressed and the Bill is, as I stated, incomplete.  Amendments dealing with Article 14 of the convention, which upholds a person's right not to be deprived of his or her liberty unlawfully or arbitrarily, will not be introduced until Committee Stage.  How will those living with disabilities be able to give their perspective on the legislation if it remains so incomplete?  What are the reasons for the delay in publishing these amendments?  Is it to allow the Minister of State to argue that he is doing something, however half-hearted?  The Government needs to come clean on any reservations it may have on disability legislation in general. <\/p> <p> Some discriminatory language persists in legislation and this Bill presented the Government with an opportunity to repeal or replace outdated and offensive terminology.  The term \"of unsound mind\" was used as recently as 2014 in the Companies Act.  The Bill was supposed to amend such terms across all legislation but this has not been done.  Will the Minister of State make a commitment to remove discriminatory language from our legislation in the near future to coincide with the ratification and implementation of the UN convention?  I ask him to respond before we conclude the Second Stage debate.<\/p> <p> The Bill does not address the outstanding issue of a person being found in a District Court to be unfit to plead guilty because he or she lacks decision-making capacity and the case is referred to a higher court with a harsher sentencing regime.  In 2010, the High Court found that this caused a constitutional issue for people with disabilities who become subject to a harsher sentencing regime purely because they have a disability.  This matter has not been resolved in the Bill.  Why has it not been addressed?<\/p> <p> The Bill recognises that people who are deaf should not be excluded from participation in a jury simply because they need the support of an Irish Sign Language interpreter.  Reasonable accommodation should also be extended to people with other disabilities. Section 2(b) amends a provision in the Juries Act 1976 on ineligible persons by relating ineligibility to capacity rather than disability.  This does not go far enough.  It would be more appropriate to create a system in which a person would be ineligible for jury duty if he or she did not, in the opinion of the court, have the ability to perform the functions required of a jury following the provision of reasonable accommodation.<\/p> <p> It will be some time before Ireland ratifies the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  For example, the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 has not yet been commenced.  On 26 January, the Minister of State suggested in the Chamber that the Act would need to be commenced before ratification of the UN convention could proceed.  This is a cause of concern because a great deal of work must be done to prepare for this new, wide-ranging legislation which fundamentally reforms how people are supported to make decisions.<\/p> <p> While oversight of the implementation of the UN convention is given to the Department of Justice and Equality, this has not been placed on a statutory footing.  Furthermore, the convention recommends that the focal point be placed at the heart of government such as in the prime minister's office or with the cabinet - in Ireland's case, the Department of the Taoiseach - to ensure cross-departmental collaboration and leadership in meeting the task.  It is imperative that the remit of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission is expanded to include a truly independent capacity with a clear link to the designation of the commission as the independent mechanism under Article 33 of the convention.  The Bill does not explicitly define the remit of the Department of Justice and Equality and Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission beyond their administrative duties.  Given that this issue could be easily addressed, I wonder why the Bill does not provide for this change and other small but important changes to legislation. <\/p> <p> The significant role of people with disabilities in the monitoring and evaluation process of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities cannot be understated.  Not only is this role of vital importance, but it is a requirement in the convention.  Article 33.3, which sets out the requirement to involve people with a disability in the monitoring process, states: \"Civil society, in particular persons with disabilities and their representative organizations, shall be involved and participate fully in the monitoring process.\"  The Minister of State must outline how those with lived experience will be resourced and facilitated to play a crucial role in monitoring the implementation of the UN convention and will continue to be key constituents in the monitoring of the convention in future.  This is of vital importance. <\/p> <p> Overall, I am concerned that the Bill is incomplete and may have been published prematurely to make it appear the Government has been doing something on the ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  I am also concerned that, with amendments to be made on Committee State, we may wait for a long time for the Bill to progress and lose at least another year before ratification can begin.  After ten years of waiting, how does the Minister of State justify allowing more time to elapse before the proper ratification and implementation of the UN convention takes place?<\/p> <p> This debate presents the Minister of State with an opportunity to speak out on the real reasons ratification has been slow.  Cost has always been the key issue for the Fine Gael Party.  Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il have never factored in the physical, financial and emotional costs placed on people with disabilities by the burden imposed on them by the failure to ratify the UN convention.  It is time the Government factored in these types of costs and recognised that ratification of this vitally important convention will benefit all citizens as it would further emphasise the principle of equality. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100044#RR00500","speaker":"1366","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1485894600,"counter":632,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important Bill.  Mr. Paddy Connolly, the chief executive of Inclusion Ireland, wrote a moving and impassioned piece in the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>today under the heading &quot;People with disabilities are not a diagnosis, they are human&quot;.  I presume the Minister of State read the article but if not, I urge him to do so.  Some of the words in it struck a chord with me, including, for example, the statement that the &quot;greatest threat to the wellbeing of people who have disabilities is their invisibility&quot; which &quot;renders them non-agents of their own fate, passive recipients of care rather than rights-holders&quot;.<\/p><p>Mr. Connolly also called out the statement by the Minister of State that Ireland is &quot;in advance of other EU states&quot; when it comes to persons with disability.  A study by the European Institute for Gender Equality showed clearly that this statement is simply not true.  Furthermore, Ireland is the only EU state that has not implemented the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. <\/p><p>Mr. Connolly also stated that he recently resigned from the national disability strategy implementation group, which he described as a &quot;bureaucratic echo chamber&quot;.  As legislators, we must ensure that people with disabilities do not feel invisible and we must enhance and protect their right to live full and equal lives.  While I will support the Bill and welcome that it has finally come before the House, it is time the Government stepped out of the echo chamber and put words and promises into action.<\/p><p>I recently questioned the Minister of State on the amount of funding he had secured for disability in budget 2017.  As Deputy Pringle stated, the implementation of the UN convention revolves around cost and the unwillingness of the Fine Gael Party, with which the Minister of State is now allied, and the Fianna F&aacute;il Party in the past to spend the funding required to fulfil assessments for citizens with disability. <\/p><p>I have some questions for the Minister of State on the legislation, as it stands.  Will he outline what legislative provisions will be made to ensure that people with disabilities have equal and effective legal protection against discrimination on all grounds, as provide for in Article 5 of the UN convention?  The civil legal aid scheme does not extend to people with disabilities wishing to make complaints to the Workplace Relations Commission and thereby enforce their protection against discrimination.  The lack of legal aid renders the protection ineffective for many.  Given the limitations of the legal aid scheme, people with disabilities do not have access to legal advice and representation before other tribunals such as the social welfare appeals office.  How will the Minister of State address this issue?<\/p><p>This is most extraordinary legislation.  I cannot remember a Minister describing the introduction of a Bill in the House as an historic day before stating that it is proposed to introduce a raft of amendments at a later stage.  As Deputy Mick Barry stated, we will not have an opportunity to invigilate these amendments.  From that point of view, I hope the Minister of State is serious about this legislation and that it will mark a watershed of huge improvements for our 600,000 citizens with disabilities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100045#SS00200","speaker":"1361"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1485894600,"counter":633,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"}]
