The resulting report was published in July 2017 and further explored the issues raised in the original survey. The comments quoted therein cover a wide range of issues relating to human resources management. These include pay and conditions, vacancies, recruitment and retention, promotion systems, performance management, leadership, culture, morale, stress and work-life balance.<\/p>  <p>  The report pre-dated the significant improvements in pay that have taken place in the intervening period. Successful negotiations with the Permanent Defence Force Representative Associations have provided for pay increases to Permanent Defence Force personnel under the Lansdowne Road Agreement. <\/p>  <p>  The finalisation of negotiations under the agreement allowed for the commencement of the process for the implementation of pay increases and arrears, which have now been applied to the Permanent Defence Force.\u00a0 An increase of 2.5% from 1 January 2016, for annualised salaries up to &euro;24,000 and 1% for annualised salaries between &euro;24,001 and &euro;31,000 was paid in July 2017. An increase of &euro;1,000 from 1 April 2017, on annualised salaries up to &euro;65,000 per annum was also paid in July 2017. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, improved payscales for general service recruits and privates who joined the Permanent Defence Force post 1 January 2013, were backdated to 1 July 2016 and paid in August 2017. <\/p>  <p>  The Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020, contains proposals for further pay increases over the period of the agreement ranging from 6.2% to 7.4% with the benefits to weighted towards those on lower pay. The agreement also provides for the restoration of the 5% reduction in allowances under FEMPI by the end of the Agreement. By the end of the agreement, the payscales for all public servants earning up to &euro;70,000 will be restored to the levels that existed prior to the FEMPI legislation. The first increment under this agreement of 1% in annualised salaries due from 1 January 2018 has been paid to members of the PDF. <\/p>  <p>  There is ongoing recruitment to the Defence Forces and a range of initiatives are being developed including commissioning from the ranks, criteria for the re-entry of former Permanent Defence Force personnel with specific skills and consideration of increased use of direct entry for specialist posts. The Public Service Pay Commission will also be examining recruitment and retention issues in its next tranche of work.<\/p>  <p>  There is an ongoing programme of HR development within the Defence Organisation. As well as pay and recruitment, other issues highlighted in the Survey are being addressed. A number of initiatives including a review of the criteria governing contracts of enlisted personnel and a comprehensive skills gap analysis across the Defence Forces have been announced. I also initiated a review of the C&amp;A scheme which is underway. These directly address issues raised in the Survey.<\/p>  <p>  In tandem with these actions the Department is also engaged in planning on a longer term basis. Many of the recommendations arising from the Climate Survey have been captured in and will be progressed by White Paper projects.\u00a0 Projects arising from the White Paper on Defence around topics such as medium term manpower planning and encouraging as wide a pool as possible for recruitment are already underway. <\/p>  <p>  With regard to other issues relating to human resource management highlighted in the Climate Survey, there are extensive support systems currently in place for members of the Defence Forces. The Personnel Support Service is available to provide information, assistance and counselling on a range of matters including interpersonal problems and stress.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032100062#WRA01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":17,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 39 to 41, inclusive, answered orally.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":18,"content":"<p>Question No. 42 answered with Question No. 39.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Data","counter":19,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032100062#WRA01700"},{"type":"question","counter":20,"qnumday":43,"qnumall":"[10381\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032100062#WRA01800","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the number of Permanent Defence Forces personnel expected to serve on UN-led missions in 2018;

Over 350 Civil Defence volunteers, using the range of assets available, provided support to the Principal Response Agencies during the course of the Storm and its aftermath.\u00a0 Actions undertaken by\u00a0Civil Defence included bringing patients and staff to and from hospitals; bringing\u00a0nurses and home helps out to visit vulnerable people; delivering food, fuel and medicines to elderly people in their homes; transporting urgent medical supplies; assisting\u00a0An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and assisting the transport services. <\/p>  <p>  Under the Framework for Major Emergency Management, the local authorities have primary responsibility for dealing with severe weather and flooding. Civil Defence have provided great support to the local authorities in dealing with these type of emergencies not just during Storm Emma but also, for example, during last year&rsquo;s flooding both in Mountmellick, Co Laois and in Inishowen, Co Donegal.<\/p>  <p>  The 2015 White Paper on Defence sets out government policy in relation to Civil Defence.  It states that the future of Civil Defence will continue to be developed around its central strategic objective of supporting the Principal Response Agencies in a\u00a0number of emergency and non-emergency situations.  This includes a wide range of emergencies at national and local level including severe weather, flooding and searches for missing persons.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Defence is charged with the management and development of Civil Defence at national level.  The Department provides policy direction, centralised training through the Civil Defence College, administrative support and guidance and centralised procurement of major items of uniform and equipment in support of local authority Civil Defence efforts.<\/p>  <p>  Civil Defence is funded by way of a grant from the Defence Vote. Funding for Civil Defence operations at local level is shared on a 70\/30 basis between the Department of Defence and local authorities by way of an annual grant to each authority.<\/p>  <p>  Civil Defence services are delivered through the Civil Defence Officer (CDO) of the relevant Local Authority for that area.  The CDO is a full time employee of the local authority and is responsible for the day-to-day management of Civil Defence matters under the overall direction of the relevant Chief Executive.  Volunteers join Civil Defence through the local authority for their area and undergo relevant training\u00a0to deliver activities required by the local authority and the other principal response agencies.\u00a0 A number of volunteers\u00a0may progress and qualify as Civil Defence Instructors.<\/p>  <p>  The Civil Defence College, which is part of\u00a0my Department, is recognised as a training institution by regulatory bodies such as the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council (PHECC) and by Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI).\u00a0 Training in a wide variety of programmes is provided by the College to the Civil Defence Volunteer Instructors. \u00a0When trained, Instructors return to their respective local authority areas and\u00a0provide training to\u00a0the Volunteers based there.<\/p>  <p>  The wide range of roles undertaken is what makes Civil Defence unique among volunteer based emergency response organisations.  For this reason, a very wide range of training is provided within Civil Defence.  This includes training in first aid up to Emergency Medical Technician level, training in manual handling and people handling, search management training, swiftwater training, map reading, child protection, food preparation, radiation monitoring, pump operation, sandbagging, powerboat operation, use of drones, Critical Incident Stress Management, radio communications, setting up rest centres etc.<\/p>  <p>  The training needs for Civil Defence are kept under review to ensure that the organisation can continue to provide effective support to the Principal Response Agencies in dealing with a variety of emergency and non-emergency situations.  This includes assisting the local authorities in dealing with severe weather.  My Department will be undertaking a review of Civil Defences response to the recent severe weather in conjunction with Civil Defence Officers from around the country.  This review will help identify any needs for additional training or equipment arising from Storm Emma.<\/p>  <p>  The government is committed to\u00a0continuing to support Civil Defence\u00a0both in the areas of training and equipment to ensure that Civil Defence\u00a0can fulfil its important role.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032100063#WRB02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Permanent Structured Co-operation","counter":76,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032100063#WRB02800"},{"type":"question","counter":77,"qnumday":63,"qnumall":"[12883\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032100063#WRB02900","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the scale of Ireland's involvement in the European Union Training Mission Competence Centre and Upgrade of Maritime Surveillance to be developed under PESCO and which were formally adopted by the EU Council on 1 March 2018; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1366","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":78,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware PESCO is a mechanism provided for in the Treaty of the European Union to enable participating member States to come together and, on a project by project basis, jointly develop military crisis management capabilities for use in support of the EU's Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) operations and missions in support of international peace and security. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland is a strong proponent of the important role the EU can play in support of international peace and security and the UN.

The SCU had no input in selecting or contracting any external or third party interviewees.  No political spokespeople or Government backbenchers were recommended for interview or for pictures to be included by the SCU in any of the partnerships with regional media organisations. Decisions about what organisations and individuals would be asked for comment or pictured were entirely a matter for each media organisation.<\/p><p>The SCU did not have sign off of the copy produced for the media. <\/p><p><b>Cinema and Radio Advertising<\/b><\/p><p>Cinema advertising relating to Project Ireland 2040 appeared in all screens across the country over a 4 week period, at a total cost of &euro;80,113 ex Vat. <\/p><p>The 60 second video was produced by a creative agency in conjunction with the SCU.<\/p><p>The SCU managed two national radio campaigns since January 2018 - Healthy Ireland 2018 campaign, and the Self Employed Benefits radio campaign.

The Committee meetings are regularly briefed on developments in the EU in relation to Horizon 2020, European Defence Agency, EDIDP, European Defence Fund and PESCO.  <\/p>  <p>  PESCO also features as a topic at meetings of the Interdepartmental Group on the European Union and Brexit which is attended by senior officials across Government Departments.<\/p>  <p>  I have now confirmed Ireland's participation in two PESCO projects (1) EU Training Mission Competence Centre and (2) Upgrade of Maritime Surveillance.  As these projects are still at an early stage it is unclear what opportunities may be available within these projects for Irish industry\/SMEs and whether they will be eligible for EDIDP funding. However my staff will ensure that the existing relationship with Enterprise Ireland is utilised to facilitate the onward communication of any opportunities that may arise.  <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore a joint Military and Civil project team has been created within the Defence Organisation to establish a Security and Defence Enterprise Group.  This Group would support Irish-based enterprise in their engagement with EU institutes and funding programmes, to the benefit of Irish Enterprise and Defence Forces capability.  Once established this Group will provide the Defence Organisation with a further means for communicating opportunities (including information related to accessing EU funding) to interested parties.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032100071#WRK02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Humanitarian Assistance Scheme","counter":281,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032100072#WRL00200"},{"type":"question","counter":282,"qnumday":157,"qnumall":"[13075\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032100072#WRL00300","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the case of a person (details supplied); and his plans to review the limits for the Donegal humanitarian scheme in this case.","asker":"1288","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":283,"content":"<p>In early September, 2017 the Government established an emergency humanitarian support scheme to\u00a0assist small businesses and community, sporting and voluntary bodies in County Donegal which through no fault of their own were unable to secure flood insurance and were flooded following the exceptionally heavy rainfall of August 22 and 23.\u00a0 A similar scheme was successfully operated countrywide in 2015\/16 following Storm Desmond and another one is currently ongoing following Storm Eleanor at the start of this year.<\/p>  <p>  The purpose of the emergency scheme, which was administered by the Irish Red Cross, was to provide a mechanism whereby those small businesses and organisations could apply to receive a once-off ex-gratia contribution towards the costs of returning their premises to their pre-flood condition.

This was a very worthwhile exchange with members of the Joint Committee setting out a number of issues and concerns which are raised by the UK exit. I was pleased to discuss with the Joint Committee the Government&rsquo;s views and responsibilities as a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, and our ongoing engagement through the Article 50 negotiations, to ensure the protection of the Agreement in all its parts.<\/p>  <p>  The Joint Committee published its policy statement on the UK withdrawal from the European Union on 13 March, making a number of recommendations to ensure the ongoing protection of rights on the island of Ireland.  The Joint Committee is uniquely placed as an institution of the Good Friday Agreement to address the issues that Brexit raises for human rights on this island.  The Joint Committee&rsquo;s policy statement and continuing engagement on these important issues is therefore very welcome, and indeed essential, as all those with responsibilities seek workable and agreed solutions through the Article 50 negotiations to ensure the protection of the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts.<\/p>  <p>  The Joint Committee has provided its policy statement to the Government and careful consideration is being given to the recommendations, taking account of the Joint Committee&rsquo;s mandate and expertise, and the Government&rsquo;s role and responsibilities as a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, as well as the provisions of that Agreement.<\/p>  <p>  The Joint Committee&rsquo;s recommendations refer to issues which also directly relate to responsibilities of the UK Government and to the role of the European Union.  I understand that the Joint Committee has therefore also provided its policy statement to the UK Government, to the European Commission Article 50 Task force and to the European Parliament for consideration as appropriate.<\/p>  <p>  In the context of the UK withdrawal from the EU, the Government is determined to ensure that the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts is fully protected, including the provisions relating to rights.  The human rights and equality provisions of the Good Friday Agreement are central to the Peace Process, supporting the confidence and willingness of all communities to participate in and operate the agreed political institutions and protect everyone equally.<\/p>  <p>  The Government appreciates the solidarity and support which has been shown by all of our EU partners in respect of Ireland&rsquo;s unique issues and concerns, including the protection of the Good Friday Agreement.  These concerns are being progressed by the Union through the Article 50 negotiations with the UK. <\/p>  <p>  On 8 December last, a Joint Report between the EU and UK negotiators was agreed, and this included important commitments in respect of protecting the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts.  On 18 February, the European Commission published a draft Withdrawal Agreement including a Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  The Protocol translates into legally-binding terms the firm commitments made in December. Accordingly, the Protocol proposes that the UK ensures no diminution of rights, as provided for in the Good Friday Agreement, including by respecting EU non-discrimination laws, and that these commitments are implemented through a dedicated mechanism.  The Protocol also proposes that the UK facilitate the related work of the institutions and bodies of the Agreement, including the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland and the Joint Committee of representatives of the Human Rights Commissions of Northern Ireland and Ireland.

In dealing with parents of children with special educational needs, SENOs will keep parents informed of what resourcing decisions are being made on their child&rsquo;s behalf.

Contact details for all SENOs is available at <i><\/i>.<\/p><p>All students with learning difficulties have access to additional teaching support in school.  It is a matter for schools to monitor and utilise their allocation of additional teaching support to best support the needs of identified pupils, in accordance with the Department's guidance.  The teaching time afforded to each individual pupil is decided and managed by schools, taking into account each child's individual learning needs.<\/p><p>On 1 September 2017, the new Special Education Teaching allocation model was introduced, which provides a single unified allocation for special educational support teaching needs to each school, based on a school&rsquo;s educational profile.  This allocation allows schools to provide additional teaching support for all pupils who require such support in their schools and for schools to deploy resources based on each pupil&rsquo;s individual learning needs.<\/p><p>The new allocation model gives greater flexibility to schools in relation to the manner in which they use their resources.  Schools may deploy special education teachers in a variety of ways in order to effectively meet pupils&rsquo; needs, for example, in-class support, small groups, team teaching or withdrawal.<\/p><p>The SNA scheme is designed to provide recognised schools with additional adult support staff to cater for the care needs of pupils with disabilities in an educational context, where the nature of these care needs have been outlined in professional reports as being so significant that a pupil will require adult assistance in order to be able to attend school and to participate in education and also to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned, or for their peers, and with a view to developing their independent living skills.<\/p><p>The criteria by which SNA support is allocated to pupils is set out in my Department's Circular 0030\/2014. In considering applications for SNA supports for individual pupils, the SENOs take account of the pupils' needs and consider the resources available to the school to identify whether additionality is needed or whether the school might reasonably be expected to meet the needs of the pupils from its current level of resources.  SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource.<\/p><p>My Department provides funding to schools towards the cost of assistive technology for pupils with special educational needs\u00a0in Primary, Post Primary and Special schools for personal computers and specialist software for educational purposes under the Assistive Technology scheme, as set out in my Department's Circular 0010\/2013.  This Circular states that equipment is provided under the scheme for children with more complex disabilities who require essential specialist equipment to access the school curriculum, which they do not already have, or which cannot be provided for them through the school's existing provisions.<\/p><p>Other supports available to schools include:<\/p><p>- the National Educational Psychological\u00a0Service (NEPS) delivers a consultative, tiered service delivery model to\u00a0schools, in line with international best practice for the effective and efficient delivery of educational psychological services that best meet\u00a0the needs of all pupils\/students in schools.  This service delivery\u00a0model allows NEPS psychologists to support schools to provide an effective\u00a0continuum of support to meet the needs of pupils\/students.<\/p><p>- NCSE's Support Service has brought under\u00a0its control the Special Education Support Service (SESS), the National\u00a0Behaviour Support Service (NBSS) and the Visiting Teacher Service for\u00a0children who are deaf\/hard of hearing and for children who are\u00a0blind\/visually impaired (VTSVHI).  The Support Service provides advice and\u00a0support to schools on the education and inclusion of students with special educational needs, providing in-school support for support teachers,\u00a0continuing professional development for teachers, and support to schools\u00a0on the management of challenging behaviour.

On the contrary, the intention is to build on, update and\u00a0improve a very valuable service so that it is available to every child or young person in the country who requires it.  This improvement to the service will\u00a0have benefits for\u00a0significant numbers of young people in the State who cannot currently access GYDP services.  While certain aspects of the new service model have been determined, work is ongoing to complete the full details to be included in the Call for Proposals, which is expected to issue later this year.  I am convinced that community ownership and participation of the projects is an essential dimension that must be preserved and strengthened in the working out of this process.  <\/p>  <p>  To ensure State-wide coverage\u00a0of GYDP services for young people, (which does not exist at present), the intention is that, in general, service provision will be aligned with Garda Divisions or other appropriate local areas with a distinct community identity, as may be agreed during the consultation process.  The\u00a0consideration of such local arrangements\u00a0will apply particularly in relation to areas with a large number of potential participants on GYDPs.  <\/p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that my Department is committed to\u00a0ensuring continuity of service for participants on GYDPs and to maintaining a community driven approach to their operation, as well as minimising any disruption for workers and service providers.  In this regard, I am advised that the Call for Proposals process will facilitate existing service providers forming consortiums which could apply to provide services under the new GYDP model.  <\/p>  <p>  Careful consideration is being given to all issues raised by stakeholders involved in GYDPs as part of a wide-ranging consultation process, which is currently ongoing.  This process includes arrangements for an extensive series of meetings with community based organisations and project workers which will facilitate closer communication and exchange of information in relation to these matters.  The consultation process will help to inform further development of the Call for Proposals in advance of it being issued.  <\/p>  <p>  As indicated above, the Call for Proposals will require applicants to provide for continuity of GYDP services to current participants.  It is of course a matter for organisations which apply to provide future GYDP services under the Call for Proposals to ensure that they comply with relevant legal responsibilities, including in relation to the European Communities (Protection of Employees on Transfer of Undertakings) Regulations 2003 (S.I.

Since the closure of the Mobility Allowance, the Government has directed that the Health Service Executive should continue to pay an equivalent monthly payment of up to &euro;208.50 per month to the 4,133 people in receipt of the Mobility Allowance, on an interim basis, pending the establishment of a new Transport Support Scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The Government decided that the detailed preparatory work required for a new Transport Support Scheme and associated statutory provisions should be progressed by the Minister for Health.\u00a0 The Programme for a Partnership Government acknowledges the ongoing drafting of primary legislation for a new Transport Support Scheme to assist those with a disability to meet their mobility costs.  The Health (Transport Support) Bill is on the list of priority legislation for publication in the Spring\/Summer session 2018. I can confirm that work on the policy proposals for the new Scheme is at an advanced stage.  The proposals seek to ensure that:<\/p>  <p>  - There is a firm statutory basis to the Scheme's operation;<\/p>  <p>  - There is transparency and equity in the eligibility criteria attaching to the Scheme;<\/p>  <p>  - Resources are targeted at those with greatest needs; and<\/p>  <p>  - The Scheme is capable of being costed and is affordable on its introduction and on an ongoing basis.<\/p>  <p>  It is hoped to bring a General Scheme and Heads of Bill to Government shortly, seeking Government approval to the drafting of the Bill for the new Transport Support Payment.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the Motorised Transport Grant, this scheme operated as a means-tested grant to assist persons with severe disabilities with the purchase or adaptation of a car, where that car was essential to retain employment.  The maximum Motorised Transport Grant, which was payable once in any three-year period, was &euro;5,020.\u00a0 Following closure of the scheme in February 2013, no further Motorised Transport Grants have been payable.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers scheme operated by the Revenue Commissioners, remains in place.  This scheme provides VRT and VAT relief, an exemption from road tax and a fuel grant to drivers and passengers with a disability, who qualify under the relevant criteria set out in governing regulations made by the Minister for Finance.\u00a0 Specifically adapted vehicles driven by disabled persons are also exempt from payment of tolls on national toll roads and toll bridges.  Transport Infrastructure Ireland has responsibility for this particular Scheme.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the Deputy's question seeking information on numbers of recipients in County Clare in respect\u00a0of both the Motorised Transport Grant and the Mobility Allowance in 2013, I have referred this out to the Health Service Executive for a direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032100081#WRU02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1359"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Facilities","counter":551,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032100081#WRU02100"},{"type":"question","counter":552,"qnumday":254,"qnumall":"[13087\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032100081#WRU02200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if funding has been allocated for a helipad at Cork University Hospital; and when the project will be completed and operational.","asker":"1287","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":553,"content":"<p>As the HSE is responsible for the delivery of health care infrastructure projects, the Executive has been requested to reply directly to you in relation to this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032100081#WRU02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medicinal Products Reimbursement","counter":554,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032100081#WRU02400"},{"type":"question","counter":555,"qnumday":255,"qnumall":"[13131\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032100081#WRU02500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will reinstate the funding for the Versatis patches in view of cases similar to that of a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":556,"content":"<p>Medicines play a vital role in improving the health of Irish patients.  Securing access to existing and new and innovative medicines is a key objective of the\u00a0health service.  However, the challenge is to do this in a safe and sustainable manner.  Treatment must be appropriate and proportionate and clinical decision-making, such as prescribing, should be based on both patient needs and sound medical evidence.<\/p><p>Lidocaine 5% medicated plasters are licensed for the\u00a0localised relief of post-shingles pain in adults.  This is the only licensed use for the patch in Ireland.  It has been reimbursed in the community drugs schemes since 2010.<\/p><p>When the plasters were first introduced, the budget impact was low, because of the specific indication for which they are licensed.  It was therefore a cause of clinical concern that, from 2012 on, usage increased significantly, to the point where, as a nation, we were using more plasters than the entire UK National Health Service, with ten times our population.<\/p><p>When a treatment is intended for a small group of patients, and evidence suggests that it is being used for many times that number, it is important and appropriate for clinicians to review its use. In 2016, the HSE Medicines Management Programme, MMP, reviewed the use of the plasters.  The review estimated that only 5-10% of prescribing had been for the licensed indication.<\/p><p>Following the clinical review, and in the interest of ensuring appropriate patient care, the HSE introduced a new reimbursement approval system for the patches from 1 September 2017.  This process supports their appropriate use, ensuring that post-shingles patients continue to receive this treatment.<\/p><p>Under the new arrangements, all patients receiving lidocaine plasters for the licensed indication, shingles, were automatically approved on the HSE system.  All of these patients continue to receive the treatment under the community schemes.<\/p><p>Non-shingles patients were given a three-month grace period, in which their GP could move them to other treatments or apply for continued reimbursement.  However, from 1 December 2017, non-shingles patients were no longer automatically reimbursed under the community drugs schemes.<\/p><p>In order for non-shingles patients to receive the patch through the community schemes, their GP must apply online for continued reimbursement approval.\u00a0 If an application is refused, the GP may appeal, making a clinical case for the patient. \u00a0The HSE advises that the turnaround time for applications is three working days and for appeals it is five days.<\/p><p>As of 16 March 2018, there have been 5,504 online applications from GPs requesting the reimbursement of Versatis.  Of these applications, over 19%, or 1,059 patients, have been approved.<\/p><p>In addition, 526 online appeals have been made, and over 69% of these patients have been approved.  The MMP has sought further information on 38 appeals before a recommendation on reimbursement can be made.<\/p><p>Since 1 September 2017, some 1,421 patients have been approved for the reimbursement of lidocaine plasters, based on the clinical case made by the GP.<\/p><p>It is clear that this new process supports appropriate use and prescribing and both post-shingles patients and other appropriate cases can continue to be treated with lidocaine plasters.<\/p><p>The introduction of the new approval system was flagged in August 2017, when details of the proposed changes were circulated by the HSE to prescribers and pharmacies.  This advice has been re-issued in the last week, and information for patients and practitioners is on the HSE Medicines Management Programme website. <i>.<\/i><\/p><p>This decision is a matter for the HSE.

Following a public consultation process, it was further extended in 2012, and now applies in 26 urban areas nationwide.  The ban has proved very effective in reducing particulate matter and sulphur dioxide levels and has had the effect of significantly improving public health.  Research indicates, for example, that the ban has resulted in over 350 fewer annual deaths in Dublin alone.<\/p><p>Scientific understanding has evolved in the intervening years, however, and numerous studies now indicate that air pollution\u00a0has impacts on human health at lower levels than was previously understood.\u00a0 Consequently, it is necessary to continue to strengthen policy to enhance air quality for the protection of people&rsquo;s health and the environment. <\/p><p>Recent\u00a0monitoring has also revealed that the air quality in some of our smaller towns in Winter is worse than that in larger towns where the ban is in place.\u00a0 Given the clear human health benefits, I am committed to extending the ban nationwide.\u00a0 This process necessarily involves discussion and consultation with a wide number of stakeholders, including with the European Commission, relevant Government Departments and Agencies, the residential fuel industry, and the general public.\u00a0 Discussions with many of these stakeholders on issues that may arise in connection with the proposed nationwide ban are underway.\u00a0 My next step will be to introduce the specific legal measures to give effect to the ban over a twelve month period commencing in Autumn 2018.

The most recent data shows that youth unemployment has fallen from a peak of 31% in 2012 to 12.2% in Q4 2017.  Overall youth unemployment has fallen from well above the EU average in 2012 to well below the EU average of 16.4% in Q4 2017.<\/p><p>Within the South-East region, youth unemployment has fallen from a peak of 41% in 2012 to 13.9% in Q.4, 2017.  The number of young people in employment in the South East increased by over 6,000 over the same period &ndash; from 18,600 on average in the year 2012 to  24,700 on average in 2017.<\/p><p>These trends indicate that together with improvements in the labour market and economic recovery, our approach to youth employment, which focuses in the first instance on enhancing processes and policies for assisting young unemployed people to find and secure sustainable jobs, has been relatively successful.<\/p><p>The Government&rsquo;s primary strategy to tackle unemployment since 2012 is twofold:<\/p><p>- Firstly, through policies set out in the Action Plan for Jobs, to create an environment in which business can succeed and create jobs.  This policy now includes a specific regional Action Plan for the South East Region. The Plan has been embraced within the region and the efforts by stakeholders and businesses in the region are paying off: Average employment in the South East was 224,000 in 2017 &ndash; 14,000 more than in  2015 (baseline year), and representing significant progress towards the 25,000 target for 2020 as set out in the Plan.<\/p><p>- Secondly, through Pathways to Work, my Department ensures that as many new jobs and vacancies as possible are filled by people taken from the Live Register.  Under this policy, employment services and activation supports are heavily concentrated on the areas of highest unemployment.<\/p><p>Under the Youth Guarantee process case officers engage with unemployed young people, on a monthly basis, to prepare and implement personal progression plans for employment.  Where young people do not find work quickly, additional supports are offered through places on employment and training schemes, which are closely aligned to the needs of the labour market.<font color=\"#2F2F2F\"> <\/font><\/p><p>For those who do not find employment, through the process just described, additional offers are provided for. Most such offers (over 70%) are in existing further education or training programmes.  Others are in existing community-based employment programmes\/workplace based interventions such as CE, Gateway and T&uacute;s and First Steps; or in subsidies to employers, through JobsPlus Youth.

He instructed the Department to consult with parents and disability advocates on the recommendation particularly given the sensitive nature of the proposal.  Therefore, earlier this month, I, together with the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, launched a national consultation process with people with disabilities, their families and advocates to seek their views on these recommendations.

In line with the Comprehensive Employment Strategy and building on developments in recent years, it is expected that the Department has a greater role in the delivery of employment services and supports to persons with a disability.<\/p>  <p>  In recent years, the social protection system in Ireland has undergone significant reforms, moving away from passive income supports to an &lsquo;active inclusion&rsquo; approach that seeks to maximise the potential of working age adults, with the appropriate supports and services.  The Intreo service, which is the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection&rsquo;s integrated income support, employment and support service, is central to this process.<\/p>  <p>  In line with commitments under the Comprehensive Employment Strategy for people with disabilities and Pathways to Work 2016-2020, the Department has progressively expanded the mainstream Intreo service to cater for people with disabilities.  Across the Intreo service network of 62 offices, people with disabilities may, on a voluntary basis, seek an appointment with an employment supports case officer to discuss their employment ambitions and develop an appropriate personal progression plan.  The Intreo service has also undertaken a programme of upskilling staff to better support persons with disabilities who want to pursue further education, training or work opportunities.  While the Intreo service, as the mainstream employment service, acts as the primary gateway or access point to employment supports, it may also refer those with more complex support needs to other relevant bodies, such as the Employability service for training or employment supports.<\/p>  <p>  It is my intention to continue to build the capacity of the Intreo service so that it has the ability to address the public employment support needs of people with disabilities. <\/p>  <p>  Last year, the Make Work Pay for people with disabilities report made a number of recommendations on how people with disabilities who want to work and can work could fulfil their employment ambitions.  One of the key recommendations relates to the principle of early engagement. Early engagement means that the State will support people with disabilities at the earliest stage possible to help them achieve their employment goals.  To this end, people with disabilities would get advice from the Intreo service when they apply for a disability income support payment. The service would be provided on the following basis:<\/p>  <p>  - Engagement would be voluntary.<\/p>  <p>  - Engagement would encourage new recipients of disability income support payments to use the Intreo Service and supports. <\/p>  <p>  - Engagement would focus on an individual&rsquo;s needs.<\/p>  <p>  - Engagement would be effectively resourced.<\/p>  <p>  - Engagement would be joined up with other service providers to make sure that the process is as seamless as possible. <\/p>  <p>  - Engagement would address barriers to work faced by people with disabilities<\/p>  <p>  No decision has yet been made as to when this approach would start.  Earlier this month, a national consultation process commenced to seek the views of people with disabilities, their families and advocates on the implementation of this recommendation.  The Government wants to get the views of stakeholders before considering whether any changes, if any, might be introduced.  The national consultation process will continue until mid-April and will be followed by further consideration with a number of stakeholder bodies.

Harnessing the off-balance sheet potential of private investment in social housing is an important\u00a0contributor to meeting this objective\u00a0and the social housing targets set out in Rebuilding Ireland over the period to 2021 reflect the ambition in that regard.  Of the 50,000 social housing homes to be delivered under Rebuilding Ireland, 10,000 will be leased by local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies\u00a0(AHBs)\u00a0under leasing arrangements from a range of different sources and funded under the Department&rsquo;s Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme (SHCEP).  High\u00a0quality secure\u00a0properties\u00a0which represent value for money\u00a0and are available on a long-term basis are\u00a0being\u00a0targeted by local authorities around the country to accommodate people on local authority waiting lists. \u00a0<\/p><p>The Government\u00a0has increased significantly the delivery expected from local authorities through their\u00a0social housing\u00a0build programme, but it remains the case that more homes can be provided through leasing than could reasonably be expected to be delivered under construction and acquisition programmes alone.  In addition, the cost of delivering social housing units under the traditional construction and acquisition model is not adequately captured by the up-front capital expenditure as each unit will carry a stream of ongoing costs over the long-term including management, maintenance and remediation.  Furthermore, during the term of the lease, the responsibility for structural matters remains with the property owner and not the local authority.\u00a0 At the end of the lease term, the dwelling can require major renovation or upgrading resulting in a substantial capital cost, which under leasing is borne by the owner rather than the local authority.<\/p><p>On foot of a wide variety of interest from developers, investors, financiers and others in being involved in the provision of social housing, a structured, formal process was put in place to facilitate engagement with such parties.  The Clearing House Group\u00a0(CHG) was established to examine and consider proposals and to meet with the companies, groups and institutions involved.  This was set out in the Clearing House Protocol published in March 2015.The CHG comprised representatives from:<\/p><p>- Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government;<\/p><p>- Department of Finance;<\/p><p>- Department of Public Expenditure and Reform;<\/p><p>- Dublin City Council;<\/p><p>- The Housing Agency;<\/p><p>- The National Economic and Social Council (NESC).<\/p><p>The Chairperson was assigned by the National Asset Management Agency on a temporary basis at the request of my Department.  The CHG was a sub-group of the Finance Work Stream, one of the governance structures of the Social Housing Strategy 2020. <\/p><p>The examination of proposals was a complex task and despite a high level of engagement with potential providers, none of the proposals met the criteria that would enable them to be considered off-balance sheet.\u00a0 The following summary table details each of the 25 proposers who made submissions to the CHG.

This work culminated in the launch last\u00a0month of \u00a0the new Enhanced Long-term Social Housing Leasing scheme. <\/p><p>The scheme will be governed by my Department and operated by local authorities.  It will be funded through my Department's SHCEP.  The Housing Agency will manage and administer the scheme on behalf of my Department and will act as a national co-ordinator.  It is intended to target property developers and investors who are in a position to deliver housing on a reasonable scale as well as fulfilling management and maintenance responsibilities and this is reflected in the changes to the existing lease terms.  It\u00a0will\u00a0complement the existing long-term leasing arrangements, which will continue to be available for leasing existing properties; new properties delivered at a smaller scale; or properties made available for leasing where a housing provider is not in a position to provide management services as required under this new arrangement. <\/p><p>The provider will be paid up to 95% market rate as opposed to 80% (85% for apartments) currently, which\u00a0reflects the reduced responsibility of the local authority in relation to maintenance of the property under this type of contract as compared to standard long term leasing.  The market rent must be evidenced by a valuation prepared by a qualified valuer and each valuation must refer to 3 comparable properties in the locality as evidence of the market rent for the property. <\/p><p>Local authorities will determine the suitability of the proposed properties, having regard to the standard of the properties, the requirement for social housing in the area and the criteria set out in each authority&rsquo;s Development Plans, including in particular sustainable communities considerations. <\/p><p>The new scheme may be used by local authorities in arrangements for Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000.  However, the enhanced lease is specifically targeted at providing housing units in addition to any targets set for Part V arrangements; i.e. any units that are leased under this scheme must be additional to normal Part V obligations on any specific site.  If the new lease is used for a Part V arrangement, the appropriate net monetary value discount will apply and the provider would, therefore, not receive the maximum 95% of market rent. <\/p><p>A call for proposals is currently open and the Housing Agency is accepting submissions from interested parties until 12 April 2018. \u00a0All proposals are subject to a range of criteria as set out in the &ldquo;Calls for Proposals for Enhanced Long Term Social Housing Leasing Scheme&rdquo; and the proposals will be assessed and marked in accordance with the terms set out therein.  The Call for Proposals is available on the Housing Agency website at the following link: .<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032100088#WRBB02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Residential Tenancies Board","counter":759,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032100089#WRCC00200"},{"type":"question","counter":760,"qnumday":327,"qnumall":"[13140\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032100089#WRCC00300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the number of requests for additional funding, staff resources or expertise that have been made by the Residential Tenancies Board since January 2016; the purpose of the requested additional funding, staff resources or expertise; the response of his Department to each request in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1222","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":761,"content":"<p>The RTB currently has 55 staff which include a number of secondees from other civil\/public service bodies.<\/p><p>Demand for the RTB&rsquo;s services has increased significantly due to the increasing size of the rental sector and also because of the changing regulatory structure.
