This is important because it causes serious problems for broadcasting, editorial and sound staff.<\/p><p>Today, we will engage with the new Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade with responsibility for European Union affairs, Deputy Helen McEntee.  Last week, in her absence, members and I congratulated her on her appointment and expressed our desire to work with her.  We complimented the outgoing Minister of State, Deputy Dara Murphy, who was work-like in his duties.  I know the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, will be the exact same.  We are genuine in wishing the Minister of State every success and happiness in her new role.<\/p><p>It is important the relationship between the Minister with responsibility for European Affairs and the committee is strong.  We had good interactions with the previous Minister of State and I hope to have similar strong engagement with the new one, Deputy McEntee.  I have watched the career of Deputy McEntee and since her elevation to ministerial office I have seen her work very diligently in government.  I admire Deputy McEntee and I look forward to working with her.  It is very positive that we can have this initial engagement so soon after Deputy McEntee taking office.  We realise the Minister of State has to read herself into the brief.  We may have less to speak about today than we will in the future but nonetheless it is the beginning of our relationship of working together.  I know that members look forward to interacting with her.<\/p><p>I extend a warm welcome to the officials accompanying the Minister of State and acknowledge the good work of the Department.  I thank the Minister and her officials for taking time out of their busy schedule to be here.<\/p><p>Let me remind members and witnesses of the rules of privilege.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.<\/p><p>I invite the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, to make her opening remarks before opening the floor to my colleagues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017070500002#A00100","speaker":"1319"},{"type":"speech","time":1499259600,"counter":6,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members for their well wishes.  I agree it is important we have a strong relationship and that there is strong engagement between us.  I am at the disposal of the Chairman and members should they need me at the committee.  I am delighted to be here today, the first time I have had the pleasure of being before this committee since I was appointed Minister of State with responsibility for European Affairs two weeks ago.  I was honoured to be asked to take on this important job at a time when Ireland&rsquo;s place in the European Union is centre stage.<\/p> <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s future prosperity is best served by our membership of the European Union.  Brexit only serves to underline that our membership of the Single Market and customs union are the cornerstones of our economic success.  We are all too well aware of the disruption and negative impact that Brexit may have on key sectors of our economy, in particular agriculture, agrifood and the drinks industry, but that does not in any way weaken the case for our remaining committed members of the European Union &ndash; quite the contrary.<\/p> <p>  Chairman, I look forward to working with you and members of the committee to deepen our national and parliamentary dialogue on the full EU agenda.  National parliaments and committees on European affairs play a vital role in EU policy formulation and implementation and in ensuring that the EU improves its engagement with all our citizens.  I assure the Chairman and members of my openness to working with the committee in the period ahead.<\/p> <p>  In the time available today I would like to touch on three issues: the outcome of last month&rsquo;s European Council meeting; the unfolding debate on the future of Europe, a topic that is of particular interest to the committee; and the incoming Estonian EU Presidency, and I welcome Her Excellency, Mrs. Kristi Karelsohn, Ambassador of Estonia to the meeting.<\/p> <p>  One of my first official engagements following my appointment as Minister with responsibility for European Affairs was to accompany the Taoiseach to the June European Council.  Items on the agenda included security and defence; migration; jobs, growth and competitiveness; external relations; the Paris Agreement on climate change; and Digital Europe.  The Taoiseach has already made a comprehensive statement to the D&aacute;il so I do not propose to go into great detail on it now, however, I will touch on a few key issues.<\/p> <p>  On Brexit, the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier updated the European Council on Article 50 format - that is, the 27 member states minus the UK - on the recent opening of formal negotiations with the UK which took place just over two weeks ago, which were seen as generally positive and constructive.  In line with the EU guidelines, the Irish-specific concerns - protecting the Good Friday Agreement and the gains of the peace process; avoiding a hard Border through imaginative and flexible solutions; and maintaining the common travel area &ndash; will be prioritised in the first phase of the negotiations, before we move to discussions about the shape of the future relationship.<\/p> <p>  In respect of jobs, growth and competitiveness, the European Council considered a range of economic issues.  The President of the ECB, Mario Draghi, gave a generally positive presentation about the EU and eurozone economies.<\/p> <p>  There was a discussion of the Single Market and trade policy.  Members will be aware that Ireland has a high level of ambition for the Single Market, in particular with regard to cross-border trade in services and in advance of the European Council we worked with like-minded partners to ensure that a specific reference to services was included in the Council conclusions.  We strongly support the priority the incoming Estonian Presidency has attached to Digital Europe.<\/p> <p>  On trade, the Taoiseach stressed our support for a robust, free trade policy, upholding an open and rules based multilateral trading system.<\/p> <p>  The discussions on security and defence covered both the internal and external aspects.  Discussions covered efforts to tackle the spread of radicalism online and its financing.  The challenges inherent in tackling terrorist communications, while at the same time safeguarding privacy, were acknowledged.<\/p> <p>  On the external dimension, the High Representative, Ms Federica Mogherini, briefed on the implementation of the EU global strategy one year after its adoption.  Ireland strongly supports the strategy, and we have emphasised the need for the comprehensive implementation of all five of its priorities, which is important if all member states are to contribute and play an active part.  Using the Union&rsquo;s unique mix of diplomatic, civilian and peace-keeping capabilities will help protect our citizens, and contribute to peace and security in our neighbourhood and beyond.  <\/p> <p>  The strategy also provides the framework for EU co-operation with NATO, focused on peace-keeping and maintaining international peace and security.  Ireland&rsquo;s neutrality is, of course, fully respected, and has not been brought into question and we do not participate in any military alliance.  However, we favour initiatives to strengthen the EU&rsquo;s capacity to act as an international peace provider, in particular in support of the United Nations.  We also support co-operation within the Union to achieve common objectives in response to the range of new and growing threats.  We have all witnessed them in the past number of weeks and months.<\/p><p> While there have been some positive developments on migration, in particular a significant decline in activity along the eastern Mediterranean route, the situation remains critical in terms of irregular visits and arrivals through the central Mediterranean.  The Council agreed to improve co-ordination efforts in this respect, provide more support for Italy and try to end the tragic situation where so many people are unfortunately losing their lives.<\/p><p> Ireland has consistently called for a comprehensive response to the migration crisis that addresses its effects as well as its underlying root causes.  We have agreed to take up to 4,000 asylum seekers, including 200 minors, and refugees, provide naval vessels to help with search operations - since May 2015, seven of our vessels have saved almost 17,000 migrants - and supply humanitarian assistance to those affected by the Syrian crisis.  To date, we have provided more than &euro;78 million for that.<\/p><p> On the external relations items on the agenda, the Council expressed regret at President Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement on climate change.  On sanctions against Russia, the Council decided that Russia's ongoing actions in eastern Ukraine left little choice but to renew the restrictive measures for a further six months.  This is a decision that Ireland has fully supported.  Leaders discussed relations with Turkey, with concerns being expressed about its human rights situation.  The President of Cyprus updated the European Council on the ongoing UN-sponsored talks between the two communities on the island.<\/p><p> I will turn to the debate on the future of Europe, a matter on which this committee is actively engaged.  On 1 March, the European Commission published the White Paper on the Future of Europe.  As well as setting out the main achievements of the EU over the past six decades, the White Paper addresses the challenges that Europe is facing and presents five scenarios for how the Union could evolve by 2025, depending on how we choose to respond.  The Commission has since published five accompanying reflection papers on a range of diverse topics that will also contribute to the Europe-wide discussions that the White Paper seeks to initiate.<\/p><p> The Government has welcomed the paper.  It contains much valuable food for thought about the international context as it is now and may develop over the coming decades and sets out a number of scenarios for how the EU might evolve and develop in the period ahead.  The White Paper takes an open and non-prescriptive approach and is presented as an initial contribution to a Europe-wide discussion and debate.  This open, inclusive and transparent approach is welcome and is in keeping with the need to renew the EU's contract with its citizens.<\/p><p> The European Commission will lead a public engagement strategy to discuss and debate the future of Europe in all member states.  I understand that the head of the Commission representation in Ireland, Mr. Gerry Kiely, appeared before this committee last month to facilitate an initial exchange with members on the White Paper.  I would be interested to hear from members what themes emerged from that discussion and what discussions they had subsequently.  I understand that the committee is planning a call for public submissions on the future of Europe for later this month.  National parliaments play an important role in debating the future of Europe and the Oireachtas should facilitate and encourage as wide-ranging a debate as possible on this matter of national importance.  The Joint Committee on European Union Affairs is best placed to take a lead role in this regard and I am happy to encourage that lead.<\/p><p> Ideally, the debate should be followed in the autumn by a wider Government-led consultation process, with the outcome of the process that the committee has launched making an important contribution to the Government's consideration.  The consultation process should be as inclusive as possible and involve all interested parties, including social partners, business partners, the voluntary sector, academics and members of the general public.  It is important that the debate engage the public to the greatest extent possible.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is examining a number of options for facilitating and encouraging that wider debate.  I hope that we can work together to further that aim.<\/p><p> I welcome the new Estonian Presidency of the Council, which has just begun.  The ambassador to Ireland, H.E. Mrs. Kristi Karelsohn, is present and will address the committee shortly on her country's priorities.  Ireland welcomes the priorities identified by Estonia, given their emphasis on preserving our shared values of prosperity, security, peace and stability in Europe.  In particular, we welcome the focus on a digital Europe and Estonia's intention of holding a summit meeting in Tallinn on 29 September to discuss Europe's digital future.  I understand that the Taoiseach will be attending that.  We wish the Estonian Presidency well for its upcoming six months.<\/p><p> Some of our Seanad colleagues have been working on a paper on Brexit.  I thank them for their work and look forward to engaging with them next week during the Seanad debate.<\/p><p> I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to address the committee and I look forward to working with members on promoting Ireland's place in the EU.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017070500002#A00200","speaker":"1337","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1499259600,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

I am delighted to see her taking up her role and I wish her best wishes in the coming months and years of her service.  I do not doubt that she will be a success and the Government will flourish with her in this vital role.  I thank her for her kind words about the Seanad committee's report, which was launched yesterday.  Alongside Seanad colleagues, I look forward to engaging in a debate on the report with her next week.  I will not discuss Brexit today.  I am sure that other committee colleagues might have a word or two to say about it, but I will have 80 billion words to say to her about it next week and many other times socially.<\/p> <p>  I wish to touch on two matters, both of which the Minister of State has mentioned, and I am grateful to her for doing so.  The first matter is the White Paper on the Future of Europe.  I will not mention Brexit because it has happened, is being negotiated and is playing out.  Our Government has played an excellent role in putting Ireland in the best position in that regard, which is to be commended, but we have moved on and must now consider the future of Europe and the European Commission's suggestions, some of which are welcome.  Like anything when it comes to dealing with European affairs, however, I fear that some of those suggestions could be taken for granted, jeopardised or misrepresented by ill-informed or nefarious elements in civic society.  We need to be careful in this regard.  When we approach the idea of the future of Europe, we should set out exactly how Ireland sees its role in that future.<\/p> <p>  It will come as no surprise to the Minister of State or other members of the committee that I wholly believe that Ireland's future has to be at the heart of Europe.  She remarked on this matter at the start of her address, which was welcome, but it is not something that can just be written down or shown.  We need to become living and breathing examples of what it means to embrace the European ideal.  To date, we have only done that at a half pace.  We have kept ourselves semi-detached and connected to the UK instead of looking to the rest of Europe and the European project.  This is our future - the UK is our past.  We will maintain as strong a relationship as possible, but the UK has made a decision for us.  Ireland must now make the decision that not only will we be at the heart of Europe, but we will defend it and say why this is right.  I will not go into too much detail because the Minister of State has a great deal of work ahead of her.  It is probably the busiest junior Ministry and should be a full Ministry, given that the Minister of State will have the workload of a full Minister, so I wish her well.  Every meeting should be underlined by us voicing our commitment to Europe and our reasons and by taking on those who put out the idiotic suggestion that we would somehow be better off out of Europe.  That is the challenge that I lay down to the Minister of State and I wish her every bit of luck.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017070500002#B00300","speaker":"1399"},{"type":"speech","time":1499259600,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, her officials, the ambassadors, their staff and the diplomatic corps.  We appreciate their attendance at our meetings and they add to the meetings' importance.  The Chairman has been active in meeting all the EU ambassadors.  We commend him on his efforts.  All members have been available to meet ambassadors to discuss issues.<\/p> <p>  I commend the former Minister of State, Deputy Dara Murphy's efforts and co-operation over the past number of years.  We welcome the new Minister of State in that capacity and congratulate her.  She will make as big an impression in Europe as she makes in my area of Castlecoote in County Roscommon, which she has visited many times.  We are always delighted to meet her there.  She is approachable and will undoubtedly make that impression in Europe.<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State's speech was excellent and covered many matters.  She is working her way into the situation, but she has a good knowledge.<\/p><p>She has previous ministerial experience and acquitted herself very well.  She came up with new initiatives which were very welcome.  Like other members, I was in Malta when it held the Presidency of the Council of the European Union.  I will be representing the committee at a COSAC meeting in Estonia at the weekend.  I commend Estonia and wish it well during its Presidency.  I also thank the Maltese in what was an excellent Presidency.  <\/p><p> I welcome the peace talks initiated by the United Nations now taking place in Switzerland.  We could play a very important role in dealing with the Cypriot issue, particularly in resolving issues between Turkey and Greece which very much reflect the difficulties we have had on our island.  Our experiences and achievements in the peace talks which led to the Good Friday Agreement impressed the Cypriots.  I know that the Minister of State met the President of Cyprus who updated her on the current position.  It is an area in which I would like to see her get involved as her experience would be of benefit.  She also has responsibility for the Council of Europe; I think it is part of her portfolio, but I am not quite sure.  Normally the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs attends Council of Europe ministerial meetings.  It is a very important forum at which 47 countries are represented and meet on a regular basis - four times a year.  Our representative is Senator Joe O'Reilly.  He is the leader of the Irish delegation which comprises excellent members.  I wish the Minister of State every success in that regard.  I am not here to ask her questions, just to wish her well.  There is no doubt that she will have a tremendously busy time in dealing with her portfolio.  She will be one of the busiest Ministers in the Government, but I have no doubt that she is ready, willing and able to take on the role.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017070500002#B00400","speaker":"1393","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1499259600,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I join the Chairman and colleagues in wishing the Minister of State well in her new role which I have no doubt her excellent abilities will enable her to perform very well.  There are a number of issues arising from her contribution, one of which is the migration crisis.  It was very disappointing to hear some of the recent comments made by countries.  I fully understand that for ones directly affected, it is very difficult to deal with the inflow, but, collectively, the European Union has an incredible responsibility.  We are dealing daily with men, women and children's lives and it is one of the most defining issues on which it will be judged.  It is at the heart of what it is supposed to be about in terms of how we treat people.  The last thing we want to see happen is future generations to look back and ask the question that has been asked: how could people enjoy their lovely holidays on the shores of the Mediterranean in the months of July and August at a time when the Governments of those countries were allowing people to die?  As a country, we have made a tremendous effort.  We have to acknowledge the deployment of the Naval Service and other members of the Defence Forces and the role they have played, but, collectively, EU member states need to do more.  There is a need for a greater integrated response because one life lost is one too many and thousands dying is almost becoming a non-story for the media.  We should never forget what is happening.<\/p> <p>  Senator Neal Richmond has mentioned the other point I want to raise.  I welcome the restatement of our commitment to the European Union.  It should not be necessary to do so, but it is.  It is regrettable there are people who, for whatever reason, are willing to sell a story to which there is no logic that this country would somehow benefit from being outside the European Union.  There has always been a cohort who are negative about or anti-the European Union.  We, therefore, need to redouble our efforts, particularly in the process of looking at and shaping the future of the European Union, and restate the central benefits to the country, its economy and future, of membership of the Union.  In Britain there has always been a very strong anti-EU group.  Eventually there was a referendum that took it out of the European Union.  Britain played a central role with us as members of the European Union in terms of the way we sought to shape it with the rest of our European partners.  Shaping it is one of the greatest challenges facing the Government, in the next stage of which the pro-EU voice in Britain will be missing.  Britain does not acknowledge its achievements within the Europe Union, particularly in its enlargement and expansion.  As a country, we need to look at how we, without the British voice, can redouble our efforts to make sure the future shape of the European Union reflects the interests of all mainland Europe countries and will take account of what it is like to be a country on the periphery or at the very edge of Europe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017070500002#C00200","speaker":"1310"},{"type":"speech","time":1499259600,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State and her colleagues and wish her well in her ministry which is very important and pivotal and growing in importance.

To say the least, such comments are unhelpful and they have come from people who should know better.  It is timely for us to recognise that the Government, the Oireachtas and Members of the Houses, collectively, have a responsibility to keep firm lines and our position on membership of the European Union clear and transparent.  We have long since committed to membership of it and intend for it to remain that way.  We also need to be absolutely certain that pre-emptive strikes will not take place.  One or two have already been made and we could find ourselves negotiating in a situation where some ground had already been conceded by virtue of some of the suggestions made.  It is a little like tackling somebody before a rugby match starts.  It involves red and black cards, sin bins and everything else.  What I am trying to say, without mentioning names, is that pre-emptive strikes are unhelpful in the context of negotiations.  The EU negotiating team is led by Michel Barnier and it is the appropriate route to follow.  <\/p> <p>  We have a particular interest in Brexit because of the position of Northern Ireland which is of particular importance to us on this island.  Nothing has changed in that regard and the commitment made by the Government prevails in terms of its anxiety to ensure continued access to the Single Market.  There can be no fudging on the issue.  It should also be recognised that the Irish and British Governments are co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement.  It is on that basis that both of them have responsibility.  The Good Friday Agreement is an international agreement and attempts to unwind it by stealth are not to the benefit of either Northern or Southern Ireland or the European Union.  The European Union has given a commitment in that regard and there are also global commitments.  I strongly reiterate the need for us to remain steadfast in our objectives and ensure we will not in any way be distracted by people who tend to make unhelpful, unfounded and unresearched suggestions that would lead us nowhere except into the sand.  <\/p> <p>  We are glad to see that in terms of job creation, growth and competitiveness the position in the European Union is beginning to improve.  It is focusing on the issues and bringing about results.<\/p><p>It remains with the larger economies in the European Union to take maximum advantage of this turning trend.  Without that, it will fizzle out again.<\/p><p> In this country, we tend to think only of the security and defence of Europe.  The passage of time and recent events indicate, however, we all have security and defence issues which we have to keep in mind.  We need to be fully supportive of our security forces, the Garda and the Defence Forces, and be reliant upon them to do the job in ensuring their ability to counter any terrorist or potential terrorist attack.  It is not to our advantage to highlight alleged weaknesses in our system.  I do not believe we need to advertise to anybody these weaknesses.  We must keep in mind also that some of the most security conscious countries in the world have not been able to withstand or detect in time the issues which have caused serious loss of life in the UK, France, Belgium and all over the globe.  Tending in this country to downgrade our capabilities in this area is neither helpful, useful nor supportive.  In actual fact, it undermines our ability to provide the adequate protection to our citizens.<\/p><p> It is not acceptable that countries throughout the European Union, notwithstanding that some of them are next door and closer to the action than we are, will not assist with the refugee crisis.  Collectively, the European Union must be well disposed in catering for refugees.  However, it seems we cannot do it because we cannot get the agreement of all member states.  That is a failing not on the part of the Union but on the part of the countries who refuse, are incapable of or are unwilling to negotiate and cater for that situation.  As I have said in the past, if, in the 21st century, the best we can do is offer razor wire to kids who are fleeing from torture, hunger and war, that is a sad reflection on the European Union in general, and an even sadder reflection on the individual countries concerned, particularly countries which have had themselves first-hand experience of the kind hardship that some of these people are now experiencing.<\/p><p> I apologise that I must leave but I have to attend a meeting next door.

Accordingly, I have no doubt any dialogue we have with the new Minister of State will be constructive and in the national interest.<\/p><p>The White Paper on the Future of Europe was published by the European Commission in March.  It set out five possible scenarios, namely, scenario one, carrying on; scenario two, nothing but the Single Market; scenario three, those who want more, do more; scenario four, doing less more efficiently; scenario five, doing much more together.  A briefing note from the EU division of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, suggests, more or less, that scenario one, carrying on where the EU focuses on the delivery of its positive reform agenda, certainly represents a predictable safe course in the short to medium term.  Are we proceeding along these lines?  By and large, Ireland has always adopted a pragmatic approach to the European Union and EU negotiations.  It seems the Government&rsquo;s suggestion is to opt for a wait-and-see pragmatic attitude.  Is that our position?  Have we any firm commitments regarding the future of Europe?<\/p><p>I hope the consultation on the future of Europe will be extensive.  There is a danger that this debate will bypass the majority of our citizens.  Obviously, this committee will do its bit.  Will the Minister of State reassure me that the Government will do its part in promoting a debate on the future of Europe?  We must also ensure that the European Commission plays its part in ensuring citizens of Europe engage in this process.  The danger is, if a referendum ever comes on aspects of the future of Europe regarding treaty change, that the citizens will not become engaged until a week before polling day.  We need to do everything possible to engage citizens in this national and European debate.<\/p><p>I agree with everything stated in the communiqu&eacute; from the European Council meeting on internal security.  We have all been shocked by recent terrorist attacks.  The measures proposed at that meeting are to be welcomed.  As regards external security, several measures were agreed on defence.  The most important one was the establishment of a permanent structured co-operation, PESCO.  Over the past few days, <i>The Irish Times<\/i>ran a series of articles on the future of Europe, which have been useful for this debate.  Basically, the articles stated Ireland is enthusiastic about the PESCO initiative, but will not participate in any of the measures proposed or the other measures outlined at the recent European Council meeting.

I thank them for their swift action on it.<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State has had time to cool off, so I will kick back in again and try to put the pressure on.  We were talking about security.  It is my view that our State is not dealing with security on the same level as the 27.  There is co-operation among our police forces and defence forces.  I have no doubt about that.  However, when we move into the higher levels of security services, I do not believe we have the level of co-operation that we need.  I have been calling for the appointment of a director of homeland security for some time and for the development of a homeland security service.  I do not expect the Minister of State will do much in that regard - I do not think it comes under her portfolio - but it is something that she will find levied at her as she goes around Europe.  She needs to be aware of that.  We do not have a relationship with the likes of MI5.  It is as simple as that, and I make no apology for pointing it out.<\/p> <p>  The other issue is the issue of online security and monitoring.  In particular, much of the terrorism is now taking place through social media and various other types of media.  By Government admission and not mine, we need to amend 50 pieces of legislation.  As far as I recall, that was announced in 2016.  Nothing has been done to bring that legislation before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Unless we amend the legislation, we are not able to co-operate on a European level with the tracking of digital data as it is moving through the system.<\/p> <p>  On migration, the Irish Government has lived up to its commitment so far.  I am very grateful to the Department of Justice and Equality.  I travelled to Sicily some time ago to look at the migration crisis as the part of COSAC.  I was the Irish representative.  There is an issue.  We still have 1,298 migrants to relocate into this country and the Italians are refusing to allow our immigration people on the ground.  I made the point at the meeting that, unless that happens, we cannot fulfil our full commitment.  This morning we heard the Italian ambassador on the airwaves speaking about the problem in Italy.  There is no getting away from the problem, which is massive when out there on the ground.  Last year some 19,000 people landed at the tiny port of Pozzallo that I visited in Ragusa.<\/p><p>By the time I got there, which is now almost two months ago, close to 5,000 had already arrived.  Some of my colleagues have spoken about the need for European countries to stand up and take ownership of this crisis and to offer a place of refuge to those migrants.<br\/><br\/>This is a major humanitarian crisis.  I am the first person here to point out that we must recognise the difference between an economic migrant and a refugee or asylum seeker.  When I looked at the numbers coming through Pozzallo, roughly 3% of those who were rescued in the Mediterranean came from countries such as Syria, Iran, Iraq and Afghanistan.  The remainder had come from countries such as Nigeria, Eritrea and Bangladesh.  We must recognise that a significant number of those arriving in Europe are economic migrants.  Just because they are economic migrants, that does not mean we do not have to look after them.  We in Ireland above all countries should know what it means to be an economic migrant as many of our people have been economic migrants since the time of the Famine.  We need to establish clearer guidelines on how we deal with economic migrants versus how we deal with refugees and asylum seekers.  Every refugee landing in any country in Europe deserves to be given a place of safety.  For those who are arriving for economic needs, we will have to come up with strategies.  Those strategies will involve investing in their home countries in order to incentivise those migrants to return home and stay at home, and ensuring that the corporate world is made to pay its share<b>.<\/b>A teeshirt manufacturer based in Donegal moved to Morocco because it could get labour at 20% of the cost it was paying for it in Donegal.  A major sports manufacturers moved from County Meath to China because it could get labour at 20% of the cost there.  Have those manufacturers reduced their prices?  No, they have not.  They are making super normal profits on the backs of workers in Morocco and other African countries, in China and other parts of Asia.  The European Union need to penalise and tax those people in order that we can invest in Morocco, Nigeria and other countries and give them a reasonable standard of living.  Those corporate entities have to be made to pay.  I made that point in Germany.  I was there as part of the German-Irish friendship group and the Germans feel exactly the same as I do.  Those corporations have to start becoming good citizens of Europe.  With respect to the definition of an economic migrant versus an asylum seeker or a refugee, we have to come up with that strategy.<br\/><br\/>A refugee or any individual who arrives in Sicily is picked up the Mediterranean.  Those unfortunate people are treated horrendously before they are put on to some miserable piece of rubber or a timber boat and pushed out into the Mediterranean.  They are told by the traffickers that it is only five or six mile over there and that they will be fine, knowing in their hearts and souls that it is not the case, but they also know that the Irish Navy, the Norwegians and the Italians will be there to rescue these people.  When migrants arrive in a port, they are first allowed to have a shower, they are given clean clothes and a SIM card and then they are brought for interview.  The purpose of the interview is to establish who the migrants are.  Most of the migrants arriving have no identification papers.  If they had them, they were taken off them by the traffickers and, in some cases, they destroyed them themselves.  This is the best way for a migrant to get a brand new identity.  When a migrant on arriving in Sicily is asked him name, he may say his name is John McCormack.  When asked if he has papers, he will say he does not.  He is told he is welcome to Sicily and to take a seat until an officer talks to him.  The migrant gets a brand new identity and he can then move through Europe.<br\/><br\/>I am not saying we are importing terrorists.  I want to be very clear about that.  I am saying that there is a security risk.  Most of the terrorism that has taken place in Europe recently has been carried out by from home-grown terrorists.  Therefore, the issue is not one of terrorism.  We strongly vet the people coming into this country.  How do we do that and establish who anybody is coming into the country?  We have no way of knowing.  Do we pick up the telephone and ring the Nigerians and ask them do they know John McCormack?  When we do that and they say they do not him, we tell them that he is a big heavy guy who is balding and ask them are they sure they do not know him, they say that they do not know John McCormack.  In a that way, John McCormack becomes a new personality who moves through Europe and once he gets into Europe if he within the Schengen area, he can move anywhere he wants.  We have to find a better way of dealing with the migration issue.<br\/><br\/>On the issue of our sister countries within the European Union, I have spoken directly to people from Hungary and Poland and I have attended meetings with them in Pozzallo in Sicily.  The problem they have is not unlike our own.  They have masses of homeless people.  Their politicians, just like ourselves, know that they will have to face their electorate in the not too distant future.  Politics is taking over from where humanity should be.  It is taking over because the politicians are with faced with the problem of whether they can really bring migrants into the country and house when their own nationals are homeless.  There is a moral issue here.  It is not right for us in this country to turn our eye on anybody else and criticise them.  They have their problems and we have ours.  <br\/><br\/>Having spoken to people from different countries around the European Union, it is my view that the greatest single threat to the European Union and the European community is migration.  It will cause the rift and the division that Brexit will not cause.  Unless we come to terms with the migration issue and do so soon, we will find ourselves in serious trouble.  One of issues the Minister of State might consider when talking to her opposite numbers around Europe is that we would consider giving economic migrants a visa for five or ten years, where they could come to a country, work, earn money, sent it home, just like the Irish did in America and in London.  When I went to London in 1968 I sent a fiver home a week.  I used to get it all back when I came back on holiday but that is neither here nor there.  Anybody I knew who was in London at that time was sending money home. Any house one would visit in the west would remember the dollars coming in from the United States.  Economic migration is not such a terrible thing.  We did it for an awful long time and we did it again in 2008.  Let us not knock it but let us find a strategy that allows it to be orderly and manageable.  Instead of allowing these traffickers to traffick people, let us set up migration places in Nigeria, Eritrea and Bangladesh, and if people want to come here they can apply for a visa in the proper way and we would allow them into the country.  Having said that, I am acutely aware of the fact that Irish people go to America without visas and perhaps they too should observe what I am talking about.  I am sorry for taking a little longer than I should have but the Chairman did cut me off earlier.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017070500002#E00900","speaker":"1390","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1499259600,"counter":35,"content":"<p>I apologise for that.

We all want her to be successful.  There is a huge burden on her.  We all want to work with her and her officials to get the best deal for Ireland.  It is important to have a common Irish voice on many of these matters.  It helps in negotiations and moving the process forward but it is a two-way process.  She needs to keep not only members of her party but members of the Opposition on board in these negotiations.  Does she have a view on how she plans to move to forward in regard to these matters  in terms of keeping not only this committee involved and up to date but also the spokespersons on the Opposition side?<\/p> <p>  My colleague spoke about the refugees crisis.  I listened to what the Italian ambassador said this morning on the radio.  He spoke about the scale of the challenge facing Italy.  The Italians feel that there is a lack of solidarity from the rest of Europe when it comes to the huge number of refugees landing on their shores.<\/p><p>The fact is that boats can bring refugees to any safe port, but they are coming to Italian ports in the main and not to anywhere else.  There is a lack of solidarity.  I do not believe we should equate the two when we talk about this because it raises fears over security, terrorism and refugees.  I do not believe they should even be in the same sentence, although many people try to lump the two issues.<\/p><p> Clearly there is a link between poverty, inequality, global warming, conflict and war.  Many countries in Europe are responsible for many of those issues and we have a responsibility.  These are vulnerable people at the end of the day.  People can label them as economic refugees or those who are fleeing poverty, equality and all the rest, but they are vulnerable people and we need to look at that.<\/p><p> One question that people continually ask is what Ireland is doing.  A friend who has left here said that he visited Italy and looked at the camps and so on to get an idea of the experience there.  The first thing that people ask me is how many people from Italy have actually arrived in Ireland.  We know some have come from the camps in Greece, but what are the barriers to people arriving in Ireland?  Are there any plans to increase the amount of people who are going to come to Ireland?  I am conscious of what my learned friend was saying about the difficulties and so on.  The goodwill of the Irish people exists in respect of refugee matters.<\/p><p> The Government has plans to increase the amount of refugees that we agree to relocate from Italy or other front-line states.  What is the Government doing to ensure the human rights of refugees are being protected and to ensure that lives are not lost?  I am conscious of the role of the Naval Service and so on.  Part of that role has to include our stepping up to the plate in respect of the difficulties of other states.<\/p><p> We also need to raise our voice in respect of those countries clearly supplying the conflict and supplying weapons of war to the conflict in that region.  There is a direct correlation between conflict and refugees.  If people are bombed out of their homes, where are they going to go?  Are they going to go somewhere they believe to be safe?  Many believe Ireland is safe or safer than where they live.  There is a direct correlation and many of those countries with barriers and barbed wire fence and so on are precisely those directly feeding the conflicts by their arms industry.  I do not see a contradiction for us but I believe we need to start raising our voice and becoming louder internationally in respect of those countries that are basically putting barbed wire fences up to exclude those fleeing the conflicts and wars in which their governments and arms industries have direct involvement.<\/p><p> I wish to comment on Brexit and the Border.  I listened to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, at the launch of the Good Friday document on Brexit.  Given the disastrous impact that Brexit will have on the island of Ireland, it is important that we have a common language that we agree to.  The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy McEntee, is aware of the position of the D&aacute;il on special designated status for the North of Ireland within the EU.  It would be helpful.  The Government voted against that motion.  Does the Minister of State not agree that it would be helpful if we had a common Irish position?  Again, we are being asked to wear the green jersey.  That is the position of most parties on the island of Ireland.  We see it as the best way forward for the economy and for the people.  We need to agree the terms of what we are looking for.  Again, I am keen to hear what the Minister of State believes in respect of special status for the North within the EU.<\/p><p> Can the Minister of State outline the timetable for Brexit negotiations?  When is the deal expected on the divorce Bill?  When will it be agreed?<\/p><p> One of the things that came as a surprise during the week was the issue of fishing and Brexit.  I saw a report that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, learned of it for the first time on the edge of the talks in the North.  I talked to a secretary of the Scottish Cabinet during the week.  It came as a surprise.  They are arguing that the fishing issue is a devolved matter.  Is the Minister of State aware of that?  Is that the understanding of the Minister of State on the matter?  When was the Minister of State first made aware of this decision to pull out of the London Fisheries Convention?  Has it come as a complete surprise to the Government?<\/p><p> The EU military was referenced.  I raised this issue during the pre-Council meeting.  I am deeply concerned about the increased militarisation of Europe.  There is talk of spending &euro;1.5 billion per year in the EU budget on what I see as regressive military projects.  There is a view that part of this funding will go towards the establishment of a standing EU army.  The reports from the reflection paper on the future of Europe, which was launched on 7 June, refers to how member states and defence forces will one day be pre-positioned and made permanently available for rapid deployment on behalf of the Union.  In simple terms that means we are talking about a standing EU army.  Was that raised at the pre-Council meeting?  What is the Government's view in respect of this standing army?<\/p><p> Again, we need to separate the idea of the improvement of domestic security.  We are all conscious of the recent attacks and so on.  The creation of an external force is an extra financial burden not wanted by anyone.  Most of us here have the view that rather than going down this route we would like to see the money being spent on housing, trolleys, people on trolleys and mental health.  There is an extensive list.  The priorities are wrong and I have said as much in the pre-Council speeches.<\/p><p> I do not think anyone has touched on taxation but it is one of the issues.  Yesterday in Strasbourg MEPs voted on a report on corporate tax and tax transparency.  For more than a decade civil society groups, NGOs and tax justice groups have been campaigning for country-by-country company reporting.  We are talking in terms of possibly a sum of $500 billion that is lost to tax dodgers.  Again, I am keen to hear whether the Minister of State has a view.  What is the Government's view on country-by-country reporting and the idea that we would allow profit-shifting to tax havens to continue unhindered?  I note the fact that Fine Gael MEPs voted with their EPP counterparts to allow this loophole for multinationals.<\/p><p> What is the view of the Government on the fiscal rules as part of this negotiation?  Does the Government have a view?  We have long argued that the EU fiscal rules would stifle essential investment and starve public services.  We can see that with the uneven development and under-development in many parts of the country.  The impending effects of Brexit demand that, at a minimum, whatever flexibility exists currently is used by us to the greatest effect.  Is part of the strategy to try to look at flexibility with the fiscal rules?  We have a globalisation fund at the moment.<\/p><p>Has there been any talk of a Brexit fund for those countries whose workers will be impacted upon negatively?  Does the Minister of State think that will be part of the negotiations and will it be seen as a priority by the Government?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017070500002#F00300","speaker":"1309","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1499259600,"counter":39,"content":"<p>I will be brief as I have to leave for another meeting.

I am sure they will be very valuable assets in the role she is taking on, which no doubt will be challenging.  Like all good Meath people, I am sure she is up for the challenge.  It is important that she uses the role effectively to continue to build on the relations we have with our EU colleagues, which will help Ireland, as a small island, in so many important areas such as trade and business that are crucial to the economy.<\/p> <p>  I wish to focus briefly on two areas.  I agree with my colleagues that sometimes the perception of Europe is negative and that is probably based on the fact that when various policies affect people negatively, then everything is blamed on Europe.  Much remains to be done to improve the perception of Europe among Irish citizens.  Most of the people I meet who have any interest in the various European policies that affect the country have a somewhat negative view.  That is unfortunate because Europe has been very positive for the country as well.  That is something that must be examined.<\/p> <p>  We must promote trade and commercial activity, especially in light of Brexit.  That would be very important for the economy and the country.

Deputy Crowe referred to the fishing industry and the threat to the livelihood of Irish fishermen.  What has emerged in recent days is an important development.  Even without that there is an imbalance in the quotas and restrictions on Irish fishermen.  In County Kerry, Deputy Ferris, the spokesperson for Sinn F&eacute;in, is always to the forefront on this issue.  We are deeply concerned about the future livelihood of fishermen because if what they are facing becomes a reality they could be wiped out.  They have suffered enough through the decades since we first joined the then EEC.  Their ground, if we could call it that, has been taken from them.  If what the UK has announced comes to pass, it will be an awful situation.

In the most recent survey that was carried out approximately 88% of Irish people agree with that.  That said, I agree with some of the comments made by members to the effect that sometimes people feel the things that go wrong in their everyday lives can be attributed to something that comes from Europe.  Perhaps they do not often see the positive things that happen in Europe that have an impact on their lives.  A body of work needs to be done in that regard.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Haughey spoke about the future of Europe, where we see ourselves and what route we are going to take.  Ireland has always been ambitious and we will continue to be ambitious.  No position has been decided on.  At this stage, we need to look at all avenues and discuss matters in the committee and with the wider population.  Just having public meetings is not enough.  There must be a different type of engagement, whether it is online or through colleges or schools.  I very much intend to start that process and to open up a dialogue because while Brexit is the biggest thing on our agenda, as Senator Richmond correctly said, it has happened and we must focus on that but what happens afterwards is also important and we must be very much prepared.  I look forward to working with all of the members in that regard.<\/p> <p>  It is regrettable that we are where we are in the context of Brexit.  It is not a decision Ireland or the other member states have made but we must deal with it and our priority will continue to focus on the Good Friday Agreement, the peace process and the work and effort that has gone into that.  The Single Market and the customs union have played a key role because they automatically took down the existing barriers.  We must ensure that we have as close a relationship as possible with the UK, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales.  We are talking about imaginative and flexible solutions.  We do not know what they are just yet but we need to be realistic and look at all possibilities and eventualities.  We owe citizens and industries that too.<\/p> <p>  One of the first engagements I had was to travel to Brussels with the Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar.  It was very clear from our engagements with the various Heads of State and Government that Ireland's specific situation is very much on their agenda.  It has been very clearly laid out over the past year or year and a half through engagement at the level of civil servants and Ministers.  That will continue.  Our position is well known, particularly on the common travel area, which is unique to Ireland and the UK.  It is in place since 1922 and other member states are very conscious of that.  The work in that regard must continue.  I have no doubt that will be the case.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, the Taoiseach and the Irish MEPs will continue to wear the green jersey, as it were.<\/p> <p>  We will be judged on how we deal with migration.  It is an extremely difficult situation.  While Brexit is our main priority, the further east one goes it becomes less of a priority and migration becomes more of an issue.  As a country we have been very ambitious and we have put our best foot forward.  Seven vessels have saved almost 18,000 people in the past two years.  That clearly shows our commitment, as does the funding of &euro;78 million that has been given to support refugees in Syria.  Not only that, we have shown commitment to work with EU member states to try to get to the core of why those problems are happening, be they economic or related to climate change, war or persecution.<\/p> <p>  We have always been at the heart of peacekeeping.  Reference was made to PESCO.  We are not stopping other member states from following their own route in that regard.  We have no plans to join NATO in the middle of the night but we are very much open to supporting the peacekeeping process and getting to the heart of what the problems are and why people are fleeing their own countries.<\/p><p>There are probably some other questions that I have not touched on but if I can I will come back to them again if there is another stage.

This is the first time that Estonia has held the Council Presidency and we in Ireland look forward to it.  We know that sometimes it is the smaller countries who can run the most efficient and effective EU Council Presidencies, building the necessary coalitions and putting the interest of the union to the forefront.  Estonia also has a reputation as being a world leader in the digital and digital governance space.  We hope Estonia will be able to bring some of that experience to the table.  The committee is very interested in hearing about the work and priorities the Estonian Government sees ahead for its challenging six months.  Some months ago I had the privilege of meeting the ambassador.  We held a good discussion on matters of mutual interest and especially in the context of Brexit and what it would mean for Ireland and Estonia.

I am very happy to present Estonia's priorities here.  As a first time Presidency for Estonia, it is a very exciting time ahead of us.  We all feel that we have to take a great responsibility in the role and take the European agenda forward.<\/p> <p>  There is no need to assure anybody that it is not the easiest time for the European Union, when we are taking up our Presidency.  First there was the eurozone crisis that shook the fundamentals of our common currency.  Then there was the migration crisis - far from over today &ndash; which started to pose new challenges for our unity and collective operation.  A year ago, after the Brexit vote, people started to ask existential questions about the future of our Union.  The increasing threat of terrorism, both in the real and cyber worlds, also contributes to the turbulence and instability for the European Union lives in.<\/p> <p>  The overarching aim of the Estonian Council Presidency is to ensure that - despite all the global and local challenges - the EU remains united and decisive.  We must keep looking for issues, initiatives and ways that unite us, and not for those that pose a risk of dividing member states.  We should look for initiatives that balance things and build bridges.<\/p><p>One of the most challenging developments in that regard is Brexit which, as a topic, is not mentioned among their priorities.  It will no doubt be a very controversial topic and a factor in financing the EU's work, at least for the next couple of years, but the main responsibility in the negotiations lies with the Commission and its chief negotiator.  Estonia, as President of the Council, will be at the service of the 27 member states and will work closely with other EU institutions to ensure as smooth and constructive a Brexit process as possible.  However, we would like to avoid Brexit being in the centre of our Presidency and see the Union moving forward with its everyday agenda.  Despite the difficulties being posed by the negotiations, the Union also has to preserve its unity.<br\/><br\/>Despite, and even due to, these challenges, the EU has to look forward.  The White Paper and reflection papers by the Commission, and several reports by the European Parliament, give us a good basis for discussion about the future of the EU.  We must not forget, however, that it is not the institutional set-up that is the most important aspect, but that our citizens must be at the centre of our attention.  Delivering concrete measures for our citizens is what the Estonian Presidency will strive to achieve.<br\/><br\/>We have four equally important priorities for the Estonian Presidency.  First is an open and innovative European economy.  Second is a safe and secure Europe.  Third is a digital Europe and free movement of data.  Fourth is an inclusive and sustainable Europe.  We also have two cross-cutting issues on our list of priorities, which are the Eastern Partnership and the digital agenda.<br\/><br\/>On our first priority, an open and innovative European economy, an open Europe means creating better opportunities for its citizens and businesses.  A strong Single Market is a key driver of economic welfare, but it is not yet complete.  To support growth and competitiveness, we must ensure providing services and starting business in the EU is easy and that rules are transparent and predictable.  We need to create new funding opportunities for companies and a stable banking sector.  These objectives could be achieved by protecting and promoting the EU's four freedoms and facilitating the freedom of establishment and cross-border mobility of companies.  The European economic and monetary union has been strengthened in recent years, but much is still ongoing.  It is necessary to complete the second stage of the creation of the European banking union and work must continue on implementing the capital markets union.<br\/><br\/>Guided by the principles of the European energy union, the Estonian Presidency focus is on the new electricity market design, which provides an essential basis for a single European energy market.  Estonia will co-ordinate the clean energy package and seek agreements on practically every aspect of the package.<br\/><br\/>In the era of the slowdown of globalisation, trade is no longer an EU policy that enjoys unconditional support, but Estonia believes in free trade and stands, together with Ireland, in defence of it.  We hope to finalise the agreement with Japan.  There is an opportunity for a political agreement tomorrow at the EU-Japan summit.  We also want to make progress on other agreements such as Mercosur and those with Mexico and other countries.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>With regard to a safe and secure Europe, the security situation in Europe and its neighbourhood countries remains complex. Terrorism, organised crime and the protection of the EU's external border remain a high priority.  The migration crisis proves that Europe cannot ignore the events unfolding outside its borders.<br\/><br\/>It will come as no surprise that Estonia intends to put greater emphasis on defence co-operation and levels of defence spending to enhance European military capabilities.  We also hope for the European Parliament's support in setting up the European defence fund.  Estonia will join the Permanent Structured Cooperation, PESCO.  In addition, we want to move forward with EU-NATO strategic co-operation for tackling hybrid and cyber threats, <i>inter alia<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>We believe internal and external security is indivisible.  Estonia supports the High Representative in implementing the global strategy.  We are ready to contribute to the strengthening of transatlantic ties, supporting the implementation of the objectives of the European neighbourhood policy and ensuring the EU's political focus remains on the Eastern Partnership, which is one of the cross-cutting priorities for our Presidency, as mentioned.<br\/><br\/>In recent days, the level of migration has reached new peaks.  It is an issue that got a good deal of attention in the previous session here.  In our view, the most important aspect is co-operation with third countries to deal with the root causes of migration.  We have to protect those who are entitled to international protection and at the same time strengthen our external borders, implement an effective return policy for those who are not entitled to stay, and fight against trafficking of people and irregular migration.<br\/><br\/>One of the main Estonian priorities is the reform of the European common asylum system.  We must continue creating databases and modern IT solutions that allow for rapid exchange of information when needed.  To improve the exchange and use of information, we will continue the work towards interoperability of different IT systems and databases.<br\/><br\/>That leads me to our favourite topic and the third priority, which is DigitalEurope and the free flow of data.  It will come as no surprise to anyone that one of our priorities is DigitalEurope.  We see technological innovation not as an objective itself but as a tool to make the lives of people, companies and governments more effective.  We believe that making good use of technology will be the key to success for Europe.<br\/><br\/>Our Presidency will focus on the establishment of a digital Single Market, increased use of e-solutions and data as well as on the development of cross-border e-services and cyber defence.  We have planned around 45 events and meetings directly or indirectly related to digital topics.  About half the informal Councils and four Minister&rsquo;s meetings also have a digital dimension.  The most important event, as mentioned by the Minister previously, will be the digital summit in September in Tallinn.<br\/><br\/>We will also aim at introducing new smart IT solutions to make the EU function more efficiently and easier to understand.  In the same way, the free movement of data is something that concerns all European policies.  Data is the raw material of the information society that makes the flow of capital, people, goods and services easier, faster and more affordable.  Today, this potential is not fully exploited within the Single Market.  The free movement of data, as the fifth freedom of the EU besides the existing four freedoms, is a future-looking debate that Estonia wishes to initiate.  Better cross-use of data is needed for better decision-making, efficiency and fighting common threats like terrorism and cyber crimes.<br\/><br\/>Doing that, one cannot overlook the fundamental freedoms of our citizens.  The free movement of data needs clear rules.  We need to find ways to ensure the data is used in a secure way for our individual and collective benefit.  That involves data protection and privacy, new technologies, cutting edge infrastructure and all other enablers and restrictions on the movement of data.  Also, Estonia is ready to share its wide experience here.  Among other things, I was delighted to speak at the recent data summit in Dublin about how we have built trust in an Estonian digital society.  More concretely, we want to focus on the removal of unjustified data localisation requirements; promoting a once only principle for eGovernment services; and creating clear rules on data access and portability.<br\/><br\/>The fourth priority is an inclusive and sustainable Europe.  We believe that economic achievements alone do not bring happiness and prosperity for European people, but we have to seek a balance between economic, social and environmental goals.  Inclusive Europe supports equal opportunities for employment, access to services and social inclusion.<br\/><br\/>When moving across borders, equal opportunities also mean fair mobility.  To promote the free movement of persons, workers and services and supporting social guarantees, Estonia will continue the work on social security co-ordination regulation.<\/p><p>A sustainable European Union cares about and contributes to a cleaner environment and a more balanced economic model.  We want the European Union to stay committed to the Paris Agreement and a 40% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.  We aim to make progress on all climate policy files and look forward to productive collaboration with the Parliament in advancing them.<\/p><p> I thank all members for their attention.  I am happy to take comments or questions they may have and engage with the committee in the future during our Presidency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017070500002#J01000","nonspeaker":"H.E.

I wish Estonia well.  It has a big job ahead in the next six months or so and I wish it the very best of luck.<\/p> <p>  I am reading through priorities of the Estonian Government which the ambassador has set out in her presentation, starting with the finance model.  I am very interested to see a reference to an attempt to finance small start-ups because that is the future of businesses.  One thing I have seen both in this country and the United States is the use of microfinance in establishing start-up businesses, but, unfortunately, to move to the next stage, they depend on venture capitalists.  We had this discussion last week in Germany, for example.  Venture capitalism, taking chances and so on do not rest easily with the Germans and, to a certain degree, we are very limited in this country.  I would, therefore, like to see second-tier finance available to small start-ups through the European system.  If this were to require the European Union to take some equity in companies as they grew, I am not so sure that would be bad, at least in the initial stages.<\/p> <p>  The ambassador talked about stable banking.  What is it?  Does it entail shareholders being satisfied or the needs of the public being met?  There has been a dramatic recovery in this country and the Government should be very proud of where we have got to.  However, it has not been without significant pain, as the ambassador will know, having lived in the country.  I know of a young couple who have paid &euro;82,000 in rent and they are being refused a mortgage by the bank because they have no savings.  How are they going to have savings when they are paying such rent?  As they have the capacity to repay loans, the banking system must change to meet the needs of society.  Perhaps Estonia might consider this issue during its Presidency.<\/p> <p>  On taxation, the committee has already heard me speak about the corporate entities that move to using cheap labour.  The European Union must find a way to tax these companies because they do not drop their prices.  They avail of cheap labour, but the price remains the same.  A company that manufactures runners or sportsgear in County Meath sells a pair of shoes for, say, &euro;200.  It moves its manufacturing base to China and makes the shoes for a fraction of the cost, but it still charges &euro;200 for them.  We must find a way to penalise such companies in order that we can invest in the third countries from which there is migration.  This is something I would like to see happen and this is the where I talk about Estonia's aspirations to have fair competition.  Fair competition can only happen through taxation.  If one moves from a country in which labour is expensive to one in which it is cheap, we must equalise the position through the taxation system.  That is my view of the direction we should take.<\/p> <p>  I believe organised crime is a big issue confronting the Estonian Presidency in the first instance.  It never ceases to amaze me that the military can co-operate across Europe but that police forces do not necessarily co-operate at the same level, with the result that - the ambassador will know this, having lived here - we have organised crime bosses living in Spain but who are directing operations in this country.  We must find a way of working across the European Union to ensure there will be no hiding place for them.  <\/p> <p>  The committee has heard what I have to say on the issue of migration.  During its Presidency I hope Estonia can come up with a methodology to allow us to enable but control economic migration because that is the real issue.  Refugees account for a very small part of the numbers crossing the Mediterranean.  I know that the European Union is doing a lot of work on this issue.<\/p> <p>  I worry when I read the words \"EU-NATO [closeness and] co-operation\".  Ireland is a neutral country.  Any closeness to NATO brings us close to those who have caused the destruction of Syria, Palestine and parts of Iraq and Afghanistan.  We see on television the modern cities in Syria that have been razed to the ground with bombs and bullets supplied by the West.  More horrific is the fact that we no longer have to risk soldiers' lives on the ground; drones can be sent that are managed somewhere in Texas to bomb the hell out of these countries.  Until we stop this from happening, I certainly do not want to see us getting anywhere close to NATO or involved with NATO that believes it is the conscience of the western world.  We really do not want that to happen.<\/p> <p>  I hope to see something to tackle climate change come from Estonia also.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017070500002#L00200","speaker":"1390"},{"type":"speech","time":1499259600,"counter":55,"content":"<p>Her Excellency, the ambassador, Mrs. Kristi Karelsohn, is very welcome.  I thank her for putting forward the plans for Estonia's Presidency of the European Union in the next six months.  As she will be aware, Estonia joined the European Union on 1 May 2004 and has since played a very important role as one of its youngest members.  It has made great strides and a very good contribution.  I wish it success in its Presidency.  I look forward to visiting Tallinn on behalf of the Chairman on Saturday and Sunday, with staff of the committee.  I will represent the committee at the meeting of the Conference of Parliamentary Committees for Union Affairs of Parliaments of the European Union, COSAK.<\/p> <p>  I commend Ryanair for forging links with Estonia.  It is an Irish company which was established by Dr. Ryan many years ago and it is good to see it linking with Estonia in the form of regular direct flights between Dublin and Tallinn.  I know that the ambassador presented her credentials in September 2014 to President Michael D. Higgins in &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in and that she has been very active since in travelling around the country since, including visits to Dundalk and other areas.  I say, \"Well done,\" to her on her initiative in being a very good ambassador here.  As for what she said, the fact that she is putting first the citizens of Europe, instead of the institutions, is very important.  The citizens of Europe, not the institutions, should be at the forefront.  In a sense, one of the difficulties with and one criticism of the European Union is that it has become too distant from the people.  <\/p> <p>  I wish Estonia every success in its Presidency.  It is a great honour to hold the Presidency of the European Union for the first time.  Following Malta's success, Estonia is taking on the responsibility at a very crucial time in the first six months of the real Brexit negotiations.  It will host the leaders' meetings later in the year also.<\/p> <p>  I thank the ambassador for her presence and know that the Chairman has been in touch with her directly.

I have a few questions to ask and comments to make.<\/p> <p>  The ambassador referred to \"an open and innovative European economy.\"  I understand this involves the protection and promotion of the European Union's four freedoms: the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital.  As I am sure the ambassador will know, Brexit poses a real challenge to Ireland in that regard.  It threatens to impose a possible hard border on the island and physically stop these four freedoms.  Will the Estonian Presidency explore these issues separately from the negotiations?  Will Estonia be involved in discussions or talks in that regard?<\/p><p>We are particularly interested in hearing the ambassador's view on the Irish Parliament's call for the North to be given special status within the European Union.  We believe a special status would ensure that the four freedoms are protected on the island.<\/p><p> Another headline in the ambassador's statement was a safe and secure Europe.  Earlier my colleague mentioned our concerns.  I note that the Estonian priority includes an increase in defence expenditure.  Earlier I mentioned to the Minister of State the proposal to spend &euro;1.5 billion on developing European defence co-operation and the EU-NATO partnership.  My party does not support the measure.  I am sure the ambassador is aware that Ireland is a neutral country.  Perhaps it is not as neutral as my party and possibly many people in this country would like it to be.  Successive Irish Governments have eroded our neutrality over the years.  People believe that many of the steps that we have taken within the European Union has eroded our neutrality.  I oppose the militarisation of Europe.  I oppose a military alliance and the creation of an EU standing army.  Can the ambassador convey her Government's view about the creation of an EU standing army?  Does her country support or oppose it?  Does she think an EU standing army is a necessity?  Is Estonia happy with NATO?  Does Estonia believe NATO meet its needs?  Does the ambassador agree that military expenditure should be a national issue rather than an EU one?  I believe military expenditure should come from national budgets rather than EU ones.  <\/p><p> I am conscious that many people in Europe have survived difficult hardships.  Many of us would like the EU to prioritise investment in health care, education, jobs and ways to improve the quality of people's lives.  Therefore, many of us oppose investment to make Europe a fortress.  <\/p><p> Earlier the Minister of State talked about Europe being involved in peacekeeping.  Is Europe involved in peace enforcement?  There is a huge difference between peacekeeping and peace enforcement.  <\/p><p> In terms of digital Europe and the free movement of data, Estonia places a high priority on technology and the technological industry.  Many people view Estonia as leading this sector in the EU.  In fact, I have been told that the only thing that an Estonian citizen cannot do online is get married, divorced or sell one's home.  Estonia is way ahead of us in technological terms and voting is an example.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017070500002#L00400","speaker":"1309","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1499259600,"counter":58,"content":"<p>That is true.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017070500002#M00200","nonspeaker":"H.E.

It means that the provider cannot give faster access to video streaming than Dailymotion on YouTube, for example.  I presume YouTube would provide this service to its parent company Google.  The fine for violating the EU principle of net neutrality is &euro;9,600 in Estonia, which is a fraction of the penalty enshrined in laws in other countries.  Why is the fine so low in a progressive country like Estonia?   Non-net neutrality can cause damage to both freedom of expression and online competition.  I call for the issue to be tackled strongly.  Estonia champions net neutrality.  How does it enforce fines?  <\/p> <p>  The ambassador mentioned an inclusive and sustainable Europe in her opening statement.  This includes modernising rules in order to promote labour mobility and the free movement of persons.  What does the Estonian Government mean by that?  It sounds positive but it could mean the weakening of workers' rights.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the fact that Estonia seeks to secure a more sustainable environment.  Climate change is one of the biggest threats to face the planet.  I hope that the Estonian Presidency will champion green and environmentally friendly initiatives.  Can the ambassador give me more details on the matter?<\/p> <p>  Earlier my colleague touched on the opening up of markets.  It is a positive that people can travel from Dublin to Estonia yet retain the ability to use the same data provider.  Let me outline one of the negatives of being a small country like Ireland.  This morning I heard a radio clip about the availability of cancer drugs.  Small countries like Ireland are squeezed out of the market when it comes to any type of medicinal drugs.  Does the ambassador believe Europe should work together to get a better package particularly for highly expensive life-changing drugs?  The companies that produce these drugs can cut off small counties.  Does the ambassador view such co-operation in Europe as important in the future? <\/p> <p>  The ambassador touched on the subject of migration.  She outlined that Estonia's main priority is to reform the European common asylum system.  I agree with her that it should be reformed.  As I said to the Minister of State, it should be based on solidarity.  We must place the needs of the vulnerable refugees at the heart of the system.  Some countries in eastern Europe have refused the mandatory refugee quota.  All sorts of reasons have been given but their stance is extremely unhelpful.  I am conscious that many of those countries, through their arms industry, have played a role in the conflicts that have erupted in the Middle East and elsewhere.  Those countries get jobs from the industry but they have helped to create killing fields where people have died.  How does Estonia propose to reform the European common asylum system? <\/p> <p>  Previous speakers have mentioned the disconnect between EU institutions and many people across Europe.  Does Estonia see this matter as a priority?  I am interested in hearing Estonia's approach and policies to tackle the problem that it will adopt during its Presidency.  One can see from recent elections that people have turned away from the idea of Europe, which is worrying.  There is a lot wrong with Europe but, conversely, there is many positives.

I will try to address them in categories.  I will start with the final question about support for the EU in Estonia.  This question followed on from some previous questions and comments.  Since joining the EU, and indeed prior to that, Estonia has ranked among the countries with the highest levels of EU support, if not indeed the highest.  Support for NATO, meanwhile, is higher still.  Why is support for the EU so high in Estonia?  This may also answer some of the other questions raised by members.  Estonia is three times smaller than Ireland.  It is very clear to us how much we stand to gain both from working together with European allies and particularly from the Single Market and the opportunities it opens to our companies to export to Europe.  These factors drive how we think about Europe.  They also drive our priorities and what it is that we want to achieve with this EU Presidency.  We are working on efficiency, not only in terms of the digital agenda but also with regard to some of the other matters raised here today, the movement of drugs, for example.  It is vital for a small country and a small market to co-operate with others so as to maximise gain.  <\/p> <p>  I now come to the issue of Brexit.  As was already mentioned, responsibility here lies with the Commission.  We want to keep the whole process around the negotiations under the Commission's lead, with discussions taking place in the General Affairs Council and in the dedicated working groups.  The Estonian Government is, of course, very well-informed about Ireland's special concerns in this matter, particularly with regard to Northern Ireland.  I can confirm that I, for my part, have done everything I can to keep my government informed.  I do not, however, think it wise for the Presidency to start any separate negotiations or engagements with Britain.  In our Presidency of the EU we do of course have a responsibility for the interests of member states, so we will engage very closely with the Irish Government in the future so as to understand its interests and concerns.<\/p> <p>  With regard to digital and data protection, a question arose about fines and net neutrality.  I am certainly aware that Estonia has some of the lowest fines in the Union.  This, however, remains the responsibility of individual member states.  I have just seen official confirmation from Estonia that it is intended to keep the fines as they are.  If we decide that they need to be changed then we will do so.  <\/p> <p>  On the issue of defence co-operation, I am very aware of Irish neutrality and the special concerns it raises for Ireland.  The committee must also understand, however, that we in Estonia are in a very different situation.  We see no need for an overlap in EU and NATO defence responsibilities.  Both organisations have their own defined responsibilities and files in this regard.  The EU could duplicate what NATO is doing, but we are certainly not pushing that EU member states be required to dedicate the same 2% expenditure levels that NATO members currently do.  The EU is a totally different organisation.  We do, however, see a need for strategic co-operation to complement each other's capabilities and competencies.  We see this, as I mentioned earlier, in the area of cyber security, where the two organisations could and should work together.  Other hybrid threats such as terrorism are not of a purely military nature and thus not solely relevant to NATO.  <\/p> <p>  The crucial point with regard to migration is that we find a way to distinguish between different categories of migrant.  We need to work with those entitled to international protection.  I definitely agree that we need solidarity between EU countries on this and the Estonian Presidency will very much focus on getting this solidarity working.  We also have to find ways of tackling the often illegal in-flow of economic migrants.<\/p> <p>  I am not sure if I have left anything out-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017070500002#N00300","nonspeaker":"H.E.

The Simon Communities of Ireland is a network of communities that provide local responses to local needs and issues.  They are based throughout the country in Cork, Dublin, Dundalk, Galway, the midlands, the mid-west, the north west and the south east.  They provide local responses to local issues.  As members of the committee will be aware, the complexity of homelessness is touching every aspect of Irish life.  The greatest impact is being felt by the most vulnerable people in society.  We have provided our full submission to the committee.  I will not go into the detail of the figures in the appendix to the submission because the Chairman has asked us to keep our presentation brief, but members will see that 7,699 people are currently in emergency accommodation.  This is the highest such figure we have ever known.  Among those who are in emergency accommodation are 1,312 families, 2,777 children and 3,150 adults who do not have dependants in their care.  I intend to highlight some of the key aspects of our opening statement.  As officials from Safetynet who have undertaken some of the key research in this area are present at this morning's meeting, I will ask them to set out some of the statistics and details in that regard.<\/p> <p>  There is a complex relationship between homelessness and health.  Multiple health issues and needs can cause homelessness in the first place, but can also be a consequence of being homeless.  We know from our experience throughout the country that the longer people remain homeless, the greater the impact on their overall health and well-being.  The lack of a stable home can cause physical health issues.  People who are homeless are at a much greater risk of developing illnesses than the general population.  A recent study, which my colleagues will talk about, found that 67.8% of participants in a study of the health of homeless people had a chronic physical health diagnosis, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, arthritis, heart disease, epilepsy, tuberculosis, chronic respiratory problems and stomach problems.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017070500002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Niamh Randall"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1499241600,"counter":75,"content":"<p>(Interruptions).<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1499241600,"counter":76,"content":"<p>Does somebody have a mobile phone switched on?

I apologise.<\/p> <p>  The existence of mental health issues can be a reason for people becoming homeless.  Such issues can have a significant impact on people's experiences while they are homeless.  A homeless person's mental health can really deteriorate over the period of time for which he or she is homeless.  Some 58% of those who participated in the study to which I have already referred had at least one mental health condition.<\/p> <p>  There are high levels of problematic drug and alcohol use among the homeless population.  Drug and alcohol use can put people at risk of homelessness and can be caused or exacerbated by traumatic experiences, including homelessness.  We know there is a significant correlation between risky behaviour and housing stability.  The poorer someone's housing type is, the greater the chance that he or she will engage in risky or harmful behaviour.  People who are sleeping rough and those who are in emergency accommodation are more likely to use alcohol and drugs in unsafe ways and to use them in greater quantities.  A health snapshot study that was conducted by the Simon Communities in 2011 found that 50% of homeless people who participated in the study were alcohol users and 31% of them were problematic drug users.<\/p> <p>  We know that people who are homeless can have multiple needs or complex needs.  This means that a couple of issues can happen at the same time.  Physical health issues, mental health issues and problematic drug and alcohol use can exist at the same time.  This can lead to difficulties in accessing services and can make it difficult for people to have their needs met.  We find that people can fall between two stools.  It is often argued that if someone has a mental health issue, it should be dealt with in a mental health setting.  If that person also has a drug and alcohol issue, however, that needs to be dealt with in a drug and alcohol facility.  This means that people's needs are not necessarily met.  As a result, problems can arise when efforts are made to respond effectively to people's needs.  We would certainly recommend that people's needs should all be dealt with at the same time.  Such needs should not be isolated so that they are dealt with individually.<\/p> <p>  People who are homeless encounter many barriers when they try to access health care.  It can be difficult to access services.  As a result of the cutbacks in services we saw during the period of austerity, there are greater waiting lists and longer waiting times.  Some services have been closed, particularly in rural areas.  This means people can have to travel great distances to access services which used to be readily available in their local communities.  We know that people who are homeless often contact health services at a time of crisis.  We need to intervene before a crisis hits.  We need to look at prevention and early intervention.  Other barriers to accessing health services include stigma, restrictive catchment areas, inflexible services, lack of discharge protocols, lack of specialisation in services, lack of case management teams and the dearth of services in rural settings.<\/p> <p>  I would like to speak about possible solutions.  Housing First is critical if we are to address homelessness.  Housing First programmes are internationally recognised as representing best practice in housing people who have experienced long-term homelessness and have complex and multiple needs.  People with mental or physical health issues, including those with dual diagnosis, have complex needs.  There are two key aspects to the Housing First approach - the immediate provision of housing without preconditions, including a requirement for housing readiness, and the provision of open-ended ongoing housing support for as long as is necessary.<\/p> <p>  I will comment specifically on health services.  It is essential to increase access to general practitioner and primary health care services so that the health care needs of people who are homeless can be met and early intervention can be provided to prevent further chronic illness.  The ongoing resourcing of primary care services is critical if we are to ensure interventions in homeless services are provided nationwide where they are required.  Some really good examples of such initiatives are operating in the Simon Communities around the country.  It is also important to look at the resourcing and delivery of step-up and step-down beds for homeless people who are being treated for chronic illness.  We can discuss this further during the question and answer session.<\/p> <p>  It is essential to fill the posts in mental health services to ensure there is nationwide coverage of community mental health teams and, in particular, to ensure there is responsibility and accountability for people who are homeless within catchment areas.  We also need to look at the development of specialist adult teams, as recommended in A Vision for Change and in the national clinical programme for the assessment and management of patients presenting to emergency departments following self-harm.  We need to look at increasing funding for mental health services to 8.24% of the national health budget, as recommended in A Vision for Change.  Trauma-informed practices and counselling services are needed to deal with the traumatic experiences that have led to people becoming homeless and to support people's recovery from homelessness.  Such work should be resourced in social work settings, community and family services and homeless services.  We need to ensure HSE-funded services are upskilled to manage and deal with dual diagnosis.<\/p> <p>  Harm reduction is absolutely essential and must be at the heart of homeless and drug service provision.  The success of harm reduction approaches is vital because there is no conditionality attached to Housing First.  It is really critical that we align harm reduction with the Housing First approach.  The key to doing this is to look at expanding current harm reduction programmes and at what works best in other jurisdictions.  The recent passing of the Bill establishing the State's first medically supervised injecting centre is really welcome.  Immediate implementation is critical so that this legislation can have the greatest impact really quickly.  This will save lives and keep people much healthier for much longer.  We need to ensure there is greater expansion of and access to needle exchange programmes across static, outreach and pharmacy exchange models.<\/p> <p>  Drug treatment and rehabilitation is about ensuring national alcohol and drug services target the specific needs of homeless people who have alcohol-related or drug-related problems, or both, in line with the four-tier model.  Access to aftercare housing is particularly important when people leave treatment.  When people engage in drug treatment, it is a really difficult and challenging programme for them and it is expensive for the State.  If they do not have anywhere to go to follow up on that, it does not make any sense.  We need to ensure aftercare housing with support is provided for people.  Rapid access to treatment is really important.  People often have to wait in homeless services while they are on treatment waiting lists.  Again, this does not make a huge amount of sense.<\/p> <p>  We also need to look at rehabilitation.  There are actions in the Rebuilding Ireland action plan, but there is not enough detail about what this looks like.  How are we going to support homeless people with drug and alcohol issues in the longer term?<\/p><p>On the specific commitments, we need some of the vagueness to be clarified.<br\/><br\/>We also need to look at developing, resourcing and implementing discharge programmes and in-reach services in general hospitals, mental health services and drug treatment services.  Nobody should be discharged back into homelessness, yet that still happens.  We also need to ensure that ring-fenced emergency accommodation options are in place for drug users experiencing homelessness who are detoxing or working towards methadone maintenance where they are trying to abstain from drug and alcohol use.  It does not make sense, when people are dealing with this hugely challenging issue, that they may be in an environment where other people are actively using around them.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>We greatly support the report of the Oireachtas Committee on the Future of Healthcare.  It makes many very important recommendations including the expansion of counselling services in primary care settings, which is significant and could have a huge impact in terms of dealing with some of the trauma associated with the experiences of homelessness.  The proposal to introduce universal access to primary care must continue to be a key priority<b>.<\/b><br\/><br\/><b><\/b>We look forward to the publication of the new national drugs strategy, which we expect in the coming weeks.

I am joined by Dr. Austin O'Carroll and we are here from Safetynet Primary Care.<br\/><br\/>Safetynet Primary Care is a medical charity that aims to deliver the highest possible standards of health care to homeless people and other marginalised groups.  Our network of services includes 20 clinic sites in Dublin, Limerick and Cork providing services to thousands of homeless and vulnerable people each year.  Our direct services delivered in collaboration with the Health Service Executive, HSE, social inclusion and partner organisations, such as our colleagues here from Dublin Simon, include a primary care in-reach team in homeless hostels, a mobile health unit for rough sleepers, clinics for vulnerable migrants and a health and screening unit for vulnerable populations, including the recently relocated asylum seekers from Syria.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>The link between homelessness and poor health is well established.  Ms. Randall pointed out that homeless people have far worse physical and mental health conditions than the housed population.  She pointed out also that poor health can lead to homelessness and that homelessness can lead to poor health.<br\/><br\/>I will draw on two examples from patients Dr. O'Carroll saw earlier this week.  He saw Mary on Monday.  She is a single parent in her 20s.  She has been depressed recently and is not coping with managing household expenses.  She failed one rent payment and is to be evicted this week.  Peter is a young man whose drug addiction has gone out of control in the past three months since he went into a hostel.  He had three overdoses in one week recently and needed to be revived with naloxone each time.<br\/><br\/>Dr. O&rsquo;Carroll and myself conducted and-or analysed significant health surveys of homeless populations from 1997, which was conducted by Tony Holohan, and one we conducted in 2005.  The one in 2013, which I made available to the members, was conducted with the Partnership for Health Equity.  As a result of that significant research, we conclude that over time, through economic bust and boom, homelessness remains an unhealthy state.  Of the 601 homeless people interviewed in Dublin and Limerick in the most recent survey, we found that almost the entire sample had either a diagnosed mental or physical health problem.<br\/><br\/>Ms Randall highlighted some of the important findings, but others are that over half reported a diagnosis of depression and half a sample had both a mental health problem and an addiction problem.  I find it alarming that one third of respondents had self-harmed, three fifths have had suicidal thoughts and one in three reported having attempted suicide.  Compared with the previous studies in 1997 and 2005, the recent study showed that the homeless population had more diagnosed ill health, more were treated with prescribed medication and more reported mental health diagnoses and treatment in 2013.  We believe that is as a result of more services diagnosing disease rather than an actual increase in disease.  Ill health is a constant feature of homelessness.<br\/><br\/>Services have improved.  Medical card coverage has improved.  The level of primary care and emergency department use has increased.  We thought that increasing primary care access would decrease hospital admissions and presentations in hospitals but because there is such a high burden of disease, putting in place more services will just pick up that ill health.  That has resulted in a higher number of onward referrals.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>Ms Randall outlined the findings about addiction.  It, too, has risen steadily over the 17 years to now become polydrug use.  Rates of dangerous drinking have also increased, particularly among women.  Drug and alcohol addiction associated with secondary health problems such as liver disease, dental problems and hepatitis C were also found to be elevated among those populations.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>Recommendations are included, and we concur with the recommendations Ms Randall pointed out, namely, expansion of specialised primary care services; expansion of easy access to methadone treatment in primary care; improved access to appropriate mental health supports, including psychiatry; and the urgent establishment of interventions for homeless people in crisis in line with national suicide prevention guidelines, including a crisis house.  Overall, we found that the health needs of the homeless are great and although much is being done, much more needs to be done, particularly in the area of mental health and addiction.<br\/><br\/>Safetynet Primary Care aims to provide health care for the most vulnerable in our society and to employ the most effective treatment.  For homelessness, the most effective treatment is a move away from the homeless condition.  Our services, therefore, seek to remove ill health, addiction and poor mental health as a barrier to exiting homelessness.  However, that is not simply primary care as usual.  For many very good reasons, typical primary care services are simply inappropriate or inaccessible for many homeless people and other vulnerable groups.  Again, I point to a patient Dr. O&rsquo;Carroll saw yesterday to demonstrate that homeless people with serious health problems often fail to attend the mainstream services for treatment.  Dr. O'Carroll saw Julie, whose right leg was completely swollen from her foot to her groin for the past six weeks.  She has experienced a deep venous clot in the past.  It is highly likely that she has another.  She knows that could fire off, block an artery and cause instant death.  She has been referred to an accident and emergency department twice in the past six weeks but has not gone.<br\/><br\/>Services have to meet people where they are located.  They need to be innovative, appropriate, accessible and, importantly, patient centred and delivered in a coherent and collaborative way aimed at moving the person out of homelessness.  A heath strategy in isolation of housing will not succeed.  One quick fix that would succeed in removing one of the barriers to homeless people's access to care and medication would be to remove prescription charges for homeless people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017070500002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Fiona O'Reilly"},{"type":"speech","time":1499241600,"counter":81,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. O'Reilly.

We brought in regulations to try to improve rented accommodation.  They were welcome at the time.  The purpose of one of the regulations we brought in was to get rid of bedsits.  Did that change in the regulations contribute to more people ending up living on the street?  If the deputations were in charge now, is there anything they would do to change it in any way?  Many of the people who were in bedsits are people who want to live on their own.  The regulations came in and more or less prescribed the minimum space for living accommodation.  The regulations were brought because there were some appalling bedsits that needed to be sorted out.  Is there any half-way house between both that would in any way contribute to improving the situation?<\/p> <p>  The second issue relates to the management of people who have mental health problems.  I came across a case recently involving a person who had perfectly good support from family but the person had health issues.  Basically, it had got to the point where a single carer could not be assigned to the person at any one time.  Two people had to be there all the time.  Carers had been assaulted by the individual and a package was put together by one of the agencies involved.  The cost of the package was &euro;134,000 per annum for that individual.  How do the deputations deal with a difficult situation like that when there are health issues?  This particular person could be in the southern part of the country one day but might turn up in Donegal two days later and end up in hospital.  That is a difficult situation.  How do we manage that?<\/p> <p>  Long ago, mental hospitals were used to deal with these problems.  In many cases, they were used inappropriately.  I came across one particularly difficult case.  In 1956, the Army wrote to the parents of a person and said that if they did not collect their son, the Army would admit him to a mental hospital.  Some 50 years later, the man was still in a mental hospital.  That is one of the saddest cases I have come across.  In fact, he did not really have a mental health problem, although he may have had a depression problem at the time.  I do not want to go back down that road.  The question is how we deal with that difficult situation.<\/p> <p>  We need to consider the whole approach in respect of people who are sleeping on the street.  I remember being outside the Simon Community in Cork one night.  I found eight or ten people trying to get in.  It was 11 p.m.  The hostel has rules and regulations and it was full.  How do we deal with those people when there is an alcohol problem - it is a serious problem - to ensure they are not living on the street at night?  I know many things were done.  It is about the management of all of that.  No matter how much assistance is given, it changes from day to day.  They will change from day to day.  How do we deal with that situation?<\/p> <p>  The homeless issue is one of the major problems we have.  It comes back again to the whole issue of accommodation.  Cork City Council had more than 1,800 single people looking for accommodation.  Do the witnesses find any change by local authorities in the provision of accommodation for single people?  The priority seems to have been that we build accommodation for families but we are not building enough appropriate accommodation for single people.  Do the witnesses believe that we need to fast-track that whole issue to deal with this particular problem?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017070500002#F00200","speaker":"1409"},{"type":"speech","time":1499241600,"counter":85,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their attendance, for the evidence they have given thus far and for the work they are doing.  I imagine it is not easy to find the time to come in.<\/p> <p>  This is something I often think about and it is heart-breaking really.  It relates to children who are sleeping in emergency accommodation, bed-and-breakfast accommodation, hotels or even hubs - wherever they happen to be.  Is there any support available?  Those children are probably the most in need of mental health support but are possibly among the least likely to receive it.  I am keen to hear from the witnesses on this.<\/p> <p>  It must be soul-destroying to live in a hotel but to never be able to bring friends over and so on.  Are there any specific supports available for children?  I do not suggest it is a bed of roses for the parents either, but I am thinking of the children in particular in this situation.  When my daughter was younger, there was a constant stream of her friends in and out of the house and she was in and out of their houses too.  We would regard that as a normal upbringing &ndash; although she might disagree with that.  Anyway, is there anything specifically targeted at children?  We learned recently that the HSE child and adult mental health services units are running at approximately 50% or 53% of what they should be in terms of the staff recommended in A Vision for Change.  Are there any targeted resources for that group?<\/p> <p>  The next question is probably for both groups.  It relates to the best place.  Dr. O'Reilly made the point that the services need to meet people where they are.  I know there are small groups working in this way, but what is the national picture?  Let us consider that statement from Dr. O'Reilly.  She said the services need to meet people where they are.  Are the services meeting people where they are?  In the case of people who are homeless at the moment, are the services not meeting them where they are?  Is there a national policy in this regard?  Are staff members designated to ensure that the services meet them?  Are we talking about a number of specific pilot programmes in urban areas?  Ms Randall referenced the urban-rural split in services.  Is the picture uniform throughout the country?<\/p><p>Related to that, there are people who are not necessarily presenting as homeless and who are living in cars or even tents along the canals in Dublin.  They may not necessarily be engaging with the homeless services.  Is there that level of outreach for people who are not using homeless services but who are providing such accommodation for themselves, even though it might involve sleeping in a tent or a car?<\/p><p> During the debate about supervised injecting centres, we got distracted into thinking that it was only about the centres.  While the provision of these centres is important, it is a small part of a much bigger picture.  What are the witnesses&rsquo; views on the bigger picture and what supports should be in place?  These centres will be fighting a losing battle if there are no support services for people.  What is the national picture on this and the urban-rural split on this?<\/p><p> Senator Colm Burke raised the issue of bedsits.  There were good reasons that regulations for bedsits were introduced, namely, substandard communal facilities such as shared bathrooms.  I would not necessarily agree the introduction of these regulations was a massive contributing factor to homelessness, but it was a factor.  There is talk now about perhaps revisiting those regulations.  For me, that sets off alarm bells because many bedsits were closed because they were unsuitable.  Would the witnesses see the return of bedsits and accommodation of that sort as a retrograde or progressive step?  There is obviously a need for single people to have accommodation.  However, having been in many bedsits as a student, I am not necessarily convinced that living in a single self-contained room is ideal for a person with mental health issues or someone who has experienced homelessness.  What are the witnesses' views on that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017070500002#F00300","speaker":"1302","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1499241600,"counter":87,"content":"<p>Senator Dolan asked what are the issues beyond health.  We need to ensure that there is an effective cross-departmental response to homelessness and housing issues.  That means the Department of Social Protection taking action on income adequacy and rent supplement.  It means education, training and employment opportunities.  Once people move out of homelessness, it is important that they have meaningful occupations and an opportunity to engage in further training and employment.  Housing is key because the link between health and housing is important.  Ensuring that people have a stable housing environment is critical.  If they have a stable environment, people, without prompting, will start looking at their drug and alcohol issues, reducing their levels of use and their mental health issues can become much more stable.  We must ensure there is that support in housing because sometimes people might have a trigger, such as a trauma, and we might need to intensify that support in housing.  It is critical that we have an open-ended, flexible response to support people.  Income adequacy, a sense of tenancy security and stability, and ensuring that people have opportunities, such as those relating to education, training and employment, are key.<\/p> <p>  On the query about the ratio of cause and consequence, I have not come across anything that can definitively argue that.  We often see people coming to our services after several things have happened to them.  People do not become homeless and then end up in the Simon Community&rsquo;s services.  People often rely on friends and family for support.  There is hidden homelessness whereby people are sleeping on floors and move around.  When it comes to using services, it is difficult to work out what was the precipitating factor.  The key point is prevention and early intervention.  If we can intervene when people have health, drug and alcohol, or housing issues, we can intervene to stop this spiralling out of control.<\/p> <p>  Senator Colm Burke raised the issue of bedsits.  We really welcomed the decision to look at this regulation.  People were living in really awful circumstances, with poor quality accommodation and grown adults sharing facilities.  There were also significant issues with health and safety, as well as a range of other matters.  At this point, the real issue is the provision of social housing.  The reason we are in this situation is because the State stopped building and providing social housing.  We need to be clear that social housing provision is the solution.  The quick fix to this is looking at vacant property throughout the country.  There are approximately 200,000 vacant homes in Ireland and there should be mechanisms to ensure that they can be brought up to speed.  We are awaiting the publication of the vacant homes strategy.  It was due to be published before the recent Fine Gael leadership contest.  We are now waiting for the new Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, to publish it.  It would be a really quick fix because these are low-hanging fruit due to the length of time it takes to build housing units.  We need to be clear that this is the solution.  My understanding is that there are approximately 1,000 bedsits remaining.  Of those, between 50% and 60% would have fire and health and safety issues in any event.  They would not be appropriate settings.  We also need to look at quality of life for people.  The last thing we need is people with mental health issues and ongoing pressures in their life living in tiny isolated places with poor light and space.  It is not the way to go from our point of view.<\/p> <p>  We must look at diversity in housing provision.  Up to 44% of those on the social housing waiting list are single people.  Building three-bedroomed semi-detached houses around the country is not the way to go.  We need to look at building a range of different types of accommodation and housing estates which can provide for people at different stages of their lives.  Perhaps what we need to encourage is more residential mobility than we have.  Often what happens is that people buy a home and it is a home for life.  Maybe we need to look at opportunities for mobility.  People often want to stay in their communities.  If one had the opportunity to move into a smaller accommodation type within one&rsquo;s community, more people might take up those particular options.  We must look at diversifying what we are providing.  We need to do it quickly.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Louise O'Reilly referred to children&rsquo;s experience of homelessness.  We know from research that children who experience housing instability and homelessness have a greater chance of experiencing homelessness in adulthood.  We know this damage is being done.  We are very much on the back foot on this issue.  Additional supports have been provided in some of the bed and breakfast and hotel accommodation settings.  One of the key issues is actually keeping children in school.  Schools and teachers play an important role in this regard.  One of the important developments was supports around transport to ensure that children could actually get to school.  Some families were taking two or three buses to get their children to school because the setting they were in was so far away from the school.  Having continuity and routine in school attendance is important.  Again, the solution is moving people out of emergency accommodation quickly.  It is about housing supply and, in particular, affordable housing supply.<\/p> <p>  Hidden homelessness is a really challenging issue.  We know the number of people who are currently in emergency accommodation.  We do not know the number of people who are struggling but we can guess.  Figures from the CSO on overcrowding show that the number of people sharing housing has grown when the family size has actually reduced.  We know there are increased amounts of overcrowding with people doubling and tripling up.  Again, prevention is the key.  If we can support people when we know they are at risk and vulnerable, that is important.  Ensuring that there is enough information, advice and awareness in order that we can intervene quickly is key.<\/p><p>Medically supervised injecting centres are only one piece.  They are a really significant and important development from a harm reduction and health promotion point of view.  They are part of a suite of measures to respond effectively to drug and alcohol issues.  We need a plethora of harm reduction services.  We need naloxone and we need to look more progressively at heroin and opiate prescription and a range of other things.  We need to look at criminalisation.  We need to look at how we approach these issues, particularly at a time when people are making such changes internationally.  We can learn from international experience but we need to be increasing beds.  We need residential and detox beds.  We need to ensure there are clear supports and referral pathways within the medically supervised injecting centres in order that if people make contact, especially people who are homeless, there is a real opportunity to make contact with people in a particular setting like that and link people in with further services and support.  I will invite some of my colleagues in on some of those more practical issues and also the regional issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017070500002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Niamh Randall","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1499241600,"counter":89,"content":"<p>I work with Dublin Simon Community.  For the past 15 years I have worked with homeless clients, first with the HSE and then with Dublin Simon Community for the past ten years.  Senator Dolan asked about causes and consequences.  While I do not have empirical evidence to support this, over the past 15 years, 90% to 95% of adults I have seen come from a background of severe social deprivation, such as poverty, not having access to education or not having access to health care.  I have seen people who became homeless at the age of 13.  There are many social causes, such as poverty and social exclusion.  If a person enters homelessness at 13 years of age, by the time the person reaches 18, he or she already has lots of other consequences that add trauma to the original reason for becoming homeless.  Looking at the social dimensions of health for the homeless population is key.<\/p> <p>  The issue of bedsits was raised.  One's environment is extremely important in terms of one's physical, mental and social health.  I lived in a bedsit when I moved to Dublin first and it was appalling.  I could afford to live in a very expensive bedsit but it was appalling.  I did not want to live there so I do not expect that homeless people should have to live there either.  That adds to the social exclusion.  I do not think returning to bedsits is appropriate at all.  Homeless people are entitled to the same as the rest of us in terms of the type of accommodation we have.<\/p> <p>  Senator Dolan asked about health services and how the system works.  Dublin Simon at Usher's Island has 64 beds.  Those 64 beds are there as a consequence of trying to plug the gaps that have existed in addiction and health services for the homeless population.  In 2004, we started off with eight detox beds and we had 12 recovery or rehab beds.  Since then we have expanded to meet need and we could expand even further.  We have plans in for a 100-bed unit on that site.  It is a medical facility for detox and recovery.  We have a HIV unit for homeless people who are living with blood borne viruses such as HIV or hepatitis C.  We only exist because we take 64 people off the street every night.  If those 64 people did not have access to that service, they would be on the street or they would be dead.  That is the reality of the situation.<\/p> <p>  Phase one of our plans for Usher's Island is planning permission for 70 beds.  Phase two will be an additional 30 beds.  We will expand what we currently do and work with other colleagues in the sector such as SafetyNet and St. James's Hospital to look at facilities such as a step-up, step-down unit.  We are working with Merchant's Quay to set up a rapid access detox unit.  It is something that has not happened in Ireland to date.  There are examples of variations of it in Scotland in Turning Point and in City Roads in London.  It is to address the issue that has been raised already of people who are not able to access methadone or addiction treatment centres because their lives are quite chaotic on the street.  They are not even able to get to a methadone clinic.  The idea is to initiate the methadone on the site or stabilise the person.  It comes back to the question of how we meet people where they are at.  It is something that Deputy O'Reilly mentioned.  With rapid access as an example, we meet people where they are.  We do not know what will come through the door.  We have to see the person and their myriad issues, whether those are physical health, mental health, addiction issues or other social issues.  We have to take them as they come through the door and try to deal with it.  It takes a lot of innovation and flexibility.  That is what is probably not in the mainstream - the level of flexibility to adapt to what homeless people need.  There are other groups who would also experience that exclusion or lack of access to services.  There is not an equality of access to health services for people who are marginalised or socially excluded.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017070500002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Majella Darcy"},{"type":"speech","time":1499241600,"counter":90,"content":"<p>I would like some clarification.

Senator Dolan raised the issue of cause and consequence.  I agree with Ms Darcy.  To clarify, I work as a GP in inner city Dublin, but I have also worked in many homeless hostels since 2002.  I see some of my patients in my surgery, in homeless services a few months later and back in my surgery a few months on again.  As Ms Darcy stated, this is because poverty is the key cause of homelessness.<\/p> <p>  The majority of people who end up homeless do so because of poverty, but the mechanisms of how they end up there are complex.  When I first started, there were two main mechanisms.  Drug addiction played a large part.  It is endemic in poverty and intrinsically associated with it.  Mr. Alastair Storey refers to how there is a cliff at the edge of poverty, namely, homelessness.  Many people end up in homelessness because of drug addiction.  The dilemma then is that their addictions get worse.  The same is the case with alcoholism, which was the classic stereotype of a homeless person in the 1990s.  It is the same mechanism.  It was probably more spread throughout social society than just in poverty, but it was more concentrated in the latter.<\/p> <p>  Since the recession, drug addiction has worsened in the inner city, which is affecting the homelessness figures, and alcoholism is re-emerging.  We see many people involved in polysubstance abuse - drink and drugs.  It is a major problem because it is very difficult to treat such people.  While it is not easy to treat either on its own, having the two together makes it incredibly complex.<\/p> <p>  Everyone agrees that the main issue in recent times has been economic homelessness.  It is worsening.  I saw two people this week, one on Monday and one yesterday, who had become homeless.  In recent weeks, I have seen more and more patients who have become homeless because of poverty.  I referred to \"economic\".  As with the person whom I saw on Monday, people can become stressed out because of, for example, the pressure of being a single parent or managing in the social welfare system.  They might miss one rental payment.  Landlords now have no sympathy and, because the market is so intense, people are out if they miss a rental payment.  The situation is complex, but the real issue is poverty.<\/p> <p>  Another issue is a self-created one, namely, the lack of social housing, which Ms Darcy discussed.  Ireland has 7% social housing.  In the Netherlands, the figure is 33%.  That is a significant difference.  As we all know, our social housing stock has shot down since the 1980s.  I will revert to the question of social housing when we discuss the bedsit issue, but Dr. O'Reilly will answer some of the other queries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017070500002#J00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Austin O'Carroll"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1499241600,"counter":103,"content":"<p>Senator Dolan referred to the housing issue.  Housing and health are linked, but he asked what else was linked.  The whole gamut of social determinants of poor health - education, employment and networks - are linked.  As such, it is important that there be cross-sectoral collaboration to tackle health issues.  It cannot be done through health policy alone.<\/p> <p>  The Senator also asked about how good co-ordinated responses were.  They are improving.  One of our main reasons for being is to co-ordinate responses among health organisations that are working with homeless people in order that there is a joint medical record and web-based database that those organisations can access to see whether, for example, Johnny in Merchants Quay can be seen today and whether Dr. O'Carroll can see him in the Granby Centre tomorrow.  That is good co-ordination, but there is not enough overall and it could be improved, particularly in mainstream services.<\/p> <p>  Deputy O'Reilly rightly stated that services should be delivered at the point of contact with homeless people.  Were that a major national policy, it would be helpful.  There are good examples and Dr. O'Carroll might address shared care and trying to get the new hepatitis C treatments out to people who would not otherwise receive them because they are not a hospital-going population.  Hepatitis C treatment has to be initiated by consultants.  Our population will not be able to access those treatments unless we think creatively.  To that end, we are working on a shared care model with Dr. Jack Lambert.  Running outpatient departments, OPDs, for homeless people is a waste of money because so many do not attend.  Maybe we should stop expecting them to attend and bring the outpatient services to where they are.  That would be a mind shift for mainstream services, but it is required and we should highlight it in policy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017070500002#J00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Fiona O'Reilly"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1499241600,"counter":104,"content":"<p>I will clarify the example.

This is a common problem with homelessness.  For example, there is a service in Dublin called a wet hostel.  The issue of people staying out all day drinking alcohol only to return to their hostel too late was mentioned.

It caters for chronic alcoholics who would otherwise be out on the streets.<\/p> <p>  I will provide an example of the complexity involved.

It is a complex issue which requires a co-ordinated response.  In some respects, there has been much innovation, much of which has come from within the sector through Safetynet Primary Care and the adult homeless team in Cork.  We have examples and templates that work, but we just do not have enough of them.  For example, the adult homeless integrated team is part of the HSE's adult homeless support network within the main hostels in Cork.  There is a link with the adult addiction services through working with the Cork local drugs and alcohol task force.  The key point is that there are many people in the same area around the same table, which means that they are communicating and working together.  One is adapting to circumstances as people present.<br\/><br\/>We have found that accessibility is key, particularly in achieving positive health impacts.  The reason we set up in the first place around these services was people were not going to the emergency services until it was too late.  Sometimes they went <i>in extremis<\/i>and sometimes they were not in a position to wait and created problems in emergency departments and so forth.  Obviously, the services are under enough pressure as it is.  The idea, therefore, was to bring the services to them and make them easily accessible.  That is what works.  Dr. O'Carroll referred to hepatitis C screening and so forth.  It is about that adaptability in the wider health service to become more of a part of supporting such initiatives because they work.  It is more cost effective in the longer run.  We also operate these systems in Cork in managing people.  One knows that they are not going to give up drink, but one tries to manage their drinking and keep them and everybody else safe.  The key to doing that is understanding the nature of the issues and then finding a response that will meet the particular needs identified.  In many cases, we are not dealing with homogenous groups.  People are individuals and their needs are individual; therefore, the system must be able to adapt to circumstances.  It is about people; one cannot separate their mental health, polydrug use and so forth.  Dealing with these issues has become far more complex.<br\/><br\/>There is another issue which is related to harm reduction.  There is no point in telling somebody not to do something if one does not offer an alternative.  Part of that alternative is activity programmes, for example, where somebody expresses an interest.  If we can intervene with two hours or a full day of activity without somebody drinking or using, that is a positive step and opens up opportunities for the future.  A similar example is moving people along a continuum of access to education, training and work.  As I said, this is a complex issue and everybody has a role to play.  We have direct links with employers to get people into employment, work programmes, work placements and so forth, all of which work.<br\/><br\/>There is also the provision of aftercare services and supports.  The difficulty we find is that we are providing many of these services and supports, but we are not getting any support for them.  As they are not funded, we must fundraise to provide these essential services in the continuum of care provision and support for people with mental health issues, addictions and so forth.  As we know that they work, there is an opportunity to deal with these issues.  It is important when considering these matters that we look at what works effectively and then adapt the programmes to suit these needs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017070500002#K00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aaron O'Connell"},{"type":"speech","time":1499241600,"counter":111,"content":"<p>Mr. O'Connell says he is fundraising to connect with and move people on.

One must look at this issue in terms of being able to solve the problem.  If we want to support people to move out of homelessness, one of the key factors is financial stability and people being able to support themselves, as Dr. O'Carroll mentioned.  Getting people back to work is part of it.  As some are nowhere near that stage, one must work at the different stages where the people are and respond accordingly.  If we can do that and support the transition programmes mentioned, we will be giving people the capacity to support themselves in the long run.  These things work.<\/p> <p>  Senator Colm Burke mentioned the issue of over-capacity in Cork.  When there are not enough beds and too many people with complex issues looking for beds, one ends up with people on the streets.  That is the reality.  The answer is the prioritisation of people who are in homeless services for move-on accommodation.  However, there is a dearth of accommodation.  There has been some movement, but demand is outstripping supply and, in the case of move-on accommodation, we are running to stand still, effectively.  The only way we can deal with this is through the provision of social housing.  We talk about bedsits and the like, but we are reacting to events.  We already had those problems and decided to move away from them.  We must plan our response, as these things take time.  Ms Randall mentioned the low hanging fruit.  If we can bring what is out there back into play quickly, that is one way of dealing with it, but in the long run we must deal with this issue comprehensively.<\/p> <p>  With regard to lifelong adaptable housing, if people are living in their own areas, those communities are strong.  If somebody moves in terms of life changes, he or she should be able to move within these areas.  New builds must incorporate lifelong adaptable housing in order that people can move up and down, depending on their life cycle.  We must think this through comprehensively.  As Dr. O'Carroll mentioned, many of the people with whom we work are single and the vast majority come from areas of high social deprivation.  We must deal with the issues of poverty, income and housing.  Some 7% of housing is social housing.  We need at least 20% to make the system work.  That would help immeasurably to recalibrate spiralling rents and so forth.  As one has a huge impact on the other, we must connect the dots.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017070500002#K01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aaron O'Connell"},{"type":"speech","time":1499241600,"counter":117,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Connell.

I echo what Ms Darcy and Dr. O'Carroll said about poverty being the main cause of homelessness.  In rural areas outside the urban centres the big issue is access to services.  Dr. O'Carroll spoke about people experiencing drug or alcohol addiction and it being a cause of homelessness.  That is a great deal more manageable if someone has means.  If he or she is outside an urban centre, he or she might not have access to services.  There might be nothing in the local area and the person concerned might not be able to afford to use public transport.  He or she probably does not have access to a car.  How is he or she to get to a GP, a hospital, the emergency department or psychiatric services unless he or she calls an ambulance?  It quickly turns into a revolving door.<\/p> <p>  The other piece that continues to arise is the idea of fundraising for services that should available in the mainstream.  Homeless services are available because there are gaps in the mainstream.  In an ideal society homeless services should not be available, yet we have seen them expand exponentially in recent years to meet demand.<\/p><p>They are viewed as a legitimate response to people's health and housing needs.  We are seeing an increase in the provision of emergency accommodation as opposed to the building of social housing.  I echo the point made by previous speakers that the State needs to build social housing.<\/p><p> The people who engage with homeless services have complex needs and are dealing with multiple issues at the same time.  Not only are they physically or mentally unwell they also do not have a home or access to paperwork, do not know where their belongings are and do not feel safe.  All of these factors compound the problem and make it more difficult for them to visit a general practitioner. <\/p><p> In terms of inter-agency working, there is no cohesive strategy between the health and housing areas.  They are entirely separate, as is clear from the way in which services are commissioned and procured.  Even if we wanted to offer a solution that integrated health, housing and homelessness responses, the problem is that one speaks to the Health Service Executive one day and the local authority the next.  Clearer mechanisms are needed to get everyone into the same room to find a way to navigate the issue.  While there is certainly a will to do this and everybody is trying very hard, mechanisms are required to achieve this outcome.  This filters down to the delivery of front-line services.  People with multiple needs engage with multiple services.  For example, a person will have a general practitioner and may have one consultant for a physical health need and another for a mental health need.  He or she will also work with someone in homelessness services.  Trying to bring all of these people together to establish good and effective case management systems to identify a cohesive strategy that will work for the homeless person and get him or her out of homeless services quickly can be complicated and difficult.<\/p><p> If services apply certain criteria and allocate specific resources using these criteria, one finds, for example, that if Ms Darcy has different criteria, there is a gap between the services provided and Ms Darcy's needs.  Everyone involved can leave the room believing he or she has done his or her job because he or she has found he or she could not do anything for Ms Darcy within his or her remit.  As a result, Ms Darcy does not get a response when the response must always be built around the homeless person.<\/p><p> As Mr. O'Connell stated, there are many solutions available and a great deal of good work is being done.  The issue is one of capturing this good work, pulling it together and commissioning services in a way that one can respond rapidly.  Housing First is an example of how to get homeless and health services working together and directed at the individual.  The services also stay with individuals, which means that they do not have one case worker one day and another the following day because they are moved between one service and another.  Instead, they have one case worker who knows them, knows their plan, works for them and co-ordinates the work of the health professionals with whom they are also engaged.  It would be fantastic if this approach were used more widely alongside social care.<\/p><p> The rural issue must also be acknowledged.  There is a dearth of services in rural areas.  People refer to the large amount of vacant housing in rural areas.  These areas do not have services and public transport and are not, therefore, an appropriate solution for many people who have been in homeless services for a long time and need a significant input from mainstream and voluntary organisations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017070500002#K01200","nonspeaker":"Ms Emma Dolan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1499241600,"counter":120,"content":"<p>I thank the delegates for appearing before the committee.

Thankfully, homelessness is not a major issue in Cork South-West, the constituency I represent.  However, the problem is hidden to some extent because if it were not for the large number of households in which three or four generations of one family are living, many more people would be homeless.  This overcrowding creates problems of its own, including significant mental health issues.

Unfortunately, the position has become more challenging and difficult with the passage of time.  We all encounter at the coalface the social issues that emerge daily, record the extent to which we are capable of addressing them and ask whether we are winning or losing the battle.  Unfortunately, as we come under more and more pressure, we are sliding and I believe losing the battle, but that is not a reflection on the services provided by the Simon Communities of Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Housing is the kernel of many of our current problems which date back to a change in housing policy introduced approximately 20 years ago.  I do not know the reason for this change or from where the wisdom for it came because it was not a wise decision.  I made myself very unpopular at local level by slating this change in policy and at the time I predicted what has since come to pass.  I refer to the decision to shift responsibility for providing houses from local authorities to what are known as approved housing bodies.  These bodies were supposed to be the answer to everything, but they could not and never will be the answer to everything.  The answer is for local authorities to start building quality houses again.  <\/p> <p>  We also started to build duplex houses, which involves building homes on top of each other.  I remember having an argument one night about this practice.  In some cases, four houses are built on top of each other and the front door of some houses is located under an outside stairwell.  Everybody likes to have a hall door because it gives people dignity and self-respect and also shows respect for them.  Parity of esteem comes with what is around a person.  I could not believe the architecture of some of the housing schemes built.  People who were suffering from social deprivation were placed in this type of setting which made matters even worse.  The position is appalling.  I could go on a rant for at least two hours about it, but I promise the Chairman that I will not do so. <\/p> <p>  A large number of people are affected by the issues we are discussing, whereas previously only a small number fell off the edge.  I cite the example of a young girl living in a socially deprived area in a household in which other members of the family may be engaged in substance abuse.  If she becomes pregnant at 15 or 16 years, the cycle will start all over again, without her ever having had a chance to be a child, in the first instance, or to raise a family because she has no experience, no one to advise her and no support in the household.  The family unit is absent from this scenario which causes multiple problems.<\/p> <p>  Sheltered housing is needed for people who are at the bottom of this scale because the alternatives are sleeping rough and night shelters.  Sheltered housing will work, but we have a long way to go before we will have even provided general housing.  Sheltered housing is the answer because it involves supervision and medical services can be laid on.  There is also someone available who will inform a person about what will be done for him or her. <\/p> <p>  In recent times I have seen a considerable number of reformed alcohol and drug addicts, many more than one would have seen years ago.  This is a great achievement and I compliment those who have been involved in this area.  The cycle continues when depression occurs and leads to substance abuse and homelessness. <\/p> <p>  Local authorities must take much more seriously their responsibility to provide quality housing and in respect of what goes on in some houses.  There is no sense in having some poor family eventually being allocated a local authority house only to find they are living next door to a dysfunctional family who trade in drugs and have people coming and going on at all hours of the night.  How can we expect a family who are already under pressure to survive in that environment?  Everyone tends to be dragged down in such circumstances. <\/p> <p>  I am not afraid to criticise the Government and have done so from the inside and outside for many years.<\/p><p> Unless we deal with the housing situation in a serious manner, in the shortest possible time, we will have further problems.  In three, four or five years' time it will be worse.  We can throw our hands up and ask what is the cause?  The cause is simple.  There is no accommodation.  We have a bigger population than we had; it is almost double what it was in the 1950s.  We cannot presume that we can manage in the same old way, in particular in off-loading responsibilities to other bodies and agencies when the State should deal with those requirements itself.  Mine is a commentary, I am not asking questions.  I have been dealing with this issue for so many years that I get depressed myself from time to time.  I am sure the Chairman would not want me to get depressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017070500002#L00300","speaker":"1322","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1499241600,"counter":123,"content":"<p>Certainly not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017070500002#M00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1499241600,"counter":124,"content":"<p>Thank you.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017070500002#M00300","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1499241600,"counter":125,"content":"<p>At least the Deputy's depression is not affecting his tongue.  I am sorry that I have been in and out of this meeting but I had other things on this morning.  I know  the witnesses were looking for a pharmacist and I might send in my CV.  A number of us very much supported the injection centres.  I worked in drug addition in the midlands 12 years ago.  I see the need for a bespoke, tailored approach to deal with people who have addiction issues.  As Deputy Durkan said, this all starts in a person's home and the circumstances in which he or she is brought up.  One of my big concerns is the effect of living in hotel rooms on small children.  This would be grand if they were there for three or six months.  If they were four years of age, they might think they were on holidays, although I know that being in a hotel room with children for more than 24 hours proves it is a very restricted environment.  There is an idea that children do not know.  Children know well what is happening.  They are fully aware that their classmate is living in a house with a door while they are in a hotel and this is because mammy, daddy or whoever has fallen on hard circumstances.  I am not a psychologist, but I can imagine that has a detrimental effect on their psyche and how they see society and their aspirations for their own lives.<\/p> <p>  It should not be like a school report card where if someone makes the right choices in life, there is a prize at the end.  People can make the wrong choice that leads them down the wrong path of alcohol abuse or violence in the home or another form of abuse, but then sometimes these things are thrown up at people.  As Deputy Durkan pointed it out, it could be that the wrong lad moved in next door or someone just happened to kick a ball with the wrong lad in the park.  One cannot control who one's children are friendly with when they are six or seven years of age.  It is not always bad choices.  It is not about punishments.  It is necessary to provide bespoke supports for each individual case.  There is not a one-size fits all model here.<\/p> <p>  We need to move away from the idea of drug dependence and it being a bad thing.  It is a health issue.  We need to educate children about what happens if one goes down this route and to try to tackle it before it gets out of hand.  I cannot imagine what it would be like for children and teenagers living in substandard accommodation and growing up in that environment.  Whatever it would be like in a hotel room with a four year old or a six year old, I cannot imagine what it would be like with a 12 year old nor can I imagine what it would be like to explain it to a 12 year old or for the parent to stop this 12 year old hating him or her, even though the situation is probably not his or her fault.<\/p> <p>  I commend the Simon Communities on their work.  The witnesses will see many of us are on the same page.  I recognise it is not as simple as putting everyone on a bus and sending them to a ghost estate, doing it up for them and giving them a bus pass to get to wherever.  Removing people from Dublin city and putting them in towns outside the city where they have to travel to the city for their drug treatment is totally unacceptable.  One cannot have that as it does not work.  I know from my role as a community pharmacist, there is no quantitative value that can be put on the connection between a community pharmacist and the person suffering from addition.  In my husband's case, if someone does not turn up for their methadone, he drives to their house that evening on the way home to see that they are alive.  Pharmacists do not go on about this but we make the call, we go down and check to see the children are all right, did the individual get their methadone.  One cannot replicate that on a mass basis.  It is good value.  I have spoken about this before.  I think it is one-eighth of the cost to provide methadone services in the community within the group setting.  It does not have to be a pharmacist, it can be a GP, but that connection between people suffering in these ways and a health care professional who understands them and respects them as a human being, who understands that this is something that has just happened in their lives and tries to support them and their families to get out of it.  It has to be very targeted towards the individual.  If one looks at the economics of it, and one wanted to be so cold as to look at it as a money saving exercise, the State will get its money back in spades and will end up with a better society.

Some are specific and some are general.  Some months ago, when Professor Gerard Bury appeared before the committee to deal with the injecting sites issue, he spoke of people being condemned to remain on methadone for life.  It seemed there was no system for trying to get people off methadone and that they would be condemned to a methadone life.  Will the witnesses comment on that?<\/p> <p>  Ms Darcy spoke of the barriers to health care specifically regarding prescription charge.  Safetynet is developing services to provide care for those with street health problems but my impression is that the health service is generally very fragmented and there is no co-ordination between services.  The witnesses mentioned that if someone has a mental health problem, it is a mental health issue and if one has an addition problem, it is an addiction issue, and there is very little co-ordination between the two.  There must also be a lack of co-ordination in general GP health services.  Can the witnesses comment if there is a need for a dedicated health service for people who are homeless and have dual or even triple diagnoses?  Is there enough support or co-ordination between the Departments of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government and Health?  Senator Dolan referred to the social determinants of health which spans the Departments of Education and Skills, Transport, Tourism and Sport and Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  Is a co-ordinated, dedicated unit necessary within the Department of Health which would go across multiple Departments.<\/p> <p>  If one can cut the number of people entering homelessness, one can start solving the problems.  On previous occasions, this committee has heard evidence from people coming out of direct provision, or prison into homelessness or being discharged from hospital and going back into homelessness.  There do not seem to be supports available to help them stay off the streets.<\/p> <p>  Housing First gives a person a house first and wraps the services around them whereas in Usher's Island, the strategy is one of detoxing and rehabilitating and supplying services without supplying the home.

Deputy O'Connell raised the issue of methadone.  I totally agree with what she said about the community pharmacist being that connection or human relationship with people who have an addiction and the fact that it is a very cost-effective treatment.  The phrase \"condemned to a life on methadone\" was used.  I am condemned to a life on Eltroxin because I am slightly hypothyroid.  That means I have to take a tablet every day for the rest of my life.  Is it a problem?  No, because the manner in which it is handled is not one that is treated with stigma and mistrust.  I do not have to go to a centre where I meet people who would increase my likelihood, if I had an addiction, of falling back into the habit.  It is very user-friendly.  It does not stop me going on holidays or anything like that.  People may not feel they are condemned to a life on methadone if the manner in which treatment services provide methadone were a lot more user-friendly.  Obviously, that is suitable and works very effectively in primary care.  Diabetics are treated in primary care.  Approximately 10% of GPs overall can and do provide methadone as level one GPs.  That is a consequence of some illnesses being stigmatised in our community and being criminalised rather than being treated as a health condition.  That is something that can be done by the Department of Health.  A new GP contract is coming up.  One could ask why methadone is not one of the basic services GPs offer to their patients.  Why does a patient have to go to his or her GP for a sore throat and then go to an addiction centre for methadone?  Level one treatment for methadone is based on a three-hour, free online course that provides certification.  In terms of homelessness, people on waiting lists have died waiting for methadone.  That is just unacceptable in this day and age.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017070500002#N00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Fiona O'Reilly"},{"type":"speech","time":1499241600,"counter":129,"content":"<p>I completely agree with the point about someone being condemned to a life on methadone.  It is an umbrella term that suggests dirty, bad people.  I have seen people for years that have functioning lives who are down to 10 ml to 15 ml of methadone maintenance.  One could probably argue that they might not need it at all but it is a crutch and support.  I totally agree there is no reason to channel people and stigmatise them by allocating them to a particular GP in a particular area where perhaps they may meet people from their past or, statistically, they are more likely to meet somebody involved in that habit.  It is really important people do not feel they are stigmatised or that they are different.  It is almost as if there is nearly no acknowledgement that they have come so far from the needle in their arm to the 10 ml of methadone and that they are in the same category.  I do not say that the person using the needle in the arm is in a different category but I fully agree that we must move away from calling people addicts and saying they have to go down a certain channel, and if they are not, they go down a different channel.  We must deal with addiction in the same way as we deal with hypothyroidism or whatever else one might have.  It is due to ignorance.<\/p> <p>  That said, we have come a long way.  We came a long way in this committee with the injection centres and with people's views on housing.  With the help of the Department, we can remove some of the stigma from people.

In a way, it is not a choice at all when all one's friends are on drugs, one does the same.  In a way we need to get away from the idea of bad choice because the addiction is created by poverty.  That is the causation.<\/p> <p>  I agree we have come a long way, but I wish to address two issues, one is methadone and the other is the provision of primary care services to the homeless.  There is still a problem down the country.  We have many people coming to us who become homeless specifically to get onto methadone.  We have started over 500 people in the last four years on methadone through our homeless services, where we treat them in the community.  A significant proportion of them have come up from the country.  It relates to Ms Dolan's point about the lack of services down the country.  I see that all the time.<\/p> <p>  I will outline two stories.  One story turned out really well.  It is about one of those people on the canal who was in a tent.  The person had been homeless for over a year.  We started them on methadone and within six weeks they had stopped living in the tent, moved into accommodation and stopped using heroin.  That was fantastic.  The other story is about a young girl who came up from the midlands.  She was a mother who came up to us to get onto methadone because she could not get it in her local area.  She went to stay in a hostel, got onto methadone with us and did very well.  She moved back to her home but came up to us for her prescription, which was crazy.  When she came up she had to stay in a hostel and one night she was violently assaulted there and ended up back on the streets because of the depression relating to the assault and died three weeks later from an overdose.  If she had got treated down the country she would not be dead.<\/p> <p>  We have had two people die on our waiting list for methadone in the past six months.  People do not realise it but more people die from drug-related deaths than from suicide or car accidents combined.  It is the biggest killer of young people and is much more dangerous than diabetes, as Dr. O'Reilly indicated.  The huge gaps in drug services down the country are a significant issue.<\/p> <p>  The other issue relates to what has been said about rural areas.  The Chairman referred to a team for homelessness.  To be fair to the HSE, it has funded a number of our services and we reach over 50% of the homeless population with primary care services.  The HSE is funding many services that are getting out there to the people.  The problem is that when there are so many chaotic people, it is very hard to adapt a general practice service to respond to their needs.  It is a case of achieving a fine balance.  One does not want people to get dependent on our services because that might capture them and keep them in homelessness, so one wants to capture them and hold them, like a safety net while they are in homelessness but as soon as they get into accommodation they would get back into the mainstream services.  We need to maintain those flexible services while still allowing the route back into homelessness.  Our problem is - this comes back to the query about getting a primary care team for homeless people - that we still have to use other primary care services, for example, physiotherapy, counselling and occupational therapy in the mainstream and they give out appointments.  Homeless people do not keep appointments.  They do not have home addresses to send the appointment notices to; they have chaotic lives; they do not have diaries; they do not have time or transport and they do not keep appointments.  It would be extremely useful to get into homelessness services those primary care health professionals that we cannot access.  It is the primary care Safetynet team that captures people and it could be hugely expanded.<\/p> <p>  There is a gap in particular in the area of mental health, as we have indicated several times.  There are psychiatrists who work in homelessness but they deal only with pure schizophrenia or manic depression, the pure psychoses, which comprises one in five or one in six homeless people.  They will not deal with people who have drug addiction.  They say that is the role of psychiatrists who deal with drug addiction, but the problem with the psychiatrists who deal with drug addiction is they deal with people who attend the addiction centres.  Only yesterday Dr. O'Reilly and I had a meeting about this with doctors and nurses who are frustrated because they cannot get mental health services for people on the ground.  There needs to be a dedicated mental health team which works with homeless people whether they have a drug addiction or not.  That needs to be urgently addressed.  I know the HSE is trying to do that because it recognises the problem but it has been trying to do it for several years.  It needs to get the funding resources in place to address the issue.<\/p> <p>  In response to the question of bedsits - I know the issue has been repeated over and over - I do not know anywhere that the private sector has addressed the issue of homelessness.<\/p><p>The Deputy asked about comparisons across other countries.  I am sad to say I am in a thriving business.  It is terrible to say, but the reason it is thriving is because of the lack of responsibility being taken for social housing by Government.  I agree that it is not about providing vast estates of social housing.  In the Netherlands, 33% of housing provided is social housing but it is much more integrated amongst the community.  It is not set up in vast housing estates which concentrate many social problems into one area.  It is really important to get that point across.  It would be great if really nice, wonderful apartments which have a bed and a living space could be provided but I fear that the reality is that once bedsits are allowed the previous terrible situation of having horrific bedsits will return.  When I used to do house calls I would see people living in appalling states.  It is not the private sector but the public sector that needs to get moving.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017070500002#N00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Austin O'Carroll","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1499241600,"counter":132,"content":"<p>I will just fly through some of the comments and queries.  I absolutely concur with Deputy Murphy O'Mahony in respect of overcrowding and hidden homelessness.  CSO figures will support that.  We know there is a huge underbelly there.  People often make temporary arrangements, which can break down.  It is very stressful and a huge strain and these people may end up trickling into homelessness.  If they do not, there is still a huge group of people living together, possibly in overcrowded conditions, in a setting which is not necessarily appropriate.  As yet we do not have any measure of that problem.  In other countries, such as Canada, there is a mechanism which attempts to count cases of hidden homelessness.  We will be linking in with the CSO on that issue at the time of the next census to see if it might be possible to get some sense of the scale of that issue.  It is a bit of a challenge, absolutely.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Durkan, who is not present, is absolutely correct that the response is housing, but it is housing and support.  We do not emphasise the support element enough.  It is about responding effectively to the issues people have to ensure they can maintain their tenancies and their housing.  It is really important to include the support element.  On the query about youth homelessness and the response to it, we recently published a report authored by Dr. Paula Mayock of Trinity College with a number of other homeless organisations.  It is titled \"Living in Limbo\" and looks at youth homelessness.  I am very happy to share that report and some of its recommendations with the committee if that would be considered useful.<\/p> <p>  On Deputy O'Connell's comments on the bespoke, tailored response to dealing with drug-related issues, we absolutely must have that tailored response to each individual.  It is the only way we can deal with it effectively.  In terms of responding effectively, prevention is the key element.  It is prevention and early intervention and then it has to be rapid rehousing using a Housing First model.  That is the only way we are going to effectively deal with this particular issue.<\/p> <p>  We spoke about children and the damage being done. The real danger is not only that we are working with people who are experiencing poverty but that there will be a poverty of expectation and aspiration for the future and a sense of fatalism among those who are growing up in such a challenging and limited situation.  We really need to intervene as quickly as we can.<\/p> <p>  In terms of responding to rural homelessness, this issue is really complex to deal with in an urban setting where there is a greater range of services.  Once we move out of an urban setting, it is really challenging.  Either the services do not exist or they are really spread out and people have to travel great distances to access them.  Again, we have published a paper on rural homelessness which we can share with the committee.  It outlines some of the challenges and some of our recommendations for dealing with the issue.  In terms of a response, it is about building houses or renovating vacant home.  Vacant homes being renovated need to be those which are near services, supports and infrastructure because, critically, people need to be able to access those particular services.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the query about whether Ireland is unique and about similar experiences in other countries, we are quite similar to other countries in western Europe.  Growing levels of homelessness are seen across most other European countries, including the UK, at this point in time.  Regarding how things are done differently, quite progressive harm reduction and drug services responses are seen, particularly in Copenhagen where there is a very successful approach to naloxone treatment, a number of drug consumption rooms and a range of other things.  There has been quite a successful approach using a housing-led model in Finland.  There has been very strong local and national political and financial commitment to that model.  It has been the most effective country in Europe in respect of addressing homelessness to this point in time.  They are currently highlighted as quite a successful model of intervention on that issue.<\/p> <p>  There was a query about service fragmentation.  There is a challenge in terms of intersectoral, inter-agency and interdepartmental working.  It seems to be an ongoing challenge.  Sometimes it depends on relationships to a great degree and if someone changes job or role, that relationship can then break down.  We certainly need to have a stronger push in terms of guidelines and commitments to ensure that actually happens to ensure that we address people's issues effectively.<\/p> <p>  There was query in respect of Housing First in Usher's Island.  I will refer that query to Ms Darcy for a response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017070500002#O00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Niamh Randall"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1499241600,"counter":133,"content":"<p>To answer Deputy Murphy O'Mahony's question, we do refer to other agencies such as Pieta House or Aware.  It goes back to a point which Dr. O'Carroll made, which was that appointment-based systems do not always necessarily work.  The Dublin Simon Community set up the Sure Steps counselling service over four years ago.  Last year that service had 1,750 hours available specifically to homeless clients  It is an adaptive model of counselling where attempts are made to meet people literally where they are at.  It might initially be crisis intervention to get people engaged, because counselling is not traditionally a type of service which homeless people would access, so we adapted the model and it has worked very successfully.  This year we have 2,250 hours available for homeless clients and all of those hours are taken up.  They are not just available, they are actually used.<br\/><br\/>To answer the Deputy's question on Usher's Island, tonight we have 64 people in our Usher's Island facility.  They are in treatment, in recovery and in the blood-borne virus unit.  Out of those 64 people, 25 are in accommodation in Blessington Street and in Tallaght.  Those 25 people are ready to move onto accommodation.  We provide some accommodation.  We have 300 units of accommodation, which we have already provided for homeless people generally and not just for clients of the Dublin Simon Community.  These 25 people are ready to live independently but the accommodation is not there.  The longer we leave them in that holding pattern in terms of their recovery, the more likely it is that all the investment they have personally put into their recovery and the challenges they have overcome to get to that point will unravel.  The amount of work they have had to put in has been horrendous.  For it to unravel because we do not have that final piece of the jigsaw, that is, the accommodation, would be the biggest crime we could commit.  The Dublin Simon Community, as well as other approved housing bodies, are providing accommodation but much more accommodation is needed, as we are all aware.  In Usher's Island we provide a percentage of the accommodation for people to move on.  That could be the high, medium or low-support accommodation that we have in the organisation or it could be referring clients to other organisations.  <br\/><br\/>We run an addiction inreach-specific service through which we provide services to the HSE and to two other organisations.  The sole remit of that addiction homeless action team is to avoid people exiting treatment into homelessness.  We only have two people to do that and they have a case load of 25.  They have had some really successful outcomes and it is an example of good co-ordination in terms of swapping clients.  If one organisation feels that the client is not suitable to its criteria its refer the client to us and <i>vice versa<\/i>.  It is an attempt to move people out of homelessness into suitable accommodation.  <br\/><br\/>To return to the issue of methadone, I agree that people may feel that they are condemned to methadone but the service we run in Usher's Island is unique in that we take people in for an alcohol detox on any dose of methadone.  We do not have an upper limit because, unfortunately, the upper limit serves to further exclude people.  People might come in on anything up to 120 ml of methadone or more.  We do not currently detox them from methadone but they can move into our recovery unit.  Dr. O'Reilly was part of a project which we did a few years ago with regard to lowering our threshold.  We had a rehabilitation unit but we have now changed it to be a recovery unit because we felt that we were losing many people who had completed an alcohol detox successfully but could not move into a rehabilitation unit because such units did not traditionally allow a person to be on benzodiazepines or methadone.  Now people can come into the recovery unit on prescribed benzodiazepines or prescribed methadone.  Once they are on a prescribed dose, many of those people exit our treatment and recovery and manage to live very successful lives afterwards.<\/p><p>While I may not agree that people should be on methadone for the rest of their lives, a conversation needs to happen around whether we want to reduce to a level that is acceptable.  We cannot talk about health without talking about accommodation as it would be pointless.  It would be worth having cross-departmental working in this regard but there is no point unless it trickles down to the HSE, local authorities and NGOs working in real partnership.  NGOs have to be an equal partner at that level.  We have the cumulative experience over the years and we know how things work.  We have adapted and have had to be very flexible and innovative and this should be taken into account when trying to come up with solutions for the cohort with which we work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017070500002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Majella Darcy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1499241600,"counter":135,"content":"<p>There is a old story about coming upon a river and seeing a load of people drowning.

The problem is that more and more people are falling into the river and a social housing bridge or some such thing needs to be built.  We cannot really do that because we are too busy dragging people out of the river.  Perhaps people from mainstream public agencies including social protection, primary care or local authorities should be invited before the committee to be asked what they are doing for health and homelessness.

One of the dangers in the provision of temporary accommodation is that it can seen as a long-term solution.  We need to be really clear that it can never be that.  There are not just huge difficulties for children, it puts stresses and strains on relationships and this doubles back onto children, causing trauma and stigmatisation.  The housing crisis is driving the crisis in homelessness and the related health issues.  We need to plan for a long-term solution to this problem.<\/p> <p>  Senator Colm Burke referred to the situation in Cork.  We have tried to focus on pushing for long-term stable accommodation where people have their own front door.  Deputy Durkan mentioned sheltered housing.  There is a place for everything and a one-size-fits-all approach does not necessarily work.  The more independence we can create, the better people's health and well-being will be and consequently, we need a range of options.  Some people are transient and we had such a case in Cork.  The GP with the adult homeless team made a decision and the person was involuntarily admitted for treatment.  Such cases are exceptional but they also require responses.  There may be additional costs but if the services do not provide for such people we need to ask why they are falling into that scenario.  What preventative measures can be taken?  Everybody is different and we deal with individual scenarios as they arise.  We should not lose anybody simply because of putting a cost per head on a particular provision.  Everybody needs to be valued equally and the best way to provide for these people is to have a spread of services and access to them, wherever they live.  Community services in such areas need to be flexible and aware of the complexity of the issues with which people present, particularly those with issues related to addiction and mental health.  All front-line services need to be versed in these issues and to upskill as necessary.  Everybody needs to understand at what stage people are in the continuum of provision.  The services need to support each other and while we can be critical of the HSE in many ways, the adult homeless team in Cork is working very well.  It is a classic case of partnership working and people adapting to work together.  The difficulty is that there is not enough of this and there are gaps in nursing hours, occupational therapy etc.  We need to resource them and make them more effective.  The work is collaborative and innovative, and is exemplified by Dr. Austin O'Carroll in Safetynet Primary Care.

I have worked with individuals with a disability or a mental health issue or who suffered from depression or came from a Traveller background and required a lot of social work input from many different Departments, and such people needed a package to be developed for them.  We would have to go to social inclusion, disability or mental health services or primary care.  Given the length of time it takes to negotiate these things, one has to ask where the funding would come from.  All the time the individual's circumstances are getting worse and there is an even bigger job to do by the time one finally gets it all.  There is a similar structure for dealing with vulnerable adults and any time one wants to put a package together, one has to go back and negotiate with the various departments in the HSE to do so.

That should work.<\/p> <p>  I want to pick up on Dr. O'Reilly's comment about addressing the issues at the very top of the stream and why people are homeless.  It is very clear that the reasons people experience homelessness, problematic drug and alcohol use and housing insecurity come down to poverty and inequality, lack of housing affordability, poor supply, and the lack of tenancy security and income adequacy.  The committee's advocacy on these issues could really help us.  If tackled, these are the issues that could prevent these problems happening in the first place.  Very strong advocacy at a policy level is really important when it comes to preventing these issues.  <\/p> <p>  Other key messages include the importance of requiring, ensuring and supporting inter-sectoral, cross-departmental work. This needs to be done in a co-ordinated way.  Another is the importance of bringing services to where people themselves are and ensuring that those services are flexible, appropriate, affordable and adaptable.

We now have a very specific issue that we have never seen before.  Children came into homelessness in the past but usually because their parents were chaotic due to drug or alcohol addiction or because of family breakdown.  Many of the parents now coming into homelessness remain very connected to their communities and to their GPs.  They are still going to their GPs, and this is critical.  We do not want to intervene because we want that connection to be maintained.<\/p> <p>  The question was asked as to how many additional services we need around children.  I do not think that there is any service we can give to a child experiencing homelessness.  What these children need are play areas and a stable life.  Counselling is not going to do anything for children whose lives are chaotic.  What they need is to get back into a home in the community where they started.  That is the central issue.  I do not think that putting more services in place helps.  Many of the parents in question are quite stable and are keeping things together.  It is the parents, not the children, who need support in this chaotic situation.  As was already mentioned by Ms Randall, there is a need to maintain transport to and from the family GP so that the connection can be maintained.  The main thing is get them out of homelessness as soon as possible.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017070500002#Q00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Austin O'Carroll"},{"type":"speech","time":1499241600,"counter":142,"content":"<p>There needs to be support for parents to keep things as normal as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017070500002#Q00500","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1499241600,"counter":143,"content":"<p>Yes.

I am head of the shareholding financial advisory division within the Department of Finance and I am accompanied here today by Mr. Brian Corr, a principal officer equivalent in my division and Ms Deirdre Aherne, an assistant principal officer.  Both work within the credit union policy section.<\/p> <p>  As the committee is aware the Department's role is the provision of high quality information, advice and analysis on credit union policy matters to the Minister for Finance and to oversee and implement policy and legislation relevant to the credit union sector.  The credit union policy team within my division is well resourced reflecting the importance the Minister and the Department attach to the sector.  It is headed up by Brian Corr.  Along with Mr. Corr and Ms Aherne, the team also has a higher executive officer, Tom Byrne and an executive officer, Joan Finnerty.  In addition, the credit union team can freely draw on the resources and expertise within my division and indeed the wider Department.<\/p> <p>  In order to assist our work we have ongoing communication with credit union representative bodies, the Central Bank and other credit union stakeholders on a wide range of matters both formally and informally and we regularly attend at sectoral events.  The matter of credit unions investing in social housing is one area around which we have had good engagement with the credit union representative bodies, the Central Bank and our colleagues in the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government. <\/p> <p>  Credit unions are currently looking to diversify into other areas.  This, in part, reflects the changing business environment in which they operate and therefore such diversification should be welcomed.  Social housing is one area, where for several years both representative bodies, the Irish League of Credit Unions, ILCU and the Credit Union Development Association, CUDA, have indicated a willingness on the part of their members to invest some of their investment portfolio.  This is a new departure for credit unions.  Discussions have taken place in a variety of fora to try to progress these interests and, although our role is limited, the Department of Finance has been engaged in some of those discussions.  While the concept of credit unions providing funding for social housing would appear on the surface to be straightforward, it is not without challenges.<\/p> <p>  There are two main potential avenues to provide such funding, lending and investment.  From a lending perspective, credit unions are restricted in that they can only lend to their members.  This is set out in section 35 of the Credit Union Act 1997.  A member, effectively a customer, must belong to the credit union's common bond.  The common bond is based on a pre-existing social connection, such as belonging to a particular community, industrial or geographic group.  This is an integral part of a credit union's ethos.<\/p> <p>  The Credit Union Advisory Committee, CUAC, is a statutory body established by the Minister under section 180 of the Credit Union Act 1997, primarily to advise the Minister on credit union matters.  In July 2016 CUAC published its Review of Implementation of the Recommendations in the Commission on Credit Unions Report.  The Department is actively working with CUAC on implementation of those recommendations in a number of areas, including that of the common bond where CUAC recommended that a policy paper be prepared by September 2017.  I do not wish to prejudge the outcome of this policy paper other than to note that there are currently no proposals to make any change to the common bond and any such change, if proposed and agreed, would require primary legislation.<\/p> <p>  Second, credit unions are restricted by regulations introduced by the Central Bank as to the type of investments they can make, counter-party exposure and maturity limits.  A consultation paper, CP109, was published by the Central Bank on 11 May 2017 on the credit union investment framework with a closing date for receipt of submissions of 28 June 2017.  We have seen ILCU's detailed submission to this consultation paper.  The consultation paper proposes that credit unions be allowed to invest in tier 3 approved housing bodies which currently borrow primarily from the Housing Finance Agency, HFA, assisted by the European Investment Bank, EIB, at a low cost.<\/p><p>An investment in social housing would bring differing risks to those risks inherent in credit unions' loan books and current investment portfolios.  These risks - primarily, low, fixed-yield in nature for a long maturity and with limited liquidity - would need to be appropriately managed to ensure the protection of credit union members' savings.  This is a matter for the credit union sector and the Central Bank, as regulator.<\/p><p> The Department of Finance recognises that the credit union sector could play an important role in the funding of social housing.  The establishment of a vehicle to pool resources and expertise would appear to be a sensible approach, provided that the underlying economics work for all stakeholders.  We understand that the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government recently announced funding to support a sector-led financial vehicle, involving investors which could potentially include credit unions.  We would encourage the credit union sector to continue to investigate becoming involved in such a vehicle but recognise that the sector is free to pursue alternative avenues.<\/p><p> As a Department, we are actively focused on implementing the recommendations in the CUAC's report which cover seven topics, the most relevant of which today is the recommendation for a full review of the Central Bank section 35 lending regulations.  An implementation group, chaired by Mr. Corr, meets monthly to progress these recommendations.  To date, the implementation group has spent by far the largest proportion of time on issues related to credit union lending regulations.<\/p><p> We recognise that the loan-to-asset ratio in the credit union sector is currently too low, placing a burden on investment income in a very challenging low-yield environment.  However, in the year to 31 March 2017, credit unions increased their gross lending by circa 6%, which is a positive development.  We are hopeful that further lending growth can occur and that a review of the lending restrictions in due course would assist prudent loan book growth, which could be complemented by income from a diversified investment portfolio, which in turn could include an element of social housing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017070500002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Des Carville","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1499243400,"counter":155,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Carville.

By way of context, we are in the middle of the worst housing crisis in recent history.  The ability of the State to invest in social housing to meet growing housing need is limited because of the financial constraints.  Capital investment from central government in social housing remains at historic lows, even with the increases in the past two budgets.  The capacity of local authorities to deliver units is constrained by the 23% loss of staff since 2008.  Government policy indicates that there is a desire for approved housing bodies to play a more active role.  This has been Government policy for some years.  Two years ago, the ILCU put on the tables of the Central Bank and the Departments of Finance and Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government proposals which, at that stage, would have allowed, potentially, for the quadrupling of the investment in social housing by approved housing bodies.  In 2015, the approved housing bodies were borrowing approximately &euro;124 million.  Last year, the figure was &euro;260 million.  That delivered, at least in starts, in the region of 1,700 homes.  The approved housing bodies sector could potentially be delivering up to 4,000 homes a year.  Certainly, that is the position they were in back in 2006 and 2007, when the funding climate was more favourable.<\/p> <p>  I know these things are not simple and that there are huge risks involved.  I am a member of a credit union and I want to ensure that my limited savings in life are adequately protected.  However, what many of us just do not understand is how in God's name it takes two years even to get to a consultation on whether it is a viable proposal to release desperately needed funds for housing.  Every time we have raised this matter - at the D&aacute;il Committee on Housing and Homelessness and at this committee - with the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, the officials have said it is really not up to them and that it is a matter for the Department of Finance.  When representatives from the Department of Finance came before the committee, we raised the matter with them and they said it is really nothing to do with them and that it is the responsibility of the Central Bank and the Registrar of Credit Unions.  I know that, ultimately, statutory responsibility lies with the Central Bank, but when all these people get into a room privately and try to work out what the right thing to do for the State is, the witnesses' Department and their line Minister have huge influence.<\/p> <p>  I have two straight questions to which I would very much like answers.  First, is it the view of the Department of Finance that it would be a good idea, with all the appropriate checks and balances in place, for credit unions to be able to invest in the approved housing bodies sector, increase the overall amount of loan capacity and diversify from the existing sources of private sector and approved housing body finance?  Does the Department believe this is a good idea or a bad idea?  The very last sentence of Mr. Carville's presentation had many \"coulds\" and caveats, but surely his Department has a view on this.  Second, why has it taken so long?  I know everyone is busy and that we have been in the middle of a whole series of crises, but given that it has taken two years to get to a stage at which we are now considering the matter, someone needs to explain to us and, more importantly, the public how it has taken so long.  If one considers the three options the ILCU has outlined in its submission to the Central Bank, the second funding stream - the model we supported in our submission to the Central Bank - would allow for a doubling of the borrowing capacity of the approved housing bodies and a doubling of their output up to the 4,000 units they could be producing.  The public has a right to know why it has taken so long for us to reach this point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017070500002#J00300","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1499243400,"counter":157,"content":"<p>I will be very brief because I think Deputy &Oacute; Broin has covered nearly everything we need to say about this issue.  We are hugely frustrated regarding why it has taken so long to get this money into the market.  As a State, we have clearly said that we are moving more towards approved housing bodies to deliver the social housing stock, yet there is capacity to give them more funds and we are not availing of it.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin has asked the questions that need to be asked: what is delaying this, when will it be sorted out and when will the money be available for approved housing bodies or other associations to deliver housing?  The final paragraph of Mr. Carville's presentation states that the credit unions have increased their gross lending by 6%, and perhaps this will continue.  Is he telling us he is looking at this in a negative way and that the credit unions coming out of the situation they were in are now beginning to see a positive sign of their investment coming back?  In light of that, he might be looking at a smaller parcel of their portfolio being made available in this market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017070500002#J00400","speaker":"1357"},{"type":"speech","time":1499243400,"counter":158,"content":"<p>I have a few questions.

The delay is inexplicable and it seems to be the same across the board.  As with everything in this little system of ours, it is just a matter of pushing paper backwards and forwards.  I have been presented with more options from different groups and different organisations, and credit unions are willing.  Any time we questioned the former Minister, Deputy Noonan, on this, he said \"No\" and that it was taboo.  Even the credit unions were demonised as a whole because of the activities of one or two.  We all know that if it were not for the credit unions, the country would not have survived through the recession, so why is there such resistance within the Central Bank and the Department?  Perhaps the witnesses cannot answer for the Central Bank, but there seems to be a total taboo about this, that it just will not happen, it cannot happen and it is not a vehicle that could be used.  This was the impression I got from the former Minister all through his tenure and, for that matter, from his predecessor.<\/p> <p>  When will it happen?  Why is it so difficult to get clear, honest and straight answers to what the problem is?  Credit unions will say they have the money - and not to throw around.  The vast majority of them that I know are very prudent.  I am a credit union member, like Deputy &Oacute; Broin, and have some limited savings in them.  People in the social housing organisations and voluntary organisations are looking to them.  The vehicles are there, and it just seems we cannot crack this or the banks do not want the credit unions operating in their space.  There is something more to the real truth than is coming forward as far as I am concerned.  That is a personal opinion.  We cannot seem to get at it.  I would like to see whether we might get some answers in respect of this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017070500002#J00600","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1499243400,"counter":160,"content":"<p>I thank members for their questions which showed some clear commonalities.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin asked a nicely phrased question as to whether it was a good idea for credit unions to invest in approved housing bodies.  I will spend a couple of minutes addressing this issue.  If I may, I will take this back up to 60,000 ft. because the role of the Department of Finance in this is to consider the issue from the credit union perspective as a different Department and line Minister are directly responsible for housing.<\/p> <p>  The credit union sector faces many challenges.  The low or negative interest rate environment puts significant pressure on the incomes of individual credit unions and the credit union sector in aggregate.  What this means is that the income of individual credit unions falls and they are constrained in terms of what they can invest in.  As members will be aware, on 11 May the Central Bank of Ireland published a consultation paper, CP108.  The issue is, therefore, being actively considered.<\/p> <p>  Credit unions also face other challenges in terms of pretty muted loan demand by its members.  Thee membership also has an ageing demographic profile rather than a younger profile.  There are, therefore, plenty of challenges facing the sector and it is aware of them.  Based on the interaction the Department has had with the representative bodies and individual credit unions, the sector is up to meeting these challenges.<\/p> <p>  If we consider one of these topics, namely, investment income, which is very important to the viability of the sector, if structured correctly and if the economics make sense, investment in approved housing bodies is definitely a good idea.  The sector has &euro;16 billion in aggregate in assets and slightly more than &euro;4 billion in aggregate in loans.  The loan to asset ratio is not viable in the medium to long term.  For this reason, credit unions must generate income some other way.  I certainly see approved housing bodies being part of a solution, although they will not be the entire solution because, as the credit union sector would acknowledge, it would not make sense to put all of its surplus cash into one investment class.<\/p> <p>  The various papers produced by the credit unions, which are very good, detailed and well thought out, refer to a potential investment of between 10% and 20% of their assets in social housing.  This is from where the figure of &euro;2 billion referred to yesterday comes.  This figure is at the upper end of the spectrum because it assumes that every single credit union will invest the maximum amount.  For this reason, I would be cautious about that number.  Nevertheless, it is still a sizeable amount which could make a material difference from the sector's point of view.<\/p> <p>  As to whether the Department believes investing is approved housing bodies is a good idea, from the credit union viability perspective, we believe absolutely that it is a good idea and we are very keen to work with the representative bodies and other stakeholders, including the Central Bank, to try to progress it in a constructive manner.<\/p> <p>  Another issue that arose yesterday ties in partly with the timing and frustration about what has been happening in the past couple of years and I will ask my colleague, Mr. Corr, to discuss that matter in a moment.  There is an issue with the vehicle used to execute the idea of investing in approved housing bodies.  While we all agree that the idea makes a great deal of sense from everyone's perspective given the need for social housing and the needs on the credit unions' side, the question is how we bring these needs together and execute the idea.  As members will be aware - I hope they will also empathise in this regard - we have constraints around state aid rules, the directorate general for competition and having a vehicle on balance sheet when we are trying to reduce, as a matter of policy, the debt to GDP ratio in a downward rather than upward trajectory.  That is only one potential avenue in terms of establishing a vehicle, however.  The credit union sector itself could establish a vehicle, as could the private sector.  We saw also in May that the Irish Council for Social Housing has funding to explore the establishment of such a vehicle.  There are, therefore, several opportunities or ways to skin the cat.  We would like is to have a parallel process on the vehicle at the same time as the Central Bank's consultation on the investment regulations in order that the regulations will, we hope, be changed by the autumn or as soon as possible.  That is, however, a matter for the Central Banker as the regulator which is independent of the Department.  We can also work with the industry to try to figure out whether there is a mechanism to create a vehicle which we can use to execute the idea.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Corr will comment on the frustrations that have arisen regarding the time it is taking to make progress in this matter.  A considerable amount of work has been taking place behind the scenes in the past couple of years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017070500002#K00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Des Carville"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1499243400,"counter":161,"content":"<p>As a general point, since 2011, there has been a fundamental change in the regulatory position of credit unions and the role of the Central Bank.

More than 100 submissions were made as part of that consultation process, which was concerned with a wide range of issues, including investment regulations, and was, therefore, a substantial process.

There is a CSO-EUROSTAT review of the status of the approved housing body sector here and whether it should be considered on or off-balance sheet.  That is set against the backdrop of the designating of the approved housing bodies in Britain as on-balance sheet.  My question is if there were a decision by the CSO or EUROSTAT to reclassify approved housing bodies as on-balance sheet, one consequence is that it would have an impact on the Government debt so any existing and future borrowing would go on the Government debt.  My question is on the expenditure benchmark.  Would it also have an impact on the expenditure benchmark in terms of it being a borrowing that is then spent by a body that would be deemed, essentially, an arm of the State?

I will address Deputy Casey's question on the proposed structure first.  The ILCU prepared a paper, The Social Housing Funding Proposal, over a year ago in which there were two proposed structures.  One was a direct model.  It is a pity I cannot show it to the committee because it shows it succinctly in a graph.  We will send it on to the committee if it does not have it.  There was a direct model and also an indirect model.  The difficulty with the direct model is that it involved a State-owned financial vehicle within the chain.  That causes potential difficulties for us but also timing issues with trying to clear such a vehicle through DG Comp and the state aid rules.  It is also on-balance sheet.  That was one potential proposal.  I wrote to the ILCU in 2016 to make it very clear it was not our preferred approach and we would much prefer the indirect model approach which keeps the vehicle off-balance sheet.  My understanding is that the sector generally has been pursuing that approach rather than the former for a period of time.  The indirect model, for lots of reasons, strikes us as the one with a greater degree of executability right across the various criteria.  It is the approach everyone is looking at.  In terms of the conversation between EUROSTAT and the CSO and the expenditure benchmark, while we talk to them in the Department of Finance, it is not within our purview to talk to them about social housing and approved housing bodies.  It is a matter for the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.  There is a direct interplay between them.

I am joined by Ms Elaine Byrne, Deputy Registrar of Credit Unions and Ms Anna Marie Finnegan, head of policy, Registry of Credit Unions.<\/p> <p>  I will start by acknowledging the important role credit unions play in Irish society and in the financial system.  I also acknowledge the strong voluntary and community ethos of the sector.  Both the role and ethos reflect the primary objectives and purpose of credit unions to promote thrift among their members by the accumulation of their savings and the creation of sources of credit for the mutual benefit of members at fair and reasonable interest rates.<\/p> <p>  Our statutory mandate is to ensure each credit union protects the funds of its members and to maintain the financial stability and well-being of credit unions generally.  This informs our approach to all aspects of the regulatory framework for credit unions, including the investment and lending frameworks that are the focus of our engagement today. <\/p> <p>  My opening statement will provide some background information on the current position of the sector.  It will also focus on the potential for credit unions to provide funding for social housing.  Specifically, I will focus on three main areas: the current position of and main challenges facing the credit union sector, which is important in contextualising our approach, regulatory requirements and current standards and the potential for credit unions to provide finance for social housing through lending or investment. <\/p> <p>  In terms of the current position, over the past decade or so credit unions have dealt with the effects of the financial crisis, increased competition, major business model challenges, significant restructuring and increased regulation.  Co-ordinated efforts have delivered an unprecedented level of restructuring, resulting in 116 mergers, which have reduced the number of weaker credit unions and reduced risks across the sector as a whole. <\/p> <p>  Notwithstanding this progress, clearly significant challenges remain.  Return on assets for the sector as a whole continues to shrink and the cost to income is high.  While loan books are starting to recover, they are growing at a significantly slower rate than the level of growth in unsecured lending across Ireland.  Further work is required to fully embed mergers and deliver the cost savings and efficiencies anticipated in the business cases proposed for the mergers.  This is critical in putting these credit unions in the best position to deal with structural challenges and to leverage increased scale to provide a broader range of products and services to meet the needs and expectations of members.  <\/p> <p>  Investment income has helped offset declining loan income for a number of years but is falling.  Between 2012 and 2016, annual aggregate investment income has fallen from around &euro;300 million to &euro;174 million.  This happened at a time when total sector investments have increased from &euro;8 billion to &euro;11.4 billion.  Our analysis highlights that if current loan, investment income and cost trends continue, an increasing number of credit unions could face serious viability issues in the future, thus highlighting the urgent need to now address the business model challenges the sector faces.  In recognition of this, we established a new unit in 2016 with a mandate to engage with credit unions on business model changes in order to progress well-developed proposals supported by credible risk-focused plans.<\/p> <p>  I shall now discuss regulatory standards.  At the registry we have prioritised regulation and supervisory changes that improve credit union safety and better position the sector for the future.  Strong governance standards are a fundamental requirement to support strong, viable credit unions and are a prerequisite for credit unions seeking to expand their existing business models.  Regrettably, standards of regulatory compliance are still well below those required to consistently safeguard the funds of members and to position credit unions to tackle business model development.  We are still seeing an unacceptable number of credit unions failing to display strategic understanding and good governance.  In too many cases we have encountered limited financial skill sets and weak management, poor systems of control, weak risk, compliance and internal audit functioning and weaknesses in lending practices.  Significant further improvement is therefore required.<\/p> <p>  I shall now discuss finance for social housing.  There has been much discussion on the potential for credit unions to provide finance for social housing with attention focusing on the sector's low loan-to-asset ratio and the resulting level of surplus funds, the majority of which is currently held in accounts in authorised credit institutions and bank bonds.  The Central Bank is supportive of credit unions increasing their investment options, including through potentially playing a role in the provision of funding for social housing.  Recently we have consulted on proposals to facilitate this and are analysing the feedback we have received.  Nonetheless, it is important that there is realism on the proportion of the sector's surplus funds that could appropriately be allocated to social housing.  This must be informed by the specific characteristics of funding for social housing and appropriate levels of risk for members' savings.  Additionally, the sector's surplus funds are held across 277 credit unions.  Each individual credit union would have to make an independent decision on whether to provide funding for social housing.  The manner in which credit unions may fund social housing will also be driven by the existing legislative and regulatory framework that applies to credit unions.  The Credit Union Act 1997 - the 1997 Act - and the Credit Union Act 1997 (Regulatory Requirements) Regulations 2016 set out the services that a credit union may provide to its members.  These include savings and loans and a number of additional services.<\/p> <p>  Common bond restrictions in the Credit Union Act 1997 limit the potential for credit unions to provide funding for social housing via lending, as credit unions may only provide services to their membership that is characterised by a common bond.  The common bond is based on a pre-existing social connection such as belonging to a particular community, industrial or geographic group.  Therefore, for a credit union to lend to an approved housing body, AHB, the body would have to fall within the credit union's common bond.  The potential impact of the common bond on business model development was a matter raised as part of the review by the Credit Union Advisory Committee, CUAC, of the implementation of the recommendations of the Commission on Credit Unions.  CUAC has recommended that further consideration be given to the common bond.  As a result of common bond restrictions, sector-wide approaches to lending for social housing have not come to pass and consequently, focus has turned to investment-based proposals. <\/p> <p>  While the primary purpose of a credit union is the provision of loans to its members, the regulatory framework also provides for credit unions to invest surplus funds.  Under existing regulations, credit unions are permitted to invest in a range of specified investment classes, which includes government securities, bank deposits, bank bonds and collective investment schemes made up of these instruments.  The Central Bank's ability to make regulations on investments in projects of a public nature is specifically referenced in the regulation-making powers provided for under section 43 of the 1997 Act.  Therefore, such investments can be facilitated by regulations, where appropriate.<\/p> <p>  Additionally, the 2016 regulations make reference to the fact that the Central Bank may prescribe, in accordance with section 43 of the 1997 Act, further classes of investments for credit unions that may include investments in projects of a public nature.<\/p><p>The regulations state that investments in projects of a public nature include, but are not limited to, investments in social housing projects.<\/p><p> In order to ensure that the investment regulations remain appropriate for the credit union sector, the Central Bank undertook to review the investment regulations this year to consider whether it is appropriate and prudent at this stage to facilitate investment by credit unions in other classes of investments, including investments in social housing.  The Central Bank published a consultation paper on 11 May setting out the following potential additional investment classes for credit unions: bonds issued by supranational entities, corporate bonds and investments in tier 3 approved housing bodies, AHBs.<\/p><p> As for investments in approved housing bodies, the consultation paper identifies potential risks and risk mitigants for such investments and asks for feedback on the appropriateness of credit unions undertaking such investment and the level of such investment that could be undertaken.  An important issue highlighted in the consultation paper is the need for credit unions to take account of maturity considerations and the balance sheet impact of undertaking investments in approved housing bodies which, by their nature, are likely to be illiquid and significantly longer term than existing investments and could result in an increase in the existing maturity mismatch on the credit union&rsquo;s balance sheet.  Consideration will also need to be given to the interplay between a possible move to longer-term lending and longer maturity investments, which could also exacerbate this issue.  If credit unions wish to significantly shift the maturity profile of their assets, they will need to consider how they can extend their funding profile, particularly if it requires the longer-term tie-up of funds belonging to ageing members.<\/p><p> The consultation period closed on 28 June and we have received more than 70 submissions from a broad range of respondents.  The majority of submissions are from individual credit unions with additional submissions received from representative bodies, AHBs, investment firms and Deputies.  We welcome this feedback, which is an important input into the policy development process.  We are in the process of examining the submissions.  The majority of respondents have commented on the potential for credit unions to invest in approved housing bodies and broadly welcome the potential for credit unions to do so.  The submissions, however, also demonstrate some divergence in views on the level of risk associated with such investments and appropriate levels of exposure for credit unions.  The Central Bank will consider the entirety of the submissions received prior to finalising changes to the investment framework for credit unions and will publish a statutory instrument amending the investment regulations for credit unions.<\/p><p> Finally, on longer-term lending, it is important to note that under the 2016 regulations, credit unions are already permitted to lend up to 30% of their loan book over five years and up to 10% of their loan book over ten years - subject to a maximum maturity limit of 25 years.  In addition, credit unions can apply to the Central Bank for an extension to their longer-term lending limits of up to 40% over five years and up to 15% over ten years.  Currently for the sector overall, total gross loans over ten years amount to approximately 3% of overall loan books.<\/p><p> In conclusion, by way of background I have set out the current position of the credit union sector and identified a number of challenges the sector faces.  This is important in the context of this discussion.  I have also provided some background on the regulatory framework for credit union lending and investment, the consultation process on investment in social housing and our intention to amend the investment regulations later this year. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017070500002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ed Sibley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1499243400,"counter":182,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Sibley for his presentation.  I have a general comment and a couple of short questions.  It is always funny when one repeats to the second set of witnesses the same general context as given to the previous delegation.  There is huge frustration for those of us in the Oireachtas who are dealing with the housing policy agenda.  This frustration is borne out of a number of considerations that form part of the context even though they do not have a direct bearing on the Central Bank of Ireland's deliberations on the consultation.  We have possibly the worst housing crisis experienced in recent times.  The ability of the State to invest in the social housing that people need is incredibly limited, even with the capital investment increases over the last two budgets.  The capacity of the approved housing bodies sector is greater than what it is currently delivering.  By most estimates, the approved housing body sector could be delivering up to 4,000 additional social homes annually.  It might take them a year or two to get up to that level but that is their potential.  Last year, approved housing bodies got approximately &euro;260 million in loans from the Housing Finance Agency, which allowed them to deliver approximately 1,700 units.  In the year before, the number was half that.  From the housing policy point of view it makes eminent sense to allow approved housing bodies to do the work they do by increasing the overall lending capacity to the sector and to diversify the sources of lending.  The frustration arises because none of us are asking the Central Bank to jeopardise in any way or to put at risk credit union members' savings.  We are all members of credit unions and we all have savings there.  We want those savings, as well as the institutions, to be protected.  Credit unions made detailed proposals to the various bodies, as far back as 2014, and we are only now at a stage where there is a consultation.  While I very much welcome the consultation, in the context of the housing crisis, the difficulties of direct State investment in social housing and the potential availability of a valuable source of funding for approved housing bodies, most members of this committee and of last year's Committee on Housing and Homelessness do not understand why it has taken so long from proposals being made to a public consultation.  My first question is the same one we asked the Department of Finance; how has it taken so long to get to this point?<\/p> <p>  I will now turn to the second issue.  I made a submission to the Central Bank, from a housing policy perspective, stating clearly our preference is for the investment model for all the reasons I believe are self-evident.  The proposals from the Irish League of Credit Unions, ILCU, included three funding options or streams and our preference was for the middle option because we believed it was the most prudent in not putting the risk too high at the start and in seeing how that level of investment could go.  It could then be assessed and if it was proving more difficult lending capacity could be reduced.  If it was proving more successful then lending capacity could be increased.  The Central Bank of Ireland's timeline is to complete consideration of the submissions, publish its response and potentially change the regulations by the end of 2017.  Is Mr. Sibley confident the Central Bank will meet those deadlines?<\/p> <p>  The answer to a lot of these questions depends on the specific funding model and vehicle and the interaction between what the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government offers in terms of supporting finance and availability agreements and what funding vehicle is in place in respect of the Irish Council for Social Housing and the credit unions.  In the Central Bank's consideration of these aspects, is it engaging with these other bodies separate to the submissions?  If we get right the model, the fund structure and the supports from the Department, then the level of risk will reduce considerably.  I hope those conversations are happening, irrespective of submissions.  Even if the Central Bank's recommendation or decision at the end of the process is to change the regulations to allow for this new class of investment funding, there is a lot of work to be done to make sure that the funding vehicle is designed in the best possible way to ensure the funds, if and when they are invested, are invested wisely.  This is from the point of view of those of us who are members of credit unions - and it is our money - and from the perspective of the approved housing bodies and the individual credit unions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017070500002#N00200","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1499243400,"counter":183,"content":"<p>I agree.  We have a housing crisis and it is sad that we are nearly one year on from the launch of Rebuilding Ireland but we still need to build houses.  The credit unions are there and we always associate credit unions with being part of our community.  I do not think there is anybody in the country who does not use the credit union.  I was a little bit taken aback when Mr. Sibley said \"we have encountered limited financial skill sets and weak management, poor systems of control, weak risk, compliance and internal audit functioning and weaknesses in lending practices\".  I believe this is the way to go in the future because we are in a housing crisis and it is crucial that money and funding come through the programmes.  Yesterday the committee met housing bodies such as Cl&uacute;id, Respond! and other co-operative housing groups.  Everybody is either trying to buy or build houses and timing is crucial.  As Mr. Sibley noted, the Central Bank of Ireland has received 70 submissions.  I understand that Mr. Sibley has outlined the three areas of concern, namely, the current position of and main challenges facing credit unions, regulations and potential for credit unions to provide finance for social housing.  Overall, however, the bigger picture is that funding is there and people are crying out for houses.  Everything must be regulated, and rightly so as that is how it should be, but this is a way to help people who are in need of housing.  Working with the credit unions and working together is a way to solve a problem that needs to be solved.  It is, again, about timing.  Can we have the timing for this?

The ability of the Central Bank to make regulations in this area came into force in early 2016.  That is the earliest that we could have taken action on this matter.  We committed to undertake the consultation and review in 2017 and that is what we are doing.  Without getting into a he-said-she-said discussion, high level proposals or aspirations about one side of the balance sheet or the collective availability of funds do not necessarily make for a detailed and well-thought through proposal that we can work on.  In the discussions on this, including some of the discussions that we ourselves have had in the Central Bank, there has been some iteration around the best way to use those funds.  Direct funding to Government was potentially an option, as was lending.  The investment suggestion came from us.  There has been a degree of iteration in the discussion around how to get this working.<\/p> <p>  In my opening remarks I made a point about the standards, controls and risks in the credit union sector.  It is important to bear these in mind when it comes to the safeguarding of members' funds.  An enormous amount of effort has been made in the sector both to restructure and to improve standards to better safeguard members' funds.  There is still work to be done, however, and we can see through our ongoing supervisory work and our engagement in the credit unions themselves that standards still need to be improved.  There are in fact significant risks associated with this kind of investment.  The typical investment profile of credit unions is that they have relatively short-dated and liquid instruments.  They can get in and out of them as required.  If there is a change in their liquidity requirements, if they need to repay members' funds, for example, they have the ability to do so quickly.  What we are talking about here, however, is an investment that would last for 25 years at a fixed rate of return and set at a period with very low interest rates.  This is a very long-term commitment that will have a very significant impact on credit union balance sheets.<\/p> <p>  This is also taking place at a time when those balance sheets are changing anyway and there is discussion around longer-term lending.  I referred to this in my opening remarks.  This is not a straightforward investment and there are very significant risks involved for the credits unions.  There needs to be a degree of sophistication and risk management within the credit unions in order for them to make these decisions.<\/p> <p>  Having said that, we have consulted on potential changes and we are very open-minded, both about these changes and about the potential to open up an avenue for credit union investment into social housing.  From the start of last year up to our issuing of the consultation paper, we engaged extensively with the credit unions themselves, with their representative bodies and with the approved housing bodies to make sure we have a really good grasp of the issues and risks involved here and of the potential for making this work.  Ms Finnegan will come in at this point to discuss our engagement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017070500002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ed Sibley"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1499243400,"counter":187,"content":"<p>A lot of work went into preparing the consultation paper.

It was important for us to get a detailed understanding of how funding for the AHB sector could be provided by the credit unions.

It is very important that the regulation be drafted in such a way as to facilitate the options that are on the table.  What we have seen discussed to date has been very much based on some form of collective investment scheme that would provide an opportunity for credit unions to pool funds and provide them to AHBs.

First, I thank the committee for the opportunity to discuss the Bill.  This is an area of law of immense importance and the decisions taken in implementing the general data protection regulation, GDPR, will be in place for many years to come.  After all, it is now nearly 30 years after the 1988 Act came into effect and I suspect we will see this in place for something close to the same time.<\/p> <p>  The first point I would like to make is on the structure of the Bill.  I know that previous witnesses have said the Bill is over-ambitious in that it tries to do much in one document, and I agree with that.<\/p><p>In particular, it would be desirable to separate the provisions the Bill, specifically in Part 4, which implement the law enforcement data protection directive and place them in a separate instrument.  This is because there is a significant overlap, or at least a perceived overlap, between the two areas.  I have already seen a degree of confusion on the part of people reading the heads of Bill who have read a section in Part 4 that appears to be reflecting the General Data Protection Regulation, GDPR, when it is not implementing it but rather the directive.  There is a real risk that the very similar language will lead to a degree of confusion on the part of users.<br\/><br\/>The other point made by previous witnesses, in particular the commissioner and Mr. Denis Kelleher was that the residual Parts of the 1988 and 2003 Acts should be repealed and re-enacted as a stand-alone instrument rather than being left in place.  I support that argument.  It seems that if we leave any Parts of the 1988 and 2003 Acts in place, we will have a position where to deal with certain matters, in particular those with an overlap between public and private processing of data, we will have to look to the 1988 Act, determine how it was amended by the 2003 Act, determine how that was amended by what would be the 2018 Act and then look to the GDPR on top of that, possibly while looking to other European instruments on top of that as well.  For example, these might include European instruments regarding the Schengen information system.  It seems that would be a real recipe for confusion.<br\/><br\/>It would be greatly preferable to, as far as possible, deal with the few aspects remaining in the 1988 Act in a short, separate and stand-alone instrument.  These are the aspects required of Ireland under the 1981 Council of Europe privacy convention but not dealt with under the GDPR or the law enforcement data protection directive.  This is something we will have to do in any event.  The Council of Europe convention on the protection of personal data is in the process of being modernised and we are at a point where we are very close to agreement on a final text.  This is something that will be implemented certainly in the next couple of years in any event.  It would be very useful at this point to pre-empt that as far as possible by separating those provisions.<br\/><br\/>The next point relates to article 80 of the GDPR, which deals with representation of data subjects.  A real problem in this area has been that individuals can lack the expertise, knowledge, time and money to enforce their legal rights.  As members know, the Irish legal system is expensive and difficult to navigate for lawyers, never mind those people unfamiliar with it.  Many of these rights, if they are to be enforced, would involve a trip to either the Circuit Court or the High Court at a cost that is simply beyond the scope of the average individual.  The GDPR aims to alleviate that problem with a mandatory and two optional provisions with article 80.  The mandatory provision is that member states must allow individuals to nominate a not-for-profit body to act on their behalf to make complaints to a data protection authority, appeal against decisions of a data protection authority, or take an action against a controller, like an Internet service provider, where it has abused personal data.  The optional parts of the article are that member states may allow individuals to nominate not-for-profit groups to act on their behalf to seek damages and they may allow not-for-profit groups to bring actions on their own initiative without the need for an individual to nominate them to do so.<br\/><br\/>It is very important that Ireland would take up the two aspects of flexibility in the GDPR and it is rather disappointing the heads of Bill do not address these points at all.  The heads of Bill before us now would exercise the discretion silently that would not take advantage of these options.  There are practical and principled reasons it would be useful to make these changes.  The practical reason is that given Irish law does not allow for class actions, as such, and there is no general provision for them, if individuals are not able to nominate a representative body to bring an action for damages on their behalf, there will be a multiplicity of claims being brought before the courts that the courts simply are not equipped to address.  One might think about a data breach, for example, such as the Yahoo compromise or the Ashley Madison data breach, where there could be thousands, tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of individuals affected, some of whom may be very seriously affected.  In that context we can expect a similar number of cases coming before the courts.  The GDPR gives us the option to effectively consolidate these cases if we allow people to nominate not-for-profit bodies to act on their behalf to bring a single action.  Without that option - it is not an option under the heads of Bill as they stand if individuals are seeking damages - the individuals, if they have time, expertise and knowledge to bring an action individually, will have to do so individually.<br\/><br\/>The second reason is a principled one.  It seems that if individuals are not able to nominate not-for-profit bodies to bring an action for damages on their behalf, and if not-for-profit bodies are not able to bring an action in appropriate cases where an individual complainant has not come forward, there will be a gap in protection.  In many cases, in particular discussing sensitive personal data, individuals - even if they can be identified and know they have been harmed - would be very reluctant or unable to come forward.  Individuals who find sensitive medical records leaked, for example, or like with the Ashley Madison case, those who find information relating to their sexual life has been leaked, would be very often unwilling to become the public face of the issue for very understandable reasons.  Although we might be able to identify an affected individual, that is not to say the individual would be in a position to bring a complaint or action in respect of the matter.<br\/><br\/>This is important from a principled perspective because in our own litigation challenging data retention law, the High Court and Mr. Justice McKechnie acknowledged that it was important that Digital Rights Ireland would be able to bring an <i>actio popularis<\/i>, an action on behalf of the wider population in respect of data retention laws.  This was a pressing issue of public concern and if we were not able to do it, individuals would not have the financial ability to bring the action by themselves.  In an area where the European Union was eventually found to have acted in a manner that was entirely illegal, this would have gone unchallenged because individuals simply did not have the resources to bring these claims.  As members will know from a number of hearings, this is an exceptionally complicated area of law.  We say it is unrealistic and unfair to expect individuals to navigate these waters without a guide.  The two discretionary provisions in article 80 are necessary to enable individuals to have an effective remedy.<br\/><br\/>My next point does not appear on the speaking note that was distributed but it relates to head 20 of the Bill, which would allow for restrictions to be placed on controller obligations and the exercise of data subject rights by means of statutory instrument.  We are concerned that head 20 appears to introduce a far-reaching power on the part of each individual Minister to effectively exempt particular forms of data processing from the requirements of the GDPR in a way that might not be fully consistent with fundamental rights.  It is noticeable that in the heads of Bill the Department acknowledges it would be desirable for Departments to introduce limitations on these rights by means of primary legislation but it suggests it is nevertheless necessary to have a residual power by means of statutory instrument to introduce these exceptions.<br\/><br\/>This power, certainly as drafted in heads of Bill, goes significantly too far.  In head 20, subhead 2(s), there are two typographical errors but the second is the one to which I refer.<\/p><p>It states that a statutory instrument may be introduced which will restrict controller obligations and data subject rights in relation to important objectives of general public interest.  What are such objectives?  They are defined in head 20, paragraph 2, under the second subsection (s) as \"such other important objectives of general public interest of the Union or the State as may be prescribed in regulations\".  In other words, we may have regulations introduced where necessary for matters of important general public interest.  What are matters of general public interest?  They are matters which may be defined by the regulations to be introduced to implement matters of general public interest.  Even in that aspect of the heads of the Bill there is circularity in the definition.<\/p><p> More generally, there is a concern that we are creating a very far-reaching power to carve out exemptions from the General Data Protection Regulation, GDPR, without clear standards being laid down in legislation to do so.  It seems to me that if such a far-reaching power is to be in place, there should be some additional check on it.  What that check might be is a matter for the Oireachtas.  It could be a requirement for a positive resolution of the Houses before the exemption would come into effect.  It could be a sunset clause whereby any regulations introduced under this provision have a finite lifespan and must either be re-enacted in primary legislation or allowed to expire.  It could be some other mechanism for parliamentary or perhaps committee scrutiny of particular classes of regulation.  As this stands, however, particularly in the context of a minority Government, there is a risk that exemptions could be introduced by ministerial order which might not pass full legislative scrutiny and certainly might not command the support of the Houses of the Oireachtas.<\/p><p> I apologise that my final point is not included in the speaking note provided to the committee.  It concerns the position of data protection officers, DPOs, and the protection they have if they are victimised for doing their work.  As the members  know, under the GDPR data protection officers are required to be independent.  Data controllers are not to interfere with the independent exercise of their functions.  However, the remedies available for breach of this duty are sanctions imposed by the Data Protection Authority on the data controller.  They are not remedies that are available to the data protection officer who might have been victimised as a result.  For example, if an individual DPO is sacked for doing his or her job, there is no remedy available to him or her under the GDPR itself or under the heads of the Bill.  It seems to me that it would be desirable to provide some form of remedy.<\/p><p> DPOs already have recourse to a limited form of remedy in that they might have the right to bring an action for wrongful dismissal.  As committee members will be aware, however, an action for wrongful dismissal is a limited one in the sense that it is quite expensive.  It must be brought before the Circuit Court or High Court as appropriate.  It would be preferable to provide that DPOs have available to them an action for unfair dismissal, which is a much cheaper, easier, streamlined process that can be brought before the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court.<\/p><p> The analogy here would be to the Protected Disclosures Act, which creates a protection for those who are dismissed on the basis of protected disclosure.  There would in fact be an overlap in that, in some cases, DPOs might make a protected disclosure precisely in order to bring themselves within the scope of that legislation, for example by notifying a matter to the Data Protection Commissioner.  It would be preferable to avoid the need for them to artificially bring themselves under the purview of the Protected Disclosures Act by explicitly providing that, where an individual is dismissed on the basis of the exercise of his or her functions as a DPO, an unfair dismissal remedy be available to him or her.<\/p><p> That concludes my statement on behalf of Digital Rights Ireland.  I welcome further questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017070500002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. T.J.

This legislation, together with the implementation of the GDPR, will mark a watershed in respect of the relationship between the State and its citizens.  I will address three major points and will pick up some of the threads from Mr. McIntyre's submission.<\/p> <p>  First I will address head 23, a proposal in respect of State agencies, public bodies and administrative fines.  It provides for administrative fines to be imposed on public bodies or authorities solely in respect of occasions on which they act as an undertaking.  The effect of this exemption is to make sure they are not liable to fines on all other occasions when they are not acting as an undertaking.  The result is to exempt public bodies and State agencies from administrative fines.  The committee will have heard from the Data Protection Commissioner and other witnesses already.  I echo them in saying that this is a very unwise course of action for the State to have taken.<\/p> <p>  State agencies will not have the same level of accountability as commercial bodies.  Between State agencies, a tally in respect of fines over the course of years is a very good initial indicator of any structural or institutional difficulty that may be arising.  Such a difficulty is easy to see as the fines build up, should there be repeated fines, and therefore it is less likely that long-term structural difficulties will develop.  Administrative fines are cost-neutral for the Exchequer as a whole.  The fines levied on public agencies go back into the Central Fund.  There is not really a cost saving exercise here for the State or the Exchequer.<\/p> <p>  The proposed provision requires a legally very complex test to be carried out on each occasion that the Data Protection Commission thinks it is necessary to do so, before any administrative fines could be levied.  On every occasion, there would have to be an examination of whether elements of public authority were acting as an undertaking before an administrative fine could be levied.  In the explanatory note to the heads of the Bill, it is acknowledged that this is a complicated matter.  It cannot be said that a particular State body is an undertaking in all its activities.  The example given in the explanatory note is that the HSE in the provision of ambulances is sometimes an undertaking and is sometimes not.  This is a high legal threshold for the regulator to have to get over every time it must decide whether it is possible to exercise legal powers.  It also introduces the potential of a challenge by the public body to every such effort to exercise those powers, in respect of whether it is acting as an undertaking.<\/p> <p>  It seems that there is very little by way of compelling reasons for providing this exemption for the State bodies.  Certainly there is nothing set out in the explanatory note as to why State bodies ought to be exempt as a matter of policy.  There are very clear reasons for having State bodies subject to the same regulatory system as the rest of civil society.  Our recommendation is that it would be better if article 83(7) was implemented without any restrictions on the administrative responses available to the Data Protection Commissioner, including such fines as the commission found appropriate in respect of breaches of citizens' personal data privacy.<\/p><p>Head 91 deals with the requirement giving effect to the general data protection regulation, GDPR, that there should be a right of compensation for financial and non-financial loss arising from a breach of the regulation.  Article 82 of the regulation is phrased in such a way as to say that there \"shall\" be provision made for the recovery of compensation for material and non-material loss.  The wording of the article is such that precedent would suggest that when a European legislative provision states there shall be provision, it indicates that a further step is likely to be necessary on the part of the member state in order to give force to that intention. <\/p><p> The heads of Bill recognises there is a right of action but on examination it does not explicitly create a right of compensation by a data subject for a breach of their rights.  The result would be that there is a question whether the State would have complied with the requirement that there shall be a provision for the recovery of compensation.<\/p><p> This has unattractive features from the point of view of potential data subject citizens where there might have been a breach of their rights.  It will also leave the State open to potential claims from people who find that they were unable to enforce their rights as it is a requirement under European law that if a person has not been able to recover their compensation that should have been provided for under European law, as a result of a failure by the State that per the Frankowicz case they have a right to recover such damages as they would have recovered from the third party from the State.  The result is that by not implementing an explicit statement saying that there is a right of compensation as opposed to a right of action, the State may hold itself open to any of the damages that would have otherwise fallen on private third parties who were breaching the data protection rights.  For all those reasons, we recommend that it would be better to see the intent of Article 2 of the regulation and Article 56 of the directive being made explicit by way of an explicit legislative recognition of the right of recovery of compensation for both material and non-material damages.<\/p><p> Dr. McIntyre has dealt with the separate implementation of regulation and directive but I would like to add that the current general scheme of the Data Protection Bill seeks to do three separate things: to largely, but not completely, replace the existing data protection Acts under head 5; to legislate for a small number of matters in the GDPR which have been left to member states such as the Internet age of consent and other matters; and to transpose entirely by way of part 4 of the heads of Bill, Directive 216\/680 in respect of national security.  We do not think it is a good idea to attempt to do those three things because this legislation must be passed and it is on a deadline.  The GDPR comes into force in May of next year and by running the implementation measures in respect of the GDPR together with the complicated matters in transposing a directive and the partial repeal of the data protection Acts, we run the risk from a practical point of view of either legislative gridlock preventing the matter from progressing at the required speed, or of the matter passing without the necessary scrutiny in respect of one area of the Bill because there is such a pressing deadline in respect of other areas.  For those reasons, we recommend that it is better to address the transposition of Directive 216\/680 by way of a specific legislative instrument separately.  This would allow any of the necessary residual elements required from the data protection Acts for that transposition, or as a result of the requirements of the State as a member of the Council of Europe, to be dealt with separately in another issue.  This would then allow for the full repeal of the existing data protection Acts which are intended for partial repeal under head 5 and their replacement by the GDPR in Irish law.<\/p><p> We think it would be a good idea if the GDPR is reproduced as either an annexe or appendix verbatim in the final Bill, together with a few domestic legislative variations which are provided for under the regulation.  As well as providing clarity for users and the courts in the consideration of what is quite a complex area of law &ndash; I am sure every lawyer says their pet subject is a complex area of law &ndash; but I hope the committee will agree that this one does seem to meet the bar for that description.  It also significantly reduces the chance of any legislative uncertainty as to what provisions are being applied by the court at any given moment.  Therefore, the likelihood of challenges to the interpretation by the new Data Protection Commissioner before the courts is reduced.  That is a valuable aim in itself.  The Data Protection Commission, which is set up, will be a new body exercising significant new powers and it is important for building up confidence in that body, but also in respect of the courts relationship with that body as a place of appeal from its decision making, that exactly the laws it is working under and exactly the powers it is implementing are as clearly set out by the Oireachtas, in advance of the commencement of the commission in order to allow the commission to fully exercise its rights without the fear of constant challenge, which we have seen in previous regulatory systems which have been introduced.  Particularly where large amounts of financial administrative fines are at stake there is an incentive for judicial challenge.  That is always available for people to take and if bodies or individuals feel they have not been treated properly by the Data Protection Commission, it is right that they should be able to take the matter to the courts.  We are suggesting, however, that in order to make sure that those appeals are minimised, it is best that the law the decisions are taken under is as clear as possible for all users.  <\/p><p> I want to deal with a couple of matters that Dr. McIntyre has raised, specifically the exemption carved out to give the Ministers powers to effectively grant an exemption to anybody on any matter they think relevant.  I think that is under head 20.  This is a matter that has been live before the European courts in recent years.  In 2015, the Bara judgment dealt with a data sharing provision by the Romanian Government on foot of legislation which the European Court of Justice said was not acceptable on the basis that it had shared this data between two government agencies and that doing this without the prior knowledge of the data subjects was contrary to the charter of fundamental rights and the data protection directive.  This is significant because it means that even when the matters are provided for by legislation, the State does not have a free hand to pass any such legislation that it wants to in order to carve out exceptions from a matter that is underpinned by the charter of fundamental rights.  In passing any such exemptions, it must give consideration to the questions of necessity or proportionality.<\/p><p> The heads of Bill take no account of these limitations on the national member state's executive powers.  They deal with a very wide range of stated and a general catch-all unstated basis on which these powers could be exercised, including such things as maintaining registers for reasons of general public interest.  This seems to be a general right to build databases in respect of the population.  Whether these provisions, if they were passed into legislation, would pass scrutiny before the European Court of Justice I could not say for sure, but certainly some provisions that are foreseen as being carved out by head 20 would fall foul of the same legal arguments that struck down the Romanian legislative provisions on data sharing.  I know the Data Protection Commissioner has issued a guidance note to State agencies on data sharing following the Bara judgment and the State has received guidance from its legal advisers in respect of the desirability of passing such data-sharing exemptions from the data protection directive by way of primary legislation.  It is important that if the State is to provide for certain matters to be dealt with and if primary legislation is required in order to ground an exemption from the data protection directive on a lawful basis, which is a provided for in the directive, it should not provide for non-primary legislative means.<\/p><p>It seems like a recipe for challenge and, in all likelihood, a recipe for the Data Protection Commissioner to have to deal with a repeated number of complaints and challenges to actions of the State.  There have been recent examples in respect of the primary online database where certain databases were rolled out with very long or indefinite retention periods involving holding the data of five year olds indefinitely and those matters have had to be rolled back following the engagement with the Data Protection Commissioner as to what was and was not appropriate under European law.  I do not think we should allow for an unqualified right of a Minister to provide for exemptions from European law at the stroke of a pen by way of a statutory instrument regardless of whether that is attractive to the Executive as a method of providing for regulatory activity.  It should be the case that we should go by way of primary legislation if there is to be a reliance upon the lawful basis exemptions from the data protection directive.  That is all I wanted to say on that matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017070500002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Simon McGarr","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1499241600,"counter":211,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McGarr and Mr. McIntyre for their contributions and their written submissions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017070500002#E00200","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1499241600,"counter":212,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McGarr and Mr. McIntyre for attending the committee meeting.  Listening to both of them and their views as to what areas in the legislation could be improved has been informative.  I will make a few comments about the structure of the Bill because both Mr. McGarr and Mr. McIntyre raised it.  They are correct in stating that it would be preferable if the 1988 and 2003 Acts were repealed in order that people who want to know what the law on data protection in Ireland is could come to one new piece of legislation and see it there rather than have to go back to legislation from 14 years ago and from 1988.  I had not been aware of the potential for confusion that can arise from the inclusion of Part 4.  There may be logic in trying to separate the GDPR legislative basis from the other one.  That is really a matter for Government.  It will be difficult for us to do that as a committee by way of an amendment, but it is an interesting point and something to which I will give further consideration.<\/p> <p>  In respect of the point made by Mr. McIntyre about the representation of data subjects, I would have thought there is a legitimate concern on the part of data controllers, the Oireachtas and Government that this could become an overly litigious area.  While there are people who have minor data breaches and who are perfectly entitled to have them ruled upon, there could be a concern on the part of the Legislature or Executive that it will involve lawyers taking cases, and even though there is minimal compensation to be paid, it will result in a lot of costs.  I can understand why that is a legitimate concern.<\/p> <p>  I am interested in the reference to the non-profit entities.  I looked at the definition of a non-profit entity in Article 80.  Will the witnesses provide us with further explanations?  What would be a non-profit entity in an Irish context?  Obviously, Digital Rights Ireland would probably be one.  Will Mr. McIntyre give us other examples?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017070500002#E00300","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1499241600,"counter":213,"content":"<p>Yes.  In fact, Digital Rights Ireland might not be the best example because I would envisage that this is an area where there might be consumer rights groups bringing actions.  I believe this is common in Germany.  Data protection rights are an aspect of consumer rights, and if a consumer rights body is active in the area of the protection of consumer privacy, there is no reason it could not bring an action.  I would envisage that trade unions might fall into that category as well if they are protecting the privacy of employees at work.  The National Union of Journalists might fall into that category if it was protecting the privacy of journalists from surveillance by the State.  It seems to me that it would not be limited to traditional civil rights groups but has a wider application.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy's point regarding the possibility of burdensome litigation is a fair one.  However, it is one that has already been addressed to a large extent.  The existing provisions deal with that.  The fact the Data Protection Commissioner has the discretion not to entertain claims that in current language are termed \"frivolous and vexatious\" represents an important safeguard that is already in place.  One can add to that the requirement there be a filter here.  The provision that only qualifying non-profit entities get to bring these actions is an important one.  I do not think many bodies would be set up with these objectives and have this track record.  It is ultimately open to the court to decide if the particular body qualifies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017070500002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. T.J.

People who are applying for their first passport must first take up a public services card.  That is a subsection of a wider question, which is relevant to the Bara judgment, which is that the State has taken many concrete steps in recent years to build not merely an ID database of which the public services card is the physical manifestation but also a series of national databases intending to capture not merely all citizens' data but also data on people travelling through the State by way of the passenger name recognition database, PNR, and on all residents, who may not necessarily be citizens, of course, by way of the individual health identifiers database.  On each occasion that these steps have been taken, provision has been made to take the data which has been collected from individuals by other agencies for other purposes and apply it to this new purpose, this data-sharing between bodies.  This is again exactly the matter that was before the Court of Justice of the European Union, CJEU.  It is again exactly the matter in which the Romanian Government was found to have acted unlawfully in transferring its data between its equivalents in Romania of our Department of Social Protection and Revenue Commissioners.  It seems to me that despite the Data Protection Commissioner producing an excellent briefing note for the State on these matters, there has still been, shall we say, executive reluctance to absorb fully the lessons of what European law states on the limits of state data-sharing.<\/p> <p>  Nonetheless, what we can see here and in other recent proposed legislation, including the proposed data-sharing Bill, is that there is an effort by the State to continue to provide a backstop for its projects that are under way and on which a great deal of money has been spent while at the same time not fully addressing head on the question of citizen's rights in respect of data-sharing.  That is not an attractive way for the State to have acted.  In particular, notwithstanding the very legitimate reasons there may well be, for example, in the health sphere, for creating databases which can contribute to public safety and to health safety, the level of trust that is required to allow databases of that sort to be built must be built first on the understanding of the citizenry as to what is being done and must be built up in order that they know it is being done in the right way and that they trust it is being done in the right way.  Internationally what we have seen is that if trust is not built first and there is an administrative push to collect the data and explain it to people later, very expensive and substantial projects fail completely.  I am thinking of the NHS care.data project, which was a centralised health records scheme that failed completely after the expenditure of million of pounds sterling in the UK as a result of a basic failure of public trust in how the data were going to be managed.  I am thinking of the Australian identity card scheme and public identity register which effectively came to creaking halt once the Australian people lost trust in the scheme as it was being provided for.<\/p> <p>  These matters are not tidying-up matters.  It is not a matter of going back and explaining it to people afterwards.  If trust is not built into the scheme from the start, if the necessary explanations cannot be provided, and if people do not think their legal rights to their data privacy are being respected, potentially very valuable public schemes become hamstrung from the very start.  It is not merely counterproductive from an administrative point of view and in terms of the loss of time and money.  It is also very destructive of the relationship between the state and the citizen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017070500002#F01500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Simon McGarr"},{"type":"speech","time":1499241600,"counter":245,"content":"<p>On that same theme, does the new legislation square with the ongoing health identifiers framework project which aims to have a database in place which will track every Irish citizen through the health service from birth to death?

It seems to me that there has been a rush to bring the project through.  Following the Bara decision, there was an acknowledgment that further advices needed to be taken to ascertain what its consequences were.  Regardless of what those advices might have been, there has been no hesitation, pause or slowdown in the implementation of the plan that was previously outlined.  It seems to me that the right to compensation which has been introduced in the GDPR cannot be removed by individual member states, even if the administrative fines element is left in.  On the question of whether the State is causing itself difficulties, I would argue that following the Bara judgment, the Health Identifiers Act does not comply with European law.  If this turns out to be the case following the decision of the court, there will be grounds for a claim of compensation for actual financial loss or for non-material loss.  Every single resident of the State - one will not need to be a citizen - will have a claim on the State in such circumstances.  Regardless of whether a resident has a financial loss as a result of the breach of his or her rights, he or she will have a right to compensation for non-financial loss.  The risk that the individual health identifier database poses to the Exchequer and to the relationship of trust between the State and its citizens is such that it would be very valuable for the matter to come under extremely close scrutiny between now and the implementation of the GDPR in May 2018.  It seems to me that the approach taken by the HSE, and perhaps to a lesser extent by the Department of Health, is that because this matter which has been legislated for, it intends to carry on until someone tells it to stop.  I am not sure whether that is the best way to deal with an extremely complicated matter where European law is moving forward and changing the grounds on which the risk assessment would be made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017070500002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Simon McGarr"},{"type":"speech","time":1499241600,"counter":250,"content":"<p>When I asked the Data Protection Commissioner about the information gathered by phone companies, she told me there is no specific provision under the Communications (Retention of Data) Act 2011 that obliges her office to notify a person about whom a request has been made for access to his or her telecommunications.

The first issue is the standard in Irish law under which surveillance can be carried out.  The standard in Irish law at the moment is that surveillance can be carried out on someone by ministerial warrant in the case of listening to his or her phone calls, and by individual internal Garda authorisation and signature in the case of accessing his or her phone records.  Following the recent judgment of the European Court of Justice in the Tele2-Watson case, I think it is reasonably clear that this is inadequate.  The judgment in question makes it clear that there must be judicial authorisation of surveillance in the case of accessing phone records and - all the more so, it seems to me - in the case of listening to phone calls.  The second issue is important as well.  In the Tele2-Watson case, the court went on to say that in addition to having prior judicial authorisation before phone records can be accessed, there must also be some form of after-the-fact notification.  In other words, the person whose phone records were accessed must be notified of that at a later stage - after the investigation has been concluded - as long as he or she can be notified without undermining a law enforcement purpose.  His or her phone records may have been accessed innocently or accidentally, or because he or she was incidentally involved in an investigation targeting somebody else, but nevertheless he or she should be notified of the fact that those records were accessed so that he or she can challenge them, if necessary, and say \"No, my phone records were wrongfully accessed, I was put under surveillance for an improper purpose and I want to take this matter further\".  As Deputy Wallace has pointed out, at the moment Irish mobile phone companies appear to be unwilling to respect this right.  At the moment, Irish law does not provide for this right.  It seems to me that because this is a requirement of the European Charter of Fundamental Rights, it is not just an obligation that is binding on the Irish State - it is an obligation that would be directly effective in the Irish courts.  It seems to me that in an appropriate case, this would be binding on the Irish courts and indeed on the Data Protection Commissioner in assisting individuals to exercise their rights under the charter and under the GDPR.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017070500002#G00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. T.J.

It does not have anything to say about the mandatory position under Article 81 of the directive that not-for-profit groups can bring actions on behalf of data subjects.  In other words, it does not provide for a group such as Digital Rights Ireland to be able to bring a claim on behalf of an individual who has mandated it to bring an action on his or her behalf.

One hand of the State is potentially doing one thing around the health indicators and so on, meanwhile regulation and rights are going in the other direction.  We have to do something.  It could be possible to deal with how that collision is to be addressed in this legislation to an extent   I do not really have a question but just wish to say that.  Without putting the witness on the spot or in a collision with the executive types, he is saying we need to reorder the way we have approached this.  We need to look at the repeal of the present Acts and then perhaps write this general data protection regulation, GDPR, as a form of full document with a domestic Irish consideration.

I had the opportunity of listening to the commentary of Mr. McGarr and Dr. McIntyre and I share many of the views articulated on the general points.  I am not going to dwell on the detail of the regulation.  I am going to focus specifically on the children's rights issues, which I believe are quite significant and profound, many of which have gone unnoticed yet will have profound implications for children, particularly on the age of digital consent.  Much of what I will say today involves a much broader consultation on the issues that arise under the general scheme.<\/p> <p>  As we know, the general scheme of the Data Protection Bill is a crucial step in Ireland's preparation for the implementation of new EU data protection obligations and it provides a much-needed update of existing data protection legislation in this jurisdiction, namely, the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003.<\/p> <p>  The two key items of European legislation reflected in the general scheme are the EU general data protection regulation and the directive on the use of personal data by criminal enforcement authorities.  The general data protection regulation was agreed in 2016 and mandates higher data protection standards for data subjects, imposing increased obligations on data controllers and processors.  It focuses on reinforcing individual&rsquo;s rights, ensuring stronger enforcement of data protection rules and streamlining international transfers of personal data.  A point made in the last session is one with which I agree.  As a regulation, the GDPR will take effect in this jurisdiction automatically from 25 May 2018 and does not require a transposition.  Nevertheless, the 2017 Bill significantly gives effect to its provisions and provides derogations where permitted.<\/p><p>I have identified at the outset of my presentation, for the ease of the committee, five key issues that are central to our consideration.  The first is on the age of digital consent, which I believe should be set at 13 years of age.  The Bill in its current form is silent on this issue.  The second issue is on the need for a definition of preventative and counselling services in order that blanket blocking of sites does not prevent access to much needed, and increasingly online, services for young people.  The third key issue is the right to be forgotten.  I have strongly articulated for this right on behalf of young people.  We all know that young people sometimes insert material online that they would regret afterwards.  We need to recognise and acknowledge the vulnerability of young people.  They need to have the right of erasure and this right is not mentioned in the Bill in its current form.  The fourth key issue is the link between data protection rights and digital safety.  I have spent many of my reports highlighting the importance of digital safety.  Digital safety is not about creating a nanny state; it is about empowering young people to understand the benefits and downsides of the online world, especially in terms of young people's exposure to cyberbullying.  There is another important and profound question in respect of adult data literacy.  Much more needs to be done in this jurisdiction.  I say this as a person who still has a Nokia phone, which means I am hugely challenged myself in the context of the online world.  The fifth key issue relates to the processing of sensitive data.  We have seen so much public discussion over the last year on the importance of ensuring that organisations that hold sensitive data protect those data and that sufficient safeguards exists to ensure that citizens' fundamental rights are not breached in circumstances where data end up in the public domain.  This is at the very core of the general data protection regulations.<\/p><p> In addition, it would be interesting to know whether children have been canvassed in respect of this Bill, and how they perceive its current form.  It must be remembered that children, like adults, have data protection rights under both EU laws and under the existing Irish data protection regime.  Children may not, however, depending on their age and their level of maturity and understanding, be in a position independently to exercise these rights.  In this vein, and throughout my presentation, it is necessary to bear in mind Recital 38 of the general data protection regulation, GDPR.  I am constrained by time and will not read the provisions but just wish to highlight them.  I am very happy to engage in any discussion on the various provisions in the international instruments.  This recital states \"Such specific protection should, in particular, apply to the use of personal data of children for the purposes of marketing or creating personality or user profiles and the collection of personal data with regard to children when using services offered directly to a child.\" It continues by stating \"The consent of the holder of parental responsibility should not be necessary in the context of preventive or counselling services offered directly to a child.\" I am particularly concerned about that and the absence of any definition in the regulation on what amounts to \"preventative or counselling services\".  Recital 38 explicitly recognises children as a separate and particularly vulnerable group in society with regard to data protection issues and I believe that it must inform the approach taken in the 2017 Bill in respect of the protection of the personal data of children.<\/p><p> I shall now turn to the digital age of consent, which is a key children's rights issue addressed in the Bill.  Part 3 of the general scheme of the Data Protection Bill 2017 sets out the heads of the Bill required to give further effect to the GDPR.  Head 16 of the Bill is particularly relevant from a child protection perspective.  It concerns the child&rsquo;s consent with regard to information society services and relates to Article 8 of the general data protection regulation, which sets the age under which children require parental consent to sign up to digital services &ndash; known as the digital age of consent.  Pursuant to Article 8, where a child is below the age of 16 years, data processing shall only be lawful to the extent that consent is given or authorised by the holder of parental responsibility over the child.  Member states, however, have discretion to provide by law for a lower age, once that lower age is not below 13 years.  When the age of consent is set, the data controller is obligated to make reasonable efforts to verify in respect of children below the age of consent that such consent is given or authorised by the holder of parental responsibility over the child, taking into consideration available technology.  There is no definition of parental responsibility.  It is a term alien to Irish law and it needs to be clarified.  I shall discuss this aspect later on.<\/p><p> Article 5 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, UNCRC, explicitly recognises that children have evolving capacities and that as they get older, they have a greater ability to take responsibility for decisions affecting their lives.  The aim of the general data protection regulation, in setting a digital age of consent, is to protect young people from commercial online marketing providers, for instance social media and gaming platforms.  The current situation whereby the same data practices are being used to target teenagers as those used to target adults is absolutely unacceptable and needs to be tackled.<\/p><p> In head 16 of the general scheme of the 2017 Bill, in its current form, the Irish digital age of consent has not yet been set out.  It is silent in this regard.  In the explanatory notes to the heads of the Bill, a consultation process on the appropriate age threshold is described as having been completed and it was indicated that the results of this consultation will be submitted to the Government for a decision in due course.<\/p><p> It appears, therefore, that no determination on this critical  issue has been made by the legislature at this point in time.  I believe that Ireland should take the opportunity now to designate the lowest permissible age - namely 13 - as the age of digital consent for this jurisdiction.  This lower digital age of consent has also been recommended by children&rsquo;s organisations such as the Children&rsquo;s Rights Alliance.  Ahead of this meeting with the committee I took the opportunity last week to discuss the issue with the Ombudsman for Children, who supports my view that the age of digital consent should be set at 13 years of age.  A variety of competing children&rsquo;s rights and practical realities support the argument that the appropriate age, having regard to the permissible age range delineated by the GDPR, should be the lowest age possible.<\/p><p> Members will see in my written submission that I discuss the key rights which include the right to participate.  The right of the child to participate and be heard in proceedings concerning him or her is a fundamental principle of international children&rsquo;s rights law and is enshrined by Article 12 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and in Article 24 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.  We heard Dr. McIntyre make reference to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, an instrument that is binding on our courts.  We should take particular regard to it.  It talks about children having the right to such protection and care as is necessary for their well-being.  They may express their views freely and we need to make sure that happens.<\/p><p> The importance of the voice of the child and the child&rsquo;s right to participate in all matters has been promoted recently in this jurisdiction when the Irish people voted in a referendum on children's rights, which must mean something.  We also see it reflected in through the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015.  The focus, however, has primarily been on private family law matters such as guardianship, access and custody.  In my view it is equally relevant in the context of the drafting of new legislation.  Ireland needs to do much more in terms of meaningful consultation with children where the legislation affects them.  This is why I urge this.  I am delighted that I now have the opportunity to present a children's rights perspective because all too often, apart from discrete children's rights issues, the Legislature does not take into account the impact the legislation will have on children.  Legislation such as this will have a profound impact on children into the future.<\/p><p> In line with the national policy framework, the National Strategy on Children and Young People's Participation in Decision-Making, 2015-2020 was launched.  It discusses the participation of young people.  Its goal is to ensure that children and young people have a voice in their individual and collective everyday lives and it explicitly acknowledges that their voice in decision-making requires a cross-Government response, with initiatives and actions from all key Departments and agencies.<\/p><p> With the national strategy and the recommendation of the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child in mind, it is unclear whether children have been consulted on the issue of Ireland&rsquo;s proposed digital age of consent.  While the explanatory note to head 16 describes a consultation process on the appropriate age threshold, which it declares as having already been completed, there is no comment in the explanatory note on what this consultation process entailed and in particular, who it involved.  In light of the child&rsquo;s right of participation, I believe that the views of, at the very least, a focus group of Irish children must first be garnered before any final decision is made on this question.<\/p><p>Information services technology and digital media play an integral role in the lives of our young people, as exhibited in statistics that I have attached to my submission.  Instead of reading them out, I will try to assist the committee by providing as much detail as possible on the likely impact of this legislation on children.  The committee will see from the statistics how critical it is that children be given an opportunity to have their perspective heard in this legislation.  Therefore, I recommend that a consultation process takes place to ascertain the views of a variety of age groups of children on the issue of digital consent.<\/p><p> Freedom of expression and freedom of assembly are very important.  The right to freedom of expression is a human right that is not confined in its remit to adults.  The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, UNCRC, guarantees a child's enjoyment to freedom of expression in Article 13.  Further related rights under the UNCRC include the right to access appropriate information, provided in Article 17, and the freedom to assemble peacefully.  Such assembly may take place in the context of an online environment.  We need to realise that the world has changed and that these basic human rights are as relevant in the online world as they are in the world to which we are accustomed.  That needs to be acknowledged in our legislation.  These rights are often exercised by children through their use of information and communications technology.<\/p><p> If members examine the statistics that I have furnished in my advance submission, they will see that so many children spend a great deal of time on the Internet on a daily basis that we need to consider how their rights are protected and vindicated in the online world as much as they are in the offline world.  We have been slow to catch up with technology in terms of child protection and children's basic human rights.<\/p><p> In a number of my previous rapporteur reports, I have highlighted the importance of the Internet for children's freedom of information.  While there is a genuine need and, indeed, obligation to protect children from the dangers of the Internet, the State must ensure that it does not unreasonably restrict children's civil and political rights, such as the right to freedom of information and expression.  The Child Rights International Network, CRIN, identifies instances of Internet service providers being pressured by state authorities to institute blanket filters to block websites containing material that is argued to be unsuitable for those aged under 18 years even though some of the sites contain material that could be important for the well-being of many under 18s, such as material on sexual education, politics and support groups for alcohol dependency and suicide.  Alcohol dependency is an issue that I have articulated in strong terms in the context of my recent audit report.  Society has been reluctant to engage with the issue and the Government has been reluctant to take on vested interests.  Now the time is right to deal with the issue and provide supports.  Sometimes, those supports can exist online.<\/p><p> The blanket filters to which I referred are arguably contrary to Article 5 of the UNCRC, which deals with children's evolving capacities.  Restricting Internet usage for children, for instance, by setting the digital age of consent at 16 years, should therefore be approached with caution and the varying rights at play must be borne in mind.  The overarching consideration must be whether any such restriction is in the best interests of the child.  This is mandated in Article 24 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, which provides that, in all actions relating to children, whether taken by public authorities or private institutions, the child's best interests must be a primary consideration.  I believe passionately that, to prevent any infringement of the child's right to express himself or herself freely and to ensure children's access to online information, the digital age of consent should not be set at 18 years, but at 13 years, which would be preferable in order to prevent a dramatic reduction in the participation of young people in online services.  This is an important point that the committee should take on board.<\/p><p> Due to time constraints, I will move to my next critical point, namely, the definition of preventive and counselling services.  The rights of children, namely, to participate in matters concerning them, to be heard, to express themselves freely and to access information, need to be exercised effectively by children.  On a practical level, therefore, certain realities must be considered to ensure that children are capable of exercising these rights in the context of their online activity and use of digital services.  A difficulty may arise in circumstances where the view of the child is not aligned to the view of his or her parents or guardians.  For instance, children may wish to access online services relating to sexual health or education, explore LGBT issues or seek support if they are being bullied.  Certain service providers in these areas regularly require and retain personal data from the young persons who access their services in order to improve and fine-tune the operation and content of same.  Thus, children's personal data may be processed and retained.<\/p><p> These types of issue may be ones that the children involved, for a variety of reasons, may not be comfortable discussing with their parents or guardians.  Children and young people often contact organisations or services in confidence and arguably should be allowed to continue to do so without having to obtain consent from their parent or parents.  If the digital age of consent was to be set at 16 years, this would in all likelihood operate to prevent children from accessing these services, something that cannot be said to be in their best interests.<\/p><p> While recital No. 38 of the general data protection regulation, GDPR, specifically provides that the special rules relating to the processing of children's personal data, namely, the requirement for parental consent, should not apply in the context of preventive or counselling services offered directly to a child, whether the variety of service providers envisaged in that context will come within the definition of \"preventive or counselling services\" is unclear and needs to be clarified.  For this reason, I am suggesting that consideration be given to defining \"preventive or counselling services\" in the broadest possible fashion so that children can avail of support when they need it.  I urge the committee to consider this point.<\/p><p> It will be also necessary to provide clarification on whether organisations that provide online support services to children will have to verify the consent of the child's holder of parental responsibility before processing the child's data for not-for-profit use.<\/p><p> My next point is on the related issue of the holder of parental responsibility and what that means.  It should be noted that head No. 16 of the general scheme does not contain any definition of the phrase \"the holder of parental responsibility over the child\".  \"Parental responsibility\" is a term that is more common to the UK and is not defined in our legislation.  This issue arose in the context of the children's rights referendum when we examined moving away from the terms \"custody\", \"guardianship\" and \"access\", but that has not happened.  For this reason, the Bill may be problematic.  Who is the \"holder of parental responsibility\"?  The term should be defined and include any parent and guardian of the child, whether automatic or court appointed pursuant to the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964.<\/p><p> What we saw with the commencement of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 was a broad range of family types being taken in from the cold and enhanced rights for a large number of citizens.  We saw the creation of temporary guardians, an expansion of testamentary guardians and rights for foster parents under section 6C of the 1964 Act, which means that foster parents or those who have been looking after a child for a period of one year when no other parent is willing or able to act can now have guardianship rights.  Those substitute parents on a day-to-day basis should be entitled to provide consent.  If they are handling the real parenting duties, they need to have commensurate rights.  Applying a wide definition to the phrase \"holder of parental responsibility\" is preferable so as to allow for a broader category of persons who may be responsible for a child to be able to give the requisite consent for the child in question.<\/p><p> A further concern relates to the involvement of the \"holder of parental responsibility\", in that many parents or guardians of children have lower digital literacy skills compared with their children.  Despite this, the GDPR places the responsibility to manage children's data protection on their parents and guardians where the child is under the digital age of consent.  Greater awareness among parents and a more robust information campaign are required.  The Department of Justice and Equality produced a good document, entitled \"Data protection safeguards for children ('digital age of consent')\", but we need to go one step further.  This necessitates the development of appropriate, child-friendly material by the Data Protection Commission \"which convey an understanding not only of the risks that may arise when personal information is supplied online but also the remedies that are available under data protection law.\"<\/p><p> I have championed and advocated the right to be forgotten year on year in my reports.  We need to consider this matter, particularly in the context of children.  In my ninth report, I discussed the right to be forgotten and its importance from the perspective of a child.<\/p><p>The right to be forgotten was held to exist in the seminal case of Google in Spain.  In that decision the European Court of Justice held that an EU citizen had a right to request commercial search firms such as Google to remove links to their personal information when requested to do so, provided that the information was no longer relevant, emphasising that an individual's right to privacy overrode the public interest in seeking access to information in certain circumstances.  Article 17 of the general data protection regulation concerns the right to erasure, known as the right to be forgotten.  There is no specific head in the general scheme that gives effect to that article.<br\/><br\/>The right to be forgotten is not only important for adults, although the public narrative has focused on this dimension.  It is probably even more important for children, as they are less likely than adults to be aware that information they post online may be available long term.  They may not consider the consequences of posting something online which may last long beyond their childhood.  While not stated in Article 17 of the general data protection regulation, it is suggested Ireland should take the opportunity to include specific provisions on this issue in the 2017 Data Protection Bill.  At a practical level, we know that with increased vetting across the world, searches are undertaken.  If a child posts something online, it could turn up in a search and have profound consequences.  If there is anything the committee should consider in protecting young people and their vulnerabilities, it is ensuring the right to erasure reflected in Article 17 of the general data protection regulation is explicitly provided for in the 2017 Bill.  As I argued, the relevance for children of the right to be forgotten should be acknowledged.  Children should be educated on the matter and it should be understood the age at which an individual posts information online should be considered to be a very important factor in decisions on whether to remove an individual's personal information from sites.<br\/><br\/>Another issue I have highlighted year on year is cyberbullying and cyber-harassment.  These are profound child protection issues.  I argue that the Internet is the new child protection frontier.  We need to ensure our children are properly protected online.  Much more needs to be done in that regard.  When we talk about protecting children's data, it is also about protecting children.  The general data protection regulation and the general scheme of the 2017 Bill cannot be considered in a vacuum.  There are risks associated with young people maintaining an online presence which cannot be ignored.  In this vein, the introduction of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 is to be welcomed and applauded.  The Act demonstrates Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to better protect its children from online predators and specifically recognises the dangers that come with technological advances by creating a wide range of new criminal offences dealing with child pornography and grooming, with a particular emphasis on the use of information and communications technology in such offences.<br\/><br\/>A further concern associated with children&rsquo;s Internet usage is the prevalence of cyberbullying and harassment.  Each year when I have raised this issue, I have received a large volume of correspondence from parents saying they are delighted I have done so as their sons and daughters have been affected.  The issue needs to be much more prominent on the political agenda.  We must take the necessary steps to protect our children as the problem is widespread.  One EU study indicated that 21% of children had been exposed to potentially harmful user-generated content such as hate, pro-anorexia and self-harm material.  In order to ensure children are protected from cyber-bullying in their online activities and that their personal data are not exploited, regard should be had to the recommendation of the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child that states should &quot;develop effective safeguards for children against abuse without unduly restricting the full enjoyment of their rights&quot;.  It is notable that Article 6(2) of the general data protection regulation enables member states to &quot;maintain or introduce more specific provisions to adapt the application of the rules to ensure lawful and fair processing&quot;.<br\/><br\/>To further address the issues raised concerning cyber-harassment and bullying, regard should be had to the recommendations I recently made in my tenth rapporteur report which is soon to be published.  I also endorse the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission in its 2016 report on harmful communications and digital safety concerning take-down procedures.  When content is put up online, there needs to be an effective mechanism to enable it to be taken down, which would ensure the efficient removal of harmful digital communications online.  The proposed office of the digital safety commissioner of Ireland would thereby oversee an effective and efficient take-down procedure in a timely manner, regulating a system of take-down orders for harmful cyber-communications made for both adults and children.  Alongside the right to be forgotten, there must be a procedure for taking down in a timely fashion offensive material posted online.  That is why I am strongly supportive of the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission.  The proposal made by the commission regarding the establishment of a new statutory oversight system appears to be a practical and viable solution to the current gap in Irish law.  I also recommend that consideration be given by the Government to chapter 3 of the commission&rsquo;s report to enable progress to be made in this regard and ensure steps will be taken to establish an office of the digital safety commissioner of Ireland.  There needs to be some joined-up thinking between the two offices.  In the light of the publication of the general scheme of the 2017 Data Protection Bill, the office of the digital safety commissioner of Ireland, if established, should be required to liaise with the Data Protection Commission operating pursuant to the 2017 Data Protection Bill.  Co-operation between the two bodies would be essential in protecting children and their data.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>The provision on the processing of special categories of data is very important.  Article 9 of the general data protection regulation concerns the processing of special categories of personal data.  I have a significant insight into this issue as I have spent the last two years conducting an audit of the exercise by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of its emergency child protection powers which I am sure will interest the committee.  I have looked at over 500,000 fields of PULSE data.  It has provided me with a unique insight into the discrete aspect of child protection within the Garda.  It is the largest audit worldwide of the exercise by a police force of its emergency child protection powers.  It is rich in giving us an insight into how the child protection system operates.  By and large, I have found that the Garda goes to great effort to deal with children sensitively in these circumstances.  In respect of data protection, it is equally relevant.  When sensitive personal data are gathered, we need sufficient safeguards to ensure they are treated appropriately.  That is why Article 9 is important.  The processing of special categories of personal data is permitted where it is necessary for the provision of health or social care or treatment or the management of health or social care systems and services, subject to suitable and specific measures being implemented to safeguard the fundamental rights and freedoms of data subjects.  I am a big believer in ensuring citizens' fundamental rights are protected.  We need to ensure that where there are derogations from the regulations, there are checks and balances.  If somebody's sensitive personal data are being used for what are purported to be health reasons, there must be accountability, which must also be the case where there are breaches and data end up in the public domain.<br\/><br\/>In the general scheme of the 2017 Bill heads 17 and 18 concern the processing of special categories of personal data.  Head 17 permits the making of regulations for the processing of sensitive data where &quot;necessary for reasons of substantial interest&quot;, while head 18(1) particularly provides that these categories of sensitive data may be processed where necessary for, among other things, &quot;the management of health and social care systems and services and for public interest reasons in the area of public health&quot;.  It can be imagined that these exceptions to the prohibition of the processing of sensitive personal data will enable the Child and Family Agency to process such data in the carrying out of its statutory role.  It will inevitably include sensitive data relating to children and young persons.<\/p><p> The 2017 Bill only allows this processing to take place on the condition that suitable and specific measures are adhered to in order to safeguard the fundamental rights and interests of the data subject.  As identified in the explanatory notes to Head 18, it is as of yet unclear as to the extent to which the \"suitable and specific\" measures referred to in Article 9 and included in the Bill are intended to be additional or complementary safeguards to those already placed upon data controllers elsewhere in the general data protection regulation or whether additional safeguards will be required.  <\/p><p> I am passionately of the view that consideration should be given to the inclusion of additional safeguards, particularly where a child's sensitive personal data is engaged and is to be processed by an agency such as the Child and Family Agency.  This should be explored having regard to Recital 38 of the general data protection regulation and the special protection required therein for the personal data of children.<\/p><p> I thank the members for taking time to listen to me this morning.

As one can see on the monitor, the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill is being debated in the D&aacute;il.  He cannot be in two places at the one time.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Shannon has mentioned a few areas that I would like to discuss.  As Deputy Daly mentioned, the right to erasure is something that I support.  Dr. Shannon has managed to highlight in his presentation some areas that have, heretofore, been ignored but are fundamental to children's right.  Officials from the Department of Justice and Equality attended here a number of weeks ago.  On that occasion we raised these matters with them.  Unfortunately, they failed to respond or give a reasonable answer for ignoring the full transposition of some of the issues mentioned in the report.  As Dr. Shannon has detailed about the right to erasure, as people are vetted and the online world grows it is fundamental that people can be forgotten, particularly children.  <\/p> <p>  As Deputy Daly mentioned, it would be a novel idea to introduce a full and comprehensive consultation process that involved children.  Perhaps Dr. Shannon can give details about other areas that he is involved in where such consultation takes place.  A focus group would allow children to play an active role in making decisions about issues that will probably affect their future children.  We should engage with children now.<\/p> <p>  We have all seen the predatory targeting of children by parts of the advertising industry such as the gambling and alcohol industries.  Studies conducted in the United States show that children had more knowledge of Budweiser than about basic things one would expect them to know.  I am not sure how to address the problem but I believe that we should address it in this Bill.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health is trying to bring in the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill and address some of the advertising restrictions.  This committee can address the matter and the digital age of consent when discussing today's Bill.<\/p> <p>  I agree with the call for the lowest age of digital consent to be 13 years.  It is another area of the Bill that has been ignored.  It seems the tough questions and tough policy responses have been completely ignored in terms of children's rights.  We need a comprehensive response and for the Bill, as drafted, to be amended.  Now is the time to make a positive change in order to protect children's rights in the future.  <\/p> <p>  Dr. Shannon has comprehensively addressed all of the issues.  I am sure many committee members will agree with me that we should amend the legislation thus enshrining children's rights properly in the context of data protection.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017070500002#M01500","speaker":"1255"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1499241600,"counter":297,"content":"<p>I shall first reply to Deputy Daly's questions in her absence.  She raised an important point about children being consulted.  I am quite happy to set out how the initiative could be realised.  There are two options available to the committee.  First, it can request the Ombudsman for Children to assist with a consultation of a large group of children.  The Office of the Ombudsman for Children is well positioned to undertake such a consultation process.  The focus group cannot be tokenistic and must cover a large number of age ranges.  We have pegged the age of digital consent at 13 years and it needs to happen.<\/p> <p>  I must confess to having a vested interest in the Children's Rights Alliance.  I am the founding patron of the Children's Rights Alliance.  The Children's Rights Alliance has conducted a similar exercise.  The alliance was responsible for children's voices being heard in Geneva.  Their voices were incredibly powerful because children can convey an unedited message, which is what this committee needs to hear.  All too often children are ignored when it comes to issues that directly affect them.  The impact these provisions will have on children should be central in this legislation.  <\/p> <p>  Deputy Chambers mentioned the age of digital consent.  It would be a cop-out not to make a decision about the age of digital  consent.  It is a hugely important issue for children.  If we leave the age of digital consent at the age of 16 in the interest of political expediency then we will have failed children.  Children are much more adept at technology than their parents and will use technology anyway.  We should support them in a way that allows them to engage with technology in a responsible fashion.  <\/p> <p>  The right to erasure is hugely important.  We all end up posting stuff online that we probably regret afterwards.  We do not take into account the vulnerability of children.  There is stuff that a child would post online that he or she would never post at 18 years or well into adulthood.<\/p><p>We should not lose the opportunity of enshrining definitively in a Bill dealing with data protection the right to erasure and to be forgotten, alongside the take-down procedure.  The take-down procedure is hugely urgent.  Consider the cases that have come before the courts.  There is a lack of legislation.  The law must keep pace with technology and it has not.  The victims are children.  We say we are concerned about children but that concern must be matched by the necessary services and legislation for children.  That is my view.<\/p><p> With regard to alcohol and gambling, I commend Senator Black on the extraordinary work she is doing on this issue.  I feel like a fellow traveller when it comes to raising this issue, because one encounters huge resistance.  I found over the last month that there is always some issue or justification from the alcohol industry, but I am delighted to have the opportunity to appear before the committee.  What is staggering about my report is that the common feature across the shattered lives of hundreds of children is persistent alcohol abuse.  I urge members to read chapter 3 which documents appalling abuses of children because of our reluctance to engage properly when dealing with alcohol.  It requires a cross-governmental approach and it must be led from the top.  We must continue to highlight this issue.  I have argued that it is one of the biggest challenges standing in the way of children having the best possible family life.  The failure on the part of society to address the alcohol problem properly leaves the child protection system dealing with insurmountable consequences.  That is how serious it is.<\/p><p> I feel strongly about the issue because I have spent two years looking at large amounts of data.  Visions of one case I looked at will always stay with me.  It involved a mother in a fast food joint throwing her child in the air like a ball because of alcohol abuse.  Such stories permeate the report.  I have always argued that after the outrage there must be action.  That action is the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill.  There appears to be a delay in passing that legislation, and the longer we delay the longer we put on hold the opportunity to help children who live in abusive environments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017070500002#M01600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Geoffrey Shannon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1499241600,"counter":299,"content":"<p>The alcohol control Bill is being blocked as well for some reason.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017070500002#N00200","speaker":"1255"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1499241600,"counter":300,"content":"<p>There are many of the same problems.

At last, I feel that somebody else is being a voice for children and families who have been impacted and devastated by alcohol and Ireland's unhealthy relationship with alcohol.<\/p> <p>  To refer back to the data protection legislation, we must highlight the way young people are targeted by certain industries such as the alcohol, gambling and sex industries.  It is shocking.  The subliminal messages being sent to children in this area are a huge concern.  It is very worrying, particularly with regard to the mental health issue.  I wish to highlight, in particular, the importance of the bullying that takes place and the vulnerability of young children to that.  I utterly support what Dr. Shannon said today.  There is no doubt that everything he said should be included in this legislation.  However, part of me believes there should be separate legislation relating to children and data protection.  It is a minefield when one thinks about it.  What Dr. Shannon said today demonstrates that fact.  There are so many different areas where children need 100% protection.<\/p> <p>  I support all aspects of what Dr. Shannon said.  I hope we will be able to include all of his recommendations in the legislation.  I certainly will support that.  I appreciate Dr. Shannon's support on the alcohol issue in this country, because I feel very frustrated.  We are aware of the issues with the lobbying, the power of the industry and what it is doing to block the legislation to protect its profits, without any consideration for families, children and those who have issues with alcohol.  It is a public health issue and it must be addressed.  Profits should not be put before public health.  I hope that the Government and the Opposition will support that legislation but, unfortunately, that is not happening and it is being blocked.  I thank Dr. Shannon and I look forward to working with him in the future.

On behalf of the chairman designate of the Heritage Council, Mr. Michael Parsons, and its members, I thank the committee for its invitation to address it today.  I am joined by Ms Beatrice Kelly, who is the council's head of policy and research.  For the committee's information, Ms Kelly is also currently the co-ordinator for the European year of cultural heritage.  I will return to the significance of that role within the Heritage Council at the end of my contribution.  I have circulated a detailed paper of the current work of the Heritage Council as regards today's theme of preserving Ireland's natural heritage, its flora, fauna and unique habitats.  The Chair will be pleased to hear that I am going to follow the structure of that paper.<\/p> <p>  It is important to place the work of the Heritage Council in context.  It is a statutory body.  Pursuant to its responsibilities under its founding legislation, the council proposes policies and priorities for the national heritage.  It works as a public service in the public interest.  It advocates a very contemporary approach to heritage management, conservation and development.  Contemporary heritage thinking is about people and the places they live, work and visit.  It is about forming an interaction between those people, their nature and the culture that is inspired by that nature.<\/p><p>Above all, it is about trying to improve the quality of the places where people live and work and the places we encourage others to visit.  Indeed, the Heritage Council recently submitted a draft of its emerging strategic plan to the Minister, Deputy Humphreys.  Three themes are identified in that plan, the working title of which is A Fresh Vision.  All three of them are relevant to today's topic and to cultural heritage.  The three themes are advancing national heritage priorities; nurturing a sense of belonging, identity and place; and ensuring a vibrant heritage sector.<br\/><br\/>At this point in the Heritage Council's development, I would equate it to a small to medium-sized enterprise.  It has a budget of &euro;6.2 million and 14 staff based in its national headquarters in Kilkenny.  It creates and directly supports over 60 other full-time posts in satellite and other organisations around the country.  Just 28 of those 60 posts are within the public sector.  The rest of them are in the private sector.  The Heritage Council's initiatives include heritage officers, the Discovery Programme, the National Biodiversity Data Centre, the Wicklow Uplands Council, the Bere Island development programme, the Burrenbeo Trust, Woodlands of Ireland, the Irish Walled Towns Network, the Museum Standards Programme for Ireland and the Irish Landmark Trust.  Members will be interested to know that the last three bodies I mentioned are all-island bodies.  The current Brexit situation may well have an impact on their work.<br\/><br\/>I am cognisant that I have just five minutes to summarise the detailed submission we have furnished to the joint committee.  I will run through it very briefly from the section headed &quot;Research, Enjoyment and Heritage Week&quot; on page 2.  The Heritage 1995 requires us to promote &quot;enjoyment of the natural heritage&quot;, which is quite a task.  The quality of research information and data is essential to informed decision-making.  The Heritage Council has a very strong record of providing research to back up its actions and to help the Government to make decisions.  The species decline figures that are set out in our submission paint a very sorry picture.  Much of the information on species decline that is published by the National Parks and Wildlife Service comes through the National Biodiversity Data Centre, about which I will say more later in my contribution.  People and communities want to change what is happening with regard to species decline.  A piece of research we did in 2016 indicated quite clearly that 84% of people want to get involved in nature conservation to stop species decline and biodiversity loss.<br\/><br\/>It has been decided that the theme of this year's Heritage Week will be &quot;It's in your nature&quot;.  It is hoped that this will help local communities to get involved in doing something about their local natural heritage.  The National Biodiversity Data Centre, which collates, manages, analyses and disseminates data on Ireland&rsquo;s biodiversity, was established by the Heritage Council ten years ago following a proposal to the Minister of the day.  Until that time, no scientific data were available to policymakers in Ireland to assist them in making informed decisions.  The centre, which is based in County Waterford, operates through a service-level agreement with a biotechnology company, Compass Informatics and provides eight high-end jobs.  It is recognised as the go-to place for biological information in Ireland.  This information is freely accessible to the public at large and to policy makers, land managers and educational bodies.  I will leave some samples of the publications produced by the centre with the committee.<br\/><br\/>Many members will be familiar with the heritage officer network, which is one of the Heritage Council's best-known initiatives.  This country's 28 heritage officers are employed by local authorities to provide outreach and engagement at local level.  This approach works because it is a national network supported by the Heritage Council.  The heritage officers work collaboratively together and with the communities they support.  This structure accounts for 25% of the Heritage Council's funding.  We support the salaries of the heritage officers with the local authorities on the basis of them producing a community-led local heritage forum and a county heritage plan, which then attracts grant support.<br\/><br\/>High nature value farming is a participatory partnership with local farmers based on the design, development and implementation of local farming for conservation initiatives.  As it is based on partnership, it contrasts greatly with the old-fashioned designation approach of imposition.  The quality of natural heritage is an essential part of agricultural policy.  High nature value farming, which is based on results, now operates very clearly in the Burren and on the Aran Islands.  It was initially led by a Heritage Council initiative.  Most recently, the programme has tried to ensure farming in Ireland receives workable and appropriately funded support under the Common Agricultural Policy 2014 to 2020.  It has had some success in that regard.  Our objective is to try to get high nature value farming recognised in the next Common Agricultural Policy round so that many more communities and local upland areas can benefit.<br\/><br\/>The development of the Wicklow Uplands Council and a series of Irish uplands partnerships is a practical example on the ground of where we have tried to make a difference by providing long-term regular support to local communities to allow them to achieve what they want to achieve within their countryside and landscape.  Examples of the work of the Wicklow Uplands Council are listed in our submission.  The most important and significant one in terms of today's discussion is the participatory approach to best management of the upland habitats in County Wicklow, which really centres on trying to resolve some of the problems of burning that we have recently encountered across the country.  The Irish uplands partnerships are emerging as part of a new initiative that is being driven this year as part of an effort to spread the benefits of this approach into 25 upland areas throughout Ireland.  The research material that has been provided to the joint committee contains a map that shows where those areas are.  This approach is backed up by research with the communities on the ground and is strongly based on meeting the socioeconomic needs of upland communities and ensuring they are in a position to exploit the opportunities available to them and realise their potential.<br\/><br\/>All the Heritage Council initiatives I have mentioned offer potential.  I have to say that the council's current capacity is enabling it to do little more than scratch the surface of its potential.  We hope this situation will improve by increasing the council's capacity to support local initiatives.  In 2015, the EU Commission stated:<\/p><blockquote>How do we devise a more effective way of integrating the management of natural and cultural heritage?  There is a growing awareness across Europe that nature and heritage management cannot be seen in isolation and need to be tackled in a more integrated way.<\/blockquote><p>That is what the Heritage Council is trying to achieve.  Ms Beatrice Kelly, as the national co-ordinator for the European Year of Cultural Heritage in 2018, will bring that message strongly to every corner of Ireland.  There is a need to embrace new approaches and new ways and to find a fresh vision for heritage in rural, urban and peri-urban environments.  The Heritage Council is trying to ensure the best possible information about all its work is available to the Government at local and national levels and available to the communities that put all Governments in place.  All of this is needed if, collectively, we are to get this right for the people of this country and take the opportunities that are presented.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22017070500002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Starrett","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1499260500,"counter":315,"content":"<p>Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat.

In common with the National Trust, we hold properties, mainly areas of wildlife reserve.  We were pioneers in the protection of bogs and taking areas of bogland into conservation in the 1970s.  An Taisce is very widely known for its involvement in schools and education projects, including a new project in County Limerick which is pioneering learning about forests.  We have an active role as an advocate for sustainable development, climate action and protection of nature through our consultee role in the planning process for agriculture and forestry, and in public advocacy and public debate generally.<\/p> <p>  We live in a time of global species loss and we have an obligation, which is not just ethical and moral but which comes under the UN Biodiversity Convention, to protect marine, terrestrial and other species.  We have a reporting system in Ireland for the state of our habitats through the EU habitats directive's Article 17 reporting process.  That takes place every six years, most recently in 2013.  These are habitats which are rated as being of international importance.  Of the 59 habitat evaluations, only five had favourable status.  Thirty were inadequate and 24 were bad.  The bad status habitats were concentrated in raised and blanket bogs, heathland areas and species-rich grasslands.<\/p> <p>  Of the 61 species overall assessments, only half were favourable.  Looking at individual species and bird species in particular, there are currently threats to key bird species such as the hen harrier and the curlew and there is a continued decline in red grouse numbers.  Looking at the marine environment, European fisheries data for northern Atlantic European waters suggest that 40% of fish species are being overfished beyond their safe population maintenance values.  Along our inner and coastal waters, there is damaging scallop and razor clam dredging, problematic agricultural impacts which are not being properly addressed and new impacts such as mechanical kelp harvesting in Bantry Bay.<\/p> <p>  Although we have signed up to nature conservation policies and legal objectives at UN and European level, we are pursuing policies at national level which are in direct conflict with these actions through agricultural intensification.  The environmental non-governmental organisations have collectively published a document entitled Not So Green, which raises issues with the targets which were adopted in Food Wise 2025 and how they conflict with water and nitrates standards.  Recent data show a mounting problem with nitrates.  The document also addresses the decline of ten key farmbird species, the extinction threat facing one third of bee species and issues around species-rich grasslands.  This year the deliberate burning of land was highlighted, which was so serious in Gougane Barra in Cork and in the Cloosh Valley in Galway.  We have a forestry incentive scheme which has not been subject to proper environmental and cumulative assessment as required by the habitats directive.  That is exacerbating the pressure on species-rich grassland and on the hen harrier.<\/p><p>We have the Irish Sea, which is now being described as an ecological wreck, and we have inadequate resources to respond to this with the required actions.  The National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, is inadequately resourced and successive national biodiversity action plans are weak in their scope and impact and have no real effective targets.  There is no action to address the status of proposed natural heritage areas, which continue to operate with a legal limbo status.  We have a national peat land strategy which is entirely ineffective because it does not address the continued decline of blanket bogs and heath areas.  We have only now, because of legal action by the European Commission, faced up to the conservation of the remaining 1% of raised bogs with a conservation plan and turf-cutting scheme now in place.<br\/><br\/>The answer for this is that we must have a new vision for nature.  An Taisce plays a major part in this because the key is public engagement.  There is a very important concept that is now internationally understood and recognised, which is not just to consider the intrinsic value of nature - that must be paramount - but also what is defined as the concept of &quot;ecosystems services&quot;.  That should not sound too technical.  It is simply the services that nature provides to maintain clean water, soil quality, fish stocks and pollination.  As we face increasing climate change risk, natural services and natural functions, the restoration of river flood plains, wet woodlands, wetlands and peatlands have a major function in slowing down penetration of rainwater flows down river valleys causing flooding.<br\/><br\/>The NPWS needs to be adequately resourced with timetabled and targeted plans.  We need to not just tinker with the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, but to completely reconstitute the CAP and the entire agricultural subsidy system to ensure that nature comes first.  Biodiversity enhancement should be the central objective of all Government Departments and agencies, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Forest Service and Teagasc, with the reconstitution of the legal remit of those targets and agencies.  Instead of the scatter-gun approach to rural environmental protection, which has not worked - including the successive rural environment protection schemes, REPS, agri-environment options schemes, AEOS, and other schemes - we need to look at models which the Heritage Council has already mentioned, such as the Burren life scheme, for area based high-nature value farming initiatives which could be combined, where ecologically appropriate, with historic native woodland restoration.  We need to work on the great tradition of co-operative structures that we had in Ireland that were developed in the early 20th century, and these would have multiple benefits, not just to those communities, but in carbon soil management, flood attenuation, recreational amenity and tourism development.<br\/><br\/>We must completely rethink our relationship with the marine environment, which has been a story of continuous decline of one stock of fish species, only to move on to another when the first is exhausted or overstretched.  There is a legal mechanism under the marine strategy framework directive to give better protection to marine life and habitats through the designation of marine protected areas.  It has been shown that these designations, for instance for areas restricting fishing, allow fish populations to recover with greater benefit in surrounding areas as well as protected areas.<br\/><br\/>We need to have a meaningful peatland strategy which would endorse and activate the recommendations contained in the EPA bogland report for 2011, which are science-based and target-based.  We need to adopt river flood management strategies which are based on working within actual systems and to ensure that our actions in taking climate mitigation - including alternative energy interventions in wind, solar and biomass - do not conflict with biodiversity.  We need more effective action plans for invasive species and, with Brexit, to ensure that cross-Border co-operation on nature protection, and particularly the cross-Border habitats, which are designated under EU directives, are not endangered.<br\/><br\/>I would like to conclude by quoting from Pope Francis' encyclical, <i>Laudato Si'<\/i>, <i>Praise To<\/i>, which refers to our common home and gives a very strong message on the need to stabilise our climate and our common home, and to cherish each creature which has its own purpose, where none is superfluous.  It states that we must go beyond individual and sectoral interest to look at multi-generational interest for the future as, and I quote, &quot;the world we have received also belongs to those who will follow us&quot;.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22017070500002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ian Lumley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1499260500,"counter":322,"content":"<p>Bh&iacute; sin an-suim&uacute;il.

T&aacute; br&oacute;n orm.  T&aacute; p&iacute;osa beag that I have at the moment, but hopefully that will change over the summer, Mr. &Oacute; Cuinneag&aacute;in.  The presentations have been very insightful, and I thank the witnesses for taking the time to be with us today.  I know much preparation work goes into being here and I have had the pleasure of meeting with both Mr. Michael Starrett and Mr. Ian Lumley here previously, so I am delighted to have them here today.<\/p> <p>  On Mr. Liam &Oacute; Cuinneag&aacute;in's proposition to use the Irish language more as a tourism attraction, he talked about Gleann Cholm Cille and how the landscape has so much history itself.  Unfortunately, not every nook and cranny of Ireland has that benefit of a cultural attachment with regard to big names, historical events or historical buildings attached to that, but I like his idea or premise, perhaps, of thinking differently about the Irish language and how it could be used.  I would say that perhaps we are not taught the love of the language firstly, and our educational experience has not been about the love of the language, but it was more something that we had to do.  Does Mr. &Oacute; Cuinneag&aacute;in see opportunities in schools for how we could change that mindset and thought-frame?  I wonder about other parts of the country where there is not natural tourist attraction in the area such as in Gleann Cholm Cille, and how the Irish language could be used.  I will be very parochial about it and use the Cavan-Monaghan region as an example.  How could we initiate Gaeltacht in counties such as that that maybe do not have a natural gr&aacute; for it, or maybe have that impetus such as there is in Gleann Cholm Cille to promote the language?<\/p> <p>  On Mr. Michael Starrett's presentation, I was deeply involved with the heritage officer.  It is a great credit to Ms Anne-Marie Ward and Ms Shirley Clerkin in Monaghan County Council, who do fantastic, real, tangible work on the ground that gets our local communities involved in the Golden Mile, in the discovery of the castle in Clones, and Heritage Week is a fantastic impetus for all that.  It is similar to getting people involved with the arts, but with heritage, for people who do not necessarily have an inroad to it.  Heritage Week and the Golden Mile provide an opportunity for those from all walks of life to get involved and to have an appreciation of heritage and culture.<\/p> <p>  I think Mr. Starrett said that there are 28 heritage offices around the country.  From our point of view, what more could we do to provide resources that might be needed to have a greater impact?  Mr. Starrett told us a little about how important the buy-in is from the local authority.  I know that there are targets to meet laid out the five-year heritage plan.  The heritage forum is very important too for getting people involved.  If the ordinary Joe Soap in our communities is not involved, there is an issue.  Creating a link with local authorities and with communities has been a real success of our heritage officers.  Could Mr. Starrett expand on that a little bit more for us?  I think the Heritage Council has done a very hands-on, bottom-up approach by having that engagement with the local authority.  Is there any involvement with our education and training boards, ETBs, across the country in the Heritage Council, or could there be?<\/p><p>Is that something we could work on for the witnesses?<\/p><p> Mr. Starrett spoke about Brexit, which is the greatest challenge faced by all of us in decades.  What are the challenges for the Heritage Council, and this question is to Mr. Lumley also in terms of An Taisce not just for the organisations, but in terms of the work they do?  Does Mr. &Oacute; Cuinneag&aacute;in see that having an impact on his organisation?  What are the opportunities it might present, and what can we do to enhance those?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22017070500002#E00300","speaker":"1271","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1499260500,"counter":325,"content":"<p>I am leaving myself open to an accusation that I am putting a monetary value on the Irish language.

I wish that were seen by all.<\/p> <p>  The growth in the Gaelscoileanna movement and in Irish language projects outside the Gaeltacht reflects the Deputy's question.  It is the case that other communities are seeing the value of the language and the cultural heritage.  Ms Bernard&iacute;n Nic Giolla Ph&aacute;draig, who is here with me from &Aacute;ras Chr&oacute;n&aacute;in, in Clondalkin, is involved with our project, but one of the reasons I asked her to join me is because it is an excellent example of a growth in an urban Gaeltacht.

In &Aacute;ras Chr&oacute;n&aacute;in or Oideas Gael, we found that people might come on a music course, hear other people speaking Irish and enjoying it, and come back the following year to do an Irish course or, in our case in &Aacute;ras Chr&oacute;n&aacute;in, take up an Irish class on the next term.  It is about showing people that all of these areas are not separate.  Obviously, all of it comes from a love of the language and the culture, but there is an economic offshoot to it.  For example, one of the projects &Aacute;ras Chr&oacute;n&aacute;in has been very involved in with other community groups is in getting Br&uacute; Chr&oacute;n&aacute;in, the newest heritage centre in the country, opened last Monday.  That has been a 14 year long project, working with the Office of Public Works, OPW, under the leadership of South Dublin County Council, but it was as a result of a vision from the people.  In that centre we have 28 young people from the locality employed as and from this week.  The Happy Pear has taken over the management of the restaurant in the centre.  That started as a heritage project, but because the Irish language is so important in the area, everything is bilingual.  It is now envisaged that many national schools in particular from throughout the country will want their school tours to visit the centre because it is interactive and there is much fun to be had by children and also adults.  I encourage all the members to come and visit us in Clondalkin.<\/p> <p>  Last spring, we trained 45 volunteers who will be working on the heritage aspect.  When it came to them choosing a name for the centre and for themselves, even though only about one fifth of them are Irish speakers, the English speaking element said it would have to be as Gaeilge.  That is now part of the image of our area.<\/p> <p>  We are an urban centre, but we frequently hear about the Government wanting to encourage rural Ireland and the concerns of people living in rural Ireland.  From my point of view and that of Mr. &Oacute; Cuinneag&aacute;in - we are singing off the same hymn sheet - we have to look at our natural resources, not just our landscape and flora and fauna, but also our culture - music and dancing - and our language.  If we try to see those as a cohesive whole, that is where the future lies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22017070500002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Bernard&iacute;n Nic Giolla Ph&aacute;draig"},{"type":"speech","time":1499260500,"counter":327,"content":"<p>In terms of-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22017070500002#F00400","speaker":"1271"},{"type":"speech","time":1499260500,"counter":328,"content":"<p>The Deputy has one minute left of her ten minutes, but she can come back in later.

The business model of the Heritage Council is very deliberatively chosen.  We have 14 staff, but we have great outreach.

There is a very serious environmental concern about the impacts of Brexit on this country, but I can convey a positive example in the Deputy's own constituency where a major co-operative initiative is about to be launched in the Sliabh Beagh area, which is an upland heatland.  It is the highest point in County Monaghan, running into Tyrone, where there is a cross-Border nature conservation initiative to protect that area, which is one of the major refuges of the hen harrier.

We have no objections to hedges being cut inside the ditch but hedges outside the ditch on the public road and thoroughfare should be cut all year round.  I have never seen a bird standing up outside the ditch and say the traffic or people passing by are doing it harm because they are not that foolish.  They go inside the ditch to nest.  What we are talking about is nonsense.  People use public roads to travel or to walk to do exercise, which we are told to do for our health, but in many places they cannot because the roads are too narrow and they are out in the middle of the road.  Pedestrians are getting killed because of this.  Mr. Lumley did his very best to stop people cutting turf.  He may have some other way of heating his house and I am glad if he has, but in country places a lot of other people do not.  They depend on cutting a bit of turf for the fire and he fought to stop them.  We have that rectified and many people can cut their turf now who were told they could not do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22017070500002#G00400","speaker":"1320"},{"type":"speech","time":1499260500,"counter":336,"content":"<p>Does the Deputy want to give the witnesses a chance to answer the questions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22017070500002#G00500","speaker":"1235"},{"type":"speech","time":1499260500,"counter":337,"content":"<p>I have a couple of other things to address.  We will protect the hen harriers but why has Government refused to compensate the farmers?  We often hear of burglaries of houses when people are out of their houses but what is the story when the farm is taken from them completely and they are robbed in cold daylight?  They are getting no compensation.  They will not be allowed plant forestry in it.  They will not be allowed to turn the ground.  They will not be allowed to do anything with it.  This Government and the previous one have stood up and refused to give proper compensation to these people.  It is totally wrong.  I believe An Taisce is supporting this project of keeping farms for the hen harrier.  It is fine to protect the hen harrier but we must protect people and their incomes first.  It is wrong to take their farm away from them as has been done.  I am all for the curlew and the ground nesting birds but An Taisce fails to realise the other issues.  There is an idea abroad that we cannot shoot foxes at night.  Do the witnesses know that foxes kill the birds?  They kill the ground nesting birds.  It is a direct attempt to stop people getting proper income from the farm which they deserve after farming it.  Farmers cannot shoot foxes at night.  The foxes are not so foolish that they will come around in the middle of the day and say, \"I am here now, you can shoot me now\".  It is absolutely ridiculous.  There are a lot of other vermin out there.  If An Taisce went after those like it went after the foxes, people might appreciate what it is at more.  We cannot touch a badger.  At the same time, farms are wiped out.  Herds are cleaned out when farms are infected with TB.  Herds of cows are loaded into lorries and taken off to factories and men who have given all their lives trying to build the farms up are driven down to the ground.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22017070500002#G00600","speaker":"1320"},{"type":"speech","time":1499260500,"counter":338,"content":"<p>There is only two minutes left for a response if the Deputy is looking for one.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22017070500002#G00700","speaker":"1235"},{"type":"speech","time":1499260500,"counter":339,"content":"<p>I will just say there are others.

There are facts and figures and statistics that are easily available which show thousands of single houses are being built, and have been built, in County Kerry over the past decade.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the cutting season, the restriction on the cutting of hedgerows is for the nesting season.  Good hedgerow management allows for the cutting of hedgerows in advance of the nesting season and after.  There has been considerable controversy over the Heritage Bill which is before the Oireachtas.  The views of the environmental NGOs are well known and are that the existing hedge cutting season should be maintained.  <\/p> <p>  On the turf cutting issue, I am the NGO representative on the Peatlands Council and the situation has been resolved.  The remaining 1% of raised bogs are protected under European law.  We failed in the late-1990s to introduce the protecting measures that were needed and a lot of time was lost.  An effective mechanism has been put in place in compensation, relocation and resource conservation plan is in place.<\/p> <p>  With regard to hen harriers, we have been advocates of an areas based approach to sensitive habitats like the hen harrier areas that should benefit from a higher level of farm support and other grants as part of a fundamental reform of the CAP system.  Those hen harrier areas can be integrated with high nature value farming areas.  I am not clear about the issue raised on foxes because foxes are not one of the species under the current habitats reporting system.  Badgers are a very controversial issue.  We raised in our submission a very interesting pilot scheme that has been initiated in County Down in Northern Ireland for badger inoculation.  Badgers are as much sufferers of TB as cattle.  The cross-infection issue is very controversial and is the subject of ongoing research.<\/p><p>Mink is an invasive species and is extremely damaging to other native species.  Part of the reason seagulls are coming into urban areas and being more present among us is they have lost their historic and traditional feeding sources or those feeding sources have diminished.  These include the herring, mackerel and pilchard shoals that were once prevalent around our shores and have now been lost through overfishing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22017070500002#G01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ian Lumley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1499260500,"counter":344,"content":"<p>I have a number of questions but first I thank the witnesses for attending and the fantastic work their organisations do.  There is no doubt that there is to a certain extent a conflict between the work of organisations that are involved in the protection of our natural environment and how certain communities feel their livelihoods are affected by it.  Often the source of the conflict is the fact that the Government is not necessarily focusing resources on the communities in that particular zone.  If resources were put into that particular zone, it would alleviate some of the difficulties that those communities have with regard to some of the restrictions they experience in terms of the protection.<\/p> <p>  If we look to the United States and to Britain, they have a massive respect for their wild spaces.  Perhaps this is because they have had a bad history in that regard.  However, if we were to ask an American what it is they are most proud of in their country, we would be told their wildlife and national parks.  The way Britain treats its woodland is an example to ourselves.  There are good examples in this country though.  The work that the witnesses' organisations do are good examples of it.  For example, the re-wilding of Nephin is an interesting project.  If we sterilise our country from its heritage and its natural habitat, we will be a very sorry generation in a number of years.  Our own survival depends on this.  Pollinators have a massive economic effect on the development of agriculture in the country.  If we reduce the spaces in which those pollinators can function, we hit ourselves economically in the pocket.<\/p> <p>  One of my current problems with our forestry policy is that Coillte is forced to be completely self-sustaining and has to focus a lot of its efforts on the commercial aspects of its work.  There are other aspects to its work, but it seems that the forestry we are planting is nearly all sitka spruce, which offers limited opportunity for our natural wildlife.  What are the witnesses' views on that point?  Are the heritage officers employed full time?<\/p> <p>  I was looking through some of the documentation furnished to us.  I have four young kids who would be fascinated by this.  I raise my kids in Irish.  If I were to go to try to find out the Irish for heather shieldbug, it would take me a while.  Could the National Biodiversity Data Centre use more Irish in its documentation so that it would be easier for the likes of ourselves?<\/p> <p>  On river parks, I was in Toronto recently.  I was told that from now on river areas that are close to the cities are not to be built in.  Some 500 yd on each side of the river are left as parks.  Is there any opportunity for such a development in Ireland in urban areas with more than 10,000 people.  Could we allow for those river areas to be parks for people to enjoy in the future?  <\/p> <p>  Can we have an update on genetically modified, GM, foods in the country?  Are there any efforts by large companies to carry out tests and so forth here?<\/p> <p>  Deputy Healy-Rae focuses on real concerns among real people in real parts of the country.  How do we create the balance of achieving the objectives of An Taisce and the Heritage Council and not feel that a certain section of society is being marginalised in some fashion? <\/p> <p>  With regard to the Irish language, many people in this country say that the Irish language is shoved down the throats of people.  That is complete baloney.  In actual fact, there are tens of thousands of people who want to use the Irish language but the State is refusing to use it with them.  Gaelscoils were mentioned.  Some 25% of parents want Gaelscoils but only 5% are given them.  If a person wants to open a Gaelscoil, he or she will face a ten, 15 or 20 year battle to prove the demand.<\/p> <p>  Cad a cheapann an tUasal &Oacute; Cuinneag&aacute;in faoin titim, de r&eacute;ir an daon&aacute;irimh, i l&iacute;on na ndaoine at&aacute; ag &uacute;s&aacute;id na Gaeilge i dT&iacute;r Chonaill?

In talking about contemporary thinking on heritage, public engagement and all that is to do with natural heritage management, I emphasise that we cannot have a designation, an imposition and a regulation that people do not understand.  Otherwise they will rebel against it.  The way that the original special areas of conservation, SACs, were transposed into Irish law caused problems.  I touched on the fact that the science really only became available to make those decisions once the National Biodiversity Data Centre was established.  Once it was there and we had quality data and information, designations and so on could be justified.  There is some catching up to be done in terms of public perception.  Our research and what we have tried to do is concentrated on improving that relationship and work on public engagement.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman also touched on legislation for important landscapes in the UK and the USA.  For my sins, I spent most of my working life looking at, studying and working in this area.

There are specific examples.  There was a policy proposal from the Heritage Council, which I will ensure the committee gets, on that type of legislation just prior to the recession.  It may be time to bring it to the fore again.<br\/><br\/>On forestry policy, the Heritage Council has produced clear statements on forestry.  We work primarily through an organisation known as Woodlands of Ireland which is jointly funded by the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the Heritage Council and the Forestry Service.  I think it has had a great influence on the management of our commercial woodlands.  By any rational judgment, Coillte has changed its approach within the last few years.  It is still driven by the economic imperative but, in terms of recreation and its embracing of a more fixed type of forestry, great progress has been made. <br\/><br\/>On river parks in urban areas, our national headquarters is in Kilkenny.

A good model, which has already been mentioned by the Heritage Council and is internationally recognised as a success, is the Burrenbeo or BurrenLife scheme, which is in the limestone pavement areas of the Burren that maintain traditional grazing.  Were that grazing abandoned, scrub would grow and shadow over the wildflowers that are a unique feature of the Burren.  We must remember that Ireland is very much a man-made landscape since human colonisation.  There were some centuries after the Ice Age, then we were deeply forested and there were extensive areas of bog.  There is hardly any part of the country that has been untouched by man, but we need these structures and initiatives to be ratcheted up on a larger scale.<\/p> <p>  An Taisce is a consultee on the forestry applications and several come in every week.  It is unfortunate that on a piecemeal basis and in relatively small areas of land, we have yet further blocks of conifer plantation, with some tokenistic inclusion of broadleaf species around the edges or a bit of the corner and it is often on land that is unsuitable, such as peatland or land that has species with grassland or is in an area that causes conflict with hen harriers.  It would be preferable to move to a vision of having a serious national programme of native woodland restoration.  Look at how rich the Irish language is in our placenames.  For instance, take the number of places in the country that have the word \"doire\" in them, reflecting that there was an oak wood in that place.  Let us look at the locations that do not conflict with intensive farming or biodiversity where we can have large-scale native woodland restoration.  That would have multiple benefits.  Those woodlands would be a carbon sink.  They would also play a major role in flood attenuation in river catchments and on upland areas because woods have the effect of slowing down high rainfall drainage into rivers.<\/p> <p>  We are very supportive of park initiatives and of using the canals.  We seek potential to follow on from the success of the Mayo and Waterford greenways and using redundant railway lines as recreational routes.  An Taisce, in fact, is the owner of the Boyne Navigation, which has been developed as a recreational canal route between Navan and Drogheda.  There are conflicts to be addressed also.  Many of the members may be aware that issues have arisen on the River Barrow relating to protecting the riverine ecology and plant life of the Barrow against its enhanced use for walking and cycling.<\/p> <p>  On the GM issue, I am not aware of any recent proposals for testing in Ireland but we should all bear in mind that GM is coming into us in all sorts of indirect ways in soya products, animal feeds and other things.

It should talk less and listen more and I am sorry Mr. Lumley did not get that same listening time from a colleague because he paints a grim picture which the Oireachtas needs to hear.  The Pope is right.  We are not the only species living on the planet and yet capitalism, imperialism and public policy still erode the fabric of the earth.<\/p> <p>  Turning to biodiversity, are we in the middle of a biodiversity action plan?

As Mr. Lumley has mentioned, the views of various non-governmental organisations and groups in respect of the Heritage Bill 2016 are well known.  I share many of those views.

They have all cut their cloth and survived the recession.  They have all suffered job losses and the Heritage Council has also suffered in terms of capacity.  We have a small team anyway but to lose two staff members out of 16 represents a big percentage loss.  We have clearly signalled that we want to incrementally build that back up again.  In the emerging strategic plan we are seeking to build that up over the course of the next five years, to just under &euro;10 million initially in the first year and back up to more than &euro;20 million by the fifth year of that plan.  That is not an unreasonable request in terms of what the Heritage Council can achieve and hopes to achieve in its new vision.  Of course we have to gain Departmental and political support to allow that to happen.<\/p> <p>  The Senator mentioned legislation.  The Heritage Council has been quite clear in this regard.  The Wildlife Acts 1976 and 2000 have certainly sat for a long time and are in need of comprehensive revision.  I would like to see that in a programme for Government in the future.  I have already touched on the need for a new form of legislation which could help to resolve the issues - enabling and empowering legislation for our landscapes and countryside, for example,  which could involve communities.  Again, the Heritage Council has firm proposals which could help develop that type of approach.  <\/p> <p>  There was a move to consolidate all national monuments legislation and great progress had been made in that area.  That also relates to communities and cultural and national heritage.  To be honest I am not clear how that legislation is progressing but it is a provision which needs to be undertaken as soon as possible. <\/p> <p>  There is a commitment in the programme for Government to produce a new national heritage plan which will, and should, be led by the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  The Heritage Council is ready to help and assist in whatever way it can to bring that to fruition.  <\/p> <p>  I believe I have covered all the points which were directed at me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22017070500002#K00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Starrett"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1499260500,"counter":364,"content":"<p>I would first like to raise the status of the biodiversity plan.  Many organisations and nearly every statutory body including the Heritage Council and the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, have strategic plans.  The NPWS's plan for 2017 to 2021 was subject to a public consultation earlier this year.  Worryingly, a number of recommendations and actions in the published draft were watered down from an earlier draft prepared last year, particularly in the area of giving enhanced protection and status to natural heritage areas, most of which are only proposed natural heritage areas under the Wildlife Acts and have no legal status.  There was also a watering down in the area of giving active support to threat response plans for endangered species like the curlew.<\/p> <p>  There is a real worry in that regard and I cannot help but suspect that there is an unwillingness to admit failure.  The targets in the two previous plans have clearly failed because the NPWS was not given the resources.   That has shown up in the continuing Article 17 reports and the update data which is coming in.  Major initiatives are being taken.  There is programme running at the moment to halt the decline of the freshwater pearl mussel.  We are waiting for data on that to come in.  The NPWS is simply not given the resources which it needs.  <\/p> <p>  Major policy decisions at Government level are consistently sector driven.  The agricultural targets are very much driven by big agricultural business, such as the targets for increasing dairy production under Food Harvest 2020 and Food Wise 2025.  The marine sector's plan, Harnessing our Ocean Wealth, is very much based on exploitative extraction targets.  These are then supported by the full weight of industry and by the major lobby groups which represent those industrial sectors.  The voice of nature and the status of the NPWS are left very weak.  Over the years I have been at many stakeholder consultations.  It is very difficult because one often sees that the NPWS is just trying to limit damage, because a target or policy has been adopted which will have the obvious effect of increasing intensification.  That is why we need to look way beyond resourcing the NPWS and giving it better status as an independent body on the model of the Environmental Protection Agency, which would be a clear path to follow, and to look at changing the fundamental legal status and strategic objectives of the other State agencies concerned with land and marine management.<\/p><p>We need to look at changing the fundamental legal status and strategic objectives of the other State agencies concerned with land and marine management so that the protection of biodiversity is a core objective that is integrated with all other considerations, as set out in the UN sustainable development goals.  If this is not done, we will continue to see species and habitat decline.  All of us remember getting our leaving certificate results.  The red areas on the results to which I am referring depict the bad results we are achieving in respect of the species and habitats where our actions are failing.<\/p><p> There is a need to reform the Wildlife Acts and the general protection regime.  It is disappointing that the only wildlife measure that is going through the Oireachtas at the moment will erode wildlife protection by extending the cutting and burning season.  There has been a complete failure to investigate properly the devastating wild fires in places like Gougane Barra in County Cork and the Cloosh Valley in County Galway.  These wildlife crimes have had a very damaging effect.  Nesting species and invertebrates have been wiped out completely.  Much wider damage is being done.  Problems like erosion and soil carbon loss are being exacerbated.  The pollution of watercourses is affecting fish spawning.  The impact of these fires, which are getting worse every year, is disastrous.  There is potential for the risk to increase as climate change starts to kick in because we could be facing lower rainfall periods in late spring and early summer.  That is going to exacerbate the risk and the potential impact of fires.<\/p><p> The answer to this is to take a new approach.  We are already meant to be thinking about river basin catchments and upland areas in an integrated way.  The strategic plans for such areas should be based on proper community and landowner co-operation.  The benefits of this should be equitably shared in the areas in question and downstream as well.  Downstream benefits should include flood relief and attenuation, rather than of the sorts of hard engineering responses to flood relief we are getting in a number of urban areas.  Very unrealistic demands to drain the Shannon are in circulation at the moment.  A better response would be to look at the Shannon as an overall drainage catchment and to restore traditional flood plains or wet woodlands in a number of less agriculturally productive areas.  Such an approach would bring multiple benefits.<\/p><p> We need to reform the way we think about agricultural subsidies and the way we use CAP, which accounts for hundreds of millions of euro.  The analysis of the spending under the various rural support schemes over the decades has been very disappointing.  There is a need for complete reform.  There should be a move towards an area-based, strategic and results-based system that benefits landowners, the wider community, the country as a whole, our nature and our biodiversity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22017070500002#K00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ian Lumley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1499260500,"counter":366,"content":"<p>I welcome all the witnesses.  I have a few interesting questions.  Most of them relate to An Taisce.  The representatives of the Heritage Council raised issues like upland farms and fires.<\/p> <p>  To be honest, I would echo much of what Deputy Danny Healy-Rae said about An Taisce.  I come from a rural community.  An Taisce was founded in 1948.  I was born in 1968.  This is the first I have seen of An Taisce and I have been in the community for many years.  I was a member of Cork County Council for many years before I was elected to the D&aacute;il.  Does An Taisce have any idea of the anger and frustration it has caused among rural communities and rural people?<\/p> <p>  Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n spoke about creating solutions.  An Taisce could have created solutions, but has not done so because it is faceless.  Nobody could find it or talk to it.  An Taisce was a law onto itself.  No organisation in this country should be a law onto itself.  I accept that An Taisce must abide by the directives that exist.  When one deals with planning matters at council level, one gets a chance to sit down and talk to someone.  One sometimes loses the battle and one has to accept that.  In this case, there was nobody to talk to.  In most of the planning cases in which An Taisce got involved, it made a decision and it walked away.  It destroyed people's lives.  There was no understanding.  No one came in.<\/p> <p>  An Taisce seems to have a strange rule about beautiful country houses and farm families.  People are trying to return to rural communities.  We are trying to rebuild communities.  An Taisce seems to have rules in certain circumstances, but it does not seem to have any rules governing solar farms, for example.  We have not heard much from An Taisce about solar farms.  There is quite a lot of frustration about wind farms.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Lumley mentioned the kelp farm in Bantry.  It is alleged that this 1,880-acre project could cause serious destruction to our nature.  It is going ahead, but the once-off house in the rural community will be stopped.  Why can there be a rule for one and not for another?  Where does An Taisce come into play?  Where is the vision for nature in that?  I do not see any such vision, to be quite honest.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Lumley said that 40% of marine species are being overfished.  This exact kind of report came out ten years ago when the inshore fishermen were chased off from fishing salmon.  Ten years later, we are told that there are still no salmon in the water.  The fishermen have been chased off the water.  Where were the reports there?  I do not entirely agree with many of the reports that come out.  I would like to know whether there should have been a cull on seals.  Such things should have been looked at.  Maybe the inshore fishermen should not have been chased off the water.  The decision in question was meant to be reviewed after seven years, but ten years on there has been no review whatsoever.<\/p> <p>  Burning and other issues have been mentioned.  Gougane Barra is in my constituency.  Many more areas in my constituency were basically destroyed.  Any nature-minded person would be frustrated and annoyed at the like of it.  I would put the blame for that solely in the hands of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Do any of the witnesses realise what the Department did to the farmers?  It chased the farmers.  It fined them tens of thousands of euro for having gorse - for having pure nature - on their land.  That is why frustration set in.  They basically had guns put to their heads.<\/p> <p>  Many fingers have been pointed at farmers.  Many farmers have never set fire to these hills.  They would not do the like of it.  They love nature.  Why would they set fire to their own animals, their own fencing and their own wires?  The Department's vision is to fine farmers if their farms are burned, even if they did not set their farms on fire in the first place.  There is a complete misunderstanding of farming.  Farmers are being accused.  The finger is being pointed at the farmer for starting these fires even though they have little or nothing to do with it.  When I spoke to officials from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in Portlaoise four years ago, I said they would be the cause of an inferno in this country and sure enough they were.  Sadly, they did not realise that I was right.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Lumley suggested that the rural environment protection scheme was not great.  I think it was a good move in the right direction because it created habitats.  Unfortunately, the farmer then got fined by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine for having a habitat.  The whole thing is like a chicken and egg game.  There is no real understanding of the farmer.  The rural environment protection scheme had its own use.  It assisted birds and other forms of nature.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Healy-Rae spoke about verge-cutting.  The frustration down my side of the country is the same as the frustration Deputy Healy-Rae hears in his constituency.  It is frightening to travel in a rural community.  It is quite scary to come around a bend and see two or three children stuck in briars trying to get away from a car.  It is unbelievable, to be honest.  The witnesses do not understand.  They have to visit the country so they will understand.  I said to someone recently that if they want to talk about farming, they should wear wellingtons.  If the witnesses want to talk about rural Ireland, and really understand the way of living there, they have to wear wellingtons.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22017070500002#L00200","speaker":"1263"},{"type":"speech","time":1499260500,"counter":367,"content":"<p>I thank both representatives of An Taisce for attending this afternoon's meeting.

The planning system grants permission for thousands of one-off houses annually.  When planning permission for a house is refused, there has to be a difficulty with location, water quality or traffic safety.  One cannot expect every application for a house on a site to be granted simply because somebody wants to put it there.  Very often, the issue is that a family member has another location for a house.<\/p><p>The council should be taking a proactive role in finding serviced suitable sites in other areas where those situations arise.  We have actively advocated that policy in many documents down the years.  <\/p><p> We fully support the Deputy's concern that we have proper guidelines for solar wind farms and other developments.  Some of the initial wind farms caused a major issue as they were developed in a deep peat area and caused peat slides.  A very serious issue happened in this area in recent months, resulting in a fatality.  There is a need for more effective planning and construction guidelines.  Solar development, which is part of the desirable energy mix that we need for the future to get away from carbon sources, needs to be given proper national guidelines, which are not yet in place.  The new Department with responsibility for planning was very much caught on the hop on this issue because a new industry has emerged, which is producing its own guidelines, but there should be independent national guidelines separate from the individual sector.  <\/p><p> On the issue relating to kelp farming, an advertisement for what is a potentially very problematic development was posted in a local Garda station and most people were not aware of it.  We need much more effective structures, information and consultation provisions in order that people, as well as environmental organisations, are aware of what is happening in the area.  <\/p><p> The figure with regard to over-fishing comes from the European Commission's fish stock monitoring data.  I can supply the Deputy with that information afterwards.  There is no evidence that seals are making any significant or major contribution to the collapse of fish stocks in the Irish Sea.  The collapse of successive fish stocks has extended over many centuries.  In the late medieval period we had major inshore herring fishing which we exported to Europe.  Pilchards and sardines were being fished off the coast of Cork as they were off the coast of Cornwall and were also exported to Europe.  Those stocks collapsed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  The history of human intervention with fish species has been that of over-exploitation of a particular species in an area and then moving on to another with new trawling techniques.  We have cited the international fisheries biologist, Daniel Pauly, in our more detailed submission, and he outlines the effect of this.  Every time we move on to a new baseline, we forget the abundance of fish life that there was once in the Irish Sea, which is now left to shrimp farming, which is a bottom feeder, with the main species having been fished beyond their replacement propagation capacity.<\/p><p> There needs to be a much more effective community action on burning to identify what is causing this and who are the culprits.  It is a criminal matter and there needs to be a properly resourced investigation to get to the bottom of it, to find out who was behind of it, to have prosecutions and an adequate deterrent for the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22017070500002#L00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ian Lumley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1499260500,"counter":370,"content":"<p>Mr. Lumley's time is up and I will bring him back in later if he wishes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22017070500002#M00200","speaker":"1235"},{"type":"speech","time":1499260500,"counter":371,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to speak at the committee.  Mr. Starrett referred to legislation on land use in American and England.  I hope he is not talking about whittling down Irish private property rights, which are stronger here than they are in most other countries.  I would like him to clarify that.<\/p> <p>  He touched on the success of the Burren.  However, it has been a success following a disaster resulting from the impact of scientists when they said that the cows should be taken off the Burren.  Then they listened to the farmers and the people from the local area who told them how to manage it.  That is when the Burren became a success.  It should be acknowledged that people with many letters after their names contributed to destroying the Burren.  I ask Mr. Starrett to clarify those two matters..<\/p> <p>   Mr. Lumley and I go back a long way.  I would like him to correct a few matters for the record.  One is that no turf is cut within Glenveagh National Park.  I got such a report a few years ago and got another such report this year.  I drove three hours to check on this and that activity is taking place outside the national park.  I want that clarified because it is unfair to mislead the committee.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Lumley spoke about the reduction in activity on raised bogs that has taken place over the course of the seven years of reporting.  When Mr. Fernandez did his report there was a reduction.  However, it should be noted for the record of the committee that it is now acknowledged, and scientists have also come up with this, that we were probably 40% wrong in terms of our active raised bog habitat when we started reporting it first.  If we were 40% wrong at the beginning, we could not be right any of the way through reporting on that.  That needs clarification.<\/p> <p>  If one sees a hen harrier in one's field, one had better get rid of it quickly.  It is sad for farmers who have grown up with nature whose land has been designated for the protection of the hen harrier as they are not able to plant trees, clean their drains or farm their land and their land is worthless.  Those are the facts of having one's land designated for the protection of the hen harrier.<\/p> <p>  As a result of environmental rules and our failure to clean rivers we have suffered the loss of the corncrake and they have drowned.  Mr. Lumley knows Mr. Michael Silke well and has heard everything he has said.  What has happened with the corncrake is disgusting.  We thought we were smarter but environmental rules have destroyed the corncrake.<\/p> <p>  There is participation among people around the country to protect the curlew.  As Deputies Danny Healy-Rae and Michael Collins pointed out, other species are killing them on the ground.  Farmers are willing to co-operate.  Mr. Lumley, in his submission, spoke about the Common Agricultural Policy, penalties and the bad way of doing things.  A farmer is the protector of rural Ireland.  It is not someone, to cite the title of one of Nancy Griffith's songs, \"From a Distance\" who wants to preach about it.  We come from a managed landscape and respect needs to be shown to those farmers.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Lumley spoke about high natural value areas.  The reality, as Deputy Collins pointed out, with respect to burning is that farmers in different parts of the country had to destock their sheep.  If fewer sheep are grazing a large area, they will eat one area of vegetation that is sweet and leave the rest.  Unfortunately, officials from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine inspect the land and cut such a farmer's single payment.  If 20% of the area is cut, then it is all gone.  That is the reality of what is happening in rural parts of Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Lumley spoke about the Peatlands Council in terms of raised bogs and compensation.  The compensation was in place before the Peatlands Council was formed.  No relocation has been done since Mr. Lumley or any other group met the Peatlands Council, and I sat on it for a while.  The Turf Cutters and Contractors Association, TCCA, has a representative and the association is working with the national parks.  We can be critical of the National Parks and Wildlife Service, and I often was, but it is trying to make a genuine effort, along with scientific evidence in this area.  I would like Mr. Lumley to state that he will back this up because a resolution can be found to this.   Ten years ago, I made the point that out of 3,000 acres, 100 acres may not be of any use for conservation but may be of use to the turf cutting communities.<\/p><p>That is the way forward.  I would welcome the views of the witness on that issue.<\/p><p> In regard to the pearl mussel, it has been moved in rivers in order for the river to be cleaned and put back again, ironically, and everything was hunky-dory.   People now think there cannot even be the shadow of a bridge near the pearl mussel or it will disappear or die.  While the submission of the witness is aspirational, if one was to live in the world of the witness, one would think that everything has disappeared.  There is a reference to the natterjack toad, which is a frog, to put it in simple English.  It is unbelievable and delusional for anyone to say he or she will do a survey of frogs in this country.  I am aware that the witness has not said that.  John Gormley was the first person to announce it.  I do not understand how frogs would be counted.  Rural dwellers have a good idea how well frogs are doing because they are in that environment every day.  However, they will not tell anyone because An Taisce is the scourge of rural Ireland because of objections it makes to projects and the way in which it does so.  That is a sad thing to have to say.  I ask An Taisce to rethink of the way it is going.<\/p><p> As I said to the witness, currently 50% of all water extraction in Ireland for which Irish Water is responsible for is coming out of designated areas where An Taisce has lodged objections for people to have drinking water.  A total of 40% of the outflow of sewage would be going in to a designated area.  Even if the sewage is 99% treated, that would not be good enough but raw sewage is currently being pumped in places the witness and I know.  I ask An Taisce to rethink how it is doing things.

An Taisce is always open to being part of any forum.  The only prospect of progress is if we can work together.  The data is in front of us.  We know the climate challenges we face.

I hope I have given an understanding that the Heritage Council is concerned with ensuring that it is working at community level to find a good way of doing things, whatever that may be.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the question on legislation and property rights, I am very Irish and very well aware of the issues.  The Heritage Council proposals are nothing to do with whittling down anything such as that.  It is about enabling and empowering communities, including landowners, to develop something for themselves.  This is a democracy and we work through legislation.  I have said that we are very weak on that form of enabling and empowering legislation.  We have very strong regulation and imposition legislation but need enabling and empowering legislation.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the Burren, I have said that the National Biodiversity Data Centre was the first time there was quality data available to those scientists.  Many of those decisions were therefore based on informed opinion.  I am glad to say that Ireland is now in the position that much more informed decisions can be made and hopefully that the types of disaster, to use the Deputy's word, that happened will not happen again.  The Burren Life project is a shining example from which we could all learn, whether it was the Burren IFA, Michael Davoren or whoever else has driven it forward.  A contribution was also made by a very good scientist, Mr. Brendan Dunford, who was sent down there and understood the situation and the Heritage Council was there at the outset.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22017070500002#N01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Starrett"},{"type":"speech","time":1499260500,"counter":384,"content":"<p>I will allow members ask another round of questions.

When I was going out the door, I heard Mr. Lumley talking about badgers and saying badgers had TB and he appeared to be worried about that.  One does not get milk from badgers.  Farmers cannot survive on badgers.  Badgers spread TB to other animals.  Farmers can be taken before the courts if they are found to be netting badgers, which is unfair because for a couple of lorries to have to take away 50 or 60 of a farmer's cows because the cows have caught TB is denying the farmer his or her livelihood.  That is very sad and very hard for the farmer.  Deer also spread TB.  Large-scale deer culls need to take place.<\/p> <p>  In regard to curlews, magpies and grey crows are cleaning out their nests and those of pheasants.<\/p><p> The witness referred to the rivers.  God almighty, to say that we cannot clear out the Shannon or the Flesk River in Kerry, what frame of mind are people in at all?  Do people think we can raise the houses?  Do they think we can raise the roads?  Do they realise the hardship 22 families faced in Glenflesk a few years ago because the Flesk River has not been cleaned out for 30 or 40 years?  One man's last trip out of his house was in a boat.  His name is Paddy Healy and the last trip out of his house was when the fire brigade had to take him from his own house in a boat.  To think that someone would suggest that we cannot clean out the river is disrespectful.<\/p><p> As Deputy Fitzmaurice said, farmers are being penalised for allowing their land to become overgrown.  Maybe some of them have burned it but in the cases that happened this year, we were afraid that others might have set fire to these places.  The local farmers cannot be blamed, or no one can prove it.  There should be a policy that anyone who has forestry opens a fire belt around it.  Farmers who have material that would burn ought to have a firebelt around their place so that the fire cannot come in from another farm.  I have been propagating this idea at local council level and here.  Coillte used to help the farmer locally to do what was known as controlled burning.  We need to return to that.  If farmers were not penalised, they might not burn these places.  The fact is they cannot take a mowing machine, lawn-mower or hedge cutter into some of these places because the terrain is so rough and so bad, yet a Department official can say it is overgrown and cut the farmer's payment.  As Deputy Fitzmaurice said, if more than 20% of the area is found to be overgrown, the farmer loses 100% of their payment, not 20%.<\/p><p> Mr. Lumley said agriculture was the lead threat to Irish biodiversity.  Farmers and landowners are the best custodians of the land.  They had to fight to hand it down to their sons and in many places are paying down large loans in order to hold on to their places.  They have not and will not do anything harmful to their places.  The witnesses spoke about climate change.  I will argue until I die that only one person has control of the climate.  There have been changing patterns in climate going back over the years, before there was ever a combustible engine.  No one can disprove that and that is a fact.<\/p><p> Mr. Lumley spoke of the house and that he was not aware of it.  I can tell him about the people who were denied the house and the halving of the 365 acres.  I have no problem naming Michael J.

I said it was faceless, has broken the hearts of many, has caused extreme frustration and is very much disliked in rural Ireland, to say the least.  I have found no one who will say a good word about it.  How do we find a solution?  Mr. Lumley did not touch on that in his reply.  Can we find a solution, or work together to find one?  Can An Taisce come out from behind the iron curtain and speak to the people?  In county councils, when talking about planning, one might argue a point, but one will have someone to argue with.  One might lose one's argument but at least it can be discussed and a decision cannot be made that has an effect people's lives but no one has a say.<\/p> <p>  There was a suggestion that the Department might have been caught regarding solar farms.  It very much looks like that.  I have a feeling that it likes being caught because it has been notified about it for quite some time but is doing nothing about it.  There has to be a reason for it.  An Taisce was also cut off regarding kelp.  The notification was put in the newspaper.  There was a planning application for 1,880 acres.  It will have a devastating effect on tourism in Ventry, in Sheep's Head and in the Bearra peninsula.  Why did An Taisce not object?  It is talking about nature and all sorts of different things but this is going to cause absolute destruction, or it is alleged that it will.

Badgers were raised by Deputy Healy-Rae but the research remains unclear on the extent to which infection from badgers is passing to cattle herds.  We mentioned the pilot scheme for the innoculation of badgers and this should be actively looked at as a future response.  I cannot speak for the River Flesk but some very unrealistic proposals have been circulated for the flood levels in the Shannon, involving dredging.  The Shannon has a large watershed catchment and substantial rainwater flow from tributaries which drain into it.  There may be areas where some action is needed, subject to ecological appraisal, but the answer to flood relief on our river catchments is to look at best practice which is emerging in other European countries, which uses natural flood management.  The report commissioned by Friends of the Earth Ireland suggests adopting an ecosystems approach to managing flood risk, which has multiple other benefits.  On the issue of burning, we are all agreed on the need for collective action and for enforcement and if there is any justification for burning it needs to be done with proper control, supervision and ecological advice.<\/p> <p>  I was asked about the greatest impact of declining Irish biodiversity and the status report into habitats and species.  This is in the NPWS document - it is not something we are saying.  Deputy Collins raised the issue of kelp.  While we have a very elaborate system for the advertisement of planning applications, with site notices, local authority websites etc., people in Bantry Bay missed out, as did the environmental organisations such as ourselves.  The difficulty, as my colleague explained, is that we are very slim on resources and do not get any public funding for carrying out our role as an environmental organisation, which is to look at planning applications or consents in agriculture and fisheries and various big or small developments in various other areas.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Fitzmaurice raised the issue of water.  We are promoting and supporting a catchment-based approach to water and managing the watershed, to ensure there is no problematic run-off.  In the past, overgrazing of sheep caused an issue for water catchments and burning is clearly very damaging to surface water drainage and water catchments.  I am happy to talk to Deputy Fitzmaurice about certain cases but I am not clear about the issue because everything to do with the relationship of the environment, ecology and human settlement is based on maintaining clean surface water and groundwater, to be able to extract drinking water from resources in appropriate locations and in an appropriate way.  There is an assessment process to ensure, for example, that lakewater abstraction is not drawn down below certain levels.  I am not at all clear as to what concerns the Deputy raised but I would be very happy to discuss them afterwards, as we always are to talk about individual issues with local communities, Members of the Oireachtas and local councillors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22017070500002#P00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ian Lumley"},{"type":"speech","time":1499260500,"counter":396,"content":"<p>I greatly appreciate the fact that the witnesses came before us today.
