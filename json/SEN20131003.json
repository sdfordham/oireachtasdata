It is flawed legislation that my group will oppose.  We look forward to the debate.<\/p><p>I commend Senators Quinn and Barrett on the passing of Second Stage of the Upward Only Rent (Clauses and Reviews) Bill 2013 yesterday.  It is not easy for the Government to lose a vote in the Seanad, but the debate in which I participated yesterday was a good one in which many good points were made.  Successive Governments have failed to tackle this issue.  I include the most recent Government.  I hope that this Bill will show the Government a way forward.  This matter must be tackled urgently.  Businesses are trapped in upward-only rent review leases, most of which are held by landlords that are institutional investors.  We have a two-tiered commercial system.  The last Government abolished upward-only rent reviews from 28 February 2010 onwards under the 2009 conveyancing Act.<\/p><p>I seek a commitment that the Minister responsible for this matter be in attendance next Tuesday when Committee Stage is held.  I am not casting aspersions on the Ministers of State, Deputies Tom Hayes and Ring, but this matter does not fall within either's portfolio.  In the middle of yesterday's debate, one Minister of State left and another replaced him.  This is an important issue for business and we all agree that it must be tackled.  There are disagreements as to how that can be done.<\/p> <p>It is important the line Minister is in the House to listen to the debate and to set out the reason the Government now believes it is unconstitutional to pass this Bill given the unambiguous commitment in the programme for Government and, as I stated yesterday, the Fine Gael and Labour Party manifestos to abolish upward only rent reviews.  This is clearly set out in the programme for Government.  I ask the Leader to ensure that the line Minister is in the House for that debate.<\/p><p>Earlier in the week, I raised the issue of discretionary medical cards.  Has the Leader had any success in ensuring the Minister for Health will come to the House to answer questions on the reason more than 22,000 discretionary medical cards have been withdrawn?  I instanced a case with which I am dealing of a seven year old child with severe mental and physical disabilities and no mobility or speech whose medical card has been withdrawn.  This is only one of thousands of cases across the country.  This issue which has been raised by Senators from all sides of the House needs to be addressed.  Has the Leader made any progress in regard to the setting of a date on which the Minister can come to the House to answer questions in relation to his portfolio, in respect of which his performance to date has been poor?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013100300002#A00700","speaker":"1139","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1380792600,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I am delighted time has been set aside for statements of appreciation on the life and work of Seamus Heaney who was hugely respected and loved nationally and internationally.<\/p><p>I, too, commend Senator Quinn on the introduction last night of the Bill on upward only rent reviews, which is a hugely important issue.

I acknowledged in my contribution last night that the previous Government had tried to tackle it.  There is an underlying problem, which should be debated in the Seanad, namely, the elevated protection of property rights in the Constitution.  I would welcome an honest debate on the issue in the Seanad, including on the hampering affect this has had on Government policy not only in the area of commercial or retail leases but in the area of levies on development land and land being sat upon by speculators and not used.  We have had reports in the past on actions that should be taken by Government to penalise those who own land and are allowing it to remain idle.  Often action is not taken because of a fear of the constitutionality of doing so owing to the courts protection of property rights, which is not an ungrounded fear.  As I pointed out last night, there have been significant examples of progressive legislation that has been struck down by the Supreme Court in the past because of the property rights Article.  I would welcome a broader debate on the issue in this House.<\/p><p>I welcome the positive news yesterday in terms of the reduction in the live register figures and in regard to tax returns.  As I have previously stated, it appears that the adjustments to be made in the forthcoming budget will be of the order of less than &euro;3.1 billion, which is welcome.  The drop by more than 20,000 in the live register figures released yesterday by the Central Statistics Office was welcomed by the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, who pointed out that every 10,000 drop in the live register saves approximately &euro;95 million, which has a hugely significant impact on our public finances.  The positive move is an indication that the Government's Action Plan for Jobs and Pathways to Work programme being led by the Department of Social Protection are having a positive affect.  The Minister, Deputy Burton, has spoken eloquently in this House and elsewhere of the need for social protection to be a springboard as well as a safety net.  She is a genuinely reforming Minister in this area.  I commend her on her work.  I hope we will have further debates in this House with her on the Pathways to Work initiative and measures to tackle unemployment, which is the most pressing issue we face in this country today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013100300003#B00700","speaker":"1148"},{"type":"speech","time":1380792600,"counter":19,"content":"<p>Last night's debate was very valuable not because some members of the Labour Party went missing or spoke in favour of but against the Bill but because of the serious issues raised therein.  Property bubbles are threatening to destroy many economies worldwide.  We need a system that favours entrepreneurship and enterprise over finance and banking.  Many countries have been doing the exact opposite.  This is Wall Street versus Main Street.  How we deal with property rights is subtle.  It is up to us as legislators to go review all of that.  Previously, people in the city had the right to burn whatever coal they wanted to burn.  This was changed.  Changes were also made in regard to tobacco smoking, which damages people's health.  The taxi licence value of &euro;130,000 was also changed.  Recently, a farmer whose family have owned in a historic house near Carton House in north Kildare for hundreds of years was required to move because the IDA wanted the land for expansion.  Property rights are subtle.  This is what should be emphasised in our future debates on this issue.<\/p><p>I take it the Leader has had no communications from the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, which means his allegation that he was bribed by a Member of this House is now null and void.  The Minister of State is in Istanbul and is not using his telephone.  When we said the prayer earlier we did so with more fervour than ever given today is, if the Taoiseach gets his way, the day before this House is moved to death row.  It is appalling.  I am a member of the North-South Interparliamentary Association, which cannot meet tomorrow because it would mean we would be meeting with Northerners on the same day as a partitionist Taoiseach was abolishing the two all-Ireland constituencies in this Oireachtas, TCD and NUI, which is a shameful way to treat our Northern brethren.

We stand at a crossroads.<\/p><p>I congratulate Senator Quinn on the Bill he introduced yesterday.  In my contribution to the debate, I set out both sides of the argument.  Unfortunately, some of the issues arising from the Senator's Bill will create difficulties from a constitutional perspective.  To be fair to both sides, a number of the proposals made by Senators on the Government side would make the Bill more sustainable from a constitutional perspective.  It should be understood, however, that the Seanad has placed the issue on the table of the Government.  However, responsibility for this issue does not lie with one of the Labour Party Ministers.  Dare I suggest that if that were the case, legislation probably would have been introduced by now, although that is neither here nor there.  <\/p><p>The Society of St. Vincent de Paul announced this morning that the annual cost of energy for families has increased by &euro;500 per annum and the society has increased spending on helping families with energy costs from &euro;3.8 million to &euro;10.4 million.  Fuel poverty is a serious issue and one which I have raised on a number of occasions.  The Society of St. Vincent de Paul has made a number of positive proposals on how to assist families in this area, including by rolling out pay as one goes meters, which give families more control over their energy costs.  The bottom line, however, is that thermal efficiency is the answer to this problem.<\/p><p>I congratulate the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, on making additional finances available to local authorities.  From my time on Dublin City Council's housing strategic policy committee, I am aware that the measures being rolled out for local authority housing will save tenants on average one third on their energy bills in a short period.  The answer is not so easy for the many people in poverty who live in the rented sector and depend on rent supplement.  A strategy is required to improve thermal efficiency in rented homes.  I ask the Leader to raise this matter with the relevant Minister. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013100300004#C00200","speaker":"1172"},{"type":"speech","time":1380793200,"counter":35,"content":"<p>I thank Senators for the very useful and, I hope, helpful debate in the House last night.  As Senator Hayden pointed out, this is a momentous day given what will take place tomorrow.  I hope last night's debate will be useful to the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, as he seeks to develop tactics and policies on the issue addressed in my Bill.  I do not agree with Senator Colm Burke's suggestion that taxing rental income for larger companies and landlords could provide a solution as to do so would not benefit tenants.  I thank speakers from all sides for their contributions to last night's useful debate.<\/p><p>I ask the Leader to raise with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, an urgent problem that has arisen with regard to adoption.  The law on adoption has been changed in Russia and Ireland.  As a result, at least four families who had adoptions approved and had the babies in their hands have suddenly found that certain steps must be taken before 31 October, which is only three or four weeks from now.  The problem can be resolved and I gather the Minister takes a sympathetic view of the case for doing so. <\/p><p>While I am aware that the House debated energy recently, a number of developments are under way in this regard.  It has been brought to my attention that marine energy systems have great potential for development.  A considerable amount of energy is produced at the Ardnacrusha power station for the ESB.  If we had half a dozen rivers similar to the River Shannon, we could have many more facilities similar in size to Ardnacrusha.  The waters off our cost hold out the same potential, however, but technology and Government investment are needed.  I ask for a debate on this issue because such an investment would be worthy in the long term as it would pay for itself and reduce energy costs in the years ahead. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013100300004#C00300","speaker":"1145"},{"type":"speech","time":1380793200,"counter":36,"content":"<p>I am sure the Cathaoirleach will indulge me if I extend my good wishes to people in east County Galway who were devastated last night when a mini-tornado came in over the River Shannon and struck Clonfert.

I welcome the news that the adjustment will be less than &euro;3.1 billion.  The previous two budgets introduced by this Government and the previous four budgets introduced by its predecessor have forced more people into poverty and out of work.  As a result of the poor decisions that were made in those budgets, many people have been forced to emigrate.  In the past two years, I have called for genuine, proper discussions and debates on the alternative budget proposals of Opposition political parties and groups outside the Houses which make submissions on alternative budget measures. <\/p> <p>We have not had that and that, to me, would be real and genuine political reform.  We must move beyond arriving at budget day and being presented with a <i>fait accompli<\/i>and not having the genuine robust debate that we need to have on budget day.<\/p><p> Our party was asked to submit our alternative budget to the Government and we did so.  It has been fully costed.  Again, we will present a fairer way to deal with the economic crisis and address our deficit by giving working families a break, the families who have disproportionately borne the brunt of the last number of budgets, protecting public services and, more important, getting people back to work.<\/p><p> We need to have the debate on unemployment and emigration again.  While it is welcome that the live register figures have fallen, the reality is that three times as many people have left this State during the past three months than have come off the live register.  That is the reality.  It is a fact and we need to have a debate on that issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013100300004#C01400","speaker":"1133","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1380793800,"counter":48,"content":"<p>That is not true.

This morning I was at a meeting in the Dundrum town centre, where there are 40 restaurants creating employment and giving jobs to the people there.  If there is an increase in this VAT, I assure the House that jobs will be lost in the hospitality sector.  The people who own the little bistros, restaurants and coffee shops throughout the country will not increase their prices.  They will not do that.  Unfortunately, however, people will lose their jobs or there will be a reduction in their hours.  It is a state of anarchy that we have with the four men up there.  We do not have any women on it and they do not have an ounce of commercial experience.  If they did, they would not be increasing the VAT rate from 9% because they would know that jobs would be lost.<\/p><p>I heard some beautiful words from one of the Senators this morning about another discussion on Action Plan for Jobs.

We do not know whether we will be executed or survive or what will happen, but either way it is a significant exercise in democracy whereby the people have their say on the future of this House.  People may well be surprised by the outcome.  I have engaged with the people.  As a Senator, I feel as if I am somewhat in a glass bubble because I am talking about something associated with myself.  However, from talking to people, I have gathered that they are well engaged and informed.  They are a good deal more informed about the work of the House than people might think.  The only fear I have is that not enough of them will turn out to vote.  My appeal is to those who have studied the Chamber and who have seen and admired the great people who have gone through the Chamber over the years.  They have been well documented at this stage and include Mary Robinson, Gordon Wilson and others.  When people are reflecting tomorrow in the polling station, they should reflect on the positive as well as the negative.<\/p><p>We have seen a significant dirty campaign, probably the dirtiest campaign we have ever seen in a referendum in the history of the country.  It demeans the profession of politics and the Oireachtas and there was no need for it.  Certainly, there was no need for the misinformation, which has been clearly demonstrated as misinformation.  It is regrettable that politics must be brought down to the lowest common denominator.  If anything makes people cynical it is what I would describe as cheap yellow pack politics.  We are better than that and certainly this Chamber is better than that.  I sincerely hope the Chamber has a reformed future.

The fact that we would seek to dismantle some of our democratic institutions without any meaningful attempt at political reform is strange, especially at a time when people are suffering as a consequence of the economic crisis we have experienced during the past five years.  Any fair-minded person would acknowledge that a major contributory factor was the failure of these Houses to fulfil their obligations to the people effectively over a period by not being set up in a sufficiently robust or open manner.  During the summer we saw in a debate the authoritarian bullying of members of a particular party who took a particular perspective on a Bill from a conscientious position.

This has indeed been an extremely dirty campaign, with false statements and misinformed posters that should have been removed.  During my two and a half years in this House, I have witnessed excellent debates with fantastic contributions by many expert people in their field.  This stands to the strength of this House, which is that Members are doing what they were elected - or in my case appointed - to do, namely, to discuss areas of concern and to scrutinise and strengthen the legislation.  This I believe Members have done with more than 500 amendments.  Were this referendum to be passed - I firmly believe and hope it will not - I would worry about the State and what will happen to this country, were power to be given to a smaller group of people.  I would worry about the committees that will be appointed because they will be appointed by the Government of the day.  As for this suggestion of an expert group of witnesses, expert groups of witnesses already come into Leinster House.  I meet such expert groups every single week and I learn from the different groups from all sides and then use that information to bring it back to the Minister of the day.  Having a second Chamber offers so much and it is needed.  I hope that when the referendum is defeated on Friday, Members will have the opportunity to come back and have a better, reformed and more powerful Seanad.  I wish to thank those people who have inundated me with telephone calls, messages, letters and e-mails, wishing all the Senators well in the forthcoming days.

While it does not particularly affect those Senators present today or the 60 Members of Seanad &Eacute;ireann, it affects future generations and it affects our democracy.  For 800 years, we struggled to obtain independence.  For 800 years, we did not have a defined role in making our own laws for our own people.  For 800 years, we struggled in a tyrannical situation.  We now find ourselves in a situation in which Europe is playing an ever increasing role in our democracy and in the laws that dictate in our country but they are not being scrutinised in this Oireachtas in any way.  Moreover, Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; made reference to this yesterday, there may well be a darker side to the European and German influence in trying to reduce democracy and the voice of the people within Ireland's Parliament and to have more federalisation at a European level.  This would be a step in the wrong direction.  While the making of laws is important to our people and the implementation of those laws costs millions and millions, yet there is a refusal to debate the laws adequately by refusing to engage in real political reform at a time when it was never needed more.  This is a false dawn and is a political consequence.  When one considers the other House, in which the Fine Gael, Labour Party and Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies, that is, 127 Deputies out of 166, are advocating to get rid of this House, one must ask why.<\/p><p>As for the other referendum to be held tomorrow, I believe the Government and the commission, particularly the former, should have engaged with the electorate more substantially on the serious referendum on the appeals court.  I believe it is an important referendum that affects the legal system.  It is a dangerous referendum in the sense that it is not addressing the waiting lists or the legal costs associated with the court system and I believe the Government has done the people a disservice by not engaging in debate on that a referendum.

This is what it is about for me.  If we close down the voices, we will be closing down representation and diversity.  We will be devolving power into fewer hands, which ultimately is a blow to democracy.  Regardless of the outcome tomorrow, Members still have a duty to serve and a debate is needed on political reform.  Moreover, Members have a contribution to make as they are being paid by the taxpayer and have a job to do.

We would like to see them return, as well as more people from that country, and we are very happy to see them here.  This pertains to Senator White's point about the VAT rate.  I believe the VAT rate is crucial and I completely agree with her but one must remember it was the Minister, Deputy Noonan, who introduced it without being lobbied for it.  It has been hugely influential in improving the tourism industry in Ireland.  An important point to make in this debate is he is acutely aware of the necessity for it to be maintained and he is trying his level best to have it maintained or at the very worst, to have it increased slightly.  Consequently, it is important to mention that he introduced the reduction at a time when he was not lobbied for it and credit should be given where credit is due in that regard.<\/p><p>As for the Seanad, this obviously is my first time in this House.

It is not all about the headline issues.  While they are important and obviously the bigger matters catch everyone's attention, only the week before last Senator van Turnhout raised the issue of child pageants in the House and the very next day, that very competition was cancelled.  I refer to her efforts in this Chamber and while it may seem like a trivial matter, it is very important.  Consequently, it has been heartbreaking.

The statements in the D&aacute;il were more than thought provoking.  In his tribute the Taoiseach memorably said: \"Across the world Seamus Heaney was and is seen not alone as Ireland's better self, but, I believe, its best self possible\".<\/p><p>In each of the contributions made last week, the esteem in which all members who contributed held the work of Seamus Heaney was apparent but in addition to this, many of us who are in the Houses of the Oireachtas and across the country and the globe felt a close personal connection with Seamus.  This also shone through in the contributions.  Like many, both in this Chamber and in the D&aacute;il, I met Seamus Heaney on a number of occasions.  Most recently, I had the pleasure of Seamus Heaney's company in Paris when he read his work at the Centre Culturel Irlandais as part of Ireland's Presidency of the European Union.  Each person in attendance was honoured to hear him.  It was an open air event and, introducing Seamus, I could feel the growing sense of anticipation and excitement among the audience.  This large group had gathered to hear the words of the master.  When he uttered his first word a calm descended on the audience.  There was a palpable sense of anticipation.  Seamus was Ireland's supreme cultural ambassador and the respect in which he was held by the academic world, the Irish diaspora and the reader was unparalleled.<\/p> <p>I am glad his wife, Marie, is with us today.  As Seamus started to recite his poetry, a blackbird emerged and accompanied him during the whole poetry reading event.  It was quite extraordinary.  I understand something similar happened in Rome.  It reminded me of the old Irish tradition where the reciter was always accompanied by a harp but in this instance, it was by a blackbird.  As the blackbird has played such a part in Seamus's poetry, it was very fitting.  Maybe it was sending us a signal for the future.<\/p><p>When Seamus travelled to Stockholm in 1995 to accept the most prestigious award a writer can receive, we were deeply proud of him.  This was a formal recognition of something that was already well-known, namely, that he was a writer of international standing and one of the greatest of our time.  So much of Heaney's work was immersed in living things, in heritage, in landscape, in our surroundings and especially in our boglands.  His extraordinary talent could also be beautifully simple.  The language Seamus used was often the language of the everyday.  He painted vivid scenes with often simple words but every word was chosen with the greatest of care and consideration.  <\/p><p>His mastery of language was equalled only by his generosity of spirit.  He had time for everyone and he gave freely of his talent and his counsel to many aspiring writers, poets and artists and to those of us who simply loved his writing and who delighted in his reading of his work.  I saw Seamus communicate with several audiences over the years, especially in my home town of Listowel where he was a regular visitor during writers' week.  I saw the connection he had with people, how easy he was with people and how people felt they could approach him with the simplest of requests.  That is what really distinguished Seamus so much - that he had that connection with people and people felt so comfortable with him.<\/p><p>Seamus bequeaths a mighty legacy and leaves an immense gap in all our intellectual and artistic lives.  With this in mind, I will ask the director of the National Library of Ireland to work with my Department to present a major exhibition on the work of Seamus Heaney in 2015.  It is my intention that this exhibition will be one of great significance which captures the extraordinary contribution Seamus Heaney made over his lifetime.  It is my hope that when this exhibition is presented, it will be viewed by many people from home and abroad and will contribute to the greatest possible understanding of the man and his work.  <\/p><p>I had the pleasure of Seamus Heaney's company and had the honour of introducing him.  I have my personal memories of this most private of public men and like many I know some of words by heart.  These words will stay with me forever.  <\/p><p>Our thoughts remain with his family - with Marie, Michael, Christopher and Catherine Ann.  I hope that through the formal statements last week and those this morning that we have, in a small way, communicated to them the extent to which we feel and share the loss of Seamus.  Seamus, the husband, father, grandfather, brother and uncle, will always be theirs but we thank them for sharing him with us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013100300008#G00300","speaker":"1046","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1380795900,"counter":103,"content":"<p>I recite Requiem for the Croppies by Seamus Heaney:<blockquote><br \/>The pockets of our great-coats full of barley<br \/>(No kitchens on the run, no striking camp)<br \/>We moved quick and sudden in our own country.<br \/>The priest lay behind ditches with the tramp.<br \/>A people, hardly marching - on the hike -<br \/>We found new tactics happening each day:<br \/>Horsemen and horse fell to the twelve foot pike,<br \/>We'd stampede cattle into infantry,<br \/>Retreat through hedges where cavalry must be thrown<br \/>Until, on Vinegar Hill, the fatal conclave:<br \/>Twenty thousand died; shaking scythes at cannon.<br \/>The hillside blushed, soaked in our broken wave.<br \/>They buried us without shroud or coffin<br \/>And in August barley grew up out of the grave.<\/blockquote>The principal of my national school in Kenmare, Donal Sleator, taught me that poem.  He was a great man for poets, including P&aacute;draig Pearse, whose poem, The Wayfarer, contains the line &quot;And I have gone upon my way Sorrowful&quot;, and Joseph Mary Plunkett, whose poem, I See His Blood upon the Rose, contains the lines:<blockquote>I see his blood upon the rose<br \/>And in the stars the glory of his eyes<\/blockquote>Seamus Heaney is not up there among the greats; he is one of the greats and is up there with all our poet laureates and all our Nobel Prize winning poet laureates.  He came to Kenmare many times for a festival of culture and, to be honest, there used to be quite a bit of drinking as well.  As often happens, everyone claims he or she came up with the idea but it was Joseph Thoma, who was a great teacher but he could not teach me art.  I suppose it was never in me, so he could not get out of me what was not in me.  My fellow Kerryman over there would point to another great Kerryman, the late Con Houlihan, who said one of our great Kerry poets was making all the right mistakes.  I was making all the right mistakes.  Joe Thoma came up with an idea that Seamus Heaney and Liam &Oacute; Maonla&iacute; should recite poetry together accompanied by music.  Kenmare is claiming credit for where it happened first.  It then happened in many auspicious locations, including in Carnegie Hall in New York.<\/p><p>  Over his life, Seamus Heaney gave us great words and he was a wordsmith of monumental and global proportions.  I will conclude with the words of Pearse that we shall all go upon our way sorrowfully.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013100300009#H00200","speaker":"1159"},{"type":"speech","time":1380795900,"counter":104,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister, Marie and friends to the Seanad and will recite The Forge by Seamus Heaney:<blockquote><br \/>All I know is a door into the dark.<br \/>Outside, old axles and iron hoops rusting;<br \/>Inside, the hammered anvil's short-pitched ring,<br \/>The unpredictable fantail of sparks<br \/>Or hiss when a new shoe toughens in water.<br \/>The anvil must be somewhere in the centre,<br \/>Horned as a unicorn, at one end and square,<br \/>Set there immoveable: an altar<br \/>Where he expends himself in shape and music. <br \/>Sometimes, leather-aproned, hairs in his nose,<br \/>He leans out on the jamb, recalls a clatter<br \/>Of hoofs where traffic is flashing in rows;<br \/>Then grunts and goes in, with a slam and flick<br \/>To beat real iron out, to work the bellows.<\/blockquote>They say the arts, music, sports and literature transcend society.  They unite people as one and bring together nations of great political divide.  It is not often that the announcement of the death of a literary figure can bring a country to a standstill but such was the case when the sudden death of Seamus Heaney was announced.  No one was prepared for such a loss.  The familial connection and love that we felt for Seamus reverberated around the world as witnessed by the flood of heart-felt tributes.  <\/p><p>  Seamus Heaney, who died on 30 August at the age of 74, won the Nobel Prize for literature &quot;for works of lyrical beauty and ethical depth, which exalt everyday miracles and the living past,&quot; according to the citation on the Nobel Prize official website.  Seamus was a visiting speaker on a number of occasions at my <i>alma mater<\/i>, Villanova University in Pennsylvania, the first time in 1988 and the fourth and last visit in April 2010 on the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the university's Heimbold chair.  Seamus was always generous with his time.<\/p> <p> Much of Seamus's poetry was grounded in his sense of place.  He wrote with such nostalgia about his rural upbringing in County Derry in poems like The Forge and Harvest Bow.  Living in the North, much of Seamus's poetry was influenced by what became euphemistically known as the Troubles.  He was very aware of the lives sacrificed in the name of Ireland, and brilliantly made the connection with other lives sacrificed to the land 2,000 years earlier in his poems Bogland and The Tollund Man.  It was no doubt his awareness of living in fear that resulted in Seamus being able to empathise poetically with conflict throughout the world.  <\/p><p> While his <i>North<\/i>collection was strongly political, this was just one aspect to his poetry.  The obvious love he felt for his parents is deeply touching in poems like Digging and The Pitchfork, inspired by his father Patrick, while the special relationship he shared with his mother Margaret is beautifully portrayed in Clearances and Mossbawn, among others.<\/p><p> We might assume that such talent and achievement would result in a proud, accomplished figure but this was the most surprising and ironic aspect of the man.  There is perhaps nothing in life more disarming than listening to an interview with Seamus Heaney.  Rarely focusing attention on himself, the warmth and generosity with which he praised others was truly humbling to witness.  I particularly love the story of his reaction to winning the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1995.  Far from expecting such an honour, he was out of the country on holiday and it took some time to contact him with the news.  When his family told him that he had won he simply replied, &quot;Well fair play to the Swedes.&quot;<\/p><p> Seamus was well aware that sometimes simplicity is best.  I wonder if he could possibly know, in these uncertain times of change and upheaval, how comforting his final words would be to all of us.  Although texted privately to his beloved wife, Marie, we all felt the enormous power of his last written words: &quot;Noli timere.&quot;  Don't be afraid.  Seamus, a chairde, ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013100300009#H00300","speaker":"1165","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1380796500,"counter":106,"content":"<p>I would first like to acknowledge Marie Heaney in the Gallery.  I have always felt that Marie and Seamus Heaney were an ageless union.  I know that her loss is profound and I am very grateful today to have the opportunity to hold her in our hearts and in our thoughts.<\/p><p>  In The Cure at Troy, which is a dramatisation by Seamus Heaney of Sophocles's &quot;Philoctetes&quot;, the chorus of elders speak these lines at the close of the play:<blockquote>Now it's high watermark<br \/>and floodtide in the heart<br \/>and time to go.<br \/>The sea-nymphs in the spray<br \/>will be the chorus now.<br \/>What's left to say?<br \/>Suspect too much sweet-talk<br \/>but never close your mind.<br \/>It was a fortunate wind<br \/>that blew me here.  I leave<br \/>half-ready to believe<br \/>that a crippled trust might walk<br \/>and the half-true rhyme is love.<\/blockquote>What a fresh and a new wind gave us the unique gift that was Seamus Heaney?  Yeats said that poetry found its power in its attempt to hold, in a single thought, reality and justice.  Poetry has always allowed the gods to speak and the poet prophets and poet seers to be heard.  Seamus Heaney was and remains our link between the gods and his human being sense of things.  He was a diviner of words with which he was able to gift us, individually and nationally, with word music, imagination and a majestic mind.  Bridge us back and forward to all that is best about us.  Bridge us back and forward to all that is best within us.<\/p><p>  &quot;Your poems are miracles&quot;, said Michael Longley to him standing backstage a few weeks before he died.  &quot;If they are&quot;, said Heaney, &quot;they are all from Bellaghy.&quot;  They were all from the core, all from the beginning, all from the foundation of his life at Mossbawn.  No matter where Seamus Heaney travelled, who he met or what universal or world civil gifts were bestowed on him, that well, that touchstone, that shape, that sound and that sculpture of Bellaghy's influence never ran dry.  It never left him.  It was his home.  It was his heartbeat, his ear, his eye, his taste, his smell, the contours of the palm of his hand, the clock of his imagination, the language of his life and, above all, the plough, which became his pen.<\/p><p>  When Heaney decided to use The Government of the Tongue as a general title for the 1986 T.S. Eliot Memorial Lectures, a title that well befits us here in the Seanad since it is the government of the tongue that we most use in this House, what he had in mind was poetry as its own vindicating force.  Would that we could parallel such vindication.  Would that we, as a Seanad, could parallel such valediction.<\/p><p>  He, above all else since Yeats, earned that right to govern both through his extraordinary precious mind and through the world-wonder of his words.  He wrote in these essays about the poet's power to open up the unexpected, the unedited communication between our nature and the nature of the reality we inhabit - a conduit for the gods.  Poetry was Heaney's threshold, not a path, and he constantly approached and departed from it, and gave the reader and writer an ability to undergo in different ways the experience, as he said, of being at the same time summoned to it and released by it.  <\/p><p>  I ask Senators what we are to do now that he has left us for the gods.  What now for our bare-faced world?  Where are we to turn now for imagination against the pulse of steel and the repetition of intolerances?  Who will fill the world with the wonder of word-beauty that has gone abroad forever with him?  We are on what Heaney would call a shifting sand, a sea changed, because we have lost a cosmic elder and the vacuum is very hard to fill.  <\/p><p>  What will continue is his poetry.  It will continue to be as redemptive and as illusory as love because Heaney's mind and tongue was always free from predicaments.  He was able to hunker us down to some good place outside and away from what he called cultural anxiety.  He cleared so many of our own spaces for us and we should be, and we are, so grateful.  His work is his gift to us.  <\/p><p>  C.S. Lewis said that we read to know that we are not alone.  Through Heaney's poetry we will come to know the truth of that statement but it was also when Heaney spoke his verse that we became truly connected, spoken tonic solfa, treble and base, rise and fall, thin and full, quiet Bellaghy rhythms of meaning and feeling, pitch and fork, perfect on the tongue.  When he read his work aloud, child and man knew they were in the presence of a mastermind, a spoken Mozart:<br \/><blockquote>I stepped it, perch by perch.<br \/>Unbraiding rushes and grass<br \/>I opened my right of way<br \/>through old bottoms and sowed-out ground<br \/>and gathered stones off the ploughing<br \/>to raise a small cairn<br \/>Cleaned out the drains<br \/>faced the hedges<br \/>often got up at dawn<br \/>to walk the outlying fields.<br \/>I composed habits for those acres<br \/>so that my last look would<br \/>neither gluttonous nor starved<br \/>I was ready to go anywhere.<\/blockquote>And he did.  He went everywhere with the words, and he brought us with him.  He moved us through his poetic world.  How rich we are, and will be, because of him.  How very privileged we are to have known him.  Those that the gods love, need and want, Marie, die far too soon.  May he rest in peace.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013100300010#J00200","speaker":"1170"},{"type":"speech","time":1380797100,"counter":107,"content":"<p>Minister, Marie, distinguished poets and guests and my friends from the Yeats Society in Sligo, thank you for being here to share in this moment.  It is very difficult to pay tribute to a man of Seamus Heaney's immense stature.  I am honoured to stand here as a Senator and to be able to contribute.<\/p><p>  At his death, the <i>Irish Independent <\/i>described him as the best known poet in the world.  In 2008, Harvard University, in trying to explain his immense popularity, especially among younger people, said that they were not teeny-boppers, but Heaney-boppers.  That Seamus Heaney was a great poet is in no doubt.  The American poet, Robert Pinksy, said that Heaney had the gift of the storyteller.<\/p><p>  I only came to know him a little bit in person in very recent years, but I knew him long ago from his poems and was always touched by how his words allowed me to reach out to a real world, to reach into his world and to begin to make sense of my world.  Rather than trying to confound or impress people, Seamus just wanted to share what he saw, felt and understood.  He did this by telling the story of his life, the landscape, the weather, the earth, the light, the cold, his mother, his father, the berries, the ferrets, hares, turf, milk, horse, cart, the smells and the feel of steel and wood.  Always the simple things - the clatter of the stones, a kingfisher's blue bolt at dusk, a snipe's bleat, the cold smell of potato mould.  All lines of magic, so many lines of magic.  We have been handed a treasure trove of a mind that could always tell the wood from the trees.<\/p><p>  He could write all of this because he wrote from the heart, from where he had been, from where he was, from where he knew.  His sense of self was very strong and remained so all his life.  Whether he was writing about the pitchfork, the ash plant or his beloved blackbird, he had not read it in any book or thought it might be cool.  No, he had been there, and those things had burned an image, smell or sound on his conscious memory.<\/p><p>  Seamus was a man who never lost touch with who he was and what he wanted to say.  His sense of his own voice was always strong.  He always understood and knew where his roots were and he never shied away from them.  There was nothing post-modern about Seamus.  He did not reinvent himself for a quick headline or a fast buck.  He was always true to himself and to poetry.  His authenticity beamed out from him along with his great, warm smile.  His poetry always felt believed in, not made for money or fame, not crafted for a prize or a promotion.  It was simply what Seamus loved and believed in and what he wanted to do.  It was important; it mattered.  He knew that the voice of the poet was an essential voice in society and that, somehow, now he was that voice.  The scholarship boy had won the greatest prize.<\/p><p>  He knew, too, that this was the most special prize.  As he told <i>The Paris Review<\/i> some 20 years ago, he had always expected to have a job, but the most unexpected and miraculous thing in his life had been the arrival in it of poetry as a vocation and almost as an elevation.  He never lost sight of the responsibility that this miraculous thing had thrust upon him.  In 1993 at University College Swansea, he said that the poet who would be most the poet had to attempt an act of writing that outstripped the conditions even as it observed them.<\/p><p>  As a colleague, Ms Aoife O'Driscoll remembers meeting him at the fourth annual human rights lecture in 2009 when there was much conversation about the attack on the flotilla to Gaza by the Israeli army.  Ms Mary Robinson spoke about that event.  She had just come from a meeting of the elders in South Africa.  As Aoife remembers it, Seamus was standing next to her and listening to Mary.  He had his left hand on his face.  She said that he had an intense and calm look when Mary stopped speaking.  He said that one could just imagine the ships in that moment, on the sea, the people staring at one another, their fear, their excitement, their terror on their faces, but there they were staring and waiting.  Then, he said suddenly, almost abruptly, that poetry was the thing that made us blink.  It was that moment.<\/p><p>  Seamus Heaney knew that he could not hide in the fields and barns of his childhood.  The Troubles and the political conflict of his native land were something that he knew he had to talk about, to deal with, to include in his poetry.  In 1972, in the dedication of his collection <i>Wintering Out<\/i>, he wrote these stark words:<blockquote>This morning from a dewy motorway<br \/>I saw the new camp for the internees:<br \/>a bomb had left a crater of fresh clay<br \/>in the roadside, and over in the trees<br \/>machine-gun posts defined a real stockade.<\/blockquote>The &quot;articulator of the years of pain in the North&quot; was how his old friend, Monsignor Brendan Devlin, summed up Seamus's poetic contribution about the North at his funeral.  Writer and critic, Mr. Blake Morrison, said that Heaney's response to the Troubles showed that he had taken on the mantle of public spokesman.  Yet he did all of this work without trying to be important himself.  He did it because it was important for us.<\/p><p>  His original pseudonym as a writer was Incertus, meaning &quot;Uncertain&quot;.  While he was quickly able to throw that name aside and write as himself, he retained some level of that uncertainty.  By this I mean that he was never so certain of himself and his contribution that he belittled others or saw himself as better, superior or rather grand - a Nobel winner after all.  Those of us lucky enough to have spent even a small time in his company understood that immediately.<\/p><p>  I am no academic.  I never wanted to parse and analyse Heaney's lines.  I never felt that I needed to drill down into it because it drilled into me.  Somehow, I always thought that I knew Seamus before I met him because I felt that he was speaking to me when I read his poetry and that he was telling me about his life.  Or, as he said simply, making sense of a life from a time that he described as not really the 20th century at all, but rather a medieval country where water was carried from the well and horses ploughed the fields.  He was talking about his beloved Bellaghy.<\/p><p>  Seamus Heaney had a long, strong and wonderful relationship with Sligo and that other Nobel prize-winning poet, William Butler Yeats.  Indeed, there is no argument that Seamus Heaney is the greatest poet since Yeats, whom he was able to read as a young boy in his aunt Sarah's house.  She had a three-volume collection of Yeats's plays and poems.  Sitting in the dark of the Hawk's Well Theatre on 4 October this year at the 54th Yeats International Summer School, one could have heard a pin drop and every seat was filled with those of us lucky enough to hear Seamus Heaney's last public reading.  His mind was, as in the words of Henri Cole in <i>The Paris Review<\/i> 20 years ago, alert and mischievous, firm but funny, sharing, enjoying the moment, contemplating his work, reading with his magical, mellifluous voice that itself was a gift.<\/p><p>  His association with the Yeats Society stretched over 40 years.  He first came to read in 1970 as a young poet with just one published collection.  In the words of Ms Stella Mew, the stalwart of the Yeats Society, he came and came and came back to Sligo, winter and summer, to run workshops, lecture and read, and to acknowledge Yeats but, above all, to inspire and support another generation of poets and poetry lovers and to share his own love of ideas and words and his absolute belief in the power of poetry and its place in Ireland and the world.<\/p><p>  Do I have a moment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013100300011#K00100","speaker":"1129"},{"type":"speech","time":1380797100,"counter":108,"content":"<p>The Senator has gone over time as it is.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013100300011#K00200","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1380797100,"counter":109,"content":"<p>I know, but may I finish?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013100300011#K00300","speaker":"1129"},{"type":"speech","time":1380797100,"counter":110,"content":"<p>Briefly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013100300011#K00400","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1380797100,"counter":111,"content":"<p>He loved to visit, to read and to talk to the students who came and still come from around the world to learn about Yeats and to enjoy contemporary poetry.

The following is a piece which he wrote for the launch of Yeats Day in Sligo last year, which has not yet been published:<blockquote><br \/>When Marie and I went there [he was talking about Thoor Ballylee] one bright summer morning two men were working at the top of the tower at the top of the narrow winding stair out on the roof replacing damaged slates.

Their love for each other and their children and grandchildren was always visible and tangible.  Our thoughts are with them and with his close friends.  We hope that today our words will help to fill the emptiness for them in a tiny way.  It should be remembered that on the day before his funeral, 81,000 people attending a football match in Croke Park stood and applauded a poet.

I wish it every success.<\/p><p>  It is an honour to welcome Marie here and to pass on our commiserations to her and Michael, Christopher and Catherine Ann.  Dr. Conor Harper, who is in the Visitors' Gallery, along with Professor Brendan Devlin and others celebrated the wonderful funeral mass for Seamus Heaney.  Professor Devlin cannot be here because he is visiting a very sick friend in Kilkenny.  Also here are, David Hanly, who interviewed Seamus for 20 minutes on &quot;Morning Ireland&quot; when he won the Nobel Prize, Terence Browne, a well known writer on literature and culture and a fellow Derryman, Emmet Kearns, Phil Coulter, Eamon McCann and John Hume from St. Columb's College.  What an amazing collection of alumni from that school.  My sister Geraldine is in charge of them.  Like Professor Devlin, Martin Naughton, the founder of the Seamus Heaney chair of poetry at TCD was unable to attend today.  The Minister will have Seamus in the National Library and he will be remembered down the street in TCD.  Professor Brendan Kennelly also represents that great tradition of poetry.  Others who could not attend include Dr. Edward McParland, pro-chancellor at TCD, and Professor Dan Bradley from Anahorish.<\/p><p>  Conor Cruise O'Brien said of Death of a Naturalist,<i><\/i>&quot;I have read many pessimistic analyses of Northern Ireland but none has had the bleak conclusiveness of this poem.&quot;  Seamus Heaney's volume <i>The Spirit Level <\/i>was described as being tinged with a sense of hopefulness for the passing of conflict.  This was recalled when Seamus took his last journey through the main street in Bellaghy to join his parents and brother Christopher and the PSNI saluted his passing coffin.  In the early days, Seamus wrote about what a difference it was to be called Seamus or Se&aacute;n and not Samuel.  So much had happened up to the time he attended the wonderful dinner in Dublin Castle with Her Majesty the Queen, former President McAleese and Prince Philip.  It was a journey that encapsulated so much of what he had to done to reconcile the traditions of this island.<\/p><p>  Seamus Heaney was the president of the Classical Association of Ireland, by whom he is warmly remembered, during which time, as stated by Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell, he dramatised Sophocles into The Cure at Troy, which was run in the city of Derry.  In the context of entrepreneurship and cultural development, those were incredible times.  Seamus also translated old Irish and <i>Beowulf<\/i> .  His successors at the Classical Association of Ireland include Archbishop Richard Clarke of Armagh and Frank McGuinness, who wrote <i>Observe the<\/i><i>Sons of Ulster Marching Towards the Somme<\/i>.<\/p><p>  Seamus was a great poet.  He also wrote beautiful cards and letters, which we will remember.  It is great to honour him in this Chamber which was graced by another Nobel Prize winner, W. B. Yeats.  This is a marvellous day.  Seamus Heaney's generosity and kindness will live on forever and his memory will be preserved by the Minister in the National Library and by TCD.  Everybody has read with emotion their favourite poem by Seamus.  The following is mine and is celebrated in the museum in Croke Park so that the poet will always be honoured by 81,000 people.  The title of the poem is Markings and is about boys playing football in a field in County Derry:<blockquote>We marked the pitch: four jackets for four goalposts, <br \/>That was all. The corners and the squares <br \/>Were there like <br \/>Under the bumpy  ground, to be <br \/>Agreed about or disagreed about <br \/>When the time came. And then we picked the teams <br \/>And crossed the line our called names drew between us.<br \/>Youngsters shouting their heads off in a field <br \/>As the light died and they kept on playing <br \/>Because by then they were playing in their heads <br \/>And the actual kicked ball came to them <br \/>Like a dream heaviness, and there own hard<br \/>Breathing in the dark and skids on grass <br \/>Sounded like effort in another world . . . <br \/>It was quick and constant, a game that never need <br \/>Be played out.

I welcome the representatives of the Yeats Society who are here with us today, with whom I understand Seamus was involved for 40 years.  Despite receiving the highest accolades by critics worldwide, Seamus Heaney notably never lost the common touch.  I was lucky to have met him in Mayo in my family home.  He helped us celebrate the George Moore festival a number of years ago.  We were thrilled to have him as a guest in our home.  It is a happy memory, in particular during the past while.<\/p><p>  Former US President, Bill Clinton, recently praised Seamus Heaney as our finest poet of the rhythms of ordinary life.  Heaney's poetry possessed an aural beauty and a finely raw texture which he presented with a coherent vision of Ireland past and present.  His early poetry collections painted a portrait of family and farm life in County Derry, evoking a hard, mainly rural, life with rare exactness.  Seamus Heaney also used his collections, <i>Wintering Out <\/i>and <i>North <\/i>to reflect upon the Troubles and sought to weave the ongoing situation in Northern Ireland into a broader historical framework, embracing the general human situation.  Bill Clinton also described Seamus Heaney as a powerful voice for peace.  Seamus was undoubtedly a symbol of hope and inspiration to many during the Troubles.<\/p><p>  Seamus Heaney did not reduce political situations to simple clarity and by all accounts he did not believe his role was as political spokesman.  However, the following lines from his play,<i> The Cure at Troy<\/i> are truly inspirational:<blockquote>History says, don't hope<br \/>On this side of the grave.<br \/>But then, once in a lifetime<br \/>The longed-for tidal wave<br \/>Of justice can rise up,<br \/>And hope and history rhyme.<\/blockquote>Seamus Heaney's work of lyrical beauty and ethical depth, like that of his fellow Irish Nobel Prize winners, Shaw, Beckett and Yeats, are and will continue to be an enduring gift to the world.  Seamus Heaney possessed the rare ability to make one see, hear, smell and taste this life, illustrating that all parishes, rural or urban, are equal as communities of the human spirit.<\/p> <p> I propose to recite a poem, Seeing Things, which I heard while visiting Inishbofin on the weekend after Seamus Heaney passed away.  Coincidentally, I once met Senator Fiach Mac Conghail on Inishbofin and it was he who suggested that we recite a poem today:<blockquote><br \/>Inishbofin on a Sunday morning. <br \/>Sunlight, turfsmoke, seagulls, boatslip, diesel.<br \/>One by one we were being handed down <br \/>Into a boat that dipped and shilly-shallied <br \/>Scaresomely every time.  We sat tight <br \/>On short cross-benches, in nervous twos and threes, <br \/>Obedient, newly close, nobody speaking <br \/>Except the boatmen, as the gunwales sank <br \/>And seemed they might ship water any minute. <br \/>The sea was very calm but even so, <br \/>When the engine kicked and our ferryman <br \/>Swayed for balance, grabbing for the tiller, <br \/>I panicked at the quick response and heft <br \/>Of the craft itself.  What guaranteed us--\u00ad<br \/>That fluency and buoyancy and swim-- <br \/>Kept me in agony.  All the time <br \/>As we went sailing evenly across <br \/>The deep, still, seeable-down-into water, <br \/>It was as if I looked from another boat <br \/>Sailing through air, far up, and could see <br \/>How openly we fared in the light of morning, <br \/>And loved in vain our bare, bowed, numbered heads. <\/blockquote> I offer my deepest and sincerest sympathies and condolences to Marie as well as to Seamus's children, Christopher, Michael and Catherine Ann.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013100300012#L00300","speaker":"1153","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1380798300,"counter":116,"content":"<p>I welcome Marie to the Seanad this afternoon.  It is fitting that the House is paying tribute today to a man who will always be remembered as an Irish legend.  Born in April 1939, shortly before the beginning of the Second World War, in a farmhouse known as Mossbawn between Castledawson and Toomebridge in County Derry, Seamus Heaney moved to Bellaghy in 1953 as a teenager.  He came from ordinary beginnings deep in the Derry countryside.<\/p><p>  Seamus Heaney's contribution to Irish life can only be described as extraordinary and brilliant.  He has been described by many Senators as one of Ireland's greatest and that description is not an understatement.  Many academics and Irish, European, American and world leaders have spoken of the man he was.  Seamus Heaney came through the Troubles in the North and they shaped, in large part, his professional outlook and literature.  He was described by Robert Lowell as the most important Irish poet since Yeats, a sentiment echoed by the academic, John Sutherland, who described Heaney as the greatest poet of our age.  Everyone here will agree with that description.<\/p><p>  As previous speakers noted, on 1 September 2013, a crowd of 81,533 observed a minute's silence and applauded for several minutes at the all-Ireland football semi-final in Croke Park.  This was a fitting and appropriate gesture given the magnitude of Seamus Heaney's influence on Ireland and its people and the importance we, as a nation, place on our cultural and historical identity.  President Michael D. Higgins, the former United States President, Mr. Bill Clinton, the President of the European Commission, Jos&eacute; Manuel Barroso, and leading lights in literary and academic circles paid tribute to Seamus Heaney on his death.  Colm T&oacute;ib&iacute;n wrote the following appropriate words: &quot;In a time of burnings and bombings Heaney used poetry to offer an alternative world&quot;, while the former US President, Bill Clinton, acknowledged not only the greatness of Heaney's work but, more important, its influence in bringing about peace in our time.  This influence cannot go unrecognised.<\/p><p>  I acknowledge the Minister's proposal to recognise the wider contribution of Seamus Heaney.  It is an excellent idea, particularly as Seamus Heaney was an extremely generous man who gifted the State his literary notes in December 2011.  I understand he and his son, Michael, packed the notes in boxes and donated them to the State.  They are an enormous contribution to the State and a great reflection on the man.<\/p><p>  Seamus Heaney will always be remembered as a great Irishman and Gael who influenced the cultural identity of our nation.  In the poem, Digging, from the 1966 volume, <i>Death of a Naturalist,<\/i> he reflects on his past and brings it into the literary work that was to shape poetry in this country and the minds of generations of young people in the classroom who learned about poetry through his writings.  I will recite some of the lines from Digging: <blockquote>My grandfather cut more turf in a day<br \/>Than any other man on Toner's bog.<br \/>Once I carried him milk in a bottle<br \/>Corked sloppily with paper.  He straightened up<br \/>To drink it, then fell to right away<br \/>Nicking and slicing neatly, heaving sods<br \/>Over his shoulder, going down and down<br \/>For the good turf.  Digging.<br \/>The cold smell of potato mould, the squelch and slap<br \/>Of soggy peat, the curt cuts of an edge<br \/>Through living roots awaken in my head.<br \/>But I've no spade to follow men like them.<br \/>Between my finger and my thumb<br \/>The squat pen rests.<br \/>I'll dig with it.<\/blockquote> Ar dheis l&aacute;mh D&eacute; go raibh a anam uasal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013100300013#M00200","speaker":"1123"},{"type":"speech","time":1380798300,"counter":117,"content":"<p>I, too, am grateful to have an opportunity to pay tribute to Seamus Heaney, a renowned poet and Nobel laureate.

His startling depictions in his poetry of the Troubles in Northern Ireland acted as a catalyst for reconciliation between North and South.  Not only was he an inspiration to many through his poetry, he also showed an extraordinary commitment to human rights and the fight for a better world.  His deep love of his land and its people will live on through this generation and future generations, as will his work and legacy.<\/p><p>While I was not as fortunate as other speakers to have met Seamus Heaney, I have met two of his children, Mick and Christopher.  They share their father's personality, wit and love of language.  It is lovely to know that through this sadness, Marie will take comfort from the fact that Seamus's amazing personality and love of family will live on through his children and grandchildren.<\/p><p>As a former teacher of English, I had the pleasure of introducing students to Seamus Heaney's poetry.  With no disrespect to the other esteemed and renowned poets who are present, I loved teaching his poetry.  It will stay with us as it struck a chord with the students I taught.<\/p> <p>This was because it gives a vivid depiction of the not-so-ancient history of our country.  He has influenced the generations of young people who studied his poetry at school, young people who could relate.  It is so important that we are able to relate to the young people and to educate them in order that they may grow up to influence and educate the generations to come.<\/p><p> I will conclude by reading my favourite poem, the poem I used to love and get so much enjoyment from, as did my students.  It is a poem about innocence and childhood.  Reading back through it this morning brought back all the memories of conciseness and the idea that one can get so much into so few lines but open so many thought-provoking ideas as well:<blockquote>Mid-Term Break<br \/><br \/>I sat all morning in the college sick bay<br \/>Counting bells knelling classes to a close.<br \/>At two o'clock our neighbours drove me home.<br \/><br \/>In the porch I met my father crying--<br \/>He had always taken funerals in his stride--<br \/>And Big Jim Evans saying it was a hard blow.<br \/><br \/>The baby cooed and laughed and rocked the pram<br \/>When I came in, and I was embarrassed<br \/>By old men standing up to shake my hand<br \/><br \/>And tell me they were 'sorry for my trouble,'<br \/>Whispers informed strangers I was the eldest,<br \/>Away at school, as my mother held my hand<br \/><br \/>In hers and coughed out angry tearless sighs.<br \/>At ten o'clock the ambulance arrived<br \/>With the corpse, stanched and bandaged by the nurses.<br \/><br \/>Next morning I went up into the room.

Our loss does not compare to the loss of Marie.  We share that.  I support all the emotion because it is important in this cynical age that emotion is seen as a valid response to bereavement and loss.  It is also a response to events and the passing of Seamus Heaney is an event as well as a moment of personal and professional grieving.<\/p><p>  I cannot say I knew him well but his extraordinary generosity made me feel that I was one of his closest colleagues and friends.  I worked with him as director of the Abbey Theatre.  We produced his play &quot;The Burial at Thebes&quot;.  That play, along with &quot;The Cure at Troy&quot;, demonstrated how he understood and supported theatre and the politics of theatre, and how theatre could communicate issues of justice, politics and equality.  Often there was a mild accusation that Seamus was not political.  In fact, he was quite the opposite and he used the power of poetry to be allegorical, mischievous and challenging.  That is one of his greatest legacies.<\/p><p>  This is a wonderful occasion today because it is all-Ireland poetry day.  What a wonderful occasion for us to be celebrating not only Seamus Heaney but poetry.  I extend my welcome and f&aacute;ilte to Professor Brendan Kennelly, David Hanley, Terence Brown and other colleagues here.  I acknowledge that the community of poets in this country are also bereft and at loss because one of their brethren, a colleague of theirs, is no longer with us.<\/p><p>  I will read one of his poems that was commissioned by Amnesty International, From The Republic Of Conscience.  He remarked on it in a wonderful book of conversations - another of his legacies - with Dennis O'Driscoll, who, sadly, is also no longer with us.  Heaney said that he remembered a poem by another writer that helped him to get started, in this case, by Richard Wilbur, and that he used Wilbur's poem Shame to do a little commissioning himself.  He said that Wilbur made an allegory of Shame by turning it into a small cramped country.  During the previous term, Heaney asked the Harvard students in his workshop to write a poem based on it.  Then it occurred to him that he could ask himself to do the same thing, to make up an imaginary country to represent a particular state of mind or feeling.  Once the job was presented in those terms, the element of play entered and he was able to cross the frontier of writing and shift out of the doldrums of what happens.  Amnesty International had sent him some reports about the injustice and suffering endured by prisoners of conscience in different parts of the world.  All he could do at first was quail before that evidence.  No cry he could have made in verse could have matched what was crying out in the dossiers.  He had to recover and &quot;by indirections find directions out&quot;.<\/p><p>  The poem was read recently by another south Derry artist, Eleanor Methven, who was a member of the cast of &quot;Major Barbara&quot;, which we ran in the Abbey Theatre.  On the morning that we heard of the passing of Seamus, Eleanor read it on the stage of the Abbey Theatre and there was a standing ovation afterwards as a way to mark his passing:<blockquote>From The Republic Of Conscience<br \/>I<br \/>When I landed in the republic of conscience<br \/>it was so noiseless when the engines stopped<br \/>I could hear a curlew high above the runway.<br \/><br \/>At immigration, the clerk was an old man<br \/>who produced a wallet from his homespun coat<br \/>and showed me a photograph of my grandfather.<br \/><br \/>The woman in customs asked me to declare<br \/>the words of our traditional cures and charms<br \/>to heal dumbness and avert the evil eye.<br \/><br \/>No porters.

He was described by fellow poet, Robert Lowell, as the most important Irish poet since Yeats, no small statement, and, indeed, he was.<\/p><p>  His life has been celebrated throughout Ireland during his life and since is death by all the print media, national media and every type of media.  He was given a front-page dedication in the <i>New York Times<\/i>.<\/p><p>  It is fitting that we in Seanad &Eacute;ireann use our final opportunity for statements before the vote - I am referring to before the vote, not the final statements in Seanad &Eacute;ireann - to pay tribute to a great man, a great family man and a great people's poet.<\/p><p>  In his final farewell he brought together people from all walks of life, old friends and new friends, fellow poets and wordsmiths, heads of state and government, politicians, diplomats, rock stars, actors, those who had met him, those who had not met him and those who wanted to pay tribute and be associated with him on his final day.  They came to show their respect and admiration for him and his family.  I read something in the newsprint following his funeral, the words of a taxi driver, who said to a journalist that it was a sad day for us all and that he was an extraordinary ordinary man.<\/p> <p>Before coming in, I spoke briefly to Marie and she spoke of all the letters and cards she had received, not from dignitaries, important people or whoever, but from the ordinary people of Ireland who wrote in extraordinary words.  She said they themselves were poets and that their words were valued and appreciated.  This again is a tribute to the Heaney family and to Seamus, who was in great demand worldwide but who found so much time for the ordinary people.  I attended the Clifden Arts Festival last weekend, at which a loving, moving tribute was paid to him for all of the time and work he had given to the ordinary extraordinary people of Clifden during the many arts festivals held there.<\/p><p> As a member of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, I note that as a poet from Bellaghy and Northern Ireland who lived in Dublin, Heaney used his work to reflect upon the Troubles, the often-violent political struggles that plagued the country during his young adulthood.  He sought to weave the ongoing Irish troubles into a broader historical frame embracing the general human situation in his books <i>Wintering Out<\/i>of 1973 and <i>North<\/i>of 1975.  Caithim c&uacute;pla focal a r&aacute; tr&iacute; Ghaeilge mar gheall ar a chuid oibre &iacute;ontach ar an aistri&uacute;chan a dhearna s&eacute; ar <i>Buile Shuibhne<\/i>, that is, <i>Sweeney Astray<\/i>, his great translation of the medieval work, <i>Buile Shuibhne<\/i>.  It concerns an ancient king who, cursed by the church, is transformed into a mad birdman and forced to wander in the harsh and inhospitable countryside.  Heaney's translation of that epic medieval work was published in 1984 as <i>Sweeney Astray: A Version from the Irish.  <\/i>As my own maiden name was Sweeney and some might say &quot;Sweeney astray&quot;, I have a resonance with that magnificent poem and work of prose by Seamus Heaney.

I cannot claim to have been a friend of Seamus but feel as though I knew him as a friend, as I think did everyone else.  We knew him through his words and through his personality.  I would prefer to touch on his personality at this stage, as well as his words, because I have heard so many stories over the years.  One occurred quite recently, when my wife, Denise, and I were in Galway and went out for a meal in Moran's on the Weir.  This was perhaps a month or six weeks ago, when Sheila Moran came over to us to tell us how only that morning, she had had a little visit from Seamus himself.  He came in for a cup of coffee, I am unsure if Marie was with him or if he was on his own.  In any event, she told me the story of how he had been there before and she knew of a poem which mentioned Moran's.  She had had it typed out and wanted it framed and was hoping he would sign it.  However, when he had come in and she had asked him to sign it, he said he would not but that he would write it out again.  He hand-wrote it out and I gather it has been framed there ever since.<\/p><p>  It is these little stories about how everyone felt he or she knew him and that he was his or her friend.  Anne &Oacute; Broin has worked with me for more than 27 years and her father was a poet or liked to be a poet and did his best.  She told me that he just loved it.  Coming up to his 80th birthday, which was perhaps ten or 12 years ago as he died last year, she wondered what she could get for him.  She decided to get him an anthology of Seamus's work.  As she knew where the family lived, she wrote to Seamus and, having enclosed a stamped addressed envelope, asked him whether he would sign the anthology.  However, he did not sign it but instead wrote a lovely warm letter to her father for his 80th birthday and I can tell Marie that the book and that letter are highly valued.  It seems to me that these are the memories people have of this wonderful man.  They are the memories we all have, as well as the feeling that we knew him so well.<\/p><p>  Approximately eight years ago, I got a present from friends of a lovely handwritten letter from Seamus Heaney to me.  I really appreciated it and have found it to be something I value a great deal.  It is a lovely poem, which I will read.  I had originally intended to read the poem Digging from the collection <i>Death of a Naturalist<\/i> but my colleague, Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill, beat me to it by reading it approximately half an hour ago and I will read this poem instead.  Incidentally, I did have a falling out with Seamus about 20 or 30 years ago, because I became very jealous and envious of him.  My wife returned to UCD to study literature and I found that she became infatuated and so I became very jealous and envious.  While I am unsure whether she ever met him, she continued to talk about him.<\/p><p>  That Christmas, when looking for a present for her, I actually bought a lovely framed version of Digging from <i>Death of a Naturalist<\/i>.  We have it at home and it is very valued on that basis.  The envy disappeared very quickly through the love of the poem.  However, let me just explain what is the poem on the lovely gift I received in 2005.  It is called Colmcille the Scribe and it is a version by Seamus Heaney of an early Irish poem beginning, &quot;Sgith mo crob on scr&iacute;binn&quot;.  The poet translated the poem to celebrate his enrolment as a member of the Royal Irish Academy at the Guildhall, Derry, on 9 June 1997.  To mark the 1400th anniversary of the death of Colmcille, Dr. Heaney commissioned Tim O'Neill, the calligrapher and authority on early Irish manuscripts, to write the poem on vellum and he presented it to the academy on the occasion of his admission as a member.  I am honoured to have one of 150 copies of that poem and it is greatly valued by me.  Therefore, having this lovely message from Seamus is very valued.  While I am sure I will not do it justice, I will read the poem to Marie.  It is called Colmcille the Scribe and is from the 11th century:<blockquote>My hand is cramped from penwork.<br \/>My quill has a tapered point.<br \/>Its bird-mouth issues a blue-dark<br \/>Beetle-spark of ink.<br \/><br \/>Wisdom keeps welling in streams<br \/>From my fine-drawn, sallow hand:<br \/>Riverrun on the vellum<br \/>of ink from green-skinned holly.<br \/><br \/>My small runny pen keeps going<br \/>Through books, through thick and thin<br \/>To enrich the scholars' holdings:<br \/>penwork that cramps my hand.<\/blockquote>It is from the 11th century Irish and is signed by Seamus.  It is something that I value.  We all very much value the wonderful memories we have of Seamus, the work he has done, the words he has given us and the great pleasure he has given to so many people over the years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013100300015#O00200","speaker":"1145"},{"type":"speech","time":1380799500,"counter":123,"content":"<p>Like others I am grateful to have the opportunity to speak during this debate paying tribute to the late Seamus Heaney following his sad and most untimely death.  I also welcome Marie to the House and extend sincere condolences to her, as well as to Mick, Christopher and Catherine Ann, as well as to her grandchildren and family.  I also welcome Professors Kennelly and Brown and other distinguished visitors from Trinity College and from the Yeats Society, as well as an American visitor, Mark Tuohy, who also are present in the Gallery for this debate.<\/p><p>I personally always have loved Seamus's poetry.  I had the pleasure and privilege of meeting him in Trinity as I was there at the same time as Seamus and Marie's son, Mick.  Like everyone else has noted, he was friendly and approachable, with a touch of mischief it must be said, as well as being humorous, which perhaps was very different to the somewhat austere stereotype of the Nobel Laureate that one might expect.<\/p> <p>With all due respect to William Butler Yeats, I always thought he appears to have been a somewhat more austere figure.  <\/p><p> It was with deep sadness and regret I learned of Seamus Heaney's death.  It touched so many people - all over Ireland, North and South, and outside this island.  Others have referred to him as &quot;the people's poet&quot;.  From random conversations with taxi drivers, colleagues, friends and acquaintances following his death, it was clear just how deeply people everywhere were touched.  Senator O'Keeffe described the &quot;Heaneybopper&quot; phenomenon, which was widespread.  The extent to which people everywhere were touched by Seamus's death was extraordinary.  Perhaps it is because his poetry, while apparently homely, much of it dealing with domestic issues, his childhood and upbringing, always carried universal themes.  Others have spoken of the importance of Heaney's poetry as a human response to the Northern Ireland Troubles.  Blake Morrison described Seamus as a spokesman although his mantle of public spokesman was somewhat contested.  Yet there was that homely touch, that dwelling on universal themes.<\/p><p> Others have read very eloquently from Seamus's poetry, with Senator Moran reading from my favourite poem.  It is that perhaps because I came across it first when I was much younger.  It is, of course, Mid-term Break, which was about the death of his younger brother.  I always find it extremely moving and did so when Senator Moran read it just now.  It is an incredibly poignant account of loss told through the eyes of a child.  It is one of those poems that are timeless.<\/p><p> I acknowledge the long association that Seamus had with Trinity College, Dublin.  As my fellow Dublin University colleague, Senator Barrett, mentioned, Seamus had a long-standing relationship with Trinity where, since 1998, he had been an honorary fellow.  The provost paid a very warm tribute to him recently, pointing out the deep respect and admiration the Trinity College community and the wider community had for him.  Seamus gave of his time and intellect freely within Trinity.  I remember a packed-out Edmund Burke theatre some years ago where he was giving a reading in support of Amnesty International but he also gave readings in Trinity on other occasions and as part of charity fundraisers.  Senator Barrett mentioned the Seamus Heaney Professorship in Irish Writing, recently named in his honour, which I believe will form a legacy - one of many - to the significant and immense contribution he has made to Irish writing and literary studies.  <\/p><p> Every speaker has mentioned Seamus's common touch and the immense and widespread response and outpouring following his death.  However, it is noteworthy too that he was a major intellectual figure.  His translations, in particular that of <i>Beowulf<\/i>, were rigorous academic studies.  He gained immense respect at that level, as well as at the popular one within the Irish community.  <i>Newsweek<\/i>gave a lovely description of his translation of <i>Beowulf,<\/i>saying it had &quot;muscular language, rich with the tones and smell of earth&quot;.  That was appropriate to the particular text; it revitalised it as well as being true to its spirit.  <\/p><p> There is no doubt that his loss is an immense loss to Irish society as well as to the international community.  He lectured at Oxford, Harvard and elsewhere.  It is an immense loss.  Most of all, we pay our sincere condolences to the Heaney family, to Marie and to the family.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013100300015#O00300","speaker":"1148","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1380800100,"counter":125,"content":"<p>Cuirim c&eacute;ad f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire agus roimh na h-a&iacute;onna speisialta, go h&aacute;irithe Marie.

Marie is very welcome and it is an honour to be able to pay respects in the Seanad to Seamus and to try to say words that encompass all he achieved.  I feel completely inadequate standing up to do so because I know anything we say will not match the genius of the man himself.<\/p><p>  I cannot say I ever met Seamus Heaney but I bumped into him once in the airport and was totally starstruck.  We were queueing for an aeroplane and when one is doing that one goes backwards and forwards.  I caught his eye and he caught mine and I knew he was looking at me and saying, &quot;You know who I am&quot;.  I was an ordinary Joe Soap at the time - I still am - but there was a glint in his eye that told me he recognised that I knew who he was.  What struck me in the first instance was the size of the man - he was a big man and he had a long grey coat and that white hair.  There was a sense of humility about him.  One did not get a sense of ego or &quot;look at me&quot;.  He gave a really nice smile.  I did not need to say anything to him.  I wanted to talk to him because there were so many questions I would have liked to ask him but to be honest I was too shy.  I was awestruck.  However, I got a sense of the man he was, a very gentle, warm, smiling man - wonderful.<\/p><p>  Seoid n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta a bh&iacute; ann.  He was an absolute treasure for us.  File, dr&aacute;mad&oacute;ir, teagasc&oacute;ir - he was a poet, a dramatist and also a teacher.  From what I have read and seen and from listening to people talking about him the great thing that comes across is the generosity of his gift.  He saw his writing as a gift; as far as I can see he never saw it as something he had that was special. but saw it as a gift he was lucky to have, one he was so very willing to share it.  That is very special and it is probably one of the elements that made him so special.  He had a great knowledge of very many countries and places but very much of Ireland - all of it.  I will try to do justice to one of my favourite poems, which relates particularly to the west of Ireland, from where I come.  One can see the way he captured nature, time and life passing on:<blockquote>Lovers on Aran<br \/><br \/>The timeless waves, bright, sifting, broken glass,<br \/>Came dazzling around, into the rocks,<br \/>Came glinting, sifting from the Americas<br \/><br \/>To posess Aran.  Or did Aran rush<br \/>to throw wide arms of rock around a tide<br \/>That yielded with an ebb, with a soft crash?<br \/><br \/>Did sea define the land or land the sea?<br \/>Each drew new meaning from the waves' collision.<br \/>Sea broke on land to full identity. <\/blockquote>Obviously, Seamus was a genius but it seems to me he was somebody who carried his genius very humbly.  To be able to put so much into so few words was an incredible gift.  <\/p><p>  It is strange.  I was delayed coming up to the Chamber because an Irish language event was taking place downstairs and I bumped into a girl who was a student in St. Patrick's College last year.  Seamus visited that college last year.  I was not sure how much background Seamus would have had with the Irish language but she told me that he came to them when they were doing an event as Gaeilge, and supported them wholeheartedly.  He spoke to them in Irish and told them to keep up the good work, saying, &quot;Coinnigh suas an dea-obair, coinnigh suas an obair mhaith&quot;.  Another point is that he seemed to have crossed generations and is loved by old and young alike, which is an amazing gift to have.  <\/p><p>  We are a much poorer nation because of his loss.  There are lessons we must learn too.  In this Chamber we tend to have many debates on finance and the economy, the cost of things, etc.  However, I do not know whether we realise the value of things, in particular the value of the arts, creativity and so on.  A moment such as this in the Chamber is a time to reflect on that.  Although we may be going through difficult times financially and economically, we have a great richness of language, theatre and the arts.  People like Seamus Heaney are our gold bullion.  We need to remember that and to encourage it, as he would have done.  I am sure that what he might say to us is, yes, we will get through the tide, the woes and the hard times, but let us remember we have this great richness to us as well.<\/p><p>  Another great poet from the west was John O'Donoghue.  If I may, I will quote three lines of one of his poems, to note the occasion:<blockquote>Though we need to weep your loss<br \/>You dwell in that safe place in our hearts<br \/>Where no storm or night or pain can reach you<\/blockquote>Bh&iacute; s&eacute; linn, beidh s&eacute; linn agus t&aacute; s&eacute; linn.

Somebody very close to me, whose mother died, was reading a poem by Seamus.<\/p> <p>That person was reading a poem by Seamus Heaney.  I have to read it without my iPhone because unfortunately Senator Fiach Mac Conghail got to the Republic of Conscience before me.

I am sorry I forgot to mention the Minister.<\/p><p>I always considered Seamus Heaney to be a man of great courage.  He dared to be different.  That he came out of his background and yet had remained so connected with it, is an incredible power.  My image of Seamus is always with his feet solidly imbedded in the soil and yet to have navigated the world from that point was an incredible gift.

Through his poetry he made our ordinary world really extraordinary.  He was as Senator Marie Louse O'Donnell said a diviner of words that gave us a sense that we were all great in our existence, an existence we often thought was completely miserable.  When I look at his poem Digging and lines such as: <\/p><p>\tStooping in rhythm through potato drills<\/p><p>\tWhere he was digging.<\/p><p>I remember doing that with my father.  I did not think there was anything great in that.  Or the following lines:<\/p><p>\tOnce I carried him milk in a bottle<\/p><p>\tCorked sloppily with paper.<\/p><p>I did that too.  Through his words he made us realise that we value this - that this is life and it is our life and it is worth valuing.<\/p><p>When I think of all the trials and tribulations the Minister has had with the boglands, perhaps Seamus would have been the key negotiator he needed on his side so many times to make ends meet, so to speak.

Absolutely.  I consider myself very fortunate to have been a student of Seamus Heaney.  I attended Carysfort College in the early 1980s.  As a 19 year old he supervised, probably, my second teaching practice.  Somehow I knew there was a bit of greatness about him because a good friend attended his English lectures.  She used to speak to me about his work and on one occasion she told me he had to leave the lecture because the BBC was looking for him.  I knew this was no ordinary teaching practice supervisor.  He observed my class and he said afterwards it was grand but added, \"If I were you I would put in another stage in your teaching\".  When one is 19 years of age one is doing well to manage a class and one is thinking of just delivering.  I am conscious that Senator Marie Louise O'Donnell is present because she was there also in those days.  I said, \"What exactly do you mean?\"  He said, \"You need to graph it, you need to paint it, you need to engage them so that they discover what it is you want to teach them\".  For that I was ever grateful.  It certainly made me a much better teacher at a very young age.  Some 15 years later I became a teacher educator.  He was way ahead of his time, even with that piece of advice, because in 1999 we revised the primary school curriculum to imbed that approach.<\/p><p>In every way he contributed much, as Senator Ivana Bacik said.  As well as being the ordinary man who made things extraordinary for us, he was also an intellectual and a great teacher.  I pay tribute also to Marie because on more than one occasion I heard her read, particularly at the Children's Literature Association of Ireland in the company of that great wizard Robert Dunbar, when she shared with us the stories of the clans of Ulster and the hounds of Ulster.  It was, as Senator Marie Louise O'Donnell said, a great union that touched many lives.

What an extraordinary experience it is to do this in the presence of Marie, as a way of us offering our deepest sympathy to her.  I have just two simple offerings of appreciation in that regard to say about her husband and life partner.<\/p> <p>I want to express personally an appreciation for all the times I reached for a poem of his in order to help me understand the meaning of being human, whether it was an event, a time of grief or a time of joy, because I think that was one of his greatest gifts as a poet.  About a week after he died, I got word that I was to be given an award.  It came out of the blue for me and was something I never expected.  Not unlike what I often did, I went to our bedroom which has a few bookshelves.  There is a copy of every book of poetry he had published, as my partner, Ann Louise, always bought them as they came out.  I reached for one called<i>The Spirit Level <\/i>to try to help me to understand, to get a sense of and experience the meaning of what was happening.  I read a poem I had never read before and it was just perfect.  While it may not have been my most favourite, it was extraordinary for that moment and it helped me, like many other times, to understand that moment - that dimension of being human in my life.  It is actually from the collection, <i>The Spirit Level <\/i>, which I understand was the one he published after winning the Nobel Prize.  It is the last poem in the collection and it is called Postscript:<blockquote><br \/>And some time make the time to drive out west<br \/>Into County Clare, along the Flaggy Shore,<br \/>In September or October, when the wind<br \/>And the light are working off each other<br \/>So that the ocean on one side is wild<br \/>With foam and glitter, and inland among stones<br \/>The surface of a slate-grey lake is lit<br \/>By the earthed lightening of flock of swans,<br \/>Their feathers roughed and ruffling, white on white,<br \/>Their fully-grown headstrong-looking heads<br \/>Tucked or cresting or busy underwater.<br \/>Useless to think you'll park or capture it<br \/>More thoroughly. You are neither here nor there,<br \/>A hurry through which known and strange things pass<br \/>As big soft buffetings come at the car sideways<br \/>And catch the heart off guard and blow it open<\/blockquote>That is what I felt like that day - big soft buffetings coming at me, catching my heart off guard and blowing it open - and so I want to express a personal appreciation to be able to continue to reach for his poems, as so many people do throughout the world, to help me understand the meaning of being human.  They are sacred texts.<\/p><p> I want to offer another simple offering of appreciation.  Others have referred to his great contribution to the field of human rights.  Senator Bacik mentioned that he was an intellectual giant as well as a poet.  I want to remember an extraordinary night for the Irish Human Rights Commission a number of years ago when we invited Seamus to give the yearly lecture on human rights.  In fact, I think it was the high point of the decade of the Irish Human Rights Commission.  The theme chosen for him to speak to us on was the relevance of poetry in times of societal upheaval and unrest.  <\/p><p> Of course, he came to that lecture with a most extraordinary script where he weaved his reflections on other poets' work and really effectively illustrated that our poets have always written in times of turmoil.  Just after he quoted from Dante, Shakespeare and Ulysses, he - this extraordinary mind - said:<blockquote>These, as I say, are the classic voices, all of them fundamental to the evolution and maintenance of a more equitable and civilised world.  And in their wake, right down to the present, the work of writers has been crucial in keeping alive conscience and the spirit of freedom not only within the individual psyche but also in the collective mind of nations and of people.  <\/blockquote> Later in the lecture, he talked about Brodsky, a Russian poet living a bohemian literary life in Leningrad in the late 1950s and early 1960s.  He said of him: &quot;Because of his experience of the totalitarian system in action, Brodsky had a deeply ingrained fear not just of political propaganda, but of writing that too ardently supported causes, even good causes.&quot;  We should all take a little note of that.  He reminded us that Brodsky had said that the only defence against evil is complete originality.  Seamus went on to reflect that: &quot;Poetry, in his understanding, was the sponsor of that originality, and as a result of that sponsorship poetry was an agent of human liberty and human rights.&quot;<\/p><p> By way of personal appreciation for his poetry, I continue to reach for it not only to help me to understand the meaning of being human and acknowledge them as sacred texts, but also to help me on every journey and every path in regard to human rights.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013100300017#Q00700","speaker":"1176","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1380801300,"counter":136,"content":"<p>Unfortunately, I had a medical appointment that I had to keep but I will not delay proceedings.  I first encountered Seamus Heaney when I was in college in Dublin.  I became an immediate admirer of his work and subsequently a teacher of English literature in Kerry.  In those days, the mandarins in the Department were very cautious and slow-moving and those who set the curriculum for the leaving certificate were of the opinion that all Irish poetry ceased following the death of W. B. Yeats or Clarke.  It was great to be able to bring Heaney into class if nothing else as a counterpoint.  It was something the students used to like.  We also did so with our neighbouring poets, including the great Brendan Kennelly, who is my near neighbour from Ballylongford and who is here with us today, and the late Michael Hartnett from Abbeyfeale.  The students understood Heaney and those two poets immediately.  It was different from the set format laid out by the Department.<\/p><p>Seamus Heaney's position in the pantheon of Irish literature is set in stone.  To use the words of Yeats, the people will be speaking of him forever.  I will not add anything to that other than to sympathise with Marie and his family.<\/p><p>On a parochial note, my wife Madeleine was chairperson of writers' week in Listowel for many years and we got to know Seamus well because he was a great supporter of the writing festival as well as writing festivals all over the country.

What I have been reading is rather interesting.  Seamus Heaney and W. B. Yeats shared a legacy that was spoken about in great detail by many people on his passing and it reminded me of the one and only occasion on which I met Seamus Heaney.  I was chairman of F&aacute;ilte Ireland North West at the time and we were launching the Yeats Trail in Sligo.  I had the honour of being with him on that occasion and because it was about Yeats I recall quoting one of Yeats's poems and apologising to Seamus for not quoting one of his but that I had no doubt he would take the opportunity to do so, which he did.  I want to express my deepest sympathy to Marie and to all of his family on the loss of an outstanding husband, father and patriot.<\/p><p>  I could not help but reflect that one of the poems that struck me as resonating, and we all have our reasons for selecting various extracts from Seamus's anthology, was Sunlight, which he wrote some four years after the death of his mother with whom he had a particularly close relationship.  I will not read it all other than to convey the sense of that relationship to which most of us would relate in our own homes:<blockquote>So, her hands scuffled<br \/>over the backboard, <br \/>the reddening stove<br \/><br \/>sent its plaque of heat <br \/>against her where she stood <br \/>in a floury apron<br \/>by the window.<br \/><br \/>Now she dusts the board<br \/>with a goose's wing,<br \/>Now sits, broad-lapped,<br \/>with whitened nails<br \/><br \/>and measling shins:<br \/>here is a space<br \/>again, the scone rising<br \/>to the ticks of two clocks.<br \/><br \/>And here is love<br \/>like a tinsmith's scoop<br \/>sunk past its gleam<br \/>in the meal-bin.<br \/><\/blockquote>Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013100300019#S00200","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1380801900,"counter":140,"content":"<p>As Leader of the House I am privileged to say some brief words about the exceptional man who was Seamus Heaney.  I would like to extend my sincere sympathy and the sincere sympathies and condolences of all Members of Seanad &Eacute;ireann to Marie and her children.  We are delighted that you are here this afternoon to share this occasion with us.<\/p><p>  Many people will have shared the shock last August when we heard the sad news of Seamus's passing.  So much has been said of him since then reminding us, lest we forget, about the impact of his work not only on the people of this island but around the globe.  His true appeal was his inimitable ability to touch a chord with all levels of society.  It is only right and fitting, therefore, that we remember Seamus here in Seanad &Eacute;ireann today.<\/p><p>  Fintan O'Toole wrote a rather fitting article in <i>The Irish Times<\/i> in which he noted how, throughout Seamus's poetry, we are reminded that Ireland is at first a culture before it is an economy.  Given the experiences we have been through in the past number of years we, as a people, should continue to remember that.<\/p><p>  On my journey home to Waterford after Seamus's passing I listened to the radio where contributors from all over the world spoke warmly of Seamus and of his work.  It brought home to me, if we did not know it already, that this was an exceptional man who was revered by all who knew him and whose work will continue to inspire generations into the future.<\/p><p>  I would like to thank the Minister, Deputy Deenihan, for being present here today and all my Seanad colleagues for the heartfelt and genuine tributes to Seamus Heaney.  On this day, before the people of Ireland decide whether Seanad &Eacute;ireann should continue or not, I am proud of the contributions of Members of the House this afternoon and I hope we did some justice to the memory of an exceptional man of our time.

I recognise the quality of their presentations and thank them for reciting some of Seamus Heaney's best-known and epic poetry.  It made the occasion very special and unique.  I thank Marie for being in the audience today.  Her presence gave a special sense of poignancy to the occasion and made it very special.  There was a feeling of sincerity from all the contributions, which were spontaneous.  Also, as the Leader of the House mentioned, they were genuine and heartfelt.  No one was posturing or trying to impress.  These were genuine expressions of sentiment, admiration and respect for a special person.<\/p><p>It is good to be joined here today by Des Kavanagh and David Hanly but also by Professor Brendan Kennelly.  To me and to us in Kerry, Brendan Kennelly is up there with Heaney and Yeats.  They were great friends and shared that special talent with words.  It is a great tribute to Seamus Heaney that Professor Kennelly would come into the House today to listen to all the tributes made to Seamus Heaney.  I thank Brendan sincerely.  He was a great fellow Kerry footballer in his time who could also relate so much to the field and the markings in Heaney's great poem to which all of us young people growing up in Kerry could relate.  There were several markings on Kerry pitches throughout the length and breadth of Kerry, and indeed the rest of the country.<\/p><p>I tried to write something while listening and being inspired by all Members to sum up in some way what they were saying about Seamus Heaney.  I will conclude by saying that in all of his work Seamus embodied the adage that the truly brilliant need no artifice.  They are who they are, and he remained who he was - always true to himself.  He painted scenes with words lesser wordsmiths would have discarded to the humdrum business of conjunction and preposition.  Words were his thing, and none were ordinary.  They came to him with height, density and sound, and he gave them soul and life.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013100300019#S00900","speaker":"1046"},{"type":"speech","time":1380801900,"counter":142,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

Akin to what is happening in respect of this House, we should be looking at reforming, re-invigorating and re-energising the county enterprise board structure instead of abolishing it.  The model has been proved to have worked and it is a mistake to go the down the road of abolishing the county enterprise boards.<\/p><p>I outlined yesterday that board members come from a wide array of bodies, including local authorities, trade unions, employer organisations, State agencies and local businesses.  They gave their time on a voluntary basis and that will now be lost as a result of this Bill.  It is also an attack on the competence and professionalism of the county enterprise boards staff around the country who have been unfairly treated in this process.  I will return to this point when we come to section 12.  It is undermining the competence of people who have a proven track record and ability.  Many county enterprise boards share IT and payroll functions with local authorities and savings can be made through that process if it is a question of savings.<\/p> <p>As I mentioned yesterday, the county manager in Donegal had been chairperson of the Donegal county enterprise board since its establishment in 1993.  There is a new county manager there now and that person is chairperson of the board.<\/p><p>A major area of concern is that the plans envisage the local authority providing matching funding to any funds allocated by central government to the new local enterprise office, LEO.  We are all aware of the financial constraints of local authorities.  If they are expected to part-fund the functions of the LEO, it will place a further financial strain on them, given that the county enterprise board model has been funded exclusively to date since 1993 from central government funds.  How will this difficulty be addressed?  What discussions have taken place with local authorities or with the Department of  the Environment, Community and Local Government?  From where will the shortfall in funding come?  Some local authorities are not merely struggling but approaching bankruptcy.  The idea that the local property tax would replace such funding is a non-runner because the model has an 80% return based on what is collected.  That will not fill this gap, as I am aware from having discussed the matter with the staff in County Donegal that money has already been budgeted for by directors of service and country managers.  That is a grave mistake and it will have drastic consequences.  I hope there is an explanation for that.<\/p><p>As I mentioned the staff of the county enterprise boards have been dealt with quite inappropriately.  Section 12 provides for Forf&aacute;s, Enterprise Ireland or a local authority to accept staff into their employment that were previously employed by a county enterprise board.  What discussions have taken place with county enterprise board staff to date?<\/p><p>We are talking about business and creating jobs and many things need to be done to sustain our employment base in country, particularly the domestic employment base.  We need a system where grants can be made available by the Government through agencies because the banks are lending.  Zero-interest loans should be made available to those who create employment in our economy.  It is the only way forward, the pathway towards the recovery.  Leaving lending to the banks amounts to negligence because that will not work and it has been proven not to work up to now.  Despite the falsified figures banks are providing, they are simply not lending.<\/p><p>Another issue is commercial rates, which needs to addressed.  If local authorities are expected, on the one hand, to collect commercial rates from prospective employers and, on the other, to be seen to be funding business, there is a conflict of interest there, and I believe that is a wrong move.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013100300020#U00200","speaker":"1123","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1380802800,"counter":148,"content":"<p>I will speak briefly to the Bill which I welcome.  As one who was a member of an enterprise board in Waterford for a number of years, I recognise the work enterprise boards have done not alone in my city but throughout the country.  They have been quite successful.  I compliment the staff, past and present, the board members and the evaluation committees who did such tremendous work down the years.  I hope that as a result of setting up these LEOs we will not lose all the expertise that was available to enterprise boards.  When entrepreneurs were going about their business, they were helped by enterprise boards but what they wanted was a one-stop-shop for local entrepreneurs.  They wanted information on State supports and developments of services.  While the enterprise board could give them quite an amount of that information, bringing these offices in under the umbrella of the local authority - the vast majority of the members of board were local authority members who gave tremendous service to the boards - is a change in local government.  It gives more power back to local government in that it is involved in enterprise.  This should be welcomed by officials and members of local authorities.  There is nobody better placed in the community than the local authority to have a one-stop-shop, bringing together these bodies.  We all know that micro-enterprise and the small business sector are the backbone and the lifeblood of the community and that they provide many jobs.<\/p><p>I welcome that while the LEOs are coming under Enterprise Ireland and will be in the local authorities, they will be supported by a centre of excellence, by Enterprise Ireland.  The addition of the functions of that centre will include promoting innovation and best practice and approach to supporting start-up and entrepreneurship, working with the LEOs to design and deliver appropriate national training and management development programmes at local level, and developing a common approach to mentoring and mentor management.  That is to be welcomed.  These are types of supports that people starting off in business want.  They want and need to be mentored.  I am delighted to say that many of the small businesses that started up through enterprise boards have gone to on to be under the umbrella of Enterprise Ireland when they created ten or more jobs.  It is a follow-on brining all these bodies together under Enterprise Ireland and it is to be welcomed.  It is part of the jobs action programme.  These LEOs will play a important role in creating jobs.  If we could get micro, small and medium-sized enterprises to create only one job in each of them, we would probably solve our unemployment problem.  That is the importance of that sector.  The Government is and will continue to support this sector at every possible opportunity.  Regarding loans for businesses, I am sure the Minister of State will outline the number of areas where businesses can get help from the State sector other than going to the banks.<\/p><p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I also welcome the Bill before us.

Sadly, our side of the House has already indicated that we will be opposing the dissolution of the county enterprise boards and the subsuming of their role into the local authorities.  We believe that this is part of a pattern of Government decisions which have more to do with creating an illusion of reform than delivering real results, the detail of which I will go into later.  There is a strong case for retaining and streamlining the existing structure with greater co-operation across county enterprise boards to share best practice ideas while retaining the ability to respond to specific local needs.<\/p><p>The enterprise boards were established &quot;to fill the gap in the support services for local enterprises&quot; and &quot;to develop indigenous potential and stimulate economic activity at local level primarily through the provision of financial and technical support for the development of small enterprises&quot;.  Significantly each board is made up of voluntary members representing the local authority, local or national agencies and local community interests.  The boards employ a small number of staff who deliver board supports in the locality.  As the Americans would say: &quot;If it ain't broke, don't fix it.&quot;  We already have a representative group of people who embody both those who are elected representatives as well as those from the voluntary and civic society who deliver a service already.  To put it in context, the county enterprise boards have supported the establishment of more than 13,500 businesses; assisted approximately 20,000 businesses to increase their sales, employment and exports; helped in funding business which created just under 35,000 jobs; led the promotion of an enterprise culture in schools and colleges, with more than 10,000 students per annum participating in county enterprise board programmes; provided training for more than 72,000 entrepreneurs and employees; and provided value for money job creation at an average cost of &euro;5,500 per job.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013100300021#V00300","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1380802800,"counter":150,"content":"<p>Additional text to follow<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1380803400,"counter":151,"content":"<p>In that context I cannot see the reason for the rush to dissolve the CEBs and subsume them into the local authority structure.  It seems to smack of reform for the sake of reform.  It is comparable to the proposals for the Seanad and for D&aacute;il reform.  That is what they will remain.  It is a great pity that the wool is being pulled over the eyes of the people in that regard.  This is another example of it.<\/p><p>The CEBs have proven themselves to be one of the most effective supports provided to small local business.  Already many CEBs share IT and payroll functions with the local authority.  The savings to be made from this change are likely to be negligible.  The local authority providing matching funds to the funds allocated by central government to the new enterprise office is a matter of major concern.  To date, the enterprise boards were funded entirely from government, with part from the Exchequer, and in part from the regional development fund through the regional assemblies, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, which all came under the national development plan.  It is a major cause of concern as to how they will be funded.  The new proposals will require county councils to provide matching funding.  All councils are already hard pressed given the demands on services and dwindling resources.  We know the local authority's budgets have been reduced significantly in the past number of years and now they must take on a new role and subsume an effective organisation, without funding coming from Europe because of the changed nature of our economic situation.  Where will the money come from?<\/p><p>Recent independent evaluation undertaken by Fitzpatrick Associates, on behalf of Forf&aacute;s, Ireland's national policy and advisory board for enterprise, trade, science, technology and innovation, highlighted the central role the county and city enterprise boards have played in the development of local economies through enterprise.  The case for the retention of these bodies is very strong.  I am not suggesting that local authorities should not have an expanded role.  We have been crying about local authorities having an expanded role.  Is this a case of reform for the sake of reform?  There seems to be no logical reason that the existing structure will be subsumed into the local authority.  The added question mark hanging over the future funding of county and city enterprise boards certainly raises very serious issues and for that reason our party could not support this Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013100300022#W00100","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1380803400,"counter":152,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  My colleague Senator John Kelly has spoken on behalf of my party and I will add some comments.<\/p><p>The county and city enterprise boards have done an excellent job during the past 21 years.  They were set up in 1992 and I was a member of the first South Tipperary county enterprise board.  It was one of the most worthwhile committees that I served on during my time in local government.  The CEBs provide hope to communities by providing a kick-start when people set up a business and help them by providing mentoring.  Society is facing change.  This area is no different.  I am a former councillor and with many others in this Chamber I have called for reform of local government and for more power to be devolved to local authority members.  I am glad to say this is an example of that happening.<\/p><p>I believe that all work relating to job creation should emanate from the local authority and should be administered under the local authority system.  There needs to be accountability in terms of finance and decision making.  Each county enterprise board has an individual mission statement specific to its geographic area.  Nobody is better placed to put that mission statement and business plan in place than those who are elected by the people who understand their own areas.  When this change is implemented, we will see greater levels of job creation emanating from the new structure.  It is critical that the power and decision making with regard to job creation across the country has an input at local level.  Nobody knows better than the elected members of a local authority the opportunities for job creation on the ground in their area.<\/p><p>We have complained about centralisation of decision making, that local authority elected members were not having a say.  I served with very good people from the various pillars of business, community, agriculture and so on in my time on South Tipperary Enterprise Board.  At the end of the day, we were answerable to the organisation we represented.  The elected members of the local authorities are answerable to the people.  That is the key difference.  I look forward to the new process whereby greater involvement and input can occur through the services that will be provided.  Recovery of the economy has started but there is a long way to go.  I am very proud of the fact that 33,000 jobs were created in the past year, that unemployment figures are reducing but I am not blinded by the fact that in excess of 400,000 people are unemployed.  It is incumbent on us to ensure that the structures that have served us well for more than 20 years can be improved and will be improved by this legislation.<\/p><p>The Minister will be well aware that the county councils in Tipperary north and south riding will be amalgamating.  Does the Minister know what impact that will have on staffing numbers and the role of the new structure in County Tipperary?

I acknowledge that nobody understands the difficulties that small business are experiencing right now than he does.  I compliment him on his work since taking office.<\/p><p>I record my appreciation of the great work done by the county and city enterprise boards during the past 20 years.  I acknowledge that many of the very successful businesses in County Galway today got a start from the assistance of the county and city enterprise board.  I had the pleasure of serving on the board for a period.  I appreciate and wish to record my thanks to the very many successful business people who gave of their time and talents together with the elected representatives to ensure that worthy projects were awarded funding for a successful start.<\/p><p>I am surprised that our colleagues on the other side of the Chamber have so little faith in the local authority structure and are opposing the Bill on this occasion.  This new development will give the system a shake-up and provide a one-stop advice centre for start-up businesses.<\/p> <p>The Bill is designed to create a centre of excellence in Enterprise Ireland and develop new thinking and best practices for supports provided for small and micro businesses.  Local enterprise offices will provide a one-stop-shop service for small and micro businesses and be very responsive to the needs of start-up businesses.<\/p><p>Yesterday the Minister mentioned that the measures are designed to help new start-ups survive the first five years and to increase the number of start-ups by women.  We all encourage those goals.  We all know many successful women entrepreneurs in our counties.  We have quite a number of very successful women entrepreneurs in the House but there are far too few in the country.<\/p><p>We must improve the record of job creation and innovation in the small business sector.  We all know that job creation is the greatest challenge facing the Government.  We came to office with record numbers of unemployed and the number has escalated at an alarming rate.  To date, unemployment has increased by more than 34,000 per annum.  Job creation is not fast enough because, as previous speakers have said, there are still more than 400,000 people unemployed.  The Government's job creation policies are heading in the right direction but we must do everything possible to increase the level of activity.  Every Department has been challenged to play a job creation role.  The Taoiseach clearly set out that aim two years ago when Action Plan for Jobs was launched.  I look forward to having a further debate and discussion with the Minister, Deputy Bruton, in the House when we review the plan's progress.  I am sure every Senator will want to have an input into how we can escalate the pace of job creation.<\/p><p>Yesterday, some Members expressed concern, during their contributions, about the culture of enterprise in county councils.  I think the new style of management in local authorities is more enterprise and cost-oriented.  I have every confidence in the new system of replacing county enterprise boards.  I am sure it will be effective and have the desired effect.<\/p><p>We all know that the creation of employment in small numbers and in small enterprises will help breathe life back into the rural areas.  However, the IDA's commitment to smaller towns is not what we would like to see.  Major job creation projects go to the larger cities of Dublin, Cork and Galway.  My town of Ballinasloe lost 1,000 industrial jobs over the past decade.  Smaller towns are finding it very difficult to attract the sort of job replacement numbers that are required.  All small businesses in small towns and villages are under severe pressure.  The centre of Ballinasloe is under pressure due to out of town developments.  We need to review planning and address the existing imbalance.  The lifeblood is being sucked out of the town centres which have paid parking.  In contrast, large multinationals have their profits repatriated outside of the country and provide customers with free parking and facilities.  As a result, the multinationals enjoy a greater footfall.  Local authorities need to examine ways to address the imbalance.  The multinationals should pay for their out of town facilities.<\/p><p>Yesterday, Senator Quinn mentioned that job creation projects could be funded by releasing funds from pension schemes and welcomed the fact that 30% of an AVC can now be released.  I would like the scheme further expanded because it will stimulate the economy by encouraging people to spend their money and put badly needed cash in circulation.<\/p><p>I encourage the Minister to ensure the new structure is effective and closely monitored.  Expertise will be transferred from the county development boards but I want it supplemented by additional resources and funding from local authorities.  We need to create jobs at a much faster pace to overcome our economic difficulties.  I worked in industry for many years and would like to see a greater concentration of investment in manufacturing, particularly small enterprises.  We must encourage young people with skills to get involved in manufacturing.  We must create many more apprenticeships in the trades which will be of great benefit in the future.  Those skills are in scarce supply and skilled personnel are necessary to boost the manufacturing industry.<\/p><p>I wish the Minister of State well and thank him for being here today.  I hope the new structures will be effective.  I look forward to his return in 12 months time to debate progress made under the new structures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013100300022#W00300","speaker":"1118","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1380804000,"counter":155,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State and support the legislation.  It is important we do not lose sight of the fact that county enterprise boards were established to help get small businesses up and running.  Let us not lose sight of that goal.  Smaller companies employ a large number of people.  The boards arose due to an over-reliance on the IDA which focused greatly on the larger companies.  The county enterprise boards did a great amount of work to level the playing field.  They ensured that people who wanted to establish or grow their business could access the relevant information.<\/p><p>There is a need to co-ordinate the support groups provided by the local authority or educational institutions for small enterprise.  I was involved in a project where it was discovered that departments in a local authority were not co-ordinating.  That was unfortunate and the project was delayed for quite a long period.  I hope the amalgamation of services in the local authority will eliminate any difficulties experienced by small enterprise.  It was a planning issue that delayed the project that I referred to, but problems could range from a minor planning issue to compliance with health and safety regulations, etc.  I hope services can be streamlined and obstacles removed.  Obviously, there must be full compliance with regulations and legislation.<\/p><p>During the period 1994 to 1997, when Deputy Richard Bruton was the Minister, we created 1,000 jobs per week.  We are moving towards that level again, and I hope that 1,000 jobs marker is not far away.  At present, an additional 3,000 people have been returning to work every month over recent months, and I hope the figure continues to grow.<\/p><p>There is a need to focus on areas located outside of Dublin because we have already seen problems.<\/p> <p>I know that, when trying to create jobs, one cannot pick and choose where companies locate.  However, we are already seeing the knock-on benefits in the Dublin area where there is an increased demand for accommodation for people and commercial premises.  It is therefore important that we work closely with and encourage new businesses to establish outside Dublin, whether that is in cities such as Cork, Galway, Limerick or Waterford or in smaller towns.  <\/p><p>It is difficult when a company is about to invest large sums of money in creating jobs - one has to walk on eggshells and must not be seen to be setting down too many restrictions relating to establishment on them.  We need to keep that in mind, especially where we have third level institutions that can give a lot of back-up support to companies.  In particular, the institutes of technology do a superb job in preparing people for work.  It is also important the institutes of technology, the third level institutions and our schools look at where the jobs will be.  A mistake that was made over the past ten to 15 years was the lack of focus on the changing job market.  As I said in the House earlier this week, I had the privilege of speaking to a person who has a good qualification.  Even though it was not a third level qualification, he was offered jobs in three different countries at the same time.  He had a difficult choice to make and it was interesting talking to him about that.  It would be great if we had many more people who had such choice, and that is something that we need to work towards.<\/p><p>I welcome the legislation.  It is about co-ordination of services, making sure that all the obstacles are removed and encouraging people to take a risk.  People take a financial risk when they set up a business; there is also a risk about the hours that must be put in.  No one who sets up a business works 25, 30 or 35 hours a week.  I assure Members that as someone who has been self-employed for the past 30 years, I found - others Members will have found this in their own businesses and the Minister will find it in carrying out his role - I put in on average 60 to 80 hours a week, which is needed in order for businesses to survive.  The private sector has given that level of commitment over the years.  It is therefore important that, when we get that commitment from people who are prepared to put their hands in their pockets and take the risk, then we, too, should take the risk by ensuring they get all the possible support available and the playing pitch is levelled for them, so that they can move forward and create jobs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013100300023#X00200","speaker":"1150","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1380804600,"counter":157,"content":"<p>Like many Members, I came to the House from a local authority background. I speak as a former member of the Wexford County Enterprise Board.  I compliment everyone who was involved in that board, from the chairman to the staff, as well as those who participated voluntarily, either as board members or in a mentoring capacity.  Their efforts should not be forgotten at a time when we are looking to change the structures of county enterprise boards.  However, they are boards of their time - how they were established was part of the legacy that was - so we should not be afraid to make changes and put in place a different structure that is suitable for the second decade of this century.<\/p><p>I am glad that some of the functions of the boards are to fall under the auspices of local authorities.  Given local authorities are losing certain services, with water going to Irish Water and more and more motor taxation matters are being centralised with online applications, it gives them the opportunity to focus on generating jobs and work within their county boundaries.  Local authorities probably were not doing enough of that, so it is good that the work will become part of their core remit and some of the best people in the local authority will be in charge of the new structure.<\/p><p>I am critical of IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland because they are committed exclusively to larger towns and cities and not small, rural towns.  That is a mistake.  For example, in my own town of Gorey, IDA Ireland owned a portion of land there, but it sold it - it could not move the land fast enough, which shows its levels of commitment.  I would not have minded had it sold it when prices peaked, but they sold it almost at the trough, which was a mistake.<\/p><p>A local employment office would bring a knowledge that Enterprise Ireland or IDA Ireland do not have.  I do not think that county enterprise boards had sufficient clout to bring their knowledge to the powers that be in the attempt to focus on getting jobs and business into each community.  An example is Glanbia's site at Inch, which is close to where I live north of Gorey town.  Glanbia closed down its operation.  The Yoplait franchise was repurchased from Glanbia by Yoplait.  The entire facility was closed down, much to my dissatisfaction and displeasure.  It was very much a commercial decision made by Glanbia.  However, there is now a valuable site available for someone else who wants to come in.  Through the work that I and others, including Enterprise Ireland and Glanbia are doing, we are hopeful that the site can be traded in the short to medium term and facilitate the reintroduction of employment in the area, which is important.<\/p><p>I want the legislation - perhaps we can discuss this in more detail on Committee Stage - to give local authorities and employment offices the flexibility to facilitate business to flourish.  Most businesses struggle in their early stages.  It should be possible to do a deal at local employment level rather than having to deal with national legislation on, in particular, rates, and for a small company that might have ambitious plans to be given the opportunity for a waiver to be facilitated in the county structure, rather than having to go to other agencies or departments to look for consent on that.<\/p><p>I also want to discuss the commuter zone.  I have no wish to talk down any other area, but 1.25 million people live in County Dublin, which is more than 25% of the nation's population.  We must realise that there is a large commuter zone that crosses county boundaries.  It practically starts at Dundalk in the north and goes perhaps as far as Portlaoise all the way to my town in Gorey in an arc from north to west to south.  We need a strategy for the commuter zone.  There are businesses that would take the opportunity to establish in the commuter zone where the motorway structure - the M50, along with the M1 north, the M4 west, M11 south and other motorways - facilitates the transfer of workers in the opposite direction rather than everything being based in Dublin.  A commuter establishment - indeed, every company that could establish in areas outside greater Dublin, whether in Gorey or the other towns I mentioned - has the opportunity to have a lower cost base.  I am not trying to make a political point, but the previous Government did not give the matter any consideration and I do not know that this Government is giving it enough consideration either.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013100300024#Y00200","speaker":"1160"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1380804600,"counter":158,"content":"<p>Additional text to follow shortly<\/p>"}]
