The circumstances surrounding its publication are unfortunate.  Much of its content is answers that other members and I would have expected when they questioned the Minister in recent months.  Irish Water has been handed what Mr. Tierney deems to be &euro;11 billion worth of assets in the form of the networks throughout the country.  It has been afforded hundreds of millions of euro of taxpayers&rsquo; money towards its formation and setting up.  I am puzzled as to why others and I speaking on behalf of the taxpayer get no answers when we ask how that money has been spent.  I get no answers from the Minister, the Department, Bord G&aacute;is or Irish Water.  Will Mr. Tierney, as CEO of this huge organisation which will deliver one of the most important services to the people on any given day, with the amount of expertise at his disposal, tell me what happens when a question such as mine is put to the Minister?  Does he block information or is he directed to block it?  Why did we have to wait until a question similar to one I had asked was asked by a radio journalist last week?

Under the Water Services Investment Programme 2010-13, there was a call from local authorities that approximately &euro;6.2 billion needed to be spent on these assets.

If so, Mr. Tierney should riddle me this one.  At present, slightly more than 4,000 staff are employed in local authorities in respect of the provision of water services.  A macro-structure is to be imposed on top of that and is in the process of being created.  I understand the midwife is busy at work at present and approximately 500 staff are involved in this regard.  Mr. Tierney should explain to me in the first instance how, with that structure on top of the existing local authority staff - all of whom will stay in place - he expects to make those savings?  How does he expect to be able to reduce the cost of providing water services by 2021 down to &euro;6.4 billion?  Does he expect it will be possible to do this?

I presume the document would have covered the capacity of Bord G&aacute;is.  There is a feeling that we are at variance in terms of the information that was provided.  For example, Bord G&aacute;is delegates were before the committee some time ago and when we got into some detail we were told:<blockquote><br \/> The billing system we use in Bord G&aacute;is Energy is already being adapted for Irish Water and the design for the Irish Water billing system is in progress.  The billing system will be ready by 1 January 2014 and we have already seconded resources from our energy retail business into Irish Water, transferring those who are proficient in the establishment of billing and customer service.  Therefore, this expertise will not be lost with the privatisation. We have had to backfill some positions to replace those people, which means more employment within Bord G&aacute;is for people from other customer service and billing organisations.  This is already happening.  We put forward the view that we would leverage and clearly we have already started that process. I can therefore assure the committee that we will have the billing system up and running ...<\/blockquote>  The only thing I could conclude from what was put on the record by the delegation is that this was all being done in-house.  That must be considered in addition to the documents of early 2012, which I cannot put my hands on but which more or less gave the impression that there was surplus capacity within Bord G&aacute;is.  I want to be satisfied that there was not spare capacity in Bord G&aacute;is.  I do not feel satisfied that I have got that information.  I accept that there sometimes needs to be expertise.

Our energy supply side already had Oracle customer care and billing, CCB, installed and implemented three years ago.  As a result, we had expertise within the energy supply business on the process design and project management sides.  They knew how to specify processes for billing for a utility and translate this into code in an Oracle CCB system.  What we did not have were the people to write the code, as well as those who could implement and integrate the systems.  The latter group is important as a modern utility needs systems to talk to each other, as much of the automation and many of the efficiencies are based on the degree to which one&rsquo;s systems interact with one another.  We took 15 staff from our energy supply side and put them into this programme in the early days.  They helped us to draw up the tender documents which allowed us to procure the experts who would take the brain-dump from these 15 people, translate it into code in the systems and get them to talk to each other.  That expertise is not what one would carry as part of one&rsquo;s standing staff complement.  One would not keep it enduringly in an organisation because one will only set up a system like this once every 15 or 20 years.  Those whom we hired to do this were typically doing similar projects in the United States.  They will probably go to similar implementation projects in the UK or elsewhere after this.  They are global nomads.

Mr. O'Donoghue has already spoken about this issue and can elaborate further, if members wish.

Lot 7 is not mentioned here.  Is there a reason for that?  It could be that it is just a small amount, but perhaps the witness would clarify that.<\/p><p>  Finally, have any of the service providers refused to give permission to release information on fees and costs, as opposed to not giving Irish Water an answer?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014011400027#AA00700","speaker":"1167"},{"type":"speech","time":1389717900,"counter":259,"content":"<p>That is five questions but I will also take questions from Senator Naughton and Senator Landy in this group.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014011400027#AA00800","speaker":"996"},{"type":"speech","time":1389717900,"counter":260,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses.

If the systems were based on those of Bord G&aacute;is, was it not possible to ask Bord G&aacute;is's system provider to provide the services to the scale required by Irish Water, rather than hiring consultants or third party providers and re-inventing the wheel?<\/p><p>  In the same vein, value for money is the big concern of Members of the Oireachtas and the public with regard to the figures quoted in the media.

I am cognisant of the fact that Mr. Tierney was appointed on 29 January 2013 so my first question applies to representatives from Bord G&aacute;is.  I understand that Bord G&aacute;is won the tender to take over Irish Water over Bord na M&oacute;na.  In that process, Bord G&aacute;is put forward the argument that it had 55 experts in its employ who could provide expertise in setting up Irish Water.  As reported in the document before us, those staff were not made available to Irish Water when it was set up so it required consultants.<\/p><p>  I refer to pages 5 and 6 of the document.  Can Mr. Tierney answer clearly whether this fact was made known to the Department before it made a decision on the awarding of the contract for the takeover of Irish Water by Bord G&aacute;is?  The Government and NewERA contracted this project to Bord G&aacute;is and it appears they were sold a pup.  They were given to understand staff were available but then the staff were told they would be needed to continue to run Bord G&aacute;is.  It reminds me of the story of the man in the nightclub late at night trying to attract a lady and telling her he will bring her home in his Porsche.  Then, she discovers there is no Porsche and that she has to pay for the taxi to bring them home.  That is how it looks to me.  Bord G&aacute;is got this contract on the basis of in-house expertise and now we are paying &euro;86 million of the &euro;150 million start-up costs, some 57% of the budget, because the expertise is not now available to Irish Water.<\/p><p>  I am aware of the challenges facing Irish Water.  We have 1,000 water schemes across the country at risk of bacterial and viral contamination.  Water in Roscommon is subject to boil notices on a continual basis and some 41% of water is lost through leaks.  There are flood warnings across the Shannon and water shortages in Dublin and Leinster.  People are prepared to pay for services but not for poor water or no water.  Approximately &euro;1 million was spent on engineering companies known to me, such as Nicholas O'Dwyer and JR Barry.  How much work has gone into dealing with the issue of the shortage of water in Dublin and in Leinster, as referred to by Deputy Coonan, and the problem along the Shannon?  Over Christmas we saw people on television who were afraid that their front gardens would be washed away by flooding.  How much work has gone in during the preparatory phases to set up the reservoir at Garryhinch, County Laois, to deal with the problem of the flooding in the Shannon and the lack of water in Dublin and Leinster?<\/p><p>  With regard to the &euro;11 billion worth of assets Irish Water owns, as per the document, it states that there is no satisfactory record of the assets and a limited record of their condition.  We have established a figure of &euro;11 billion of assets available to Irish Water to start working on.  Can Mr. Tierney clarify how the figure was arrived at?  Does the figure stand up?  It is important that we know what we are starting off with.  The figure is used in comparison to the &euro;86 million in consultancy fees.  It may pale into insignificance in respect of &euro;11 billion of assets.  Clearly there is no identification of how the &euro;11 billion figure was arrived at.

Setting up Irish Water is tantamount to that.

I hope Mr. Tierney and his colleagues would admit that public confidence in Irish Water is crucial to its legitimacy, particularly when we are attempting to seek resources from the public to operate a public utility.  It is very welcome that a public utility, owned by the Irish people and answerable to the Oireachtas, is now in operation, but Irish Water has not got off to a good start in the minds of members of the public because of the farrago over the last few days.<\/p><p>  As a TD, a member of this committee and of the Committee of Public Accounts, and as a citizen, I find it offensive that the type of information we are discussing here this afternoon had to be extracted from Mr. Tierney in an interview with RTE's Sean O'Rourke last week.  I find that appalling.  In that regard, it is quite clear to this committee and to the wider general public that the <i>modus operandi<\/i> of Irish Water needs to change if it is to gain public confidence and acquire the legitimacy that it needs.  I am confident that can happen but it can only happen if Irish Water learns lessons.  My fundamental question to Mr. Tierney is what lessons has he learned over the last week and what lessons has Irish Water learned over the last week in terms of generating public confidence and in terms of its obligation to the Irish people as a public utility wholly owned by the Irish people?<\/p><p>  I have a few more questions.  There has been much debate in recent days about the fact that, as we speak, Irish Water is exempt from the scope of the Freedom of Information Act.  We are all of the view that this needs to change.  That Act was essentially reviewed in recent months and legislation in this respect is currently going through the Oireachtas.  Can Mr. Tierney confirm whether Irish Water had any function whatsoever in terms of communicating with the Department?  I would like to hear his view on whether the organisation should be exempt or otherwise from the scope of the freedom of information legislation.  <\/p><p>  I ask Mr. Tierney to put on record his salary.  As I understand from public commentary, it is &euro;50,000 below the pay ceiling for those in commercial State-companies.  Can Mr. Tierney put on record also whether he, any of his colleagues or any full-time staff member, wholetime equivalent, in Uisce &Eacute;ireann has received any bonus payments last year or whether any bonus payments would be expected as part of their contract for next year or any subsequent years?  <\/p><p>   We are dealing with fixed price contracts awarded to service providers which is a positive development.  Related to that, I ask the witnesses whether those contracts provide for any sanctions or penalties where there are cost overruns or where elements of contracts fail to be delivered on time or within budget?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014011400034#HH00300","speaker":"1067"},{"type":"speech","time":1389721200,"counter":325,"content":"<p>A series of questions has been asked and Mr. Tierney might answer them in the order of the speakers, starting with Deputies Coffey, followed by Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and Deputy Nash.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014011400034#HH00400","speaker":"1099"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1389721200,"counter":326,"content":"<p>On Deputy Coffey's question in terms of equating with other utilities, in section 5 we go through that in the report in a serious level of detail, acknowledging the fact that we had to keep the report to a certain length.

We have verified in the report that the systems are already up and running.

We have inherited a relatively <i>ad hoc<\/i> system of asset management through no fault of the people involved but that is the way the structure of the industry was.  We have now centralised that in one central system.  Asset management systems are data hungry.  They require an awful lot of data.  As that data are gathered and fed in, that allows the asset managers to make informed decisions about where to direct the capital investment and where to direct their maintenance programmes.  As Mr. John Tierney said, we launched the asset management system in mid-2013 to facilitate the metering programme and on 1 January we went live with the upgraded version of that, which was always part of the scope.  We now have a functioning asset management system.  I can give the Deputy a tangible example of that.  When the operatives are installing meters the work orders to the individual houses where the meters are to be located are despatched remotely.  They have a mobile device in their van and are notified the jobs through their mobile device; they dig the hole, put in the meter and record what they find such as for example, lead pipes or leaks, and upload that data and that goes back into our central system.  Equally, the completion of those jobs are recorded and they go through to our customer service centre.  If a customer wants to know when a hole will be filled or whatever, the people in the contact centre have instant information on it.  That is a tangible example of what these systems will involve.<\/p><p>  Deputy Coffey queried the issue of reinvestment.  Obviously we have made a very significant investment in the past 12 months and there will be continuous upgrades as the technology improves as we move forward but for us to invest we will require regulatory approval.  We would have to go to the regulator if we want to invest more in these systems in years to come and seek approval for him to sanction that spend, be it upgrades or complete reinvestments in new systems.  The Deputy can be assured that any money that is spent post this investment will be subject to absolute regulatory approval.  From my experience in the gas business, there were many instances when we refused approval for the spending of money.  We would have to make a strong business case for the spending of such money and there would always be a business case to support such investment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014011400034#HH00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Barry"},{"type":"speech","time":1389721200,"counter":328,"content":"<p>On the asset management system, there may have been a reasonable expectation by the public or others that the existing Bord G&aacute;is asset management system might have been utilised, tweaked or whatever for Irish Water but it is clear from what Mr. Barry is saying that is not possible as they are two entirely different systems, entirely different networks, and a whole stand-alone system was required for Irish Water.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014011400034#HH00700","speaker":"1092"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1389721200,"counter":329,"content":"<p>We used the existing system to launch the metering programme which went forward initially and that was driven by the timescale of the metering programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014011400034#HH00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Barry","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1389721800,"counter":331,"content":"<p>Deputy Coffey's question was where the funding for the programme came from.

In a new social and political chapter in the history of the State, if we are going to charge people for domestic water, it is important we are assured that we have an effective operational system and a system of capital investment, that people are getting value for money and that we are not, in Irish Water, creating a monster that we will all have to account for in years to come.  That is from where public concern comes.  The idea of getting information is that we can ensure there is fairness and value for money.<\/p><p>  The case for domestic charging is that it is common throughout the rest of Europe.  To date, businesses have carried a disproportionate burden in respect of water and sewerage charges.  The system we have does not tend to push the individual towards water conservation and it is more a matter for the individual's conscience and disposition.  The witnesses have presented a serious company and a serious job of work that must be done to set up a company to service 1.4 million customers.  The end result, or the aspiration, is an effective, somewhat commercial, efficient way of delivering the water and sewerage services to people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014011400035#JJ02400","speaker":"1070","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1389722400,"counter":355,"content":"<p>I thank the delegation for coming before the committee.  In December 2011 the Minister, in addressing a water summit in Dublin, revealed that PricewaterhouseCoopers had carried out the first phase of its independent assessment of the concept of the Irish Water project as part of the programme for Government.  I see no costs outlined in the document before us for its consultancy fees and no reference to who took care of them.  Was a full analysis, including of costs, carried out by the Cabinet at the time?  At the summit the Minister categorically stated he would be using the expertise of local authorities.  There is a great deal of such expertise in local authorities up and down the country, as I know as I was a member of local authorities for a number of years and involved in the setting up of group water schemes.  There were personnel with experience in the authorities that would be the equivalent of that of consultants.<\/p><p>  The public is angry as it believes the &euro;50 million spent on consultancy fees is excessive, considering that 34 local authorities around the country last year collected approximately &euro;200 million in non-domestic charges.  One quarter of what was collected last year has been spent on consultancy fees, which is excessive.  We are overlooking the fact that the Department and, by extension, the Government and the State is spending in the region of &euro;300 million to upgrade the water system and should not be giving the impression to the public that the infrastructure is also being dealt with, as it is not; the &euro;50 million was solely spent on consultancy fees.<\/p><p>  Will there be further spending by Irish Water on consultancy fees?  In the document presented to us it is indicated that the Irish Water programme will run to April 2015 in order to finalise systems and deliver a further geographic information system and a mobile workforce management system.  How much will this cost and is the cost included in the &euro;50 million figure?  The document also indicates that the Irish Water business model is to operate largely within Bord G&aacute;is and the local authorities, with a very small element of support from third party providers.  Who are the third party providers?  Do they include the national confederation of group schemes or local authorities?  How much will they cost and who is engaging them?  I would like these questions to be answered.<\/p><p>  The document indicates that the entire programme and associated budget, as well as the approach to resourcing and staffing, were rigorously examined and approved both by the internal Bord G&aacute;is governance approval process and relevant Departments.  What Departments were involved other than the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014011400036#KK00200","speaker":"1062"},{"type":"speech","time":1389722400,"counter":356,"content":"<p>It is quite obvious, having listened to Mr. Tierney, that there was a big hoo-ha because people did not know this money was being spent, but the Government knew it was being spent.  It is very handy to dish all of the dirt on Irish Water as that is how things work in this country.  The HSE was set up in order that we could dish the dirt on somebody else when it came to health matters.  That is how the country works.<\/p><p>  It is quite obvious what Irish Water is trying to do.  It is building a massive cash register to collect money in order to repay debts that were not ours in the first place.  It is sickening, as the idea that we do not pay for water is becoming the truth because of repetition.  As we are talking about setting up a system, I will pay for water a third time.  I currently pay for it through taxation and I also pay for it in going to the supermarket.  As there is another system being set up, I will have to pay for it a third time.  The only system that has worked so far is going to the shop.  If it does not work in that scenario, in which there is great quality assurance, I will get an apology and my money back.<\/p><p>  How much has been saved by going with Bord G&aacute;is?  The original idea was to make savings because the company had much of the required talent, but it now seems that it has none of it.  What exactly was saved?  When somebody has done a job, it is nice to know how many hours of work were done for the money and the wages involved.  Were the consultants getting &euro;1,000 or &euro;1,500 a day, for example?  They were probably getting plenty to decide what would be charged for water.  Ordinary people will not receive such payments.<\/p><p>  Mr. Tierney indicated that he had joined Bord G&aacute;is because its approach would be very professional.  Although we have strayed into the area of water quality, apparently the only reason we are here is to ask if we have received good value for money.  I read today the Local Government Audit Service report on spending in Dublin City Council in the year ending 2011.  It states:<blockquote>It is evident that the financial management, as part of project management by the environment and engineering department for this project, has been weak.  There needed to be evidence of much more comprehensive oversight in monitoring and controlling expenditure.  No proper classification of expenditure on an invoice basis was available to account for moneys spent on this project in the initial audit stage (April 2012).<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014011400036#KK00300","speaker":"1084","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1389723000,"counter":359,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Tierney and his team.  He has explained many of the issues of concern held by the public.  We wish to ensure value for money is being obtained.  While I disagree with some of the previous speakers I am cognisant of the fact that we need Irish Water.  We have needed such a body for a considerable time given the amount of taxpayers&rsquo; money that is wasted in treating water and the fact that 40% of it leaks back into the ground.  Irish Water will also be responsible for wastewater.  Other speakers have referred to the significant problem we have with contamination.  It is an enormous challenge and must be addressed as quickly as possible.  Has Mr. Tierney made any calculations of the fines that will be imposed on this country for having poor quality water or water contaminated by effluent or other undesirable matter?<\/p><p>  My other question relates to the fact that Irish Water will, in effect, be a monopoly in its management of water and wastewater.  Has Mr. Tierney put systems in place to ensure the consumer gets value for money and what are they?

Internally in Irish Water and within the Bord Gais group we have appropriate controls for how we spend money.  That was one of the reasons Bord Gais was selected to set up the utility.  An important aspect of the establishment of any utility is that one control costs.  Apart from control internally within Irish Water and the group, there is also scrutiny by the Department and through other fora such as this one, as well as by the Commission for Energy Regulation.

All of these will become published standards and harmonised in the sense that the same standards will apply nationally to all customers of Irish Water.  We will deliver this over time and do so in the context of being a regulated utility.  The CER will consult on all of these standards and set them out publicly.  They will then be published on websites, in brochures and leaflets in order that the public will be aware of them.  I do not doubt that, as with other utilities, the CER will then move to impose penalties and provide compensation where we fail to meet the required standards.

I have just checked our documentation and while I am broadly happy with the numbers, with the permission of the Chairman, I will revert on that detail because the figure looks to be a little low.  I will gladly come back with the accurate number.  We have an estimate which appears to be low.  Rather than give that figure now, I will revert back, if that is acceptable.<\/p><p>  The second question concerned the savings made as a result of the contract being awarded to Bord Gais.  As I said, in the context of contingency funds and the additional money that it might have cost, we made an original estimate of approximately &euro;29 million against a 20% and a 35% contingency figure, given the unknowns.  Savings were made in the area of software licences in the order of &euro;58 million.  The most important point is that the value one puts on what the Bord Gais utility brought to the establishment of Irish Water is very hard to quantify for a number of reasons.  First, we have come from a standing start and in 18 months delivered the utility on time and within budget.  I think, without fear of being challenged, this has never been done before anywhere.  At the heart of this was the core expertise Bord Gais had brought, but putting a value on it is very difficult.  If I had to put a value on it, it could easily be tens, if not hundreds, of millions, if one went to the market and tried to bid for what has been achieved.  Second, the utility expertise we brought in in terms of picking the systems and dictating the contracts for the service providers to do what they did was fundamental to what we had been doing as a utility for many years.  It is difficult to quantify it and it is not covered in the numbers I have outlined.  The savings, therefore, are far greater than I have outlined.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014011400039#NN01600","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Barry"},{"type":"speech","time":1389724200,"counter":427,"content":"<p>Can the delegates answer the question on potential fines by the European Union?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014011400039#NN01700","speaker":"1099"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1389724200,"counter":428,"content":"<p>There is interaction between Ireland and the EU with regard to the European Court of Justice case.

In his presentation he said the approach taken by Irish Water was in line with a modern, new utility, but the information I have suggests that is not necessarily the case.  We are talking about value for money and I would like Mr. Tierney to defend some of the utility's actions.  Irish Water is using drive-by meters, for example.  Why, when the rest of the world is migrating away from such meters to smart meters, is Irish Water installing an older, out-of-date system at huge cost?  Mr. Tierney has said that in July 2013 a letter from the Department gave Irish Water consent on a figure of &euro;250 million for the metering project.  Is that the total cost?  How can he defend the decision to install an older, out-of-date system when countries such as Malta which was praised by IBM is using a smart metering system?  Why was this decision made?  What consultant recommended this course of action?  Was it recommended by a consultant?<\/p><p>  We have been back and forth on the issue of the expertise Bord Gais had over and above that of Bord na M&oacute;na, which is why it won the contract.  Mr. O'Donoghue said Bord Gais could not possibly have all of the required expertise in-house, which I accept.  That has been verified elsewhere and Mr. O'Donoghue has said Irish Water needed so-called \"global nomads\" with expertise.  Did Irish Water consider secondments, as was done in Northern Ireland?  I heard the CEO of Northern Ireland Water who retired recently speak about that issue recently.  He made the point that hiring permanent staff would have been too costly and that hiring consultants would have been very costly, too.  In that context, considering secondments was the wisest choice.  Why was it not considered, or was it?  That approach is used in Government Departments all of the time.  <\/p><p>  I ask the delegates to clarify an issue reported in some newspapers today that four contracts were awarded without going through the public procurement process, even though they had met an EU regulation guideline.  Is that true?  What will the overall spend on consultants be by April 2015?  <\/p><p>  My final question relates to those consumers who are members of group water schemes and those who have their own wells.  Will they have any relationship with Irish Water?  Will they have to pay any charges to it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014011400039#NN02000","speaker":"1131"},{"type":"speech","time":1389724200,"counter":431,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Tierney and his team and hope their presence is indicative of a generally open approach to what is the most important and vital service we require in the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014011400039#NN02100","speaker":"1011","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1389724800,"counter":433,"content":"<p>That is not really germane to the service provision but perhaps at the meeting of 11 February Irish Water might reply on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014011400040#OO00200","speaker":"996"},{"type":"speech","time":1389724800,"counter":434,"content":"<p>That is fair enough.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014011400040#OO00300","speaker":"1011"},{"type":"speech","time":1389724800,"counter":435,"content":"<p>The context for this hearing is the sense of outrage people who have been hit with property taxes and are soon to be hit with water charges feel when they hear money they would expect to go to fix leaking water pipes, provide reservoirs and improve water quality, may be going to line the pockets of highly-paid consultants and executives in Irish Water.  Furthermore, our Government was trying to cover up that fact over the last year.  Having listened to the Irish Water representatives, my fears are not allayed on any of those questions.<\/p><p>  Who knew what, when and where?  Did Mr. Tierney know parliamentary questions had been asked when they were asked, along the lines of what has been asked today and on which we finally got answers today?  Is he surprised that last week, Government representatives, including the line Minister, Deputy O'Dowd, and the T&aacute;naiste, expressed surprise about the amount that was spent on consultants, while he is telling us they knew?  Ordinary members of the public, and I as a public representative, are confused at how Mr. Tierney can tell us they knew while last week they said they were surprised.  We need clarity.  Mr. Tierney has given us the answer, that they knew but were not telling us.  Therefore, their expressions of surprise last week were fake.  They were fooling the public last week when they said they were surprised.  They were not surprised because they knew.  That appears to be what Mr. Tierney is telling us.<\/p><p>  Is all the money that is being pumped into Irish Water in the form of home taxes, and soon to be water charges, going to line the pockets of consultants and highly-paid executives?

How much water has been conserved as a result of that expenditure?  It all relates to billing and charges.  If we did not have water charges, and consequently did not have the requirement to install meters to monitor how much water people are using, how much of this expenditure would have been necessary?  Is the vast majority of this expenditure about billing and charging rather than about building reservoirs, fixing water pipes, ensuring water quality, and the issues people are concerned about?  Can the Irish Water representatives convince us that there will be real, meaningful savings?<\/p><p>  Mr. Tierney has told us he gets &euro;200,000 per year.  In the semi-State sector there is a pay cap.  He was paid less when he was city manager for Dublin City Council.  His pay has gone up.  How many extra executives who are not subject to the normal public sector pay caps have been employed as a result of the establishment of Irish Water?  If those executive positions on salaries higher than if they were working on local authorities is indicative of so-called savings, it does not add up.  We are paying more to do things previously done by local authorities.<\/p><p>  I do not mean to personalise it, but that is what ordinary people are thinking.  They are going to pay charges and the guy at the head of the company who will impose those charges on them is getting paid more than when he was in the local authorities.  That is how ordinary people feel.  They do not understand how Mr. Tierney is being paid more while they are being charged and ordinary workers in the public sector have had their wages slashed.  Are we creating and paying for a big, expensive bureaucracy to charge people which is doing nothing for the water infrastructure of this country?<\/p><p>  If I understand Mr. Tierney, last year Irish Water spent &euro;50 million on consultants from a total spend of &euro;100 million.  By the end of the programme it will be &euro;180 million and &euro;80 million on consultants.  More will be spent on consultants and set-up charges, and that does not even include the metering.  This is all about office systems, IT software, billing, charging and bureaucracy.  What the hell are these people doing for us?  The issue is the taking over of &euro;11 billion worth of assets that were not functioning well.  It does not seem to me that establishing offices and software systems, and all the rest on which Irish Water has spent enormous amounts of money, addresses any of the key issues that face that water infrastructure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014011400040#OO00600","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1389724800,"counter":438,"content":"<p>Uisce &Eacute;ireann will be back here on 11 February and we will use that occasion to flesh out the other aspects apart from the obvious this afternoon.

They said they keep themselves aware of what happens in Parliament.  I submit that what has happened in the Parliament was an absolute shambles.  It started with the Water Services Bill.  The document refers to an explanatory and financial memorandum.  There is no financial memorandum in it.  Does the company stand over that?  Did the witnesses brief the Minister before he came to the Seanad in the week before Christmas?  Given that they follow the parliamentary debates they will be aware that he turned down amendments in respect of local authorities and he turned down any role for the National Consumer Agency and the Competition Authority to see that the organisation was working as a competitive body.  He also turned down any role for the Department of Finance in relation to investment appraisals.  We are finding out now that &euro;100 million is already gone and we do not know what it was for and we are trying to catch up after the event.  He turned down any role for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform which is supposed to deliver reform.<\/p><p>  I live in Kildare.  The Minister said we have low water charges.  The organisation should not say it is inventing water.  I have water.  We have paid &euro;1 billion per year for it in taxation.  Some &euro;539 million has been spent on meters and &euro;100 million on consultants to charge me for what I was paying for through my income tax.  I do not know what are the set up costs.  It is simply an amalgamation of 34 local authorities.  I hope there are some efficiencies but I have to say the way company and the Department have treated the Parliament is unacceptable.  That is why people are so annoyed.  The company has made an appalling start and it had better try to get onside pretty quickly if there is to be any public confidence in the organisation.  <\/p><p>  Why was the electricity regulator chosen to regulate water?  They are two completely different fields.  The electricity regulator has an electricity price which is 42% above the European average.  That is a wonderful start.  Are we going to pay 42% more for water as well, under the same regulator?  The whole issue has been an absolute shambles from beginning to end.  How many of the consultants were associated with the collapse of banking in Ireland?  As elected represented, we are trying to get away from that situation.  I am disturbed to see that the same people who walked out of Government Buildings with &euro;64 billion in their pockets are now advising Irish Water.  That is an appalling situation.  Why could it not have slowly amalgamated the 34 local authorities who were doing the job and why is it not open to having its investment plans put before the committee, the Department of Finance, and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform?  Why is it so anti-consumer?  What is wrong with the National Consumer Agency?  The organisation would not even accept advice on the billing system.  It seems to me that the National Consumer Agency would be well advised.  If the organisation is running a closed shop as it has done up to now, it will be very difficult to persuade people that this investment is in any way worthwhile.  It has been a disastrous start for Irish Water because of that.  It should have been open with us, given that it follows the parliamentary debates.  <\/p><p>  Some 164 amendments were tabled in the Seanad in respect of the legislation, 56 of which were Government amendments, having realised the flaws in the legislation.  If the organisation is in consultation with the Department there are many improvements needed to bring it up to an acceptable level so far as Parliament is concerned.  It must be accountable.  The secrecy we have witnessed heretofore is unacceptable to the public.  We are trying to reform this country and what happened to it in 2008.

There is, however, a transitional period during which local authorities start using our procurement systems.  Mr. Cowhig or Mr. Tierney referred to the use of our procurement systems by eight local authorities.  Eight local authorities are currently using our procurement systems.  This means they raise the purchase requisition on our system, which means we pay the cost and it is not incurred by the local authority.  The payment comes out of Irish Water's bank account, if one likes.  The other local authorities will move over to our procurement systems on a phased basis.  Until such time as they do so, they will incur the operational-related expenditure for providing water services.  They currently pay suppliers for goods and services off their existing systems.

It is important to acknowledge the significant improvements in productivity and the increasing range of services delivered during this period against a backdrop of significantly reduced budgets and workforce numbers.  The health system has also had to support increasing demand for its services during this time, with the population of the State increasing by 8% and the proportion of persons aged 65 years and over increasing by one fifth. <\/p><p>  Managing the impact of these significant financial, resource and demographic pressures on the health system in the years ahead, while delivering safe, quality health and social care services to the public, will only be possible by way of a reformed health system that provides access according to need rather than ability to pay, for best health outcomes from the available resources and treats patients at the lowest level of complexity that is safe, timely, effective and efficient and as close to home as possible.  A 20% budget reduction and a 10% reduction in staff numbers form the backdrop to the service plan.<\/p><p>  I will continue to deliver the Government's programme of health reform &ndash; the most comprehensive programme of reform since the foundation of the State &ndash; throughout the year.  I am pleased that the HSE has placed the advancement and implementation of these reforms at the centre of its planning for 2014.<\/p><p>  The following key elements of the health reform programme are built into the fabric of the 2014 service plan: phased implementation of a money follows the patient funding system in hospitals, with payments to be made to participating public hospitals on the basis of the level of inpatient and day case activity that they complete - in other words, if no patients have been treated, no funding will be available to the hospital; the transition to hospital groups, including the appointment of new group chief executive officers, CEOs, where required, the development of a memorandum of understanding between the HSE and each group and the development of a programme for implementation of hospital groups; the establishment of new community areas, with associated governance and organisational arrangements, following the completion of the review of integrated service areas - I refer to Mr. Pat Healy who has done great work with his team in this regard; implementation of new internal management structures, with specific programmes relating to shared services, procurement, human resources and information; establishment of an interim patient safety agency, initially on an administrative basis, within the HSE structure; development of commissioning functions, with the aim of achieving the greatest progress on a commissioner-provider split, prior to the introduction of statutory functions; and formation of a cross-divisional working group for health and well-being aimed at identifying the most effective model for the delivery of health improvement gains for the population in the context of a health care commissioning environment.<\/p><p>  My overriding priority in delivering these key health reforms across the health sector this year is patient safety.  I very much welcome the fact that patient safety and improving the quality of services to the people of Ireland are at the core of the service plan and that all health staff, individually and collectively, have a responsibility under the plan for the safety and quality of services they deliver to patients and service users in their care and must integrate this commitment to safety and quality into their core work practices.  The service plan provides for the development and use of a comprehensive set of quality and safety indicators to measure the quality and safety of services, with a particular focus this year on the priority areas of medication safety, health care associated infections, HCAI, and the national early warning score, NEWS.  It also looks to implement the recommendations made in the reports of the HSE and the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, on the maternal death at Galway University Hospital by targeting necessary patient centred improvements in maternity care.  These health reform and patient safety priorities set out in the service plan are critical in order to maintain sustainable levels of service delivery to the population into the future and build on the progress made in recent years.<\/p><p>  The 2013 edition of <i>Health at a Glance<\/i> published by the OECD shows that Ireland continues to make substantive headway in improving health outcomes.  Mortality due to cancer fell by 21%, ischemic heart disease by 59% and cerebrovascular disease by 54% between 1990 and 2012 and in all three instances the rates of improvement in Ireland were above the OECD average.  Since 200 life expectancy in Ireland has increased by four years to reach 80.6 today, again above the OECD average.  I thank the men and women who deliver our health and social care services for maintaining and, in many cases, improving the ever expanding range of services provided for the general public, despite reducing resources in recent years.  Their efforts have been highly commendable in these most challenging of times.  The reform process is well under way and gathering momentum. <\/p><p>  Chronic diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular and chronic respiratory disease and diabetes are the leading causes of mortality and account for more than three quarters of all deaths in Ireland.  The risk factors associated with the increased prevalence of chronic diseases such as obesity, lack of exercise, unhealthy eating patterns, over-consumption of alcohol and use of tobacco products are generally preventable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014011400003#B00300","speaker":"952","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1389720600,"counter":609,"content":"<p>Thank you.

I would like to add my own seasonal good wishes to everyone present.  The national service plan was formally submitted to the Minister for Health on 25 November 2013, in line with the provisions of the Health Act 2004, and is the first annual plan presented by the directorate of the health service following the enactment of the Health Service Executive (Governance) Act 2013.  The service plan is also the first since the publication of the report of the Mid-Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust public inquiry, known as the Francis report, in February 2013, the findings of which highlighted in the starkest of ways the need for a renewed collective commitment to providing the highest quality care in the safest of health care environments.  The Keogh report which followed again identified poor standards of patient care in a further 14 hospital trusts and set out the help and support required to assist health care providers in accelerating improvements in the quality of care provided while also tackling the causes of poor care.  Similar findings and recommendations were echoed in the investigations by the HSE and Health Information and Quality Authority into the safety, quality and standards of services provided to patients after the death of Ms Savita Halappanavar at Galway University Hospital.<\/p><p>  The service plan for 2014 sets out the type and volume of services, as required under legislation, which will be delivered within the funding provided by the Government.  At the heart of the service plan is the commitment to the delivery of safe, high-quality health and personal social care to patients and clients and the reform of our services.  The gross current voted Estimate for the health service in 2014, including children and families, is &euro;13.12 billion.  The reduction in the health service budget between 2008 and 2013 amounted to &euro;3.3 billion, and when coupled with reductions in 2014 the total budget reduction over six years amounts to almost &euro;4 billion.  In its initial assessment of health service requirements for 2014, the HSE approved a formal submission to the Department of Health reflecting the need to sustain safe services at the current levels, while at the same time responding to known pressures, demographic requirements, critical service priorities, programme for Government commitments and service developments and quality initiatives.<\/p><p>  There is an underlying projected deficit of &euro;419 million, including full-year costs for 2013 developments, coupled with a reduction to our funding base and additional savings targets of &euro;619 million.  This means the health service is facing a significant financial challenge in 2014.  This challenge comes at a time when the demand for health services is increasing every year, which in turn is driving up costs.  Managing ill health resulting from an ageing population and an increase in chronic conditions is a major driver of health care costs.  Future projected increases in chronic disease are largely attributable to behavioural factors that the Minister has already listed in his opening remarks.<\/p><p>  In 2013 the Government published Healthy Ireland, a cross-government framework for improved health and well-being.  A 2014 service plan priority will be development of a three-year health service implementation plan for Healthy Ireland, and this will be led by the new health and well-being division, whose director is Dr. Stephanie O'Keeffe, who is with us today.  During the course of this service plan, it will not be possible to meet fully all of the growing demands being placed on the health services.  In particular, some service priorities and demographic pressures may not be met.  However, the budget management approach outlined below has allowed the health service to invest in a number of significant and critical service priority areas in 2014, while at the same time ensuring that the health service maintains patient safety and improves the quality of services, protects core services, and drives the delivery of the reform programme.<\/p><p>  Quality and safety will continue to be a system-wide priority for the health services in 2014, and this is threaded throughout the national service plan.  The key message is that patient safety is paramount.  All health service staff, individually and collectively, have a responsibility for the quality of the services they deliver to the patients and service users in their care and must ensure that maintaining quality and safety is core to their work and practice.  A number of key quality and patient safety initiatives will continue in 2014, including improving patient experience, preventing health-care-associated infections, further implementing national early warning score systems, and improving medication management.<\/p><p>  Our approach to the reduction in the gross Estimate of &euro;272 million, or 2%, includes the following.  Additional savings of &euro;619 million will be made, of which &euro;108 million pay savings remain unspecified and will be held centrally pending a separate verification process.  A further &euro;80 million in savings relating to the Haddington Road agreement will also be held centrally in the first instance pending an assessment of the most appropriate allocation of the savings across each service location.  This exercise is currently under way.  There is also a projected incoming deficit of &euro;419 million, which includes the full-year costs for 2013 service developments.<\/p><p>  In developing the service plan for 2014, a multifaceted approach to budget management was adopted in order to protect core services.  It is important to stress that the principal focus is to continue to deliver the same level of front-line services with a reduced budget, particularly in areas such as provision of home help hours, home care packages and disability services, while at the same time ensuring that quality and safety is not compromised in any way.<\/p><p>  The specific elements of this multifaceted approach to budget management include a reduction in the lump sum provision for pensions, which will be used to offset, in part, the incoming deficits from 2013; making use of savings which will accrue from the phased implementation of new developments during 2014; and additional savings targets of &euro;129 million in areas such as procurement at &euro;30 million, shared services at &euro;10 million, value for money initiatives at &euro;10 million, hospital reconfiguration at &euro;7.5 million, energy efficiency savings at &euro;15 million, and the full delivery of cost containment plans for hospitals, initiated in 2013, at &euro;56.5 million.  Specific actions in respect of the additional &euro;619 million savings target include pay and flexibility reductions totalling &euro;268 million, of which the Haddington Road agreement will facilitate up to &euro;140 million.  As mentioned previously, &euro;108 million of this relates to unspecified savings and will be held centrally pending a separate process.<\/p><p>  By adopting this approach, it will be possible to provide funding of &euro;304 million for a range of initiatives, of which &euro;178 million will be invested in a number of new critical service developments, initiatives to meet some demographic pressures and programme for Government<i><\/i>commitments.  A further &euro;126 million will be provided on a once-off basis to address the full-year cost of developments started in 2013, which will continue in 2014.  Full details of these new investments are set out in appendix 1 of the service plan and are included in the printed version of my statement.  I will not repeat the list that the Minister has already covered.  However, I would like to stress that the health service will provide home help and home care packages to approximately 56,000 recipients, maintaining the 2013 approved service levels.  The nursing home support scheme will continue to support more than 22,000 people in long-term residential care at a cost of &euro;939 million.  In shifting the emphasis of the model of care to home and community supports, we will maintain services to allow an additional 1,000 older people to continue to live in their own homes.  <\/p><p>  Health reform is also a critical priority for the health services in 2014, and a systems reform group has been established to oversee the governance and enable the management of change across the broad portfolio of reform projects being undertaken.  These reform projects include continued implementation of the national clinical programmes; phased implementation of the money-follows-the-patient approach to the funding of acute hospital services; transition to hospital trusts and community care organisations; the development of commissioning functions; the development of a three-year implementation plan for Healthy Ireland; the establishment on an administrative basis of the new patient safety agency; the establishment of the new Child and Family Agency on 1 January - I would like to take this opportunity to wish our colleagues well in that new agency - and the further roll-out and reform of shared services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014011400005#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1389721200,"counter":612,"content":"<p>I beg the indulgence of the committee to congratulate our Vice Chairman, Deputy Ciara Conway, on her wedding.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014011400006#E00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1389721200,"counter":613,"content":"<p>I welcome the delegation, the Minister and the director general of the HSE.

It does not unearth anything earth-shattering in the context of the framework laid out for 2014 but shows it will be very challenging, as outlined by the director general.  It also shows a big hole in the Estimate in underpinning the service plan in funding.  We are talking about an underlying budget deficit of &euro;419 million, coupled with savings to be identified of &euro;619 million.  In previous statements, the director general has referred to &euro;1 billion as the overall adjustment required to live within the budget figures announced.  That was subsequently deleted but it does not get away from the fact that we are facing a budget reduction of &euro;1 billion.  I would like some clarity on why the &euro;1 billion figure mentioned in previous times has now been dropped, even though the only additional funding I can find is the &euro;47 million identified in the Revised Estimate.  The director general said previously that it will not be possible in 2014 to deliver the plan and now he says it will be very challenging.  I find it hard to believe that the sum of &euro;47 million moves it from being almost impossible to very challenging in the overall context of a &euro;13 billion budget.<\/p><p>  We were led to believe there was uproar at Cabinet when the first draft service plan was presented by the Minister for Health to the Cabinet.  The reason we were told or were led to believe was that Ministers had concerns about the wording of the foreword signed off by Mr. O'Brien, which stated <blockquote>It will not be possible in 2014 to fully meet all of the growing demands placed on the health services.  In particular, the level of investment required to meet many of the critical service priorities or respond to many of the demographic pressures identified.<\/blockquote>That was subsequently amended to read:<blockquote>It will be very challenging in 2014 to fully meet all of the growing demands being placed on the health services.  In particular, some service priorities and demographic pressures may not be met.<\/blockquote>Twice in Mr. O'Brien's presentation, he has gone for the original wording and I find it strange that it was taken out of the original wording even though Mr. O'Brien has twice mentioned the exact wording that was deleted after political discussion at the Cabinet table.  I find it strange and I wonder why it is the case.<\/p><p>  It is identified that there will be &euro;108 million of unspecified savings and that there will be an independent verifiable process to assess how the savings will be achieved.  How long will it take to identify where the savings will be realised and whether they can be achieved?  If they cannot be achieved, other areas must suffer to ensure we come in under the budget targeted in the HSE service plan.  When will the savings be identified and, if they cannot be identified, will it require a Supplementary Estimate?  Will funding that has been clearly identified in HSE service plan be withdrawn, as has happened in previous times in respect of disability and mental health?  These areas were targeted in previous times when the books would not balance.  It is important to get clarity on this point very quickly.<\/p><p>  Fianna F&aacute;il welcomes the change in respect of the probity probe into medical cards.  It never ceases to amaze me that it could have been included in the original Estimate proposals because it did not make sense.  I do not believe there are so many medical cards in circulation that should not have been in circulation.  If that is the case, it is an indication of sloppy awarding of medical cards.  We welcome the rollback.  The Minister also referred to medical cards and how people are entitled to them.  No one disputes that everyone entitled to a medical card under the income guidelines set out in the 1970 Health Act will receive a medical card.  These people are legally entitled to them but the key area concerns discretionary medical cards.  By any adjudication, the number of medical cards and GP discretionary cards has decreased from 96,000 to 57,000 over the past three years.  There is a targeting of discretionary medical cards, even though we are consistently told it is not the case.  Most Deputies and every organisation I encounter say it is almost impossible for some people, who had previously been awarded discretionary medical cards, to get medical cards.  We must revisit this.<\/p><p>  The Minister talks about reform continuing apace.  I must question that in view of the fact that we are now facing into the fourth year of this Government.  The White Paper on universal health insurance has not been published and it is a key underpinning part of any potential further reform.  The Minister talked about setting up hospital trusts and how money follows the patient.  This is an important area and at this stage we should see what is a central plank of Government policy in terms of the reform of the health services and how they are funded.<\/p><p>  Consultant-led clinical care teams are a central plank in the delivery of health care.  Where there are consultant-led clinical care teams they work very effectively.  We must acknowledge that.  Anecdotally, I have heard of a number of incidents where it is more difficult to recruit consultants.  Is that the case?  Is it difficult to attract consultants to this country and difficult to retain consultants?  If so, why is this the case?  We all know we must increase the number of consultants in the health services to ensure we have delivery of care.<\/p><p>  Mental health is grossly underfunded.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014011400006#E00300","speaker":"983","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1389721800,"counter":615,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to address this plan at last, as we had hoped to be in a position to address it prior to the Christmas recess.  I welcome Mr. O'Brien's usage of the phraseology that was first submitted for consideration in a memorandum to the Cabinet indicating that &quot;it will not be possible to fully meet all of the growing demands being placed on the health services&quot;.  He has stated that twice in this evening's contribution, and it is the accurate and truthful position.  It is very unsatisfactory and unacceptable that the formulation was changed to a phrase such as &quot;very challenging in 2014 to fully meet all of the growing demands.&quot;  This change happened not because of an assessment by Mr. O'Brien but because of political choice, and the more sanitised version was released by the Minister and published in the 2014 service plan.  I expect the Minister to stand up for the health services and state very clearly to his Cabinet colleagues that &euro;690 million in cuts in 2014 is unsustainable.  I also expected of Mr. O'Brien that in the assessment he provided initially, he should have stood up to the Minister and insisted that the phraseology he employed in his informed position as director general should have stood.  I welcome his utilisation of that formula here this afternoon.<\/p><p>  There was a comment regarding the radio interview of 22 December, with Mr. O'Brien indicating that he was given no source for the proposed figure of &euro;113 million in probity cuts to medical cards, since changed to &euro;23 million in the service plan as presented.  The figure of &euro;113 million did not come from either the health department or the HSE.  That raises real and serious questions as to the methodology of determining budgeting for the health services and planning on a year-to-year basis.  I have repeatedly asked in the D&aacute;il and here where the figure of &euro;130 million in so-called medical card savings came from, so will somebody give the full, detailed and truthful answer?  I note from the Minister's contribution that this is &quot;pencilled in&quot;, but that is not acceptable.  We want to know from where that figure came, and nobody need take any solace from the fact that we are now considering a figure of &euro;23 million rather than &euro;113 million.  Many people who have depended on discretionary medical cards in particular have not retained their cards, and many others who would have hoped to receive their cards will not do so during the course of this year.<\/p><p>  In the context of &euro;4 billion having been taken from the health budget since 2008, with a further planned reduction in staffing, financial and human resources are being depleted.  Mr. O'Brien indicated in his closing remarks the impact of the loss of approximately 12,500 people within the Health Service Executive.  He did not indicate the projected cuts in 2014 and rather depended on the figure that might remain, but we will see a further 2,600 whole-time equivalents going in 2014.  That is what the service plan projects.  How can the health service, with all the financial cutbacks signalled, be able to carry out the level of service it currently gives, with patient safety in such high demand?  There has been affirmation from both voices heard this afternoon, saying that such safety is the principal and guiding goal at all times.  How can this be achieved if the Government continues to remove such a significant number of people from within the service?  It is not sustainable.<\/p><p>  I welcome the introduction of GP cards for children aged five and under but, unfortunately, we must consider the issue in the context of overall primary care cuts.  By my calculation, they could amount to something of the order of &euro;294 million.  When can we expect the roll-out of the GP entitlement to all children aged six and under in the course of 2014?  I note the Government is to take an additional &euro;43 million out of the pockets of medical card holders in increased prescription charges, but when that figure is compared to the anticipated savings of some &euro;50 million due to generic substitution and reference pricing, it puts into context just how pitiful the savings are with regard to generic substitution and reference pricing.  The real potential is not being realised at all.<\/p><p>  On that note, how do the Minister and the director general account for the failure of the HSE to move more quickly in setting reference pricing for medicines under the long-overdue legislation we passed last year?  I have only to reference the recent <i>Sunday Business Post<\/i> article which details the figures, indicating that a range of drugs placed on the interchangeable lists by the Irish Medicines Board have not yet had reference prices set by the HSE.  We are failing to realise what could be saved.  Will an answer be given to the question?  Do the witnesses accept that the entire process has been far too slow at a time when we need additional resourcing and funding?  We are not moving quickly enough to realise the real savings that can be brought about.  The money is to be taken from the pockets of medical card holders almost to an equivalence of what can be saved in this area, and that speaks volumes in my mind.<\/p><p>  I am also very concerned that the service plan states that no additional funding is being provided for new nursing home places in 2014.  That is a very worrying aspect, as there are already large waiting lists for places under the so-called Fair Deal scheme.  This plan spells misery for thousands of people, and it is not that any saving is being made.  There are approximately 600 people who may be holding beds inappropriately across our acute hospital network because they are unable to return home or access beds in the nursing home network.<\/p><p>  Within the very short time available to us it is impossible to cover all of the critical areas.  I wish to ask about the bilateral cochlear implants programme signalled for 2014, which I very much welcome.  Nevertheless, the sum falls far short of what might have been required to set in place a full bilateral cochlear implant programme, not only for those waiting but also for those who may now present.  Will there be a commitment to fully funding and rolling out that programme in 2015, and will the delegation confirm when the programme will be up and running in 2014?  What level of provision of implants will there be and what number of young people is hoped to be catered to in the course of the year?  Lastly, what is meant by &euro;108 in &quot;unspecified pay savings&quot;?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014011400007#F00200","speaker":"969"},{"type":"speech","time":1389721800,"counter":616,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and his Department staff, as well as Mr. O'Brien and the HSE staff.

Deputy Kelleher raised the issue of a change in the wording of the service plan following the Cabinet meeting.  First, I ask whether he takes as fact everything he reads in the newspapers.  Much of it is not fact.  What is factual is that the wording did change and the rationale behind the change was the fact that the Cabinet committee was able to agree a revised Estimate volume and additional money which allowed for a change in the wording.<\/p><p>  Another question Deputy Kelleher asked was how long it would take to identify where the &euro;108 million comes from.  I will invite Mr. O&rsquo;Brien to say a bit more about it but it is something that will require time to study.  It is within the Haddington Road agreement and must come from pay within that, but the mechanisms must be further evaluated.<\/p><p>  Deputy Kelleher stated that the figure of 57,000 discretionary medical cards was a reduction compared to the previous number, but as we all know and as has been stated to the committee time and again, and elsewhere, there has been a huge increase in the number of full medical cards allocated.  We are at the highest number ever and we have allocated a further &euro;35 million this year for new medical cards.<\/p><p>  The Deputy inquired about the White Paper on universal health insurance.  I have it in draft form to a very high standard.  It requires some minor adjustments in terms of further discussion and it will be published in the coming weeks.<\/p><p>  Reference was also made to consultant-led clinical care.  It was the policy of Deputy Kelleher&rsquo;s Government - one that I would not necessarily dispute - that there be more consultant-delivered care rather than consultant-led care.  The recruitment of consultants is no more difficult than it ever was.  There are always certain areas and specialties where it is difficult to attract consultants.<\/p><p>  Deputy Kelleher said mental health had been grossly underfunded.  The Government committed &euro;35 million last year and the previous year, and &euro;20 million has been committed this year with a commitment to deliver a further &euro;15 million next year in additional funding to mental health.  I will not take any lectures from Deputy Kelleher on how we fund mental health.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014011400008#G00300","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1389722400,"counter":620,"content":"<p>I am just stating a fact.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014011400008#G00400","speaker":"983"},{"type":"speech","time":1389722400,"counter":621,"content":"<p>With Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s record-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014011400008#G00500","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1389722400,"counter":622,"content":"<p>Could we have one speaker at a time, please?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014011400008#G00600","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1389722400,"counter":623,"content":"<p>We did not interrupt Deputy Kelleher, so perhaps he would be good enough to leave us to make our contribution uninterrupted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014011400008#G00700","speaker":"952","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1389723000,"counter":625,"content":"<p>I shall start by addressing the issue of the language used in the introduction to the service plan because much is being made of the issue.  It is important, therefore, that I put the matter into context.  <\/p><p>  Until the Cabinet meeting in the relevant week in December, the level of deficit risk associated with the numbers in the service plan was unacceptably high.  It derived from the &euro;113 million figure for probity measures, which I made clear was not deliverable, and the figure of &euro;108 million, in respect of which we do not yet know the method by which it will be deliverable.  There is, therefore, a figure of well over &euro;200 million in respect of risk.  If it had been necessary to publish the service plan with that level of risk, it would have brought with it almost an inevitability and certainly a strong danger of a precipitative mid-year financial crisis this year.  If there were to be such a crisis, the health service would be forced to take immediate corrective action, much as it has done in years past.  Recent history demonstrates that this would leave the health service with very little room for manoeuvre and would likely create the conditions in which the only measures that could be taken would be those that would have a direct adverse impact on the level, quality and quantum of care provided for the most vulnerable in society.  In that context, the version of the introduction prior to the relevant Cabinet decisions stated it would not be possible to meet \"critical service priorities\".  It did not refer to the possibility of meeting all of the demographic pressures.  The words that have changed are not, therefore, the words the Deputy believes were changed.  I deleted a reference to it not being possible to meet critical service priorities because I no longer believesd there was that level of risk in the light of the changes made.  Instead, the language members see in the service plan is consistent with what I have said previously and today at the committee.  This section of the service plan carries my signature and consequently reflects my opinion on the overall position of the service plan.  The words used previously in the plan were mine in the context of the risk there would have been without the key decisions made.  The words used in the current plan are mine in the context of the actual service plan.  I know there has been much reportage in one newspaper, but I share the Minister's view.  As we will see when we discuss the issue of reference pricing, there are distinct dangers in taking newspaper reports at face value. <\/p><p>  I ask Ms McGuinness to comment on the issue of cochlear implants, after which I will address the other issues raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014011400009#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1389723000,"counter":626,"content":"<p>On cochlear implants, a sum of &euro;3.22 million has been provided in revenue funding and an additional &euro;1 million has been provided in capital because there is a capital cost associated with the programme.

The second is sequential which will be provided for children who have one cochlear implant and would benefit from a second.  In that vein, we met the consultants involved in the delivery of the programme.  The figure provided is the maximum they will be able to spend this year.  The programme will commence in May, with 50 children set to benefit from simultaneous cochlear implants.  Under this element of the programme, 100 cochlear implants will be provided.

I used that language very precisely and it referenced my understanding at that time of the likely underlying deficit - not the actual deficit in 2013 but the consequential deficit if all costs continued to run into 2014  - and the then figure of &euro;666 million, which was the abridged Estimates volume figure.  I have never said there were cuts of &euro;1 billion.  In order to avoid any misunderstanding, I left in the two figures, &euro;619 million, as it was then, and &euro;419 million, but I deleted the calculation  of &euro;1 billion because it was becoming apparent to me that it was consistently being reported as \"cuts\" of &euro;1 billion when it is not a cut but a swing.  I have described in the budget strategy how we deal with some of that.  There are not cuts of &euro;1 billion.  There is a swing of &euro;1 billion.  I used that language precisely but it has obviously not been universally understood.  Therefore, I stopped referencing that &euro;1 billion, but I left the two figures in.  I stand over those two figures and my broad assessment of the requirement for a swing at the last quarterly meeting is borne out by the residual &euro;619 million and &euro;419 million.  I hope that clarifies that matter.<\/p><p>  With regard to the question about some of the things that will not be done in this service plan that otherwise might have been done, I will give the committee some examples.  We would have liked to develop a national perinatal pathology service this year, at a cost of &euro;420,000, but we are not in a position to do that.  We would also have liked to go to phase two of our intermediate care service as part of the NAS, at an estimated cost of &euro;4.4 million, but will not be doing that this year.  The HSE would have liked to do more in the area of health and well-being initiatives, at an estimated cost of &euro;1.5 million, but will not do so.  We would also have liked to roll out an extension of BreastCheck, at a cost of another &euro;0.5 million, in this current year but that is not proceeding.  We also wanted to put considerable resources into revamping the dental treatment services scheme but we cannot do so this year.  There is a list of things such as those I have just mentioned which, while being important developments, are not ones that can be afforded within the envelope that is available to us this year.  Therefore, they stand as priorities that we will seek to address in the 2015 service plan.<\/p><p>  It is important to stress, as many have done, that the cumulative effect has a significant impact on the health service and those who work in it.  I thank the Chairman and Deputy Healy for their comments about the staff in our health services.  I know others share their views in that regard.  It is a key concern that during the course of this year we need to have a very robust process for identifying the needs of the health service if it is to meet the needs of our population.<\/p><p>  On the issue of reference pricing, I will ask my colleague Mr. Hennessy to take the committee through what is involved, because the report referred to is very far from accurate, despite the fact that some of this information was provided to the relevant publication but did not find its way into the report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014011400010#J00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1389723600,"counter":629,"content":"<p>Reducing the cost of drugs and medicines is a major priority for us in this year's service plan for the obvious reason that it allows us to reduce our costs while not impacting directly on front-line service delivery to patients.  Quite a bit of work is already under way on this, led by Professor Michael Barry and Shaun Flanagan, our chief pharmacist.  The recent newspaper coverage of this issue suggests that we have not been using the legislation to reduce costs and that we have not been moving quickly enough on this issue.  The reality is that we have been moving as quickly as the Irish Medicines Board designates products as being interchangeable.<\/p><p>  To further clarify the situation, the legislation that was passed in the Oireachtas last year requires the HSE to consider each product and medicine according to a number of criteria, of which six are listed.  The HSE is further required to provide two blocks of 28 days, sequentially, for consultation and notification.  The Irish Medicines Board designates groups as interchangeable on a sequential pattern.  The first of those was atorvastatin, which was listed in September 2013, and we are now seeing the benefits of that in terms of reduced price.  Others have followed in subsequent months.  For example, four products of the ten listed were issued in mid-December 2013.  We act on each of those as soon as they become available.  We follow the consultation and notification due process procedures laid out in the legislation and the price reductions then follow sequentially.  Indeed, a number are now primed to fall due in the very near future.  Cost reductions obviously follow from that and the end result is very much on target in that we are going to realise &euro;50 million of savings for the taxpayer in 2014 through reference pricing.  Additional savings will be available to members of the public as prices fall in pharmacies.<\/p><p>  It is important to note that a balance must be struck in this process so that supply is maintained in the pharmacies.  That involves a process of continuous negotiation with the pharmaceutical industry and the suppliers.  I wish to acknowledge again the work of Professor Barry and Shaun Flanagan.  They are doing excellent work in this area and we look forward to briefing the committee during the course of 2014 on the progress being made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014011400010#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Hennessy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1389723600,"counter":630,"content":"<p>On the sum of &euro;108 million and the issue of the critical changes, in order to step away from the figure of &euro;113 million, we had a supplementary provision of &euro;47 million.  Our original internally generated figure for probity of &euro;20 million moved to &euro;23 million, which leaves &euro;63 million unfunded as a result of the elimination of the &euro;113 million element of the probity measures.  In addition, we have &euro;408 million.  These are areas in respect of which there is an agreed process and it reduces the overall risk at the get-go from a health service perspective.  On the question of the sum of &euro;108 million, there will be no measures to support the &euro;108 million which are not provided for in the Haddington Road agreement.  The core Haddington Road target for this year, in terms of pay cuts, flexibility, additional hours and all of the other measures provided for under that agreement, is &euro;140 million.  What we are going to do is to seek to maximise the extent to which the flexibility provided by staff can be leveraged to reduce operating costs within the health system.  There will be no other measures imposed on staff in the health service that are not provided for in the voluntarily agreed Haddington Road agreement.  The process that we are going through will produce an outcome which will save some, all - or, conceivably, none - of that &euro;108 million.  We are optimistic that a good proportion of it can be produced.  At the end of that process we will have a position in which, as the Minister has outlined, we can revert through a process that involves other Departments examining the implications of that.  It is very important to stress - and I have sought to do so repeatedly - that we are not seeking from staff anything to which they are not already committed under the Haddington Road agreement.  The issue is whether the Haddington Road processes can produce savings that are greater than &euro;140 million, and the process we are going through will determine that.

When will these new staff be allocated?  Since I have been a Senator I have sat here and heard recruitment will begin in the next quarter but we never seem to catch up.  The money is supposed to be ring-fenced.  Where will the new staff be allocated?  Will it be in CAMHS, adult mental health, old-age psychiatry or forensic psychiatry?  Nobody ever seems to be able to give these detailed figures, which makes it very difficult for me to see when and where these staff will be recruited in mental health.  We have 9,065 staff; A Vision for Change says we should have 12,240.  On dual diagnosis, is the HSE considering integrating some services, such as mental health and addiction services?

I welcome the news that 420,000 children will benefit from the new GP card for the under-5s.  The Minister has stated it should come into operation in May.  How much will it cost to introduce medical cards for these 420,000 children?  I welcome the &euro;35 million being provided for 60,000 medical cards.  Does that mean an extra 60,000 medical cards will be issued in 2014?  More than 90% of the over-70s are covered by either a medical card or a GP card.  To qualify for that card, a single person is allowed to earn up to &euro;500 per week, and a couple &euro;900 per week.  I met many elderly people over Christmas and they are very concerned about their medical cards.

How many hours of personal assistance home support is being provided in 2014?  What will be the differences between 2013 and 2014?  Will respite services be reduced in 2014?  The nursing home support scheme, which supports more than 22,000 people in long-term residential care, will reduce the number of people supported in long-stay care by 700, but will support an additional 1,000 people to continue to live in their own homes.  How will this be done and supported?  The HSE provides home help and home care packages for 56,000 people at any one time.  In 2012 and 2013, 10.3 million home help hours were provided.  Will this change in 2014?  Are any new posts in mental health services coming on stream?

I am concerned about the fair deal issue and step-down facilities from the point of view that the number of people over 65 is increasing all the time.  We are talking about providing back-up support for an additional 1,000 people at home.  However, there is a problem with the number of people, particularly elderly people, being discharged from hospital and readmitted within a six-week time period.  There is no engagement between the nursing homes about providing step-down facilities.  Will that be considered during 2014?  There is a big difference between having someone in hospital and back in his or her own home.  A step-down facility is an intermediate place where they can get the level of support they need while allowing time for the proper management structure to be put in place for them at home.  Could that be clarified?<\/p><p>  This morning I read a letter in a newspaper that indicated that the entire health service had closed down over the last 12 months.

Both organisations contacted me over the Christmas holidays to say thank you.<\/p><p>  I am disappointed about BreastCheck but Mr. O'Brien stated that it would be a priority for next year.

I will reference something which everybody here might examine after the meeting.  An app is available through iTunes whereby nine year old girls can be helped by other children to go on a diet to make their bodies look better.  We must take this seriously.

A substantial budget is directed at it but it is true that much additional money is spent on end-of-life care.  Most of us would like to see people being able to end their lives at home and, if not, at least in a hospice.  Mr. Ian Carter, the director of acute hospitals, has taken an interest in this and has plans to address it.  Mr. O'Brien will address this matter further.<\/p><p>  Mr. O'Brien will discuss the issues the Senator raised with regard to children in care and mental health.  Many psychiatric nurses retire at the age of 55, as they are entitled to do.  This is younger than the average nurse retirement age, so more people have left the mental health services as a proportion of the number over all elements of the service.  We have been playing catch-up.  Through A Vision For Change there has been a need for a change in the type of person working in our health service.  We have much more need for allied health care professionals such as psychologists and counsellors as well as nurses.  We are moving away from the old model to the new model.  An element of change in this regard is happening also.<\/p><p>  The Senator asked whether child and family services will carry any deficit forward into the new agency.  They certainly will bring their proportion of it because otherwise other elements, such as disability and the HSE, would have to take it.  I do not mean Senator van Turnhout, but people have a tendency to ask for something to be ring-fenced.  This means twice as much must come from what is left, so a 2% drop overall becomes a 4%, 5% or 6% drop in certain areas because other areas do not have to take any of the load.  The Child and Family Agency is hugely important and is a big part of the commitment of the Government towards children.  We want to see it fare well but we are not in a position to take the entire deficit.  A proportional amount was left with the services and much was taken back by the HSE centrally.<\/p><p>  Deputy Fitzpatrick spoke about the cost of the addition of children under six to the medical card scheme.  A total of 240,000 additional children will be covered as a consequence of this initiative, at a cost of &euro;37 million.  He also mentioned medical cards.  A total of 60,000 additional medical cards will be provided for.  The long-term future for the medical card for those aged over 70 is universal health insurance.  This is how it will be addressed, obviously not in this term of government but in the next, if we are re-elected by the people to carry through on the reforms on which we have made major progress and continue to do so.<\/p><p>  I do not believe there has been a change in the number of home help hours from 2013 to 2014.  I will ask Ms Laverne to address this question and that about respite services.  A number of committee members raised the issue of the Fair Deal scheme.  When people can see a large pot of money they tend to go for the resources.  The consequence is that many people have ended up in long-term care before they needed to be there and without full and proper assessment.  We are developing a single assessment tool which will be rolled out this year in 50% of cases and rolled out fully next year.  This has taken quite a long time to develop and we must train all of the people involved who will use it.  It is about transparency and fairness.  It has not been fair in the past.  In some parts of the country people went into long-term care long before they required it while in other parts people waited for long periods, long after they needed the care and should have had it.<\/p><p>  Several people raised the issue of obesity.  We take it very seriously and as part of our Presidency of the Council of the European Union we debated it during the ministerial meeting which I and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Fitzgerald, chaired.  We have a special action group on obesity.  It is a preventable cause of chronic illness and death and there is no doubt that if we do not address it we may very well be the first generation to bury the generation behind us.  Consequent on the obesity epidemic will come a diabetes epidemic.  When I started as a doctor one never saw a type II diabetic under the age of 30, but now we regularly see teenagers with type II diabetes, which is appalling.  We need to address this.  Dr. Stephanie O'Keeffe might say a few words on health and well-being.  This is a cross-Government initiative and does not only involve health.  It must also involve the Departments with responsibility for education, the environment, justice and finance, the latter with regard to VAT on certain products which are healthy, calorie-free or low in calories compared to others.  We are the first Government to put in place at principal officer level in the Departments of Health, Children and Youth Affairs and Education and Skills an individual responsible for co-ordinating services and preventing childhood obesity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014011400012#L00300","speaker":"952","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1389725400,"counter":660,"content":"<p>Has NAMA indicated a willingness to work with Government in that context?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014011400013#M00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1389725400,"counter":661,"content":"<p>It has, on numerous occasions, not just the buildings mentioned but also primary care centres that might be suitable.

We are the first Government to collate the figures which amounted to 386,000 outpatients.  As I said at the time, it was not the figure that astounded me but the fact that many thousands of people had to wait longer than four years to see a consultant after a GP referral.  We said that we would try to get everybody seen within a year by the end of this year.  However, we only got the figures in March.  We said that we may not reach the target but would get as close to it as we could.  I am given to understand that the figures will be very positive news.

With regard to the 477 posts in the 2013 plan, 180 posts remain in process and the vast bulk of them will be filled fairly quickly.  Between 250 and 280 have been identified in the 2013 plan because the exact mix of posts will influence the numbers that can be afforded.  We will shortly publish the operational plans by division and they will have more details on the matter.<\/p><p>  Members were correct to say that staff shortages is one of the impacts that followed the various voluntary exit programmes implemented in the early days of the financial crisis.  It was voluntary in the sense that one could put one's hand up and avail of an incentivised early exit programme or a grace period exit.  Many staff who left were from the very areas that we are prioritising for development.  That is why the figures are what they are.  We are playing catch-up, to some extent, in some of the areas.  Unfortunately, there is no getting away from that fact that many of the staff were part of the more than 12,000 staff who left. <\/p><p>  I shall ask my colleague, Ms McGuinness, to comment on the performance indicator.  The palliative care budget will be centralised and led by a single national director, Mr. Ian Carter.  He will be the national director for acute care.  The choice was made because there is a need to move some palliative-type care out of acute settings and into appropriate palliative care settings.  Giving one person control of the two budgets is considered to be a positive move.  No budget will be at the same level in 2014 as it was at the opening point in 2013 due to the effects of the Haddington Road agreement and other equitable share-outs.  There has been no specific real cut to the palliative care budget and there is no intention to go in that direction.<\/p><p>  I shall ask Ms McGuinness to respond to Deputy Fitzpatrick's questions on home care but I shall respond to the questions on outpatients.  We have accelerated the pace of access for patients.  Nonetheless, it is our intention, probably, to reduce the overall level of attendance.  The change is due to a disproportionate number of repeat attendance versus first attendance.  The matter was sought to be addressed in the cancer space as far back as Professor Keane's time here when there was a never-ending cycle of repeat attendance and thus limited clinical value.  We want to see a greater proportion of first attendance being part of the access programme.  We do not want people pursued relentlessly with follow-up appointments that are beyond the point of clinical relevance. <\/p><p>  Deputy Mitchell O'Connor asked a question on BreastCheck.  As she may know, I was appointed director of BreastCheck at a certain point in my career and, with a heavy heart, it was left out of the service plan.  It is something that we will seek to include again as soon as it is practicable to do so, not least because it is a priority in the programme for Government.<\/p><p>  I ask my colleague, Dr. O'Keeffe, to comment on obesity which is a central part of the health and well-being agenda.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014011400013#M00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1389725400,"counter":663,"content":"<p>A whole-of-government approach will give us a real opportunity to address a range of modifiable risk factors that have given rise to an increased prevalence of chronic diseases and an increase that we are set to see if we do not do something about them and provide a joined-up Government approach.

In that context, we will review community nursing services and dietetic services this year.  We will do so in order to see what kind of capability is available to address these issues, specifically for children but not just children.

We work with sports partnerships, schools and a range of externally funded agencies to try to address physical activity, diet and nutrition across key target groups.  One can see that the health and well-being division's service plan lists a range of actions that aim to tighten our performance indicators so that we are in a better position to quantify activity and outcomes from initiatives.

I am not trying to be picky.  He talked about language when responding to other people about the known unknowns of the &euro;108 million and the &euro;80 million carryover from last year.  It was &euro;200 million that was unknown to him in the last plan that caused him to have anxieties about the risks associated with the plan, which were subsequently eased, allowing him to change the language in the new plan.  I see &euro;188 million in known unknowns here, which potentially puts this year's plan at risk.  I wish to ask a specific question about the two ring-fenced areas.  These are pay-related savings targets.  It is stated that they will not involve any additional payroll reductions outside of what is already in the Haddington Road agreement, aside from the &euro;140 million targeted for Haddington Road and agreed by everybody, and no new measures will be introduced that are not already in the Haddington Road agreement.  I am not sure I understand that.  I hope it does not sound as though I am thick.  A total of &euro;140 million is coming from Haddington Road, and another &euro;188 million is to come from Haddington Road also, but we do not know from where it will come.  Who is in charge of that verification process?  What is the scope of that verification process?  Mr. O'Brien indicated earlier that a verification process might result in the money's not being found.  If that is the case, what happens to that &euro;188 million at the end of this year?  Is it the case that we just do not hit the target and we come back looking for more money?<\/p><p>  With regard to the decrease in staff to 98,000 whole-time equivalents, how many people does that mean we will actively seek to make redundant this year?  What changes will need to be made to practices in order that overall hours are reduced?<\/p><p>  We have been talking about language.  I wish to ask a question because I am really curious about something.  In the opening paragraph of his statement, Mr. O'Brien mentioned the Mid-Staffordshire report, the Keogh report and the HIQA investigations into safety and clinical care at Galway University Hospital.  That makes me nervous.  Is is trying to say something else?  Is he trying to say it will be difficult to provide a patient-led service this year given the budget constraints?  He mentioned earlier that had the HSE gone ahead with the previous service plan he felt it would have caused immediate corrective actions to be sought during this fiscal year.  Is Mr. O'Brien 100% sure that the fear he had has been alleviated, or does he still see that as being in play this year?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014011400014#N00500","speaker":"1075"},{"type":"speech","time":1389726000,"counter":669,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister, the director general, Mr. Tony O'Brien, and the team, and wish them a happy new year.  I know it will be a very challenging year for everybody working in the health service.<\/p><p>  I welcome the focus on safety but it is important to realise that there is a lot of talk about this.  I studied this formally when I studied health management and quality.  With regard to the quality metrics that are used, clearly, for those who are on the front line, what is measured is compliance, not true quality.  It is compliance with a predetermined standard.  To be fair, the predetermined standard can be set as high or as low as those who are designing the standard wish it to be.  I hate to personalise this, but in the Galway tragedy, for example, to me there is one key metric - which was mentioned, in truth, in the HIQA report - which is not irrelevant.  The part of Western Europe that has the smallest number of consultant obstetricians per head of population, no matter how much it complies with a predetermined guideline, is not going to be the safest place for obstetric care.  That part was the HSE west region.  It has the lowest number of consultant obstetricians per head of population of any part of western Europe and, to the best of my knowledge, the lowest of any part of the OECD, despite the fact that Ireland has one of the higher birth rates within the OCED.<\/p><p>  Safety is very important.  I have been at the cutting edge of all kinds of safety issues over a long career in medicine and in college, and I utterly understand the tragedies that can occur.  However, safety is not only a matter of errors of commission; it also involves errors of omission.  People who are on waiting lists - who are waiting to come into the system but who have not engaged with the system - will not appear in the safety metrics, but they are ones who, I believe, suffer the greatest level of departures from true safety in the Irish health system.<\/p><p>  On an allied issue - I am sorry if I sound pernickety about this, and I do welcome any reduction in waiting lists - it is not really obvious when looking at hospitals that the waiting lists are shrinking that fast, although I hope they are.  I would like some reassurance about the internal HSE documents we got our hands on during the year - which, interestingly, contained whole bits of boilerplate lifted from an NHS document.  They suggested that a new strategy was being used for measuring when waiting lists began in the outpatient component of the HSE services.  It was stated that referral letters would be sent to clinics on behalf of patients, at which time they would be told that they would be contacted when there was a slot for them.  At that stage patients go on the waiting list.  I will be glad to make the document available to the Minister.  One may not actually be on the waiting list for some months after one's GP has received the letter, which will have the effect of cosmetically appearing to abbreviate waiting lists which are, in fact, not shortening at all.<\/p><p>  The question of health service reform, the money-follows-the-patient model, etc., do not represent this year's budget plus reform. This year's budget is having the trouble it is having because the system needs reforming.  The system is full of perverse incentives and inefficient use of health care resources because of the way the system is funded and because of the silo-like nature of the different responsibilities.  I have to be very careful how I say this because I do not want to get anybody into any sort of difficulty, but I can tell the committee that lots of patients in the public hospital system are put through very inefficient processes to obtain a test because it is realised that the outpatient wait for the test is so long as to be meaningless for the clinical history of their illness.<\/p><p>  I wish to ask two very pointed questions.  I notice that the projections for service numbers in the acute services are 2,000 down on those for 2013.  Can I get the firm assurance of the Minister, the director general and their colleagues that these will come predominantly from administrative functions and not from front-line services?  Can we get a commitment that we will end all public relations, all management consultancy contracts, all corporate affairs offices within the HSE until such time as the acute front-line needs of patients are being met?  At that time we will be able to afford the luxury of public relations contracts, which, to be honest, do not exist to foster public relations but exist in a client-attorney relationship to advance the reputations of those who pay them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014011400014#N00600","speaker":"1147"},{"type":"speech","time":1389726000,"counter":670,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister, the director general, Mr. Tony O'Brien, and his staff for making themselves available.

A basic point with which I am sure Senator John Crown will concur is that if a doctor orders a test, he or she does so because it will alter his or her management of the patient.  One's first duty of care must be to get the result of the test to see whether it will alter the management of the patient.  I do not want to get into specifics in that regard.  There have been three reports on the tragedy and, at this time of the year, our thoughts should be with Savita&rsquo;s husband and family.<\/p><p>  Let us consider the issue of patients awaiting access to outpatient services.

We now have in place Mr. Thomas Byrne, the chief financial officer.  Within his remit, he has a complete reform board for financial reform within the HSE.  We know there are 11 systems from the old health boards.  Equally, we know there are literally hundreds of IT systems throughout the health service.  Somebody mentioned a figure of 1,700 and some of the systems are not able to talk to one another.  New ones are being developed and there are problems with their ability to deal with what needs to be put in place.  I will allow Mr. Byrne to talk about that issue in a more complete fashion.<\/p><p>  There is a sense among certain people that acute services drain all of the resources from everywhere else.  That is not absolutely true by any means.  The two areas with the greatest deficit - in nearly equal amounts &ndash; are demand-led and one concerns acute hospitals.  If somebody presents who is acutely ill, it is not like the airline industry in that we cannot refuse to take off because the aeroplane is not safe; we have to look after the person or he or she will die.  Equally, the PCRS is often in serious deficit because it is also demand-led.  If people are entitled to and need a medical card, they must have it.  There is no doubt that further efficiencies can and will be achieved, but they take time.  Much of the low-hanging fruit has gone.  I refer to the new ways of delivering care, the new models of care and the areas I have addressed before at the committee, including the questions of why we have nine nurses per health care assistant in some model four university-type hospitals and 2.8 nurses per health care assistant in others and why we have 2.5 health care assistants per nurse in some community nursing home units, while we can only manage a ratio of 1:1 in others.  There has been a difficulty in achieving best practice across the system.  We are now achieving this through the special delivery unit in the HSE and particularly through the clinical programmes which have carried out extraordinary work in many places.  An example is the care of stroke sufferers.  The survival rate from stroke has shot up as a consequence of the clinical programmes.  The same applies to the programmes dealing with congestive heart failure and frail elderly persons.  More needs to be done and, as I mentioned, the single assessment tool must be borne in mind.<\/p><p>  Deputy Sandra McLellan asked what would occur if the target of &euro;108 million was not achieved.  I will allow Mr. O'Brien to address that issue, but in my view the answer is very simple.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Health, with the HSE, are examining how the target may be achieved.  If it transpires that it is not achievable, it will become a matter for the Government to revisit.  That is the straight, simple fact of the matter.<\/p><p>  With regard to children, there is a new model of assessment and intervention in making progress on disability services for children and young people.  Some &euro;4 million has been put aside for that purpose and 80 whole-time equivalents.  The area of children's mental health services is a source of grave concern.  Historically, it tended to fall between stools.  In north Dublin, for instance, there was a considerable deficit in the services to provide for those between the ages of 16 and 18 years when the legal age of a child was raised from 16 to 18 years.  A question arose as to where those in this category belonged in terms of the provision of services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014011400015#O00700","speaker":"952","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1389727200,"counter":679,"content":"<p>With regard to the &euro;108 million and the &euro;63 million, the &euro;63 million is derived from a transfer of &euro;63 million from our original pension provision in order to offset the gap between the Supplementary Estimate and the original target for medical card probity.  The &euro;108 million relates to the unspecified payroll savings.  I will ask Mr. Barry O'Brien to come in on this and when we get to patient safety, I will ask Mr. Crowley to say a word, if that is all right.<\/p><p>  If the &euro;108 million saving is not achievable, it will not be capable to state that it is a failure of the Haddington Road agreement.  The Haddington Road agreement has a certain design specification.  It produces certain savings for us.  For those earning in excess of &euro;65,000 per annum, it produces straightforward banded pay cuts, which are easy to achieve and easy to bank.  The other main savings come from flexibility, from extra hours which enable us to displace agency and overtime, and in services where there are no agency and overtime but the totality of the extra hours mean that there is more staff than needed, through the redeployment mechanisms available under the Haddington Road agreement and its predecessor, they enable us to reduce costs in other locations.  We believe &euro;140 million is within that design specification.  We have not allocated our &euro;80 million of that because of wanting to ensure that we allocate it to exactly the right places and do not ask some services to do what they cannot do and let others off the hook.<\/p><p>  In relation to the &euro;108 million, it is considered possible that the displacement of other cost in excess of &euro;140 million could be deliverable to contribute to the &euro;108 million.  That does not ask more of our staff but asks more of our managers in the way they use the flexibility and the extra hours to displace cost.<\/p><p>  I will ask Mr. Barry O'Brien to talk about the verification process, but, as the Minister has outlined, we will within the next period be completing the evaluation process that Barry will describe.  If at the end of the evaluation process it is clear that some part of that &euro;108 million is not deliverable and if it is clear that the pension provision will be underfunded as a result of the move of &euro;63 million, there is a process available to us within Government to have those issues addressed.  There is no mandate to translate those issues into service cuts.  The Haddington Road agreement is not about service cuts.  It is about reducing the cost of services.  That is an important point I should make.  I will ask Barry to add something in terms of the process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014011400016#P00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1389727200,"counter":680,"content":"<p>The challenge for us in the HSE, both for the statutory and all of the funded agencies, is to maximise everything which we can under the Haddington Road agreement.  As the director general, DG, has said, there are some fixed savings which are completely predictable - how much it will save over the year for the pay cut over &euro;65,000, how much it will save by the adjustment downwards in the rate of overtime being paid, how much it will save by the absolute freeze on increments and how much it will save by the delayed payment of increments.  The real variable comes in the main in the totality of how one manages the additional hours.  If one takes, for example, that Government approved the recruitment outside of the employment ceiling of 1,000 graduate nurses and the recruitment of 1,000 support staff, those are additional to our existing cohort.  We currently employ approximately 99,930 staff.  We did not meet our employment control framework, ECF, target this year; we fell short by approximately 1,000.  Therefore, there was a balance to be struck between delivering safe services and maintaining services and how we manage the employment ceiling.  <\/p><p>  Deputy Regina Doherty asked if we would be making staff redundant.  There is an absolute guarantee that there will be no compulsory redundancies under the Haddington Road agreement on the proviso that staff give complete flexibility.  However, if one takes it, for example, that under the Haddington Road agreement there are approximate 5 million additional hours in the system, how will we manage that?  One needs to challenge the managers by asking they have done with their hours, whether they have redeployed and reassigned staff, changed rotas or come up with new ways of working.  I suppose one is asking the managers, before they even contemplate having any service reduction, whether they have maximised use of the Haddington Road agreement.  We are introducing immediately an assurance group which will introduce a standardised model to measure what is happening in each site as per the quantum of additional hours that was delivered under the Haddington Road agreement.  This is not what could be; this is what is signed up to.  To emphasise what the DG has stated, we will undertake that exercise.  We will work with managers to state in that instances they could have done something else.  For example, we had an incentivised career break earlier last year before the Haddington Road agreement was concluded for which we received 2,500 applicants; we were only able to facilitate 326 of those and we are now proposing to reopen that scheme.  Therefore, one could have an orderly facilitation of staff who wish to take an incentivised career break where one then achieves pay savings by replacing those staff with staff on additional hours and replacing the direct skill set.  All I am saying is that is the challenge now facing us and that is why there are no certainties until we get in there to see what is happening and maximise the enablers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014011400016#P00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Barry O'Brien"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1389727200,"counter":681,"content":"<p>I will deal now with the issue of what is stated in the service plan on the broad issue of patient safety and, lastly, will deal with the issue of finance, and I will bring Mr. Thomas Byrne-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014011400016#P00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1389727200,"counter":682,"content":"<p>Mr. Tony O'Brien might mention the capital plan as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014011400016#P00500","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1389727200,"counter":683,"content":"<p>That is not for today.

That is the primary reason it is there.  In addition, there has been in this part of the world - by which I include these islands - a significant period in terms of learning from adverse incidents, both in this jurisdiction and in the neighbouring jurisdiction, and we thought it was absolutely appropriate to put that front and centre in the opening paragraphs of the chapter.  We absolutely accept, in response to Senator Crown, that merely saying it does not do it but over time the debate about the health service, internally and externally, has been overly focused on money, deficits, etc.  That is heard by managers and staff up and down the country and they need to hear from ourselves, reflecting the message of the Minister, that the most important matter is the quality and safety of our services in all respects, including those who are struggling to access them at present.  If I may, I will ask Mr. Crowley to add to what I have said.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014011400016#P01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1389727200,"counter":688,"content":"<p>I agree with Senator Crown in so far as one must set a series of targets.  Targets, as one will be aware, and as we have seen their impact on other jurisdictions, can lead to game-playing - somebody referred to a possible example of that this evening already - and can lead to tunnel vision.<\/p><p>  What is important about the service plan is, first, that it has a clear emphasis on quality and patient safety, not only when services go wrong.  It is about improving the quality of care and, really, in the end of the day, is measured by patient experience.  The committee will note in the appendix that there is an increasing number of measures of quality being assessed during the year.  We also will be working with the system to develop what we are calling a \"quality profile\", which is a set of validated measures of quality, but also incorporating matters such as what incidents have occurred in the setting for which one is responsible, what has one learned from them and what has one done about those incidents.  It will include validated measures of patient experience and, hopefully, with time, also staff experience because we believe that front-line staff have much to tell us about the quality of care that we provide.  We believe we should be listening to front-line staff more and that we would have a much higher quality service if we do that more effectively than we currently do.<\/p><p>  To reiterate the point about the Mid-Staffordshire report and the Keogh report that followed it, it is imperative that we learn from other jurisdictions.  We share our learning with other jurisdictions as well.  There are lessons from those reports for us.  I have brought that report on two occasions to the management team for us to reflect on those reports and to ensure that we put in place safeguards to ensure that such level of care does not happen in our system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014011400016#P01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Philip Crowley"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1389727800,"counter":689,"content":"<p>I emphasise there always is a danger, when one has someone who is identified as the director of quality and patient safety, that it could be perceived, either internally or externally, that it is that person.  If one looks at every divisional section of the service plan, quality and patient or client safety, as the case may be, are referenced and very clear.  Those national directors who are not present today will be at our quarterly meetings - there are too many to bring all at once - but they all accept a focus on patient safety as a fundamental part of their obligations.  It is not just saying it but doing it and making it a key part of every decision made, recognising that opportunities to improve arrive from time to time and that there are decisions which, if one goes the wrong way, will have an adverse impact on patient safety.<\/p><p>  To turn to the issue of the staff reduction, where we have a say, we will not be facilitating the exit of staff from front-line services, not least because we would need to replace them and would simply be increasing our costs were we to so do.  That said, there is a grace period exit programme envisaged in the Haddington Road agreement to August 2014 and we will have no control over who chooses to exit early to avail of enhanced or preserved pension entitlements.  We cannot control this, but where there are voluntary schemes, they will be voluntary on our side also.  Unlike in the past, while there will be no compulsion on a person to go, a person who volunteers to go will be faced with a manager who will be obliged to volunteer to let him or her go.  We will not be seeking to let people go where we need to replace them.  In the last year we did not achieve the targeted reduction.  In some instances, that was because we would not let people go because patient safety could have been compromised.  Consequently, in so far as there is a hierarchy, achieving a reduction in people is not at the top of it because it does not always make sense to so do.  We must make calls and take responsibility for them.  Notwithstanding the fact that we are required to balance a range of Government policies and priorities, we must and do make calls.<\/p><p>  I am deliberately taking the financial control space last because in some respects, it is part of the message we are trying to send.  I refer to the Ogden review and the follow-on report I commissioned on becoming the acting or deputy chief executive officer of the HSE, namely, the PA Consulting Group recommendation.  Moreover, the financial improvement programme approved by a board which I chaired and which included senior personnel from the HSE and the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Health is now available on the HSE's website.  It spells out in absolute detail the manner in which we intend to reshape the financial management model, that is, moving away from an excessive concentration on financial transaction processing to more of an added-value financial management process to ensure funds are properly tracked and used etc.  As the Minister stated, the appointment of the chief financial officer is part of that process and I will invite him to say a word.  I acknowledge that a specific question has been tabled in this regard for the quarterly meeting and the answers have been supplied in respect of the numbers of staff and so on.  However, we seek to reform fundamentally the way we approach financial management in the system.  We are, by agreement, developing a business case for a single common chart of accounts, supported by a single financial system, which will apply to the whole of the publicly provided health service.  This will, among other things, help us to address some of the issues being addressed by another committee of the Oireachtas because of the visibility it will give us.<\/p><p>  In respect of acute services, last year, in the 2013 plan, we carried out a significant rebalancing in respect of additional resources.  It is true that the overall cost of providing the acute system has come down considerably.  However, at a certain point in time we had reached a stage where the health service was guaranteed to be destabilised by financial overruns in acute services because, put simply, too much had been taken out too quickly, more than anywhere has ever successfully achieved.  It was creating a situation where, when I became the deputy chief executive officer of the HSE in August 2012, I was faced with a likely overrun, without significant corrective action, of &euro;500 million.  That led us in a highly negative direction in terms of some of the cuts that had to be made and it is to avoid precisely this, that these processes I have described around the figures of &euro;113 million, &euro;108 million and so on are so essential.  Without such processes, the level of risk attached to the service plan would have been sufficient that I would not have changed the introduction, to put it in a nut shell.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014011400017#Q00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1389727800,"counter":690,"content":"<p>To follow on the comments of Mr. O'Brien, he has covered the salient points in respect of what is happening.

It is important to state, however, that although the Comptroller and Auditor General's report states annually that the systems in place are not fit for the purpose for which they are intended, at the same time there is a rigorous audit carried out every year and, touch wood, we have had a clean audit every year.  The issue arises from the number of finance staff, that is, approximately 60% of them, who spent their time working on systems that are not fit for purpose, not on front-line work or driving the business forward.

It is an intention that is part of the overall calculation.  I think \"arithmetic\" is a word the Minister has used previously.  Where does Mr. O'Brien expect these to occur since 2,600 WTE posts will be found?  In his view, is this achievable at all?  Is it desirable?  So much of the service plan is a wish list; there is no certainty and it states \"this may\" or \"that might...\".  Ultimately, the joint committee's concern is that patient safety be a central tenet at all times and that people be able to access critical services on the basis of need, which is not always the case.

We will be back in another 48 hours and can answer any questions left unanswered then.  Hopefully, we will address Senator van Turnhout's concerns further then.<\/p><p>  Patient safety is the first and foremost concern in regard to all of this.  For a long time, I have talked about focusing on better outcomes for patients and on seeing more patients more quickly.  I would like to echo what the director general of the HSE has said.  In the past, we have heard the same refrain day in and day out.  I would have been part of that then.  We had too much talk and focus on how many doctors and nurses there were and on how much money and how many billion euro were being spent.  While more money would be welcome, if money alone was the solution, we would not be where we are now.  The question I must ask therefore is why, after more than quadrupling health expenditure by 2008 from the early 1990s, we faced such a crisis in 2009 in emergency departments that the then Minister, Mary Harney, wanted to have the situation treated as a national emergency.<\/p><p>  Money is not the key issue here, although it is important.  Reform is the key issue, reform of how we work, how we deliver services, how we interrelate and who does which job.  Too many silos have grown up and there are too many people who do not want to let go of what they are doing, despite the fact they complain they are overwhelmed with work.  There is also a lack of transparency.  The waiting list initiative, in terms of outpatients, is a classic and critical issue in terms of transparency and letting people see what we have and the situation with which we must deal.  <\/p><p>  I want to go further and will go further this year in regard to transparency.  The waiting times for each department and consultant will be made available, initially internally but ultimately publicly.  Morbidity and mortality rates will also be made available.  Patients have a right to know what kind of doctor they are attending and GPs have a right to know the kind of doctor to whom they are referring patients.  The empowered patient is a safe patient.  Why would a patient not have the right to know that a visit to doctor X will mean a six-month waiting list, but a visit to doctor Y would only involve a two-month wait, particularly when both are equally qualified consultants?  Let patients make that choice.<\/p><p>  This year, we will continue to bring in legislation that will continue necessary reforms.  We want to roll out the continuation of the \"money follows the patient\" model, to create purchase or provider lists, have functioning hospital groups and new integrated service areas, set up a new contract for GPs for children under six and present a White Paper on universal health insurance to allow a broad consultation with all interest groups to determine its precise shape.  No doubt, this committee will have a huge input into that.<\/p><p>  I will finish by thanking everybody who works in our health service, who have kept the service running and delivering care 24 hours a day, seven days a week and 52 weeks a year with fewer staff and money and in the face of increasing demand, as evidenced by an 8% growth in the population since 2006 and 20,000 more people over the age of 65 every year, which while great to see creates extra demand.  While the staff of the health service have been doing all of this, they have continued to reform the system to provide better outcomes for more patients.  I look forward to working with them and with this committee to continue these reforms over the next 12 months and to improve health services, which is our duty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014011400018#R01100","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1389728400,"counter":707,"content":"<p>Does Mr. O'Brien wish to add a comment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014011400018#R01200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1389728400,"counter":708,"content":"<p>Should I comment on the ambulance service?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014011400018#R01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1389728400,"counter":709,"content":"<p>We can deal with that on Thursday.
