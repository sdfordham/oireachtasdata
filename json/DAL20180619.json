It is without question that human health has been placed at risk as a result of the environmental damage being done by this criminality.  The programme makers deserve great credit for their work.  They revealed a darker and more dangerous aspect of the Wild Atlantic Way.  A fragmented and ineffective national waste enforcement regime was laid bare, in particular in the west.  We saw issues in Clifden, Tuam, Bray and Moville, County Donegal and much more.  Appalling stories were told about the illegal dumping of commercial, construction and household waste, yet the total number of enforcement staff across all local authorities is only 150.  What emerged from the programme was that enforcement had to be resourced far more effectively.  Funding must also be allocated for a clean-up and waste recovery where illegal dumps are discovered, as illustrated, in particular, in the case of the Bray landfill site.  The particular issue of the performance of Donegal County Council's in waste enforcement and management must be investigated.  I do not say that lightly.  The breach of licence conditions by the operation in Killarney was staggering, yet it appears there was passive tolerance of it early in the journey of the company involved.  There was dumping in a special area of conservation near the River Barrow in an extraordinarily brazen way, threatening groundwater, the environmental purity of the area and human health through the leaking of leachate and the presence of asbestos.  We saw waste being moved illegally from the South to the North.<\/p><p> Does the Taoiseach accept that the regulatory system governing waste collection and disposal is fragmented, ineffective and poorly resourced?  We have had many inquiries but the \"RT&Eacute; Investigates\" programme is the tip of the iceberg.  Will the Taoiseach facilitate a form of fact-finding inquiry to get a truly national picture of the story around waste collection, disposal, enforcement and the application of the regulatory regime right now in the country so that we can find out what is going on in the sector to inform future policy?  Will the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Naughten, make himself available to the House this week specifically to answer questions on issues that arise from the \"RT&Eacute; Investigates\" programme?  The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, might accompany him as well, if it involves areas of local authority enforcement that come under his remit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900003#A00200","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1529413500,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this question.  I had the opportunity to watch the programme last night.  It was an excellent programme.  What we saw last night on \"RT&Eacute; Investigates\" was a disturbing picture that tells us that we have a long way to go when it comes to waste enforcement in Ireland, and that what is happening in some - perhaps many - parts of the country is seriously harming our environment and certainly harmful to human health.<\/p>  <p>  We have come a long way in Ireland when it comes to waste management and waste enforcement.  Only 20 years ago, this was a matter that was solely controlled by local authorities and almost everything went to landfill.  I remember those landfills, one such being Dunsink in my constituency where everything was just thrown into a landfill and there was almost no recycling or efforts to reuse or reduce at that time.<\/p>  <p>  It is evident to me, however, and I imagine everyone in this House, that compliance and enforcement is not what it should be.  There is significant variation in enforcement from local authority to local authority, as the Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin pointed out.  He singled out Donegal County Council in particular where enforcement is low.  We need to bear in mind that local authorities have a responsibility to decide how they allocate their own resources.  Donegal allocates the least compared with other counties and Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin will be aware that the largest delegation on that local authority is Fianna F&aacute;il.  The second largest is Fine Gael.  Of course there are councillors from my party too.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900004#B00200","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1529413500,"counter":9,"content":"<p>It is an executive function.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900004#B00300","speaker":"1225"},{"type":"speech","time":1529413500,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I hope Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900004#B00400","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1529413500,"counter":11,"content":"<p>That is a silly answer now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900004#B00500","speaker":"1319"},{"type":"speech","time":1529413500,"counter":12,"content":"<p>Order.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900004#B00600","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1529413500,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I hope Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin will be talking to his councillors about it.

I am informed by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment that several enforcement actions have been initiated and that all of the cases that were raised in \"RT&Eacute; Investigates\" last night are either under investigation or constitute closed cases.  As the programme highlighted, enforcement action against illegal waste operators, including unauthorised collection of waste and illegal dumping, is led by local authorities and the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, under section 63 of the Waste Management Act 1996, and the Minister is precluded from exercising any power or control in the performance of an agency or local authority in particular circumstances of a statutory function vested in it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900004#B01500","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1529413500,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I am quite disappointed with the Taoiseach's response and the pettiness of it in terms of pointing out the make-up of a council.

As we know, the report was initiated on foot of Tusla's catastrophic mishandling of allegations made against Garda whistleblower, Maurice McCabe.  I understand the report is damning and outlines dysfunction and deficiencies within Tusla in the areas of staffing, systems, reporting and governance.  I understand it highlights the alarming reality that Tusla has serious difficulties in recruiting and retaining specialist staff, in particular, social workers.  The report also points to resourcing problems and the inability of Tusla to respond appropriately to cases of alleged or suspected child abuse.  The unacceptable result of this catalogue of failure is that the Child and Family Agency is not adequately protecting children at ongoing risk.  This means that children are knowingly being left in danger.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach may recall that when I raised the horrific Galway foster home rape case with him in April, I said the State's failure of children was a damning indictment on our political system.  I also said it would not be long before we would be back here to discuss yet another failure, and here we are.  There are children at increased risk today due to the culture of dysfunction in Tusla.  This has been compounded by the Government's failure to act and properly resource a responsive and effective Child and Family Agency.  It is clear that we need to see a radical step change when it comes to recruiting and retaining social workers.  In January last, the Committee of Public Accounts highlighted the high staff turnover rates at Tusla.  Despite hiring 250 new staff, the net gain was only 18 due to the high numbers of staff leaving the agency.<\/p><p>This is an issue we have raised time and again with the Minister.  In May we learned that over 4,000 children referred to Tusla were waiting to be allocated a social worker.  We need to see dramatic improvements, but we also need to see accountability for the litany of failures contained in today's report.  In order to change the culture in Tusla there first has to be accountability.  All of this is happening on the Taoiseach's watch.  The diagnosis is clear: Tusla, as it stands, is not fit for purpose and what we now need are solutions to ensure the children at risk will be properly protected.  What does the Taoiseach plan to do to address the chronic shortage of social workers in the system?  The HIQA report published today was commissioned a year ago.  The Government and all of us knew at that stage that there were very big problems.  We also know that a year is a very long time in the life of a vulnerable child.  What measures were taken in the interim to minimise the danger to children at ongoing risk?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900005#C01200","speaker":"1239","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1529414700,"counter":36,"content":"<p>The report does not deal with matters before the disclosures tribunal.  It was, however, prompted by issues being dealt with by the tribunal.  The Government accepts the report that was approved by the Cabinet today.  Tusla accepts the report which will be implemented in full and its representatives will be before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs this week to account for it.  I commend the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Katharine Zappone, for commissioning the report in the first place and HIQA for carrying it out.<\/p>  <p>  As a Government and a society, we have many obligations and responsibilities towards our youngest and most vulnerable citizens, paramount among which is ensuring they are not subject to abuse, whether sexual, physical, emotional or neglect.  Therefore, having a properly functioning child protection system is a concern for us all, which is why the report was commissioned.  I appreciate that it was published in the past hour or so and that Deputies have not yet a had a proper chance to read or study it, but in respect of recruitment and resources, it is important to quote from the report.  It states there was abundant evidence of considerable financial investment that the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and Tusla's board and executive had made in staff recruitment and training and developing a more service demand model of staff allocation across its service.  While it does raise issues surrounding the difficulty in recruiting and retaining social workers, the report acknowledges in black and white the fact that there is abundant evidence of considerable financial investment made by the Government and the agency in staff recruitment.  Tusla's Exchequer funding for this year is &euro;753 million, a &euro;14 million increase on the figure for last year, a considerable increase by any measure.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy asked what specific actions were being taken or which had already been initiated or set in train.  The Minister has directed Tusla to produce an action plan as recommended by HIQA setting out the steps required to implement the recommendations, together with clear timelines for doing exactly this.  She is also going to appoint an independent expert quality assurance and oversight group to drive and monitor implementation in order that we will know what is happening.  The group will publish regular updates on its work.  The Minister has also advised that, in line with HIQA's report, she is prioritising several major initiatives to reform the way Tusla and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na deal with historical allegations of child sexual abuse and to support Tusla's workforce needs by creating formal career path mechanisms for students and graduates.  She will meet the board of Tusla in the coming days.

It is a major job and effort to do the transformation that has occurred in recent years.<\/p>  <p>  We cannot make these improvements soon enough, but I will give the Deputy an idea of where we have come from in only the past seven or eight years.  We established a Department for Children and Youth Affairs and a dedicated agency, Tusla.  When Tusla was set up it took on the full legacy left by the Health Service Executive and the health boards.  We have put the rights of children in the Constitution.  As I pointed out, we have increased resources for Tusla by &euro;40 million in the past year.  We successfully brought in mandatory reporting only at the end of last year.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy is right that the problems that exist around child protection are well known.  However, they are being dealt with over time and we will continue to deal with them.  I will give examples of some of the things done in recent months.  In April a new chief social worker was appointed, so there is someone now very much in charge of social work.  That person is key to ensuring that policy is being developed and implemented.  In July a new information and communications technology recording system for child protection and welfare went operational on a nationwide basis for the first time.  Joint work with the Garda is very important, especially when it comes to retrospective allegations, and improvements have been made in this area.

While this was regrettable, it showed a decrease on the figure from the previous year.  We know the extent of the campaigns by the RSA.  They are high-profile impactful television campaigns.  The RSA maintains they make a difference and its surveys suggest adults are affected and influenced by them.<\/p>  <p>  I want to compare and contrast the figure on road deaths with a different statistic, namely, the figure for drug-related deaths.  It is not a direct year-to-year statistic because the statistics do not work that way.  In the most recent recorded year, the figure for drug-related deaths was 695, which is 3.5 times higher than the figure for deaths on the roads.  EUROSTAT published a statistic this morning indicating that the number of drug-related deaths in Ireland is three times higher than the European average.  How seriously are we taking the drugs issue?<\/p>  <p>  We know the facts.  We know the increase in the rates of drug use in Ireland, especially among young people.  We know about generational drug misuse and abuse.  We know about the unhealthy relationships Irish people have with drugs and alcohol and the extraordinary damage done to families and communities.  We know about the bills in health and crime and we know the links with sexually transmitted illnesses.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach launched the national drugs strategy in Dublin Castle last year.  He said all the right things, recognising that the problem was a public health issue and the need to combat the underlying reasons for drug use and for effective intervention.  He also recognised the importance of community participation in key decision-making structures.  Two recent events highlighted the need for communities to be involved in the decision-making process.  While both events took place in Dublin, the issues I am raising concerning drugs are national.  On Friday last, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, launched an initiative to get specific on prevention and education.  A strong recommendation was made highlighting the need for a collaborative and agency approach involving community, youth projects and schools working together as well as listening to young people.<\/p><p>At a conference yesterday at Croke Park, hosted by the north inner city drugs and alcohol task force and the programme implementation board, on drug related intimidation we heard very frank accounts from those who were experiencing intimidation to pay money and attack homes and houses.  There was one very frank account of intimidation to carry out a murder and all because of drug related debt.  Even though we see a strong commitment between the community and the Garda division, various surveys have found that such is the fear of reprisal, there are low numbers of people reporting.  There is a strong recommendation that there be a multi-agency approach with statutory personnel who could make decisions with the community, linking the community involved in the decision-making process.  This would recognise good practice in communities and the wealth of experience and knowledge in them.  I ask that we commit to such a collaborative approach, with communities being part of the decision-making process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900007#E00300","speaker":"1291","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1529415300,"counter":42,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising the two very grave matters of road safety and drug related deaths.  We are aware that the number of deaths on the roads and related to illegal drug use runs into hundreds each year.  One death is one too many, with people being struck down long before they should be, often in their 20s, 30s, 40s or 50s.  The number of road deaths has fallen considerably in the past few decades.  Previously, the number had been in the region of 600, but it is now around 150, which is still too many.  There is evidence that the number may be rising again this year.  I shall outline what is required in that regard.  We must continue to support the Road Safety Authority and fund it well to continue its road safety advertisements and other information programmes.  We must step up the level of Garda enforcement.  There are 600 more garda&iacute; than two years ago.  We must ensure some of the extra garda&iacute; are allocated to the traffic corps in order that we will have increased enforcement.  We must also focus on legislation.  The Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill  2017 is before the House and I encourage Deputies to support it.<\/p>  <p>  I do not believe it is right to say road and drug related deaths are directly comparable.  The phenomenology and reasons behind drug related and road deaths are very different, but the Deputy has made the point well that there are many more people in Ireland dying from drug related issues than on the roads.  On what we can do about it, there is the new national drugs strategy which was published just a few months ago and is being implemented.  There is also greater availability of naloxone, which is very important in helping to rescue people from an overdose.  In time it will demonstrate and help to bring about a reduction in the number of deaths as a result of an overdose because the more available naloxone is to paramedics, key workers or even family and friends, the more people can be rescued from an overdose.<\/p>  <p>  We are reviewing our overall approach.  The Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, has appointed a commission to examine the issue of decriminalisation.  It will look at whether we should move away from the current approach of criminal justice to decriminalising minor possession of what are illegal drugs in an effort to move away from a criminalising system to one that may be more health oriented.  We also have approval for and are making good progress in putting in place Ireland's first injecting room in Dublin.  This will allow people to inject safety and people will know the health benefits and the number of lives that may be saved as a result.  I agree with the Deputy that communities must be involved in dealing with such issues and integrated into the decision-making and implementation processes.  She is absolutely correct and the Minister of State will take up this issue and run with it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900008#F00200","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1529415300,"counter":43,"content":"<p>The one point of comparison is that nobody wants deaths, but where there is a will, something can be done about it and road and drug related deaths can be prevented.

The Deputy is right to say that the political will to bring about a reduction in road deaths made a big difference.  Although the phenomenality around road traffic deaths and deaths related to drug use is very different, it required some similar things.  It required education, political will, legislation and a change in approach and tolerance for certain behaviours like drink-driving, speeding and so on.<\/p>  <p>  We have a national drugs strategy.  That is being implemented.  I mentioned how the greater availability of naloxone was saving lives and will save more lives into the future.  I have mentioned how we are reviewing the approach to criminalisation and whether we should move away from a criminal justice-based approach to one that is about health.  I look forward to the report of that body on that.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding task forces, they have had their budgets cut over the years, although in recent years the budget has either been held steady or has been increased in some cases.  Certainly, the budget for social inclusion within the HSE has been increased and was increased in the previous budget.  We always need to bear in mind when it comes to any of these local implementation bodies, irrespective of whether it is a drug task force, that we need to compare one with the next and see if some are getting better results.

The D&aacute;il has a role to play.  We should pass Deputy Pringle's divestment Bill, which will be up for discussion in two weeks.  Similarly, we should pass the Green Party's Waste Reduction Bill 2017 which would help us to deliver a circular economy.  We should pass Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith's climate crisis Bill, which would keep those fossil fuels in the ground.  Goldman Sachs, Coca-Cola and ExxonMobil would not like that, but the Irish people are behind it and want to see it happen.  We have the numbers in the D&aacute;il.  The only problem is Fine Gael.  Fine Gael is the climate laggard, not the Irish people, and it needs to change.<\/p>  <p>  The problem is that this change is greater than anything that the former Taoiseach, Mr. Se&aacute;n Lemass, and Dr. T.K. Whitaker tried to do in the late 1950s and we have no one on Merrion Street willing to show such leadership now.  That is what the Climate Action Network report and Citizens' Assembly said, and they were right.  It is the Government that is in the dock.<\/p>  <p>  To tackle this problem, we should think global and act local, which is an old green adage.  The new economic model will be dependent on building healthy communities where quality housing is within walking or cycling distance of local services.  To do that, we need strong local government, which means putting to the people next May the question of having directly elected mayors in every city.  I have someone in mind, a modern Whitaker, who could lead Limerick into becoming a climate treaty city.  I have someone in mind who would set Cork free from Dublin rule.  I have someone in mind who could lead Galway in setting the west awake and someone who could make Waterford the true capital of the south east.  In Dublin, we need a mayor to solve our terrible transport and housing crises.  The Ministers for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, and the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, are not solving them.<\/p>  <p>  We need to say to the St. Michael's estate team that we will go the cost rental route.  We need to stop Transport Infrastructure Ireland building ever larger motorways into Dublin and bringing more cars in, resulting in us having to dig up our front gardens when what we should be doing is using those engineers to build greenways everywhere and turn Dublin into what it should be, namely, a great garden city.<\/p>  <p>  The same applies in rural Ireland.  We need a national land use plan that treats the whole country as a national park rather than the illegal dumping ground we saw last night.  That is necessary if we are to plant 20,000 ha of new forestry and create a national rainforest.  To make all of this happen, the Oireachtas committee on climate change that we are about to establish needs to work.  It must start in September, finish by the end of the year and have the seven Secretaries General attend on Wednesday afternoons in October and November.<\/p><p>It must build a new national energy and climate plan, which we have to do for Europe, because the Government's current plan does not work.  I do not believe it.  Internationally, no one believes it.  It needs to change.  Is the Taoiseach willing to change or is Fine Gael sticking with the <i>status quo<\/i>with fossil fuels and with turning Ireland's reputation brown rather than the green it should be?

I have heard him say many times, as did the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, that he believes in directly elected representation and mayors.  He has said it clearly.  We need to be radical, to think big, put aside some of the fears that the public servants have, be political about this and say that we trust our people in Dublin, Cork, Waterford and Limerick.

The Act also grants HIQA the power to inspect direct provision centres funded by the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) of the Department of Justice and Equality.<\/blockquote><p>There are over 10,000 people, including more than 4,000 children, in emergency and domestic violence refuge step-down accommodation funded by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs at a cost to the taxpayer of more than &euro;140 million a year.  There are also approximately 4,500 people, including 1,500 children, in direct provision accommodation, the approximate cost of which is approximately &euro;67 million a year.  Periodically, we have seen widespread reports of complaints from families, in particular those living in private emergency and direct provision accommodation.  The Dublin Region Homeless Executive, DRHE, received over 300 such complaints about emergency accommodation in Dublin.  Issues raised included damp accommodation, insect infestation, limited facilities, drug use and, in many cases, soiled bedding.  I live in a constituency in which there is a large direct provision centre and engage with the residents at that location regularly.  They have spoken to me about chronic overcrowding, with multiple individuals or families in a room and limited play and education facilities which I have seen for children.  There are also ongoing issues with food, in particular for those with specific dietary requirements.<\/p><p>Part of the problem is the absence of independent inspection regimes for direct provision and emergency accommodation.  While some inspections are carried out by the DRHE of some facilities in Dublin and the Reception and Integration Agency, RIA, carries out some inspections of direct provision centres, neither body is independent of the funding bodies which fund what they do.  Last July I called for an inspections regime and was told by the then Minister with responsibility for housing that the DRHE was undertaking the development of quality standards and a such a regime.  I met representatives of the DRHE and acknowledge that much of the work it is doing looks very positive.  I support its efforts.  The problem is, of course, that the proposals have yet to be progressed and there is no outcome from the Department.  The proposals are also limited in that they would only apply to voluntary sector emergency accommodation, not to private sector accommodation.  There is no guarantee that the inspections regime would be fully independent of the funders of these facilities and we have no timeline for roll-out.  Even the timeline suggested by the DRHE to me at the end of last year was far too slow.  To the best of my knowledge, there are no plans to have a fully independent inspections regime for direct provision accommodation.  In fact, I have seen the form used for standard inspections undertaken by the RIA.  Not only is it a box ticking exercise in a metaphorical sense, the form literally consists of a set of boxes, with no real facility to set out an appreciation of the difficulties experienced by many families living in direct provision accommodation.<\/p><p>The Bill I propose is in no way perfect.  It proposes to give the responsibility for inspecting both direct provision and emergency accommodation centres to HIQA.  I am more than open to the suggestion that there is a better body to make responsible for such an inspections regime.  The purpose of the legislation is to say very clearly that it is time we had a fully independent inspectorate operating with clear quality standards to inspect all emergency accommodation in the voluntary and private sectors, as well as all direct provision centres.  The inspections should commence as a matter of urgency.  Whatever body is made responsible, whether it be HIQA, some other independent body or a new agency, it must be given adequate funding and resources.<\/p><p>Members across the House, including the Minister and me, speak to people living in emergency accommodation regularly and they tell us about a wide range of problems in some instances.  While a great deal of emergency accommodation is of very good quality and run to a very high standard, that is, unfortunately, not the case with all of it.  I am sure the Minister for Justice and Equality has, likewise, heard the many concerns of people living in direct provision accommodation.

On paper there are a great deal of proposals by the Government but in practice that plan will probably extend over the period of three to five Governments and in the meantime our housing crisis, particularly in social and affordable housing, is getting worse.  It seems that part of the problem with this Fine Gael Government is that it has, at a minimum, a delicate apprehension which is negative on social and affordable housing as though somehow or other people might get a greater sense of entitlement than the Taoiseach's party would traditionally see people who rely on social housing as having.  Has the Taoiseach taken the opportunity to share experiences with countries like Canada, a country of major immigration, which has had big house building successes in its different provinces, but also with the Republic of Korea, which has a significant public investment record so that just as we often advertise Ireland for what we have done well, we might gain some knowledge from them as to how they have addressed those problems in housing and health which are currently besetting the Government?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900019#R00200","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speech","time":1529421600,"counter":208,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas don Taoiseach as ucht a chuid freagra&iacute;.

We now have an EU-Korea Free Trade Agreement in place which has been very successful and has helped us to increase trade between the two countries.  The Republic of Korea is now the ninth largest trading country in the world and offers considerable opportunities for Ireland, particularly in the context of the free trade agreement.  Bilateral trade between Ireland and the Republic of Korea doubled between 2013 and 2016 to reach a value of &euro;2.6 billion per annum.  There have been regular visits to the Republic of Korea to promote Ireland as a trading partner and a location for investment in the EU.  When I spoke with the Prime Minister I strongly encouraged him to increase the number of ministerial visits that happen in both directions.  It is always on the St. Patrick's Day itinerary for us outbound but we do not get as many inbound Ministers from the Republic of Korea as we would like and hopefully that will increase into the future.  The EU-North Korea summit which happened in Singapore was not discussed because it had not happened at that stage.<\/p>  <p>  On the trade issues between the EU and the US, it is disappointing that the US has ended the temporary exemption on new steel and aluminium tariffs which had been granted to the EU.

We will continue to support the Commission in its determination to protect fully EU commercial interests, including through World Trade Organisation, WTO, legal proceedings and appropriate rebalancing measures.  This issue is before the European Council, which will meet next week.  It was discussed in March and I expect it to be considered again when we meet later this month.  In March, the European Council restated its commitment to strong transatlantic relations as a cornerstone of peace and prosperity and underlined its support for a dialogue on trade issues of common concern.  The view of the Irish Government is that we would prefer to avoid the imposition of tit for tat trade restrictions on tariffs between the EU and the US.  Those that have been imposed to date will have a relatively limited impact on Ireland but were it to spread to other goods and services it certainly could impact Ireland.  The particular concern we have is for the potential impact on Aughinish Alumina.  My Department, with the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Industrial Development Authority, IDA, are engaging intensively on this.  I have spoken with the CEO of Aughinish personally and made it clear that the Government will do everything possible to assist it.  Similarly, the IDA has been liaising closely with the firm's senior management since details of the sanctions first emerged.<\/p><p>The matter is also being raised through diplomatic channels and with our international partners.  As has been widely reported efforts are under way on the part of the parent companies to restructure their respective ownerships.  If this proves successful and the US authorities expressly agree it could result in the sanctions against the companies in question being lifted meaning that Aughinish may no longer be impacted.  That would be very welcome given its value to the area in terms of employment.  There is no guarantee, however, that this will happen and that is why the Government will continue to engage very closely with Aughinish and provide any support or assistance we can.<\/p> <p> In response to Deputy Burton's question on my engagement with other Heads of Government and whether we compare notes on domestic problems, yes absolutely, I always take the opportunity, if there is time, when I meet another Head of Government to talk about some of the domestic challenges we have, whether around health or housing and ask about their domestic challenges and compare notes.  For example, most recently when I met the new Prime Minister of Spain I learnt that Spain's health service does not have access issues as severe as ours yet it spends much less on health than we do.  I was trying to explore with him what Spain had got right that it spends considerably less per head on health care than we do but does not have the kind of access issues, long waiting times and so on, that we have.  We agreed that there should be an exchange involving Spain's department of health and ours on that.  He looked for something in return from me because Spain has a problem with structural long-term unemployment.  It has very high youth unemployment rates, with 20% long-term unemployment, or something close to that figure, whereas it is approximately 3% in Ireland.  I spoke about how that had been the case in Ireland for decades and how we had resolved that and we agreed that there would be an exchange between our Departments of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and Employment Affairs and Social Protection and Spain's on that issue. <\/p> <p> I often find, which is interesting and mildly reassuring but not very that when we do speak to other Heads of Government and Prime Ministers about the domestic problems we face it is very often the case that they face the same domestic problems, to a greater or lesser extent.  It would not be unusual in other member states or other countries for the same kinds of problems we have in the health sector to be problems there as well, perhaps not on the same scale but certainly issues such as recruiting staff, waiting times and increasing overcrowding in emergency departments are problems in other countries, even in France.  It can often be the case with housing shortages as well.<\/p> <p> The capital programme is not a 22 year programme, it is a ten year programme.  The national planning framework runs for 22 years, between now and 2040.  The capital programme runs for ten years, that is &euro;116 billion to be invested in public infrastructure, in housing and transport, broadband, new health care facilities and new schools.  It will not take ten years to start.  It has already started.  Investment in public infrastructure is up by 18% this year alone.  It will increase by another 25% next year, that is an additional &euro;1.5 billion.  We are getting this programme done and it is very much under way.  The ten year national development plan provides for us to grow our social housing stock by 110,000 units over the next ten years.  We grew the social housing stock, by different mechanisms, by 7,000 last year.  It will be similar or more this year and will go up to 10,000 a year and more after that, adding to the social housing stock by 110,000.  That is a considerable------<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900019#R00800","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1529422200,"counter":215,"content":"<p>The Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, has revised that to 14,000 over two years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900020#S00200","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speech","time":1529422200,"counter":216,"content":"<p>No.  Those ESRI projections do not relate to social housing.

On Monday, 11 June I launched Global Ireland,<i><\/i>the Government's strategy to double the scope and impact of Ireland's global footprint by 2025.  This represents the most ambitious renewal and expansion of Ireland&rsquo;s international presence ever undertaken.<\/p><p>Investing in our international presence in this way will enable Ireland to be more ambitious in advancing its strategic international objectives, promoting its values and exerting its influence, both within and beyond the European Union.  Global Ireland 2025 sets ambitious targets to accelerate progress in diversifying and growing Ireland's exports, inward investment and tourism, particularly in response to the challenges posed by the UK's departure from the European Union. <\/p><p>Under the initiative we will expand and strengthen our diplomatic and enterprise agency presence across the European Union and its neighbourhood, as well as in the UK; strengthen our presence in the United States, including a new flagship Ireland House in Los Angeles, and increasing our presence elsewhere in the Americas, including Canada, Latin America and the Caribbean; expand our presence in the Asia-Pacific region, including a new flagship Ireland House in Tokyo; develop our relationship with Africa beyond our traditional focus on aid to building new multifaceted partnerships; strengthen our presence in the Middle East and Gulf region; deepen and widen our connections with our diaspora throughout the world; ensure that our distinctive culture and heritage reaches new generations and audiences across the world; enhance our digital footprint through a communications strategy to increase visibility, raise awareness and enhance Ireland's reputation; publish a White Paper on Irish Aid, reaffirming our commitment to delivering 0.7% of gross national income, GNI, to development assistance by 2030; and promote Ireland's values of peace, humanitarianism, equality and justice, including through our campaign for election to the UN Security Council, which the T&aacute;naiste and I will launch at the United Nations in New York on Monday 2 July. <\/p><p>The rationale for and urgency in undertaking this initiative now is abundantly clear.  Technology is transforming lives and driving change in every corner of the world.  Geopolitical and economic power is shifting south and east.  The global trading environment is turbulent, with challenges to the rules-based systems on which we as a country rely.  Closer to home, the United Kingdom, our nearest neighbour and trading partner, is preparing to leave the European Union. <\/p><p>In addition, the challenges that the world faces, whether climate change, security, tax in the digital age or migration, demand multilateral responses.  Global Ireland will equip Ireland to shape and influence these critical debates and to take full advantage of new opportunities.<\/p><p>Implementation of the plan is already under way and will be overseen by a Cabinet committee, supported by a senior officials group chaired by my Department.  Priority actions each year will be identified with corresponding decisions about investment to be finalised in the annual estimates process.<\/p><p>A number of significant decisions have already been taken since the initiative was announced last year, including the establishment of new embassies in Chile, Colombia, Jordan, New Zealand, Ukraine, Liberia, Morocco and the Philippines and new consulates in Vancouver, Mumbai, Frankfurt, Cardiff and Los Angeles.<\/p><p>Being a citizen of the world in the 21st century requires a strong and effective international presence, both physically and virtually.  Global Ireland sets out the building blocks for Ireland to achieve that.  The initiative will, of course, inform the Government's approach to overseas visits and engagement.  For example, while my visit to Madrid last week was primarily an opportunity to meet with the new Prime Minister, I also attended an event with the Spanish-Irish Business Network and met our agency staff who are working there on the ground and had an opportunity to give them our thanks for promoting trade, tourism, inward investment and education in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900020#S01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1529422200,"counter":233,"content":"<p>We waited nearly a year for the Global Ireland document to be published but last week's document was more than a bit of a let-down.  Fundamentally, there is no implementation plan and there are no costings in the plan.<\/p>  <p>  I and my party have been calling for a significant expansion in our diplomatic, commercial and cultural footprint since well before the Brexit referendum.  We have argued strongly that we do not have the personnel available to develop the scale and depth of relations which we need, particularly in the aftermath of Brexit.  We do not have an issue with supporting the expansion as announced.<\/p>  <p>  There are two major problems with the document launched last week.  First, it is a stitching together of individual proposals from different Departments and agencies.  There is no real clarity as to exactly what our strategy is for operating where we have representation and there is too much focus on headline projects which are welcome but secondary to how we use our presence in general.  Second, and incredibly, there is no implementation plan setting annual targets and committing funding.  I know the Taoiseach said he will budget for this but I find it strange that a year on we do not have an implementation plan or any costings.  In the past two months the Taoiseach and his party have extensively briefed newspapers about a supposedly secret committee that is costing Opposition proposals.<\/p><p>The Taoiseach said he would have zero tolerance for uncosted promises.  Of course, this misses the fact that many of the proposals the Taoiseach was criticising have also been made by Fine Gael Ministers and the Taoiseach himself.  It is okay for the Taoiseach to make these promises uncosted but not for others to do so.<\/p> <p> Why is there no specific year-by-year implementation plan or detailed costings for this plan?  Without these there is no basis for assessing the credibility of the plans or the level of real commitment being made for the future by different Departments.  Will the Taoiseach address this immediately and publish the costings behind the plan?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900020#S02000","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1529422800,"counter":235,"content":"<p>I welcome the eventual launch of the Global Ireland 2025 plan.

I support all of that.  The Taoiseach referred to the opening of new missions and embassies.  Of course, this had been announced previously.  When will they become operational?  The Taoiseach referred to other agencies like IDA Ireland and F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  What additional supports and resources are planned for them?<\/p>  <p>  I have a question on a similar matter.  John Concannon headed up the strategic communications unit in the Department of the Taoiseach.

As the Taoiseach has pointed out, opportunities will present in terms of the State broadening its footprint in the coming years, especially in the event of Brexit, and there will be implications for certain sectoral employment firms in this State and their ability to branch out further afield.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to inquire about Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland.  Will their footprints be included in this as well?  I appreciate that with missions and embassies come personnel.  Are there any additional proposals for IDA Ireland or Enterprise Ireland offices?  This is especially relevant in Asia where complementary services should be provided to the counties with which our trade has increased substantially in the past two or three years.

I was in Japan and I saw the two buildings we have currently in Tokyo.  I know the price of building land there.  In fact, if a building is devoted to a diplomatic purpose, the occupier gets a decrease.  Is the concept of Ireland House to be a uniform concept now?  Are we going to migrate to that concept everywhere?<\/p>  <p>  The perception of Ireland is relevant for our footprint.  Everywhere I go, including at international conferences I attend within my political group, I constantly have to address the issue of tax haven Ireland.  Recent academic research and analysis from the University of California, Berkeley and the University of Copenhagen suggest &euro;100 billion in corporate profits were shifted into Ireland in 2015.  The research estimates that Ireland is the biggest recipient of such corporate shifts, bigger than all the Caribbean islands together.  These are real issues.  I realise they have been rejected by the Department of Finance, but perception is very real and we need to formulate a robust answer to that charge.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach might recall that his predecessor, Deputy Enda Kenny, believed in one of the perceptions of Ireland derived from our peacekeeping role through our military.  Certainly in my time in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform he was a champion of the replacement of the flagship of the Naval Service with a multi-purpose vessel that could have a hospital facility.  He believed that move could project positivity for Ireland in conflict zones.  The Taoiseach wears a dual hat as he is Minister for Defence as well.

I heard the discussion earlier about Trump and I welcome the criticisms of the barbaric treatment of young children being separated from their parents.  Some 12,000 of these children are now encaged in the most horrific conditions.  The Taoiseach did not answer Deputy Coppinger's question about whether he considers this as a line that has been crossed or action that goes too far.  She asked whether the Taoiseach should withdraw the invitation of the Government to Donald Trump to come to this country if we want to improve our international reputation.  Reference was made to our humanitarian reputation and our reputation for humanitarian values.  Is it not time to make a firm statement that Donald Trump is not welcome in this country and will not be invited to put his footprint, to use that term, in this country while thousands of children are encaged in a most barbaric fashion, separated from their parents and criminalised for simply being migrants?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900021#T00500","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1529422800,"counter":239,"content":"<p>It does not appear in the document, as published, but Global Ireland 2025 is costed.

This is something that I am going to drive.  My Department and the T&aacute;naiste will drive it as well.  Let us consider what is happening.  The plan lays out our intention to increase the number of embassies and consulates throughout the world by 26.  All those I mentioned in my earlier reply will be done within the next two years.  In fact, ambassadors have been appointed in some cases and are training up.  They are ready to go and be deployed to some of these new locations.  We look forward to seeing that happening.<\/p><p><i>4 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p> Deputy Farrell asked about the agencies.  They are very much at the centre of this.  We are expanding our diplomatic presence in Frankfurt because it is the emerging economic capital of Germany.  It makes sense for Ireland to have a much stronger presence there for IDA Ireland and for Enterprise Ireland.  This is just one example of that.  There is also the appointment of cultural attach&eacute;s to some embassies and the appointment of Bord Bia staff to some agencies, especially in places where Ireland wants to increase its food exports.<\/p> <p> There is also the Ireland House approach in Tokyo and Los Angeles, which is where the embassy is on one floor and the agencies on another floor.  This is to try to integrate our entire presence in those countries.  The Ireland House concept, which is a very good one, has to be considered on a case-by-case basis, which often depends very much on the country.  The United States of America, for example, has its political capital in Washington DC but economic activity happens in places such as New York, Texas and Los Angeles, so it does not make any sense to have everything under one roof in the United States of America.  This is similar to Australia, where the political capital is Canberra but the economic and business activity tends to happen in Sydney and Melbourne.  It does make sense in a place such as Japan where Tokyo is the financial capital and the political capital.<\/p> <p> John Concannon will be working on the UN Security Council campaign from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and his role will be to lead on the promotional and communication aspects of it, but not the political aspect, obviously, which will be handled by politicians and diplomats.<\/p> <p> There is no recent progress to report on the multipurpose vessel, but Ireland is renewing its fleet.  This is very much happening.<\/p> <p> With regard to the invitation issued to President Trump, the invitation was issued by my forebear and the invitation stands.

Canada has voted to do that and it plans to do it by next September.  I am aware that a number of US states have legalised cannabis, all the way down the west coast in places such as Oregon, Washington state and Colorado.  The predictions from those who opposed the legalisation generally have not come true.  It has been reasonably successful in the US states where it has been legalised.  It has not been done in any European country yet, except for some special arrangements around coffee shops in Amsterdam.  I have no doubt it is an issue we will consider.  The Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, has appointed a group, which is now sitting, to examine more broadly the issues around the decriminalisation of cannabis.  The group has asked for public submissions and I will be interested to see what recommendations this group comes up with.<\/p>  <p>  Medicinal cannabis is now available in Ireland on licence.  The Minister for Health has issued seven-day licences.  He has not refused a single licence when that application has been made with a prescription from a specialist.  It is our intention to expand the medicinal cannabis access programme, based on prescriptions from medical specialists who are willing to take the risk of prescribing it as a medicine and who will monitor the patient.  This aspect is very important because if cannabis is to be treated as a medicine, we must make sure it has the same standards as a medicine with regard to production, supply and monitoring.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900022#U00600","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1529423400,"counter":248,"content":"<p>It should include GPs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900022#U00700","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1529423400,"counter":249,"content":"<p>This is being worked on by the Minister for Health.

It is designed as a universal payment in recognition of the costs involved in raising children and plays an important role in tackling poverty.  As a universal payment, it does not rely on a means test or social insurance contributions.  The payment continues to be paid in respect of children up to their 18th birthday who are in full-time education or who have a disability.  Child benefit is paid to almost 629,000 families in respect of nearly 1.2 million children, with an estimated expenditure of more than &euro;2 billion in 2018.<\/p>  <p>  In recent days I have made my position on the child benefit payment very clear.  I thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to explain it on the record of the House.  I will not, and I have never intended to, introduce a means test for child benefit.  Means-testing child benefit is not being considered by Government and is not provided for in the programme for Government.  Government policy is to provide additional supports for parents and their children through increased services rather than through increased cash transfers.  This includes such services as free early years education through the early childhood care and education, ECCE, scheme, and enhanced provision of affordable childcare.<\/p>  <p>  As the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, I genuinely and wholeheartedly support the universality of the child benefit payment, the system we have, and the principle that all families with children should receive this income support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900022#U01500","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"speech","time":1529423400,"counter":258,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for making the position crystal clear so now we all know exactly where we stand.

Rather, we are using whatever money we have to try to improve and expand the range of public services.  We all recognise that these are badly needed, in particular financially supported childcare, of which there is a major deficit.  Stemming from the conversation that gave rise to the reporting, addressing that deficit is one of our country-specific objectives in the current EU semester, but there are also other measures, for example, medical care for children.  We have free GP access for children under six years of age.  The programme for Government would like to extend that.  We added a second year to the early childhood care and education, ECCE, year that was introduced by the Deputy's Government.  We would like to maintain and extend that scheme, increase capitations and improve quality.

There is no legislative obligation on an employer to make contributions or any further liability on that employer where contributions cease, nor is there an obligation on an employer to give notice to members or to consult in advance of ceasing contributions.  Accordingly, neither the Pensions Authority nor I have the power under legislation to intervene to compel an employer to continue to make contributions into a scheme.<\/p>  <p>  Even when a scheme is closed to new members or to the future accrual of benefits, the sponsoring employer role continues in respect of that scheme.  Where a defined benefit scheme is closed to future accrual of benefits, which is not the same as being wound up, the scheme remains subject under EU and Irish law to the funding standard requirements and to the Pensions Act in general.

As a first step, the campaign directed people to a dedicated page on my Department's website.  The website provides important information on the impact of false self-employment and the criteria used to determine whether someone is an employee or self-employed, as well as contact information for the Scope section within my Department, the Workplace Relations Commission and the Revenue Commissioners.

The Labour Party introduced the Protection of Employment (Measures to Counter False Self Employment) Bill 2017 which took an holistic approach to determine and classify employment status.  A clear set of rules was to be set out in statute law to apply to all State bodies and enforced across the board by the courts and administrative tribunals.  It sought to amend tax law and measures on avoidance to deal with bogus self-employment and apply PRSI.  If such a measure was in place, it would be a major deterrent.  There would be no fear that anybody would want to classify one way or the other.  Employers who might consider forcing a person to go down the route of false self-employment would think twice and probably five times before he or she would do so.

Nobody is made to stay or coerced to sign anything.  Nobody can sign anything on behalf of anybody else.  Whoever told the person who contacted the Deputy that his personal progression plan had been signed on his behalf was inaccurate.  It cannot be signed by anybody.  If someone does not sign up to his or her personal progression plan, it is not worth the paper on which it is written.  It lists the activities on which someone and the person assigned to him or her will work to try to find work.  In January the Department published a cohort performance report for the service which showed that 25% of jobseekers who had begun to engage with it in the first four quarters after its commencement had obtained work, 18% of whom had found full-time work and 4% part-time work, while 3% had started up their own jobs.  After someone involved in the service finds a job, there is a six-month period of contact between him or her and the new employer.  Obviously, it has to be voluntary.  It is not something that can be forced on somebody.  The reason for the contact with the person being employed over the six-month period is to support him or her in his or her new employment.  It is not a case of big brother looking over people's shoulders.  We have to remember that the individuals in these cases were out of work for more than 12 months in a single period before they were sent to JobPath.  There is a reason they were out of work.  In many cases, they were out of work because there was no work available in recent years, which is fair enough.  Others may have been out of work for more than 12 months for other reasons.  Many of the people concerned value and genuinely appreciate the relationships they build with their sponsors over a 12-month period.

In general, applications under social welfare schemes with a number of complex qualifying conditions, including those mentioned by the Deputy, take longer to process.  Before a decision can be made on entitlement to domiciliary care allowance, evidence of the additional care needs of the child must be provided and examined.  Similarly, before a decision can be made on entitlement to carer's allowance, evidence of the care recipient's care requirement, the level of care the carer provides and the carer's means must be provided.  In respect of disability allowance, evidence of the person&rsquo;s medical condition, the extent to which it restricts him or her from taking up employment, his or her means and habitual residency must be provided.  The target in processing applications for domiciliary care allowance is to finalise 90% of new claims within ten weeks.  This is being achieved.  The target in processing applications for carer's allowance is to finalise 70% of new claims within 12 weeks.  Currently, the average waiting time in processing new carer's allowance applications is 15 weeks.  Obviously, the target is not being achieved.  The target in processing applications for disability allowance is to process 75% of new claims within 12 weeks.  Currently, the waiting time in processing new disability allowance applications is 13 weeks.<\/p>  <p>  My Department recognises that the current processing times for carer's allowance and disability allowance must be improved and is working to achieve this.  Staff resources have recently been reassigned to work in claims processing.  A redesigned application form will be available shortly to try to simplify the application process.  The new form will allow carers to provide more information on the type and level of care they provide.  The aim is to provide deciding officers with the information they need to expedite decisions on entitlement.  The implementation of a new information technology system to process illness benefit claims, as part of the ongoing modernisation programme in my Department, will support the deployment of additional staff to support the processing of carer's allowance applications.  It is hoped this will help to reduce the average waiting time below the current level of 13 weeks.  The processes in place and resources assigned to these areas of my Department, with the number of medical assessors available to provide medical opinions, are kept under constant review to ensure delays are minimised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900027#Z00800","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"speech","time":1529426400,"counter":337,"content":"<p>We are blessed with our carers.

Carers keep tens of thousands of people out of State care and free up crucial beds for those with more urgent or life-threatening health care needs.  I shudder to think what chaos the healthcare system would face if carers were not keeping thousands of beds available.  We must do more for carers.  The current waiting time for an application to be processed is between 16 and 18 weeks, which is nothing short of an insult.  I spoke today to a number of staff members who had been following up on carer's allowance applications since 2012.  They told me that the average waiting time back then was 16 weeks, which means that we are seeing no long-term improvement.  This contradicts what the Minister said.  The process is cumbersome and tedious.  We force carers to jump through hoops and endure red tape in order to receive payments such as domiciliary care allowance and disability allowance.

To be fair to the Government and its predecessor, we have taken some small measures to try to show our gratitude.  Most recently, we introduced medical cards for persons in receipt of carer's allowance and reinstated the respite care grant.  We can do such small things to show our gratitude.  As the Deputy suggested, the payment carers receive on a weekly basis is the real sign of our gratitude.  The statistics I have are accurate.  They were compiled in the past couple of days.  Thankfully, they have changed.  We are still a week behind, but that is only in 75% of cases.  There may be 16 or 17-week cases coming to the Deputy's office.  A number of years ago we had a very serious issue with applications for domiciliary care allowance.  That gave rise to the establishment of a wonderful organisation, DCA Warriors, which most of us know and work with.  We reformed the application process by streamlining it and making it much easier for applicants and the Department.  The application process is now working well.

In December 2017 a woman was awarded full-rate carer's allowance in respect of her son.

They do not take 20 weeks to go through an application just because they want to annoy somebody.  We have times and targets available based on either the volume of applications we get or the length of time needed to do the work.

They include, among other matters, provisions related to defined benefit pensions and measures related to the General Data Protection Regulation, GDPR.<\/p>  <p>  A key priority for the Government is to provide additional protections for scheme members&rsquo; pension benefits.  However, it is essential that any new measures recognise the current pension landscape in Ireland so that a balanced, proportionate approach is developed and that unintended negative consequences do not arise.  Under existing pensions law, there is no legislative obligation on the employer to make contributions to a scheme.  However, the provisions of this Bill will introduce a new regime into the Pensions Act 1990 which will, among other things, enable the Pensions Authority to make a funding obligation direction specifying payments to be made by a sponsoring employer to the pension scheme where no agreement was reached, within a specified time period, to resolve a funding deficit.<\/p>  <p>  In order to achieve a balanced approach it has been necessary to consult with and obtain numerous legal advices from the Office of the Attorney General in respect of the DB provisions.  The Bill was provisionally scheduled for Committee Stage on 31 May.  This has been postponed to allow for the finalisation of the necessary Government amendments.  These provisions are quite technical and complex.  However, work is at an advanced stage and when complete an early date for Committee Stage will be requested from the committee. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, many of the provisions contained within the EU directive on institutions for occupational retirement provision, IORP II, will also support positive reform of the Irish occupational pensions sector.  Implementation of the directive will require legislative changes and my officials, together with the Pensions Authority, are working on the transposition process to ensure that the necessary amendments to existing laws, regulations or administrative provisions will be made to give full effect to the directive. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900028#AA00800","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"speech","time":1529427000,"counter":350,"content":"<p>Over a year is rather a long time to check that all the t's have been crossed and the i's have been dotted.

In particular, A Programme for a Partnership Government includes a firm commitment to develop a new integrated framework for social inclusion to tackle the inequality and poverty that, unfortunately, still exist in society.  This will be a successor to the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion 2007-2016 and its 2015 to 2017 update, which concluded last year.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is developing the new four-year plan for the period from 2018 to 2021.  Like its predecessor, the plan will have a whole-of-Government approach that aims to improve outcomes for vulnerable and marginalised people while recognising a shared responsibility across Government to implement actions to achieve the overall objectives.  The theme of the new plan is one of active inclusion, which will enable every citizen, most notably, I hope, the disadvantaged, to participate fully in society.  This includes having a job.<\/p>  <p>  The primary focus will be the reduction of consistent poverty, which was 8.3% in 2016, a figure none of us is happy about.  This will be achieved through a three-pronged approach: supporting incomes through a level of employment that is as high as possible and encouraging and assisting people to enter the workforce; setting targets for the level of relevant welfare payments designed to reduce relative poverty among those who cannot work or cannot find work; and improving access to quality services such as health, education, childcare, training, housing and community supports to minimise deprivation for all groups, in particular those who are on relatively low incomes.  Officials in my Department are working with their colleagues, both internally and in other Departments, to identify specific actions for inclusion in the plan.<\/p>  <p>  As a Department, we place a high value on our engagement with those who need to access our services and with the range of organisations that represent those experiencing poverty and social exclusion.  Consultation regarding the development of the new plan began last year with the 2017 social inclusion forum where the new plan was the main topic of discussion.  This was followed by an online public consultation process in February and March 2018 and further discussions that were very robust at the 2018 social inclusion forum.  This allowed my Department to gather responses from individuals who have real-life experience of poverty and social exclusion as well as from NGOs and those working in the community and voluntary sector and academia, which will inform the development of the plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900029#BB01200","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"speech","time":1529427600,"counter":381,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for the enormous amount of information she has given me.

The provisions in this Bill dealing with zero-hour contracts will help to ensure this remains the position.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to understand, however, we are not saying in the Bill that all casual or flexible working arrangements are wrong and should be prohibited.  On the contrary, flexible working arrangements are an essential requirement for any modern economy.

To prohibit outright all casual work or all flexible working arrangements would have very serious unintended consequences for many businesses and service providers across the country.

He said: \"Throwing around terms like zero-hour contracts, which we do not and never have had, is deliberately divisive\".  However, if one speaks to the workers directly, as I did, it is a different story.  Mandate has produced a copy of the contract on its website, which states: \"Your normal hours of work are flexible as agreed with your manager, spread over up to 5 days between Monday and Sunday and may include late night and weekend work.\"  There are no guaranteed hours and, in any normal language, that is a zero-hour contract.  Imagine trying to plan life like that, when a worker only knows a few days in advance how many hours and what hours they are going to do the following week.<\/p>  <p>  Zero-hour contracts are just one of many issues in that dispute.  It is about low pay, the absence of a real payscale, the absence of a proper sick pay scheme, the absence of annual leave and the attempt to stop workers organising in their union.  It is a vital strike.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900030#CC00500","speaker":"1433"},{"type":"speech","time":1529428200,"counter":396,"content":"<p>All of the issues the Deputy has just outlined will not be legal when we pass the new Bill because of all of the other sections of the Bill, not because of permitting casualised work in certain exceptional circumstances.

However, it is important to remember there are benefits to having certain casualised work.<\/p>  <p>  To give one example, in a recent high profile case an RT&Eacute; reporter was found to have been discriminated against by being dismissed on the grounds of age while she was on a casual contact when presenting a radio programme.  The Workplace Relations Commission found in her favour and she was awarded &euro;50,000.  Similarly, cover is necessary in an emergency and, for example, fire brigades have auxiliary firefighters on call for urgent situations.  Obviously, not every situation is an emergency, so cover is also needed for routine absences.  For example, transport companies would have to employ a relief driver during exceptionally busy periods or to cover the annual leave of other employees.  Pharmacies cannot open unless there is a pharmacist present so if a pharmacist rings in sick, they have to be able to provide locums.  There are a number of genuine exceptional circumstances that permit what we and the Workplace Relations Commission call casual work.

Workers themselves organising is the way that proper terms and conditions can be won.  That is why I salute those workers and Mandate for taking the initiative of organising.  That is seen in the response of the company, which has spent &euro;10,000 on setting up a bogus, so-called colleagues representative committee in flagrant contravention of ILO conventions.<\/p>  <p>  Another heinous transgression by Lloyds since the dispute began has been the targeting and intimidation of pharmacists with the claim that they do not have the right to strike, which every worker obviously has the right to because of the company's community pharmacy contract with the HSE.

The benefit that casual employees will see when we pass the Bill is that, if they are on an if-and-when contract and they have worked an average number of hours over a 12-month reference period, they will be entitled to be placed on a band of hours that reflects the reality of their working hours.  Therefore, it will not be as the Deputy has described in his reflections.  Employers will also be obliged, by the fifth day of employment after starting, to give employees a list of detailed information with regard to who they work for, what their contract is and whether it is fixed-term, as well as the expected hours of work - all of this before day five.  Employees on if-and-when contracts will also benefit from the new minimum compensation provisions so when they are given notice of work but they do not receive those hours of work, they will have to be paid, and we agreed during Committee Stage this payment will be for three hours.  Finally, employees on these contracts will also benefit from the reinforced anti-penalisation provisions so, if an employer penalises them or even threatens to penalise them, or gets one of their friends down the road to penalise them when they are on their way to work, they will be entitled to exercise their rights under the Act, bring a case to the Workplace Relations Commission and have that case adjudicated on and the employer reprimanded in the most effective way possible, which is through its pocket.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900030#CC00800","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Community Employment Schemes Supervisors","time":1529428200,"counter":399,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900030#CC00850"},{"type":"question","time":1529428200,"counter":400,"qnumday":44,"qnumall":"[26408\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900030#CC00900","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the steps she has taken following the passing of a motion in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in relation to pension entitlements for community employment supervisors; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1227","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","time":1529428200,"counter":401,"content":"<p>As the Minister will be aware, a motion on this matter was discussed comprehensively in the D&aacute;il and overwhelmingly supported.

The purpose of the payment is to assist these households with their energy costs and it was never intended to meet those costs in full.  My Department's schemes, including the fuel allowance scheme, are constantly reviewed to ensure that they are fulfilling their objectives.  Recent changes to the scheme which helped increase its effectiveness include extending the duration of the scheme to 27 weeks and the introduction of an option to receive the fuel allowance payment in two lump sums, thereby allowing people to buy fuel in bulk and potentially avail of special offers or discounts.  My Department also pays an electricity or gas allowance at an estimated cost of &euro;237 million in 2018.  Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, a special heating supplement may be paid to assist people in certain circumstances who have special heating needs.

One of the best ways to tackle fuel poverty in the long term is to improve the energy efficiency of the dwelling through proper building and household insulation.  The warmer homes scheme administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland is designed to do that.  Earlier this year, this scheme was expanded to include recipients of domiciliary care allowance and a further expansion to include carers is under consideration.

Initiatives like the warmer homes scheme operated by the SEAI under the aegis of the Department of my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Denis Naughten, have a very valuable role to play in that context, as does funding from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government to improve the quality of existing local authority houses.

I also acknowledge that Deputy Noel Rock has been in discussions with me on this issue for more than a month.<\/p>  <p>  To give the Deputy some background, my Department is providing funding for school meals in more than 1,580 schools and other organisations.  The programme, which supports more than 248,000 children, will cost approximately &euro;54 million in 2018, which is an increase of &euro;6.5 million over the previous year.  It is important to make that point because it makes a valuable contribution and its effect on the lives of the children who avail of the programme is, as Deputy Ellis described, tangible.  It is not something fuzzy or woolly.  The objective of the scheme is to provide regular, nutritious food to children who are unable, perhaps due to lack of good quality food, to take full advantage of the education being provided to them.<\/p>  <p>  In recent years, priority for new applications for funding has been given to schools that are part of the Department of Education and Skills initiative for disadvantaged schools, Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, DEIS, in line with the national policy framework for children and young people, Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures.  The schools in Ballymun, which are affected by the proposed closure of the breakfast club, all have DEIS status and receive funding from my Department under the school meals programme.  That will not change.  The breakfast clubs in Ballymun, which Deputy Ellis described as \"early bird clubs\", are operated by the Ballymun educational support team school completion programme, BEST SCP, and have been part of the Ballymun local drugs and alcohol task force funding provision through Department of Health funding for the past 18 years.  The channel of funding is the City of Dublin Youth Service Board and City of Dublin Education and Training Board.<\/p>  <p>  According to the Ballymun local drugs and alcohol task force, the allocation for the 2017 school calendar year was &euro;122,716, and &euro;87,716 to the end of June 2018.  The funding provided is used for food, staffing to prepare the food and supervise the breakfast clubs in seven schools during school term, insurance, training, etc., and has been administered centrally by BEST SCP.  The rationale for the Ballymun local drugs and alcohol task force funding these clubs was to support school retention and participation, especially for those families struggling to provide basic supports for their children in the mornings.  In an effort to maximise its funding and to focus more sharply on individuals, children and families with the most acute needs or at most acute risk due to drugs and alcohol issues, the task force in its allocation for 2018 only approved funding until the end of June and wrote to BEST SCP and local school principals to advise of this.<\/p>  <p>  The task force also allocated additional resources to engage an independent contractor to work with each school to provide support to make the necessary applications and arrangements to ensure breakfasts continued in their schools through the school meals programme, and that they were embedded directly in each school going forward.  The contractor has met the Ballymun principals' network and has been in touch with each school to assist in assessing how the breakfast clubs could be provided by the respective schools in future.<\/p>  <p>  The school meals programme has a particular focus on the provision of breakfast clubs because they provide positive outcomes for vulnerable children in terms of their energy levels, punctuality and school attendance.  The scheme provides funding for either a breakfast or a snack for all children and lunch for up to 90% of children in DEIS schools for the entire school year from September to June.  At present, all of the schools affected are funded for all children for a snack club and a lunch club.  If individual schools wish to receive funding for a breakfast club, they will lose their funding for snack clubs and obviously children would get breakfast instead of a snack.<\/p>  <p>  My Department provides funding for food costs to a number of school completion programmes, SCPs, throughout the country.  The SCP co-ordinator, who is generally based in one of the larger schools in an area, submits an application on behalf of the schools under its remit.  The co-ordinator distributes the funding to the constituent schools and the schools operate the clubs.  Occasionally, the SCP will operate the club in one school drawing in the pupils from the other schools under its remit.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has not received any application from BEST SCP to participate in the school meals programme to date.  If an application is received, it will be considered favourably.

We already know and appreciate the impact it has and that will not change.  The second thing we do is provide money through community employment schemes.  We have not reduced it either.  If anybody wants to approach us on new initiatives or move places, that is certainly something at which we can look.<\/p>  <p>  The crux of the matter is that for some reason Dublin City Council and the education and training board have decided to stop funding what they have been funding for 18 years, with no explanation and for no obvious reason.  I am not shirking my responsibilities and will gladly go with the Deputy and organise a meeting.  That is not a problem, but the question has to be asked as to why the task force saw fit to stop doing something in which they saw value for 18 years?  The only thing I can do in the short term is to genuinely encourage those involved through the school completion programme to apply for the exceptional needs money where there are cases where SCP co-ordinators help in schools.  If I can assist in that way, I will gladly do so, but the real elephant in the room is why an organisation that is funded by the State through the Department of Health saw value in doing something for 18 years and now no longer sees the value in it.  It needs to be made responsible to at least answer to us why it has stopped providing the service, what it expects the people who were going to be employed to do.  It needs to answer serious questions about why it saw fit to stop funding the service, what it will use the funding for in the future if it will not use it for the seven schools in Ballymun, but, within in my personal remit, they will continue to be supplied with food.  That is a given.  If Deputies Dessie Ellis and Noel Rock could work together to make sure the meeting that was scheduled to happen today will happen in the next couple of days and an application is made to the SCP, we will look at it on its merits, but it has to be reflective of the practice, goodwill and positive outcomes achieved in the seven schools in Ballymun.

I was not informed that the Minister would be unavailable.<\/p>  <p>  The problems associated with Scoil N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta Bhrighde in Faughart, County Louth have been ongoing for quite some time.  My office has been dealing with representations from many of the families with children who have been impacted on by the saga that has been ongoing in the school since May 2017.  Neither the Minister, the Archbishop of Armagh, Eamon Martin, nor the patron of the school up until the time it closed its doors in mid-September 2017 could find a solution to what had been an ongoing problem within the school related to leadership and management and the consequent fallout of a drop in enrolments due to falling standards at the school.  Dozens of families in the community were left with no option but to withdraw their children from the school, because of the failure or inability of the Department to deal with the issues at the time.  The school has remained closed ever since.  It operated with three teachers, a secretary and a caretaker.  Before it closed there were 23 boys and 32 girls attending, down from a high of over 100 pupils in its heyday.<\/p>  <p>  The church closed the school to find a solution to the problems, but at the time it was said clearly both to me and others that it would allow it to be divested to another patron once the problems were solved in the poor management of the school.  Archbishop Martin has been contacted by me without response, but he did respond to others, including representatives of the parents' group.  In a recent reply he stated he had no objection in principle to the possibility of the Department, following due process, making a decision on the opening of a new school under different patronage on the former Scoil Bhrighde site.  However, in his letter he stated he had had asked the Department for documentation on the process but that he had not received the documentation he had requested.  He also said that he was not aware that there had been a demand for a change of patronage or diversity in patronage provision while the school was open.  He also believed it was reasonable for any decision on a change of patronage to be made following a plebiscite or other form of wider consultation within the local community.<\/p>  <p>  The archbishop cannot but be aware of the requests for a change of patronage since the school closed.  He has also stated that, as a trustee of the trust which owns the property and as Archbishop of Armagh, he has a responsibility to the parish of Faughart to ensure the religious education of the children of the parish, including their sacramental preparation, is safeguarded.  I have received confirmation from the Louth Meath Education and Training Board that preparation for the sacraments would be carried out in conjunction with the local parish.  Archbishop Martin has asked for clarification from the Department on whether such a change of patronage would essentially involve the opening of a new school rather than a transfer of patronage to an existing school.  He has said he expects the same criteria of assessment to apply as normally apply in the case of a proposed new school.  I completely understand the concerns of the archbishop in that regard and also in regard to religious education, but surely a mechanism can be found to satisfy his concerns to enable the school to reopen to the satisfaction of the parents and community as speedily as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900033#FF00400","speaker":"1332"},{"type":"speech","time":1529430000,"counter":431,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter as it gives me an opportunity on behalf of the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Richard Bruton, to set out for the D&aacute;iI the position on voluntary reassignment of patronage under section 8 of the Education Act 1998.  As the Deputy will be aware, the Minister has announced new plans aimed at accelerating the provision of multi-denominational and non-denominational schools across the country in line with the choices of parents, families and school communities and the commitment in the programme for Government to reach a figure of 400 such schools by 2030.  The previous model of patronage divestment yielded only a very limited number of schools for transfer to multi-denominational patrons.  The number was ten since 2013.  The new schools reconfiguration for diversity process has the potential to significantly increase patron diversity in the school system.  <\/p>  <p>  The early movers provision of the schools reconfiguration for diversity process involves voluntary reassignments of patronage under section 8 of the Education Act 1998.  This fast-track process is part of the plan to accelerate the delivery of multi-denominational and non-denominational schools.  The new process which supports transfers of schools to multi-denominational patrons in response to the wishes of local families is based on the principles of transparency and co-operation.  It involves consultation with the school community, the Iocal community and the current patron and reflects their wishes in a request to transfer patronage under section 8 of the Education Act.<\/p>  <p>  In the case of the school to which the Deputy refers, the Department will consider any request that may be made by the existing patron for a transfer of patronage to a multi-denominational patron under the early movers provision.

The Louth and Meath Education and Training Board is capable and perhaps one of the best in the country at education and school management.  It has said the school could be opened for September 2018.  In a previous life I was the principal teacher in a rural school.  The Minister of State knows that the rural school is the hub of most communities and it is sad and disappointing, notwithstanding the valiant effort of the parents and families and the community of Faughart, that the school remains closed.  My concern is that there is obfuscation and fudge.  The patron has written to the Department with questions he wants answered.  The Minister of State mentioned an early movers provision but if that is not made within a certain period, people will find other places, as they would in any rural community, and they have done so in Faughart.  The patron has written letters setting out what the effects would be on the other schools.  It would only reverse the difficulty the school had before it closed.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister has sent out a first round of surveys under the consultation plan for the divestment of schools and he is also seeking to outlaw the baptism barrier for entry to Catholic schools.  However, as matters stand, the Catholic bishops have the final say on which schools they transfer and what type of school will emerge.  It is my clear understanding, having taken advice, that the Education Act 1998 makes provision for the existing patron to transfer patronage to another patron.  I have been advised that Archbishop Martin has withdrawn as patron of Faughart.  That is an important point.<\/p>  <p>  It is the parents' wish to reopen the school in September under the patronage of the Louth and Meath Education and Training Board.  The LMETB has confirmed to me that it is willing to open the school this September under its patronage and 30 families have already filled in an expression of interest form to send their children, both returning and new, to Faughart school under that patronage.  I implore the Minister to meet Archbishop Martin to obtain from him the letter of request needed to enable the transfer of patronage to take place.  Any further delay will weaken the spirit of community in the area.  As a former teacher, the Minister of State knows the importance of rural schools as hubs in the community.  Allowing this to go beyond September would run the risk of the school never reopening and we would have another Drimoleague. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900034#GG00200","speaker":"1332"},{"type":"speech","time":1529430600,"counter":434,"content":"<p>The Department has been contacted by some of the parties but has indicated this is a matter for the patron.

This case also highlights a more widespread problem in the operation of public contracts, in this case the National Development Finance Agency, NDFA, which contracted for the work on behalf of the Department of Education and Skills.  We must question the manner in which public contracts are designed in respect of the apparent lack of protections for subcontractors who are retained by the main contractor to carry out works on public projects, particularly when the NDFA, with Enterprise Ireland, participated in a meet the buyer event to provide information on supply chain opportunities for small and medium sized, SME, companies, in effect encouraging them to avail of these opportunities.<\/p>  <p>  The liquidation of the Sammon Group is very regrettable, particularly for the 200 staff and their families.  However, given the number and size of the projects undertaken by Sammon in recent years, the fact that it employed only 200 people directly demonstrates its dependence on subcontractors to undertake most of the construction work on its projects.  In my constituency, Sammon recently completed the construction of a brand new school at Tullamore College at a cost to the Government of more than &euro;12 million.  I am extremely concerned to learn that a number of subcontractors who worked on the school have been left out of pocket owing to non-payment by the main contractor.  In one case, more than &euro;40,000 is owed to a small contractor who spent many months working on the site.  This contractor tells me he cannot sustain this level of debt and he will have no option but to cease trading.  I have received a large number of representations from local contractors who have been left badly out of pocket by this particular contract and other contracts.  History appears to be repeating itself.  In 2010, Pierse Construction collapsed leaving subcontractors without payment.  They had no option but to protest at the official opening of schools in counties Offaly and Laois, notably in Ferbane and Banagher where I was in attendance. <\/p>  <p>  The Government has a duty to ensure that when large sums of taxpayers' money are being paid to the main contractor on public contracts, this money makes its way to the subcontractors who are carrying out most of the work.  Most of these small businesses have secured specific lines of credit for the purchase of materials on the strength of their retention on public contracts.  These small businesses are then unable to pay their staff and suppliers and the negative consequences continue.  The Government is committed to investing in large infrastructural projects under Project Ireland 2040 and we must ensure this results in a positive economic stimulus for the local economy and that subcontractors are not afraid to avail of these opportunities on the basis that they may not be paid.<\/p>  <p>  The construction industry was hit very badly by the economic crash.  Now that it is recovering and the volume of work is expected to increase significantly in the coming years, it is vital that the State put in place better protections for subcontractors who are the backbone of our local communities.  We have to look at the main contractors' track records on previous contracts before they are awarded further public work.  If the main contractor has a poor track record of looking after its subcontractors, we must not continue to reward it with lucrative public contracts.  Lessons must be learned from the past.  From my discussions with contractors, some have suggested that the problem with the business model is that the contract is awarded to the lowest tender and subcontractors are left to bear the risk of non-payment by using their overdraft facilities to fund the work. <\/p>  <p>  In additional, subcontractors have asked who will provide the warranty for the work already carried out if only part of the job is completed by whichever company has been awarded the contract to finish the jobs to ensure the affected schools are open in time for September.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900034#GG00500","speaker":"1339"},{"type":"speech","time":1529431200,"counter":437,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Corcoran Kennedy for raising this issue.  Unfortunately, the issue has been raised on more than one occasion recently.  It is not a new development and reflects poor payment practices in the construction industry generally.<\/p>  <p>  Former Senator Feargal Quinn's Construction Contracts Act was developed in consultation with industry to address these poor payment practices.  The Bill was introduced to Seanad &Eacute;ireann in 2010 and received cross-party support in both Houses.  It was enacted in 2013.  The Act applies to all construction contracts entered into after 25 July 2016.  Responsibility for the administration of the Act lies with my colleague, the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, whose Department has responsibility for prompt payment legislation.  I understand this issue has arisen as a result of the transfer of responsibility within Departments and the movement of responsibilities from one Department to another.<\/p>  <p>  That small and medium-sized enterprises were not in receipt of payments due on a construction project was unacceptable at the time of enactment and the same applies today.  It must be acknowledged that the contractor in question had been awarded a number of public works contracts prior to its collapse.<\/p>  <p>  This issue is not unique to public works by any means.  It is more galling, however, when it arises under a public works contract since the State pays the contractor what the contractor is due when payment is due.  The conditions of most construction contracts between construction clients and building contractors in the public and private sectors require that payments are made at defined intervals and that payment is contingent on work being completed to a predetermined standard.  There is usually no contractual obligation on the main contractor to make payments to subcontractors because this is left to individual commercial arrangements that are contained in contracts.  That is a fundamental point.  The State and the awarding body, whether an education and training board or a board of management, do not have a contract with the subcontractor.  It is the contractor that has responsibility to the subcontractor.  I realise it is a moot point but it is ultimately one of the most important points.<\/p>  <p>  The issues identified by Senator Quinn during the development of the construction contracts legislation highlighted an absence of formal contracts that set out the necessary commercial terms.  In many cases this was exacerbated by sharp payment practices by some, even where a formal contract did exist.  This was adverted to by Deputy Corcoran Kennedy.<\/p>  <p>  The Construction Contracts Act imposes minimum terms on all construction contracts, whether written or oral, and provides the tools necessary to enforce payment.  The tools include a maximum payment interval of 30 days and a requirement to honour payment requests within 30 days for subcontractors, a right of suspension for non-payment, and a right to refer a payment dispute to adjudication.  The legislation also outlaws the practice of pay-when-paid provisions that were prevalent in most forms of subcontract.<\/p>  <p>  While most of the interest from industry surrounding the Act was centred on the introduction of adjudication, it is the discipline that the legislation imposes on payments that would appear to be have been largely ignored.  Arguably, the associated provisions are the most important but they require the subcontractor to enforce his entitlements proactively with the contractor in the manner prescribed in the legislation for payments that are due.<\/p>  <p>  The Act does not cut across the normal rules for company liquidation or receivership, and so where this arises, there is no avenue for recovery.  The magnitude of the exposure that many subcontractors face upon the insolvency of a contractor would not arise, however, if the provision for payments was insisted upon and the remedies available were exercised where payment is not forthcoming.  The non-payment issues associated with the collapse of Sammon would suggest that subcontractors are not exercising the rights provided for in the Act.  I know what Deputy Corcoran Kennedy has said.  As was said by other Deputies last week, that is not always easy.  This inaction is surprising given the welcome it received by all contracting tiers in the construction industry and the support it received from many Members of this House and the other House.  I can appreciate a certain reticence to engage in the manner prescribed in the Act.  Indeed, I know well why it is not happening.  It is for fear of risking business.  Subcontractors have to question whether it is worthwhile doing business with someone who is not complying with the law.<\/p>  <p>  The matter was raised with me by two Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies last week.  I undertook to look at their specific issues.  This discussion is part of a dialogue among people in the Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900035#HH00100","speaker":"1267"},{"type":"speech","time":1529431200,"counter":438,"content":"<p>Inspired Spaces was the joint venture between Carillion and a Dutch infrastructure fund.  The joint venture won the contract to build and manage the schools.  A Carillion subsidiary was engaged to build, which in turn subcontracted to Sammon.  This means a number of steps are in place before we get to the level of subcontracting to the local small and medium-sized enterprises.<\/p>  <p>  I wonder about due diligence.  When the financial close on schools public private partnership, PPP, bundle 5 was signed off, the project and financing agreements were signed and all the conditions contained had been satisfied by all parties.  That occurred on 22 July 2016.  On 10 July 2017, less than one year later, Carillion issued a trading update warning that it had &pound;1.15 billion in losses by June 2017.

Surely some kind of red flag should have been raised.<\/p>  <p>  I have received some information from the Department on the matter.  Is it wise that the public private partnership companies in receipt of the tenders are not due payment for the construction of the schools until they are handed over?  It is no wonder that all these subcontractors are expected to fund operations at local level.  It is their overdrafts that are being called on to provide the materials and labour.  It is grand for a contractor to get a contract if the company does not need to have overdraft facilities in place and can use those of a subcontractor.  The real problem seems to be the fact that no funding is handed over until the school is completed.  Where is the funding to come from if the main company, in this case, Inspired Spaces, does not have the funds in place to deliver on the project in the first place?  That is a significant issue and warrants further examination.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900035#HH00200","speaker":"1339"},{"type":"speech","time":1529431200,"counter":439,"content":"<p>I am not going to dispute any of the comments that Deputy Corcoran Kennedy has made.

I am not passing the buck because this matter has been drawn to the attention of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on several occasions recently.

We have to be mindful of the fact that existing laws and legislation cover contract law and they have to be examined as well.  The contract does not exist between the awarding authority, whether the Department of Education and Skills, the education and training board or the board of management, and the subcontractor.

Not only is it financially costly, it causes significant damage to our environment and to human health.  The RT&Eacute; programme focused on waste and non-compliance with a fragmented system of regulation, how those who flagrantly abuse any system of regulation are dealt with, the time it takes to deal with those who cause such damage and who ultimately picks up the bill.<\/p>  <p>  The RT&Eacute; programme looked at waste, but unauthorised development is another area that requires significant attention.  A planning system is only as good as the enforcement.  While local authorities have responsibility for planing enforcement, on occasions it also requires the involvement of the courts.  I want to highlight in particular the issue of quarrying and I will focus on one particular example that is not in my constituency but it is in south Kildare, in Ballysax near the Curragh.  The history of this quarry goes back to 1983 when it operated without permission.  I shall refer, however, to 2012 when An Bord Plean&aacute;la wrote to the owners informing them that the quarry was unauthorised and did not have the benefit of planning permission because it did not avail of a section 261 regulation.<\/p>  <p>  In August 2014 a new owner took over the quarry and it was clear from the outset that the intention was to scale up the quarrying operation.  This drew many complaints to Kildare County Council and an enforcement notice was eventually issued in 2015 stating that they should close the quarry immediately with all equipment to be removed by mid June.  That enforcement notice was ignored.  Understandably there continued to be complaints from locals which culminated in locals protesting outside at the quarry on a regular basis.  Garda&iacute; were called on numerous occasions and, ironically, this resulted in some locals being arrested for breach of the peace.  Kildare County Council gave an undertaking to some local Deputies they would take High Court action under section 160 of the regulations.  A High Court appearance followed in late 2015 and a temporary closure was to follow, but that agreement was largely ignored.<\/p>  <p>  Today in 2018 the quarry is still operating.  Not only is the quarry operating to full capacity and breaking every planning law, it has in fact been extended to a massive 20 ha.  In 2016 the council took the quarry owner to the Circuit Court.  There were seven adjournments in the Circuit Court before a full hearing took place in June 2017, with the reserved judgment to follow.  In November 2017 the judge gave his decision stating the quarry was an illegal development without planning permission since 1983.  The judge ordered the quarry to be closed and the Kildare County Council legal team agreed a stay of five months, until February 2018.  The quarry owner was granted additional time to lodge an appeal for a stay on the judge's decision.<\/p>  <p>  Prior to the most recent High Court hearing I contacted the council, which was due to deal with the stay.  I was told the expectation was that there would be a full hearing.  I understand that the stay had elapsed, and while the judge appeared to favour the immediate closure, the quarry owner sought a recess to apply to another court for a stay.  Kildare County Council's legal team did not object to this.  The quarry owner came back to the court with a new stay and the judge suggested an October closure.  The council agreed to a 2019 closure, as long as the council got its fees paid.<\/p>  <p>  A small community settlement is in close proximity, details of which I can give to the Minister of State later.  I emphasise the length of time it has taken to deal with this.  Do we actually have planning enforcement at all?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900036#JJ00200","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1529431800,"counter":442,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Catherine Murphy for raising this important issue on unauthorised developments and how they are not being complied with.  I do not have the details of this specific case and am I was not familiar with the story, but I am now aware of it.<\/p>  <p>  At the outset, I will outline the Minister's role in relation to the planning system.  It is mainly to provide and update the legislative and policy guidance framework.  The legislative framework comprises the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, and the associated Planning and Development Regulations.  Furthermore, my Department has issued a large number of planning guidelines under section 28 of the Planning Act to guide planning authorities in the implementation of the wider planning policy framework.  Planning authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la are obliged to have regard to those guidelines in the exercise of their planning functions.  The day-to-day operation of the planning system, however, is a matter for the individual planning authorities and under section 30 of the Act the Minister is specifically prohibited from exercising any power or control in relation to any particular case, including an enforcement issue, with which a planning authority or the board is, or may be, concerned with.<\/p>  <p>  Under planning legislation, any development that requires permission and does not have that permission is an unauthorised development.  This is also the case with a development that is proceeding in breach of conditions laid down in the planning permission, or any exempted development that is carried out that does not comply with the limitations of that exemption.  The planning code also provides that enforcement of planning control is a matter for the individual planning authorities, which can take action if a development does not have the required permission or where the terms of a permission have not been met.  In this regard, planning authorities have substantial enforcement powers under the Act.  First, a planning authority may issue an enforcement notice in connection with an unauthorised development, requiring such steps as the authority considers necessary to be taken within a specified period.  If an enforcement notice is not complied with, the planning authority is further empowered to enter on the land and take such steps including the removal, demolition or alteration of any structure as is deemed necessary, as well as to recover any costs incurred in undertaking such actions.  Second, a planning authority may also seek a court order under section 160 of the Act, requiring any particular action to be done or not to be done.<\/p>  <p>  Taking account of the above points responsibility for enforcement action on any breach of the planning code is a matter for individual planning authorities under the powers available to them under the Planning Act.  Accordingly, individual cases of unauthorised developments or non-compliance with planning permissions should be brought to the attention of the relevant planning authority, which can then take the necessary and timely action as provided for in planning legislation.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware that Deputy Murphy has raised a specific case but it is not something I can get into because it is down to the local planning authority.  We constantly review the powers available to the local planning authority through the planning code and the Planning Act, and we issue guidance on that also.  A planning Bill is coming through the House currently and a second one is coming in the autumn.  If any issues are raised from these cases or other cases we can look at it to see if we can strengthen the law.  The enforcement of the law is at a local level and that is being strengthened there as well.<\/p>  <p>  In some cases it can be an issue of resources.  The Department makes it very clear that we try to work with local authorities to ensure resources are put back into local authorities, and in the context of making up for the last couple of years.  The authorities should be in the position to deal with these cases.  From a planning perspective the planning code is there and if we need to enhance it further we can look at it through the future planning Bills.  I thank the Deputy for raising the general issue in the Chamber.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900036#JJ00300","speaker":"1264"},{"type":"speech","time":1529431800,"counter":443,"content":"<p>This quarry is not a small development: it is 20 ha.  A small local community of 11 families lives near to it.  Four of the family members in those 11 houses now have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and others are using inhalers.  There is a significant problem with dust and on their doctors' advice the families stay inside when the wind blows predominantly towards their homes.<\/p>  <p>  Some 150 trucks per day - 40 ft articulated trucks - travel to and from the quarry on small rural roads.  They start at 5.30 a.m. and there is a serious problem with sleep disturbance for the families.  The road conditions are also dangerous.  Because there is no planning permission for the development there is no bond and no possibility of money for the remediation.  One could, at this point, predict that the public purse will end up picking up the cost of this.  Last night's RT&Eacute; programme showed us the kinds of damage that can be done in the waste sector.<\/p>  <p>  If this development had planning permission there would be a regime around it.  There are laws in theory but in practice it is going in and out of the courts.  People who comply with the law are at a disadvantage against those who break the law because they stretch it out the whole time.  This case offers a breathtaking level of non-compliance.  Every court, An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the local authority are being ignored.  While I use this case as a specific example there is a serious problem with planning enforcement.  There is great variation in levels of enforcement, depending on where one is in the State.  If this site had planning permission there would be a bond and a time allowed for operation.  A time would be set outside of which it could not operate.  Currently we cannot even insist on the enforcement of planning conditions because there is no planning permission with conditions.<\/p>  <p>  I ask that the Minister of State look at the theory to see if it is working in practice.  I was a councillor since 1991 so I have dealt with the planning system for a long time.  I have never once seen the local authority going in to take action or physically remove things using the section referred to by the Minister of State.  I do not believe it happens anywhere.  The provision is there in theory but it has to be there in practice.  The local authority should be there for the public good and I do not believe that what is happening here between the courts and the local authority in this regard is in the public interest.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900036#JJ00400","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1529432400,"counter":444,"content":"<p>The role of the Minister and me in the planning system is to provide and update the legislation and policy guidance framework.  The Minister cannot get involved in, or exercise any power in respect of, any particular case, including an enforcement issue with which a planning authority is or may be concerned.  Responsibility for enforcement action in respect of any breach of the planning code is a matter for individual planning authorities.  Part VIII of the Planning and Development Act 2000 sets out the comprehensive enforcement powers that are available to planning authorities.<\/p>  <p>  Alongside general issues, the Deputy has raised issues with this specific case, as have Deputy Heydon and others.  I have committed to considering whether these powers need to be strengthened in forthcoming planning legislation.  They are already strong, though, and I expect local authorities to be in control and, where necessary, to enforce.  We feel strongly in that regard.  We review local authorities' powers constantly and will do so again under various Acts to determine whether strengthening them is necessary.<\/p>  <p>  I agree with Deputy Catherine Murphy that there can be delays in planning authorities taking enforcement actions against unauthorised developments.  Situations can arise where, for instance, damage is caused to roads by construction activity and, if not acted upon, can become a source of annoyance and inconvenience for local residents and result in a cost to the taxpayer.  We need to strengthen our position on enforcement.  Local authorities have been strengthened in financial and staffing terms.  If we need to strengthen the legislation, we can consider doing so, but existing powers provide authorities with a good opportunity to enforce regulations in the way they should be.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding annoyance, inconvenience and taxpayers' money, the earlier that individual cases of unauthorised developments or non-compliance with planning permissions are brought to the attention of planning authorities, the earlier the relevant enforcement powers provided for in the legislation can be activated by those authorities.  In the event that it is considered that there is undue delay or failure on the part of a planning authority to address an enforcement issue, a complaint can be made to the Ombudsman.  I am unsure as to whether that has happened in this case as I do not know the specifics, but it is an option.  We will also consider powers in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  When an issue is causing people distress and inconvenience, the local authority should use its position and powers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900037#KK00100","speaker":"1264"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Apology for Persons Convicted of Consensual Same-Sex Sexual Acts: Motion","time":1529432400,"counter":445,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900037#KK00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1529432400,"counter":446,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann:<br \/><br \/>acknowledges that the laws repealed in the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 that criminalised consensual sexual activity between men:&mdash; were improperly discriminatory, contrary to human dignity and an infringement of personal privacy and autonomy;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; caused multiple harms to those directly and indirectly affected, namely men who engaged in consensual same-sex activities and their families and friends;<br \/><br \/>and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; had a significant chilling effect on progress towards equality for the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Intersex (LGBTI) community, acknowledging in particular the legacy of HIV\/AIDS within the context of criminalisation;further acknowledges the hurt and the harm caused to those who were deterred by those laws from being open and honest about their identity with their family and in society and that this prevented citizens from engaging in civil and political life and deprived society of their full contribution;<br \/><br \/>offers a sincere apology to individuals convicted of same-sex sexual activity which is now legal;<br \/><br \/>welcomes the positive progressive measures introduced by successive Governments over the last thirty years and in particular in the 25 years since decriminalisation was introduced by the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993, including <i>inter alia<\/i>:&mdash; the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act 1989;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the Equal Status Acts 2000-2016;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the Employment Equality Acts 1998-2016;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the Civil Partnership &amp;amp; Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the Marriage Equality Referendum and the Marriage Act 2015;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the Gender Recognition Act 2015;further welcomes the Government's commitment to introduce an LGBTI+ Youth Strategy, followed by an LGBTI Strategy; and<br \/><br \/>reaffirms its commitment to ensuring that:&mdash; the law fully recognises and protects sexual and gender minorities on an open and inclusive basis;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; Ireland is a country where LGBTI individuals are free to fully express their identities without fear of discrimination;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; all citizens can live in freedom and equality, and participate fully in the social, economic and cultural life of the nation, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; our foreign policy promotes and protects human rights globally, including the rights of LGBTI individuals, who continue to suffer disproportionate levels of violence and face systemic discrimination in many countries.<\/blockquote><p>I am grateful that we all have this opportunity to mark the 25th anniversary of the decriminalisation of homosexuality in Ireland.  It can be hard to change laws, and it can be even harder to change hearts and minds, to change what is considered normal, and to change a culture.  Twenty-five years ago this week, President Mary Robinson signed into law an historic Act that brought an end to decades of cruelty and injustice.  The Fianna F&aacute;il-Labour Party coalition at the time deserves recognition for its courage in driving this change, and a special mention should be made of the then Minister for Justice, Ms M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn, who piloted the legislation through this House and the Seanad.  I also particularly want to acknowledge the work of Senator Ged Nash in introducing this motion.<\/p><p>Several pieces of legislation were repealed in 1993.  Many were historical and stretched back to the 19th century, and even before the Famine.  There was some legislation from 1842 and some from 1847, with the main legislation dating from 1861 and 1885.  While that legislation was brought through the House of Commons rather than an Irish parliament, Irish Parliaments and Irish Governments defended it nonetheless for decades.  They were very much dogmas of a different time and they dictated how we treated and mistreated our fellow citizens, our brothers and sisters.  It is oppressive to live in a constant state of humiliation and a constant state of fear.  It is also deeply traumatic to feel that one is rejected by one's own country.<\/p><p>As the work of Professor Diarmaid Ferriter has shown, between 1940 and 1978 an average of 13 men a year were jailed for homosexual offences.  Between 1962 and 1972, there were 455 convictions.  I was born in 1979, and in the three years before that, there were 44 prosecutions in this country.  It is not all that long ago, and it is very much in living memory.  Homosexuality was seen as a perversion and trials were sometimes a cruel form of entertainment for the media and the public.  Others saw it as a mental illness, including the medical profession at the time.  For every one conviction, there were a hundred other people who lived under the stigma of prosecution, who feared having their sexual orientation made public and their lives and careers destroyed as a result.<\/p><p>Last summer, I was in San Francisco and I had the opportunity to visit a memorial in City Hall in honour of Harvey Milk.  Milk was the first openly gay man to be elected to office, and he was assassinated 40 years ago by those who were offended by, and opposed to, everything he stood for.  His portrait now stands in the Taoiseach's office.  Milk believed that hope was never silent, but too often in this country we were too silent on too many important issues for far too long.  It was the voices of a brave few who gave us all hope and then changed things for everyone.<\/p><p>I was just a child when Declan Flynn was murdered in Fairview Park, his only crime being that he was gay.  He was brutally attacked by five young men, one a teenager, who shouted: &quot;Hide behind a tree.  We are going to bash a queer.&quot;  He died from asphyxia after been given an horrific beating by those men.  When the Oireachtas makes something a crime, people believe that they have a licence to punish those whom they believe are committing it.  These were young men who grew up in a society that feared and hated homosexuality.  They took the law into their own hands, and all too often, people allowed the law to do its bashing for them.<\/p><p>A year after Declan Flynn's death, there were huge protests in Dublin, organised by a coalition of groups that were horrified at the lenient sentence given to his attackers.  From that, a movement was mobilised in Ireland.  The same year, we had the first Pride parade in Dublin.  People would no longer remain silent.  Pride, as we know, is now a festival of diversity, colour and inclusion, but we should not forget that it did not start out that way.  Pride festivals in many parts of the world today are still very much protests, with protestors who get attacked.<\/p><p>The date of 22 May 2015 is one that I will never forget.  It was the day of the marriage referendum, and the bench where Declan Flynn was killed at Fairview Park was covered with flowers and notes.  We think of him today on this anniversary, and of the very different Ireland that we live in now.  We also remember those who paved the way for this change.  We had many tireless campaigners over the decades such as the people involved with the Irish Gay Rights Movement.  We had the inspiring example of our own Senator David Norris, who brought his case for decriminalisation all the way to the Supreme Court 35 years ago and who never allowed defeat to dampen his determination or good humour.<\/p><p>We also owe a debt to Europe.  In 1988, the European Court of Human Rights decided in favour of Senator Norris in a landmark case.  That created the impetus and provided the momentum for us to change our laws.  Some years later, Senator Norris wrote a letter to <i>The Irish Times<\/i>and said that, for the first time, he felt like he was a full and equal citizen in his own country.  We should of course acknowledge, as he does, that he did not take the case on his own.  A dozen men who could not be named took the case with him.  Some of them are in the Gallery tonight.<\/p><p>So much has changed since then.  Three years ago, we helped to transform how this country was seen around the world when we voted so decisively for marriage equality, the first country in the world to do so by popular vote.  Last year, I had the privilege of being elected Taoiseach by this House, something that would have been unimaginable to politicians when I was born and perhaps seemed even impossible a few short years ago.<\/p><p>There are many people who helped change minds and change laws, and their contributions should also be remembered, people who fought for me and other gay people long before we fought for ourselves.  I think today of people who are no longer with us - champions like Dr. Ann Louise Gilligan, someone whose courage helped to change the laws in this country.<\/p><p>We have a long history of same-sex relationships in this country, and it is something we should be more aware of.  Indeed, Aristotle wrote that the Celts openly approved of same-sex relationships, and there are many references to such relationships in Irish mythology.  They are even provided for in Brehon law.<\/p><p>It is no secret that a number of patriots who were involved in founding our State, men and women, were also gay.  While the State's laws affected gay men in a legal sense, they had a chilling effect on lesbians as well.<\/p> <p> Today, the people I want to pay a special tribute to on behalf of the Government are the unknown heroes, the thousands of people whose names we do not know, who were criminalised by our forebears.  They are men and women of all ages who tried to live and love and be themselves in a society where their identity was feared and despised and who were aliens in their own country for their entire lives because they felt that love that dare not speak its name.  We cannot erase the wrong that was done to them but we can say that we have learned as a society from their suffering.  Their stories have helped to change us, as a country, for the better.  They have made us more tolerant, understanding and human.<\/p> <p> This evening, we mark the anniversary of the decriminalisation of homosexuality in Ireland and the progress made since then.  We have come a long way, we remember those who suffered and also acknowledge that we have much more to do.  There is always more to do, whether it is promoting LGBT equality on other parts of this island and around the world, combatting bullying in schools or the workplace or working to improve sexual health.  Harvey Milk reminded us of the challenge we face in society to \"break down the myths, destroy the lies and distortions.\"  He understood why it needed to be done.  We do it for ourselves, for others, and most of all, for the young.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900037#KK00300","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1529433000,"counter":448,"content":"<p>It is important that we take time to remember and reflect on key moments in our history, particularly when they mark a decisive move towards recognising the basic rights of citizens.  By any measure, the vote 25 years ago to decriminalise homosexuality is a turning point in modern Irish history.  It did not end discrimination, and we have not ended discrimination, but it set off a chain of actions which have changed our country unquestionably for the better.  The decriminalisation legislation was first and foremost a victory for a generation of exceptional campaigners.  They worked with extraordinary passion and no small amount of bravery to say loudly and proudly that Irish society must end the appalling stigma of criminality which gave force to an almost endemic homophobia.  The forerunner of what is today the National LGBT Federation was central to this.<\/p>  <p>  As with too many social changes in our country, the spark for change came from a terrible tragedy.  The murder of Declan Flynn in Fairview Park in September 1982, as the Taoiseach said, began a movement which suffered many setbacks but ultimately triumphed 11 years later.  The decision of the Supreme Court's majority in the case taken by Senator David Norris may well be the worst in that court's history and it is certainly and rightly its most infamous.  Even then, a mark of a brighter future could be found in the powerful dissent of Mr. Justice Niall McCarthy.  A deeply committed believer in the rights and republican motivation of the Constitution, McCarthy tore apart the idea that imported Victorian morality and legislation should negate the personal rights guaranteed to citizens of this Republic.  The subsequent judgment of the European Court of Human Rights put the focus squarely on the Oireachtas to act.  After unjustified delays, the programme for Government agreed between the Labour Party and Fianna F&aacute;il in 1992 stated clearly that change would be enacted.<\/p>  <p>  If one looks back at the D&aacute;il debates as well as general commentary, there are important lessons for us and signals for the progress which happened step by step in the following two decades.  It is wrong to see M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn as simply the line Minister who happened to be in charge of the Bill.  She made two major contributions.  First, she insisted that the House should see this as a human rights issue and not as some minor cleaning up of an out-of-date statute.  It was, she said, essential that we accepted the inherent human rights of homosexual couples.  Second, Ms Geoghegan-Quinn, with the backing of the Cabinet, rejected attempts to keep some inequality in the law.<\/p>  <p>  In Britain and other countries, decriminalisation was often done on a piecemeal basis and Governments made gestures to homophobia such as having an unequal age of consent.  Importantly, the European Court of Justice left the issue of the age of consent up to national law.  A proposal was made on Committee Stage by the Opposition in the D&aacute;il to have an unequal age of consent.  The Minister and many others rejected both the proposal and the logic behind it.  Some Members of the then Opposition filibustered it out of existence, to be fair, which meant it was never voted on.<\/p>  <p>  By deciding in 1993 to both decriminalise and have equality in this part of the law, a decisive tone was set which has been central to everything which has come since.  My party is proud to have enacted, with cross-party support, the Employment Equality Act 1998 and the Equal Status Act 2000, which extended equal protections to citizens irrespective of sexual orientation.  This legislation was recognised by the United Nations in 2001 as being among the most progressive in the world at the time.  The all-party approach, which has been central to progress, continued with the civil partnership legislation and, ultimately, the marriage equality referendum which was carried so overwhelmingly during the previous D&aacute;il.  We should all realise how important it has been that we have worked together in the past 25 years to allow voices in the LGBTI community to be heard in our national Parliament and to ensure a wide consensus.  In doing this, we have avoided the sort of damaging political debate seen in other countries.  The long-term impact of criminalisation of homosexual relations is something we must continue to address.  Even for the youngest generation, acknowledging one's sexuality far too often involves taking real risks.  We still have a journey to finish in providing the love and support the LGTBI community so badly needs.  We have to deliver health services, including mental health services which meet the needs of the community.<\/p>  <p>  We must redouble education efforts to both tackle discrimination and promote active support and understanding.  We fully support the all-party motion to pardon all those who were convicted under previous draconian legislation and we also believe that progress should be made on addressing the legislative gaps that still remain for gay couples who have children.<\/p>  <p>  Internationally, the last few years have demonstrated to anyone who wants to pay attention that the steady march of progress which was so casually assumed at the start of the 1990s has not come about.  In fact, this is a very dark moment for believers in human rights.  Basic freedoms are under threat and there are many countries where homophobia is actively promoted by governments.  Russia's active discrimination is being copied by others.  Many countries in Africa have an appalling and worsening record.  We have a duty not to turn our eyes away.  The repression of LGBTI people in these countries cannot be allowed to become a new norm which carries no consequences.<\/p>  <p>  Commemorating progress in our own country is an empty gesture if we do not speak up for those in other countries who are suffering.  In two weeks, the streets of Dublin will be filled with a joyous celebration of LGBTI identity.  Pride has become one of our capital's most inclusive and important annual events.  It is something which would have been barely imaginable in the Dublin of 1982 where a young man lost his life because he gave a small kiss on the cheek to another young man as he left a public house.  Declan Flynn and so many others who suffered because of the homophobia enabled by criminalisation must always be remembered.  They must serve as a warning to us of what happens when a society takes away basic rights from a minority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900038#LL00200","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1529433000,"counter":449,"content":"<p>The criminalisation of homosexual activity has had a long and cruel history.  The Taoiseach referred to Victorian statutes but it went back further than that.  In 1533, Henry VIII first made homosexual activity an offence, punishable by death.  It was first made a criminal offence in Ireland during the reign of Charles I and was punishable by death on conviction.  It was not until 1828 that the death penalty was removed for homosexual activity.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach referred to the Offences Against The Person Act 1861.  Under section 61, a person would not be sentenced to death but would be sent to prison for life.  In 1885, an amendment introduced by Henry Labouch&egrave;re allowed many men to be prosecuted if they were convicted of what is referred to as gross indecency.  That legislation resulted in the conviction and imprisonment of our own Oscar Wilde in England in 1895.<\/p>  <p>  I recognise that politicians have played a considerable part in decriminalising homosexual activity.  However, individuals who are not Members of the Oireachtas played a significant role and they too must be recognised.  One person in particular that we should recognise is Mr. Jeffrey Dudgeon who sought to challenge, before the European courts, the criminalisation of homosexual activity in Northern Ireland.  In 1976, he brought a case before the European Court of Human Rights, challenging the criminalisation in the North, and succeeded.  It was not just an abstract threat for Mr. Dudgeon.  This was a man who had been questioned by members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, RUC, for four and a half hours about his sex life.  I also acknowledge the role and presence of Senator Norris, who similarly took a case which went as far as the Irish Supreme Court.  The decision in that case, as Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin stated, is a blemish on the Supreme Court's record.  Having read it again, it is unfortunately the case that the Supreme Court failed in its duty to recognise that the enumerated and unenumerated rights of Irish citizens included the right to privacy and sexual privacy.  Senator Norris also needs to be commended.<\/p><p>M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn, other members of that Government, and the Oireachtas which voted in favour of the legislation also deserve to be commended, but at this time we must remember the thousands of men and women who could not live their lives openly and who were forced to live a lie by this criminalisation.

While gay people were front and centre of the campaign, it was the support of family and friends who helped make it happen.  I refer to mothers like Phil Moore who spoke mother to mother to M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn because she could see the everyday acts of exclusion which her son endured and which were then part of our social fabric.  It is fitting that mammies, daddies and families are remembered in the theme of his year's Pride festival which is \"We Are Family\".<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900039#MM00200","speaker":"1257"},{"type":"speech","time":1529433600,"counter":452,"content":"<p>T&aacute; m&eacute; ag roinnt ama leis an Teachta &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in agus an Teachta Louise O'Reilly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900039#MM00300","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"speech","time":1529433600,"counter":453,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an r&uacute;n t&aacute;bhachtach agus stairi&uacute;il seo.  Cuireann s&eacute; &eacute;ag&oacute;ir mh&oacute;r i gceart a rinne dam&aacute;iste dochreidte do dhaoine agus a rinne coirpigh de dhaoine nach raibh faic as an tsl&iacute; d&eacute;anta acu.  Homosexuality was decriminalised in the State on 24 June 1993.  The move to make homosexual acts no longer illegal followed a 16 year long legal battle which began in 1977, when Senator David Norris began a case against Ireland's draconian laws.  In 1988, he succeeded in the European Court of Human Rights, ECHR, on this case.  I acknowledge the work and campaigning of Senator Norris and also the other men who took the case with him.  I also acknowledge Belfast city councillor, Jeffrey Dudgeon, who took an equivalent case in the North, and the Minister of the day who brought forward the legislation, M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn.  That was done in a context where the homophobic murder of Declan Flynn in 1982, a catalyst for Ireland's Pride movement, was in recent memory, and where due to institutional conservatism the State failed to meet the healthcare needs of the LGBTI community.  The apology follows progressive moves in Britain and the North to enact what has been dubbed Turing's Law, which pardoned more than 49,000 men convicted under anti-homosexuality laws.  It was aptly named after Alan Turing, the mathematician who was criminalised and chemically castrated for being a homosexual man.  He committed suicide two years after his conviction.<\/p>  <p>  Decriminalisation was a watershed moment in Irish history and allowed the LGBTI community to be more open and public where previously it was harassed and criminalised by the State.  An apology for the overall treatment towards the LGBTI community is most welcome and it vindicates those members of the community who were told that on every moral level of society their identities were something that was wrong and of which they should be ashamed.  The apology to them is well deserved, as it is to those who had their lives irreparably damaged and violence visited upon them by individuals and the State.  It is more than appropriate that the State should apologise for that and for the fact that it mistreated the LGBTI community historically.<\/p>  <p>  The motion condemns this law to the history books, not as the shame of gay and bisexual men but as the shame of the State.  Those same men should have a clean record when asked and should not be obliged to disclose intimate details of their lives so that, in future, gay and bisexual men can live freer of State discrimination.  We believe the State should also commit to implementing hate crime legislation and a ban on so-called conversion therapies to protect the LGBTI community into the future.  Actions should follow the very genuine sentiment of this apology.<\/p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in had tabled an amendment, which we will not press, for the consideration of the Government.  We will not ask the House to divide on the issue.  We want the Government, however, to give consideration to the matters raised.  Lesbian, bisexual and transgender persons were persecuted by the laws also.  While indirectly affected, for many others the law sent a message of institutional discrimination that drove the LGBTI community underground, stigmatised its members and facilitated abuse in numerous ways.<\/p>  <p>  The second element of the proposed amendment seeks that the Government would establish a scheme whereby persons convicted under anti-homosexuality laws would be granted a pardon that expunges all convictions of that nature and enables all documentation carrying such a conviction to be corrected.  The motion's objective is a State apology towards those so convicted and we very much welcome it.  Homosexuality was only decriminalised 25 years ago, however, and there are still many in society who hold conviction records due to those laws.  That is the reason we call for exoneration also.  Those men deserve a clean slate and history should be corrected.<\/p>  <p>  The State's apology follows a move in Britain whereby men convicted under those laws are in a position to apply for a pardon from the Home Office.  The Taoiseach said the State does not have a system of criminal exoneration or pardon and that such an approach might be difficult due to third party involvement in the offence.  While I accept that, it is our opinion that such an approach could be introduced on a case-by-case basis.  Court records could be investigated and the Government should take such an approach.  Those who were convicted deserve vindication from the State harassment they received.<\/p>  <p>  In the spirit of the apology, it should be met with action, and I call on the Government to implement future protections for the LGBTI community.  The State is the only western European jurisdiction without hate crime legislation.  We also believe there is a need for a ban on conversion therapies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900039#MM00500","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"speech","time":1529433600,"counter":455,"content":"<p>I am delighted to be able to speak on the anniversary of the decriminalisation of homosexuality.  In 1993, the decriminalisation was a fantastic victory for Ireland's LGBTI community and for those progressives and campaigners who fought hard.  Ireland has changed since homosexuality was decriminalised in June 1993.  In the early years following decriminalisation, however, and until relatively recently, change was slow for those in the LGBTI community.  It was not slow because those from the gay and lesbian community and others did not fight, campaign, and agitate for progressive change.  It was slow because official Ireland at the time was still a deeply conservative place.  Throughout the years the fight for decriminalisation was going on and in the following years, this State remained a cold house for gay and lesbian people, as well as others who did not conform to conservative social codes.  It is impossible to quantify how many were affected and how many left the country because of Ireland's draconian laws.  That should never be forgotten.  On days like today we should remember those people.<\/p>  <p>  There is no point in pretending that some of the prejudices of that time do not linger on, were not passed on, and do not exist in this State currently.  It exists in how sex education is taught in some schools.  It exists in certain religious organisations which do not recognise same-sex families.  It exists in the exclusion of gay men from blood donation and in other areas.<\/p>  <p>  Recently, when Ireland played the USA in an international football friendly, the players wore rainbow-coloured shirt numbers to show support for LGBTI rights.

We must never forget the past, of course, but we must also recognise that once we learn from and act on the mistakes of the past, of which this State has made some very dark ones, then in this case particularly, the rainbows that will shine into the future will be brighter for it.  The decision of the people to embrace inclusivity and choice in the marriage equality referendum in May 2015 heralded a new dawn for Ireland and all of its people.  The most recent referendum has proved beyond doubt that the Irish people are committed to an inclusive and compassionate society.  The rainbows of tomorrow will shine much brighter than those which shone in the decades gone past.  They can shine for trust, pride, equality and inclusivity.  The days of marginalisation, shame and of criminalising our citizens for their sexuality and love are over and consigned to the past.<\/p>  <p>  I congratulate the Taoiseach and his Government on taking this initiative.  An apology is very much welcome but a further step needs to be taken.  Those homosexual men who were criminalised in the past for engaging in consensual acts should be exonerated.  It has been said that there are difficulties with providing exoneration but such difficulties should be overcome.  We have to right what were very terrible wrongs.  The Taoiseach or a responsible Minister should put on record in the House tonight that every effort will be made to expunge these convictions without delay.

That change has been dramatic but politicians and political parties can claim only part of the credit.  Civil society and civil organisations have been the pathfinders on this reform and none more so than Senator David Norris who is in the Chamber this evening.  The Labour Party can claim to have been at the forefront of all of the major campaigns for gay rights, but the eventual delivery at political level was on a unified, cross-party basis.<\/p><p>The words &quot;sexual orientation&quot; first appeared on the Statute Book in 1989 in the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act.  The then Minister for Justice, Ray Burke, of all people, agreed to a Labour Party amendment, supported by the Worker's Party at the time, to the Government Bill to broaden the definition from racial hatred to include sexual orientation, an amendment that his predecessor, Gerry Collins, stoutly refused to make.  We are celebrating today because the Fianna F&aacute;il-Labour Party coalition Government, of which I was very honoured to be a member as Minister for Health, delivered in 1993 on a Labour Party manifesto promise to abolish all criminal offences relating to consensual sex among same-sex couples.  It is hard to imagine now how delicately the subject was treated, but I remember those times.  It is amazing to consider that the then Minister for Justice, M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn brought two options to Government and left it up to her colleagues to choose which of them to adopt, with no statement of ministerial or departmental choice.  The second option, almost forgotten now, was that our legislation should legalise same-sex acts but only at 21 or 18, perhaps, rather than the age of heterosexual consent at the time.  It required, if I recall correctly, only a very short discussion at Cabinet to agree a principle of a common age of consent.  Ultimately, that legislation went through the D&aacute;il with just one voice dissenting, although the Fine Gael front bench under John Bruton was deeply divided on the age of consent issue and remained so afterwards.  One or two Deputies here will remember that another battle was fought subsequently when the aforementioned party leader wanted to raise the age of consent generally.<\/p><p>To our credit, that story was very different from the far more protracted and divisive debate that took place in Britain which was not finally resolved until 2001.  Of course, we know that male homosexual acts were decriminalised in England and Wales in 1967.  What is not so well-known is that in the year following the liberalisation of the law, the police brought more prosecutions under the new Act than had been brought under the previous one.  In the UK, the age of consent was set at 21 for homosexual acts, in contrast to 16 for heterosexual acts.  In 1994, the year after we changed the law here and equalised the age of consent, Ms Edwina Currie proposed an amendment to British legislation to introduce a common age of consent which was soundly defeated in the House of Commons.  The furthest they would go in Westminster was to lower the age of consent from 21 to 18 for homosexual acts.  As others have mentioned, a 1997 judgment of the European Court of Human Rights held that a different age of consent was a breach of European law.  Nonetheless, two efforts to introduce a common age of consent were vetoed in the House of Lords and a final effort was only passed using override powers under the Parliament Act.  Reform finally came to Britain in 2001, so we were ahead of our nearest neighbour on this matter.<\/p><p>Meanwhile, back home, my party's Equal Status Bill had been voted down by the Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats Government in 1992 when it was an Opposition Bill.  It was a Labour Party election manifesto commitment that became official Government policy when the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government was formed.  I had the honour in 2006 of introducing my party's Civil Unions Bill which I described at the time as providing a basic human right.  I recognise that it was only the first step to what we later achieved, namely, full marriage equality through a constitutional amendment rather than through legislative spearheading.  That popular endorsement of the concept of full civic equality was the right approach.  The sense of urgency demands consistent, insistent pressure, despite every parliamentary setback, and persistence eventually pays off.  I reintroduced the Civil Unions Bill when a new Government was formed which was again voted down.  Eventually, however, the Civil Partnership Bill became law in 2010 which paved the way for the marriage equality referendum in 2015.<\/p><p>A lot remains to be done.  When we are confronted with the shocking figures for young male suicide, I cannot help wondering how many of those lives have been destroyed by overwhelming insecurity and the terror of non-acceptance by family and community of a secret identity and sexual orientation.  It is, I believe, a greater proportion than the number of gay men and women among the population as a whole.  The ultimate goal must be complete acceptance, inclusion and normality and nothing less - the right to be treated as nothing out of the ordinary.<\/p><p>I want to finish my contribution by quoting from a message my colleagues, Senator Nash and Senator Bacik, received today from Mr. Seamus Dooley of the National Union of Journalists, which reads as follows:<\/p><blockquote>Just a short note of personal thanks to you both for your consistent and unswerving support on the issue of LGBT rights over many years.  There is every danger you may be drowned out by voices new to the topic but those of us who have been campaigning for decades are especially grateful to Labour Oireachtas members, past and present.  It would be good to mention Declan Flynn today.  His killing was a significant turning point and brought the LGBT community out onto the streets.

There were many rumours that elements in Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael would revolt, but that never happened.  We were here until very late in the evening.  I note that Senator Norris is here.

I note that one of them, Senator Norris, is here.  The reality is that such reforms were not won by the great and good of the political elite.  The political elite and the establishment often stood in the teeth of opposition to prevent progress for LGBT+ people.  They showed apathy, indifference and sometimes derision and hostility in the face of demands for homosexual law reform.<\/p>  <p>  I do not think we are here to celebrate what a great little country Ireland is in which to be gay or transgender.  The battle for these rights has not ended and cannot end.  According to a report that was written last year, some 56% of LGBT+ teenagers between the ages of 14 and 18 say they have self-harmed and 70% of them say they have seriously thought about ending their own lives.  The report shows that school continues to be a difficult place for many young LGBT+ people.  Just one in five of them believe they belong completely in their schools.  Less than half of them feel they have received positive affirmation of their identity in our society.  The report also shows that LGBT+ people continue to experience victimisation and harassment in their day-to-day lives.  Three quarters of them have been verbally abused and almost one third of them have experienced abuse in the past year.  Just one in three of them would feel safe showing affection to a partner in public.  Some 15% of them said they would never hold hands in public.  One in three LGBT+ people have been threatened with physical violence to their sexual identity, and one in five of them have had hurtful things written about them on social media.<\/p>  <p>  This cannot be a great country for the LGBT+ community, given that sex education in our schools is overwhelmingly based on one ethos and the great liberals of Fine Gael etc. have blocked a Bill that would ensure we get fact-based non-ethos sex education.  When young people hear during sex education that it is perfectly normal to be gay and to be attracted to a member of the same sex, we will have gone a long way towards heading off the psychological damage that the current system is doing to young people in our society.  As that system is often based on church denomination and domination of our schools, it imbues in young LGBT+ people a sense that they are less than normal.<\/p>  <p>  It cannot be a great little country for people in the LGBT+ community given that we are still dragging our feet on the enactment of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 and, as a consequence, heterosexual and homosexual couples do not have the same rights in relation to their children.  I remind the Minister, Deputy Zappone, that it was supposed to be enacted last year.  We were meant to have it within a year of the marriage equality referendum being passed.  The failure to enact this legislation means that the partners of women like Fiona Armstrong Astley are unable to register as a parent to their children.  This means they cannot get a passport for their children without, in effect, denying them joint parentage.<\/p>  <p>  Before we congratulate ourselves on how modern and wonderful we are, we should remember those who cannot afford to get the PrEP drug which prevents AIDS over the Internet, those who cannot access mental health services when they need them, those who are struggling with their sexuality in faith-based schools where being gay, bisexual or transgender is seen as less than normal and those who cannot register the birth of their children to get passports for them as a result of our failure to enact the necessary legislation.  While I celebrate and salute those who struggled down through the decades in very difficult circumstances and against the odds, we need to celebrate with a certain note of caution and in anticipation of the further changes that are needed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900041#OO00600","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1529434800,"counter":466,"content":"<p>We are marking the decriminalisation of homosexuality, which I see as a graphic confirmation of Frederick Douglass's famous aphorism that, \"Power concedes nothing without a demand.  It never did and it never will ... If there is no struggle there is no progress.\"  History demonstrates that decriminalisation was won following a struggle by the LGBTQ community that delivered change, just as similar movements delivered changes like marriage equality and the repeal of the eighth amendment.  The decriminalisation struggle was part of an international movement that used various political tactics including mass protest, civil disobedience, deliberate defiance of the law and the distribution of contraceptives and information.  The movement in Ireland gathered particular strength and momentum in the aftermath of the horrific murder of Declan Flynn.<\/p>  <p>  While I welcome the Government's apology, which is long overdue, it should go further.  Those who were prosecuted under what are now recognised as clearly barbaric laws should be pardoned.  We should remember that the lives of countless people were very badly affected by those laws.  People were forced to emigrate.  People lost jobs.  People's lives were destroyed.  I suggest that the State, in addition to providing a pardon, needs to undertake to address all of those who were convicted and harmed by the barbaric laws I have mentioned.<\/p>  <p>  It is striking that the LGBTQ community remains at the forefront of the struggle for social progress and equality.  One of the most striking features of the exit polls that were released after people had voted on the eighth amendment was that 91% of the LGBTQ community voted in favour of repeal.  The oppression faced by that community is not the same as it was before 1993, or even five or ten years ago.  Things have improved.<\/p><p>Nonetheless, there is oppression.  A heteronormative environment predominates in society, a situation where people's sexuality and gender are often not recognised or respected.  It is a scandal that young people - all young people born after 1993 - should still face that situation.  I am sure everybody is aware of the horrific statistics that speak to the discrimination and impact on mental health still felt by LGBTQ people, in particular young people.  One really stark statistic from BeLonG To is that one in three LGBTQ people aged between 14 and 18 years has attempted to take his or her own life because of bullying, rejection and pressure to hide who he or she is.  We need action.  A movement drove decriminalisation just like a movement drove marriage equality and repeal of the eight amendment.  It drove changes in backward attitudes, challenged prejudice and pushed conservative politicians to move, but we still need movement by the Government.  <\/p> <p> A lot of it starts with sex education.  We need objective sex education that is factually based, LGBTQ+ positive, not distorted by religious ethos.  I was disappointed by the Taoiseach's answer this morning on the money message.  It is worrying and indicates that the Government may decide to hide behind the idea of a money message and not provide it.  I appeal again to the Taoiseach in Pride month not to block this necessary legislation.  We need it to deal with the question of ethos and to have objective sex education provided in schools.  We also need action on the provision of trans healthcare to allow people to transition to their correct gender without the current medicalised model.  We need a model based on the principles of bodily autonomy and self-determination.  There is also a need for recognition of non-binary people and effective gender recognition for those under 18 years.<\/p> <p> I welcome the statement made yesterday by the Taoiseach, but it does not go far enough.  We need action on PrEP and PEP which are extremely effective in stopping the spread of HIV.  The Taoiseach has said there is to be a review.  I hope we can have it under the HSE in a year's time.  However, how many people will be affected during the course of that year?  We need action now to roll it out through the HSE.  <\/p> <p> I raise the case of same sex parents who still cannot be recognised on their children's birth certificates three years after the passage of the Children and Family Relationships Act.  They and their children have fewer rights than heterosexual families.  Last week the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Katharine Zappone, told me that an announcement was imminent by the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris.  We are still waiting.  I hope imminent means that we will hear it this week.  It is particularly appropriate, given that the theme of Pride is \"We are Family\".  Pride rightly is a celebration.  There is much to celebrate and I will be there celebrating.  However, it is also a protest which has its roots in the Stonewall riots.  Tens of thousands will be out on Saturday week celebrating but also protesting for action on all of these issues and a society without oppression and inequality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900041#OO00700","speaker":"1433","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1529435400,"counter":468,"content":"<p>I thank the Taoiseach for giving us the opportunity to contribute to the debate.

I also acknowledge and recognise the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Katherine Zappone, who courageously took a case with her partner to the High Court and the Supreme Court.  Those cases tell us a lot about Ireland and us.  In 1975 Mr. Dudgeon very bravely filed his first complaint with the European Court of Human Rights.  He had to go through such a painful process which Senator David Norris also had to go through over a period of 16 years on our behalf.  In a hearing in 1979 Mr. Dudgeon's complaint was declared admissible to be heard in the European Court of Human Rights.  That hearing was held in 1981 before 19 judges.  It was the first successful case before the European Court of Human Rights on the decriminalisation of male homosexuality.  It set the legal precedent that ultimately resulted in the Council of Europe requiring that no member state criminalise male or female homosexual behaviour.  I am sure Senator David Norris will acknowledge that the Dudgeon case served as a key precedent in the case of Norris <i>v. <\/i>Ireland which challenged the continued application of the same legislation in this jurisdiction.<\/p><p>What strikes me is that, moving forward from 1975 to 1981, this country and the judges knew that the situation was wrong.  They saw the result at the European Court of Human Rights, yet Senator David Norris had to start all over again, almost in parallel with the case taken in Northern Ireland.  In 1977 he instituted proceedings in the High Court seeking a declaration that sections 61 and 62 of the Acts of 1861 and 1885 should be repealed.  We had a High Court case first.  In his judgment in 1980 Mr. Justice McWilliam set out that &quot;one of the effects of criminal sanctions against homosexual acts is to reinforce the misapprehension and general prejudice of the public and increase the anxiety and guilt feelings of homosexuals leading, on occasions, to depression and the serious consequences which can follow from&quot; what he called &quot;that unfortunate disease.&quot;  He dismissed the case of Senator David Norris who was Mr. Norris at the time on legal grounds.  On 22 April 1983 the Supreme Court upheld the High Court's decision.  The various judgments have been referred to.<\/p><p>I want to put the date of 22 April 1983 in perspective.  It was just a few weeks after the death of Sheila Hodgers and prior to the insertion of the eighth amendment into the Constitution.  She had died in March that year because she had been refused medical treatment for cancer because she was pregnant and there was a foetal heartbeat.  In April the Supreme Court gave its judgment by majority decision.  It talked about the preamble to the Constitution, Christianity and so on.  It used the terms &quot;Christianity&quot; and &quot;Christian principles&quot; to back up a most unchristian attitude to the way people were treated.  Later that year the eighth amendment was inserted into the Constitution and a few months afterwards there was the death of Ann Lovett at a grotto in Granard.  I am only mentioning some of the things that happened around that time.<\/p><p>Senator David Norris had to continue to fight, although there were two beacons of light at the time, namely, the dissenting judgments of Mr. Justice Henchy and Mr. Justice McCarthy who, unfortunately, died prematurely.<\/p><p>Mr. Justice McCarthy stated that the Legislature is not free to encroach unjustifiably upon the fundamental rights of individuals or the family in the name of the common good.  Notwithstanding that, Senator Norris had to go forward to the court, to which he applied in October 1983.  We should remember that the eighth amendment had just been passed because that gives us an idea of the context and environment in which the case was taken.  Senator Norris complained about the contravention of his rights under Article 8.  It took until 26 October 1988 - 11 years after the proceedings were instituted in the national courts - for the decision to be made and it was a further five years before the law was changed in 1993.  The various cases lasted for 16 years, during which time the country struggled with a black and white view of the foetus and the foetal heartbeat that did not reflect reality.<\/p> <p> It is important to remember today the pain and loss of life, including the murder of Declan Flynn in September 1982, a year when so much happened in Irish society.  If this D&aacute;il had asked questions and demanded accountability at that time, many lives could have been saved, whether those lost through suicide or otherwise, and much pain and suffering avoided.<\/p> <p> If there is something to learn tonight, it is that we need to look at ourselves in this D&aacute;il and what is happening in our name.  How many other cases exist?  We see the case taken regarding the right to work for people living in direct provision.  We see a man who was in the mother and baby home in Tuam state on record that basic records relating to a family member are being refused.  As the Taoiseach sits here, and I appreciate he is listening, this is happening in our name.  The man to whom I refer has been in the High Court many times seeking basic information.<\/p> <p> We need to reflect and take different actions as we move forward.  I certainly cannot stand here and watch the mother and baby homes debacle and language being used over and over again to obfuscate, hide and confuse when we know exactly what happened.  If we are to learn anything, let us learn to use language honestly and in a straightforward fashion and to empower people to take part in a democracy.  We do not need to keep responding to court cases one after the other, as happened with the eighth amendment.  With the exception of the Circuit Court, women were brought before or had to go before every single court in the land and then to Europe and a United Nations committee.  That is what led to the changes relating to the eighth amendment and changes in the legislation on homosexuality.  It was not the D&aacute;il acting in a proactive manner.  That is the lesson for us tonight.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900042#PP00200","speaker":"1316","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1529436000,"counter":470,"content":"<p>I am happy to make a few brief remarks on this motion.  I support the idea of a State apology for past wrongs committed in its name.  The State has many things to apologise for.  Perhaps the Taoiseach is trying to emulate the late Pope, St. John Paul the Great, who in 2000 made an international plea for forgiveness for the wrongs committed in the name of the church.  It seems the State is almost 20 years behind the church on this issue.  However, we must acknowledge that the State is now taking actions or allowing actions to be taken for which it will also have to apologise at some point in the future.  I think of direct provision, the dozens of children who have died in State care in the past decade, the national housing scandal and the many other issues where human dignity is being trampled upon every day.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge that this particular apology is being offered on the 25th anniversary of the decriminalisation of homosexuality, which was a momentous and great event for many people.  I have in mind people like Senator David Norris who, although we may not share similar political or cultural views, is a man of integrity in his own right who has done much to remove the stigma that once attached to this issue.  It takes guts to stand against the prevailing cultural viewpoint.  We must face the past in all its complexity and not be afraid to admit where we may have been wrong.  Zeal for the common good may have inspired some to act with a less than generous spirit and that is to be regretted.<\/p>  <p>  All human beings, regardless of their sexuality, deserve respect simply because they are human beings.  The dignity of the human person is something we must treasure.  I fear, however, that for all our so-called enlightenment, it is something we are rapidly losing sight of.  The idea that a generation of adults lived their lives in fear simply because they were gay is a deeply sad human tragedy.  Nobody in this House can or should tolerate homophobic opinions.  I was accused of those abhorrent views simply because I took a different but sincerely held view on the issue of gay marriage.  It was a lazy and ridiculous insult that bore no relation to reality.  I said at the time of the referendum campaign that the loving relationships that exist between people of the same sex deserve to be protected.  I believe that from the point of view of the couple, such relationships do not differ from those of heterosexual couples either in emotional intensity or the depth of their value.  They can and do bear witness to the plurality of human relationships that exist in our society.  Thankfully, not only has society destigmatised this love, but it is something that can be celebrated and sealed in the public space since the introduction of civil partnerships several years ago.  That was my view then and it is my view now.<\/p>  <p>  While I do not agree with everything in the motion, in the sense that I would like to see more detail about some of the claims it is making, I am happy to support the view that the State should apologise to all those generations of gay men and women it has wounded through its laws.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900043#QQ00200","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1529436000,"counter":471,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the anniversary of this very important occasion marking the decriminalisation of homosexuality and I echo the sentiments expressed by previous speakers.  It is also important that we give special credit to the tireless work of individuals such as Senator David Norris and former President Mary Robinson and their incredible efforts over many years.  Credit is also due to the former Minister for Justice, Ms M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn, who introduced the legislation to allow for decriminalisation and an equal age of consent.  However, it should be noted that it took five years, from 1988 to 1993, to bring forward legislation to address the European Court of Human Rights ruling against Ireland that led to decriminalisation.  Recent events show us again that, in the main, progress on social issues like this often comes in spite of, rather than because of, the efforts of some in this Chamber.<\/p>  <p>  Decriminalisation, marriage equality and discrimination protections are the bare bones of what LGBTQ people needed in terms of ending legal discrimination.  If the Government is serious about protecting and empowering this community, it needs to focus on concrete and tangible issues and service provision, which currently falls far short of what is required.  Self-congratulatory speeches in the Chamber do nothing for the people in the Baggot Street MSM health clinic located less than 1 km from this building.<\/p><p>This is a facility that is unique in Ireland in the services it provides to men who have sex with men, but it is literally falling down around the ears of staff and patients.  The speeches do nothing with regard to the frankly baffling ongoing lack of progress on hate crime legislation, which makes it difficult to track and prevent homophobic and transphobic crime.  They do nothing to reassure people who are now being affected by the stalled commencement of sections of the Children and Family Relationships Act, which is causing untold distress and anxiety for LGBTQ people who are raising children.  Our contributions do nothing to reassure transgender children that their voices will be heard in the review of the gender recognition legislation or those waiting on lists for endocrinology services.  Our speeches will do little for those who are buying PrEP online and hoping it will not be seized by customs, which is particularly reprehensible given the alarming rates of new HIV infections being reported.<\/p> <p> I point these things out not to undermine the progress that the LGBTQ community has achieved in Ireland in the past two decades or the work being done by the Government.  Rather, I want to remind everyone in this House that we have a responsibility because of our position to rectify the wrongs that were done to this community in the recent past.  The legacy of this maltreatment resonates today.  Stigma remains and rears its ugly head in many ways.  Verbal and physical intimidation of LGBTQ people continues.  Homophobic, biphobic and transphobic bullying is rife in our schools.  Outmoded sex and relationship education that is of little use to LGBTQ people is still the norm in our schools and must be addressed urgently.  Most tragically, the rates of self-harm and suicide in this community remain alarmingly high.  The number of transgender individuals who have engaged in self-harm in particular is stark, with one report suggesting that upwards of 80% of members of this community have experienced suicidal ideation.<\/p> <p> I raised the issue of the poor placing of Ireland on the 2017 European region of the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association \"Rainbow Map&rdquo; with the then Minister for Justice and Equality in October of last year.  It is important to note that of 49 countries, Ireland is placed 15th in terms of the rights and freedoms of LGBTQ persons.  It is noteworthy that Malta, a country not dissimilar to Ireland in terms of its history, went from near the bottom to the top of the European chart when the new government there set out to address decades of neglect for LGBTQ people, proving that radical change in the legal and public policy areas and the lived experience can be brought about with political will in a very short timeframe.  I hope the Government would reflect on our comparatively poor ranking and recommit itself to making Ireland a world leader for protecting and enhancing the lives of LGBTQ people here at home.<\/p> <p> Another thing worth noting is the current programme for Government commitment to develop an LGBTQ strategy for equality.  While that is in the programme for Government, it seems there has been very little progress.  I understand the Department of Justice and Equality is looking at it but with the change of personnel in recent times, it seems nothing much has happened, and what the Department is doing is very limited.  This strategy is going to be critical in determining the future trajectory of LGBTQ equality on a cross-governmental basis.  This is what we have to be working towards, not to have this siloed in different Departments.  There is a need for a cross-departmental approach to be taken by Government and for one single person to have responsibility for driving that strategy.<\/p> <p> There is no doubt we have come a long way since 1993 but we still have a long way to go.  More must be done to ensure our LGBTQ family members and friends enjoy full and equal rights as citizens of this State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900043#QQ00300","speaker":"1222","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1529436600,"counter":473,"content":"<p>Over the past few hours we have had a timely and appropriate discussion in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Many Members have made moving and personal contributions.  The fact the Taoiseach was able to speak on this issue in such a personal way is quite a profound reflection of the changes that have taken place in Ireland over the past 25 years.<\/p>  <p>  As Minister for Justice and Equality, it is my responsibility to ensure that Ireland is a country where every person is valued equally and that no one faces discrimination simply as a result of who they are.  We now know and recognise the damage that discrimination of any kind can cause.  The experiences of gay men before the decriminalisation of homosexuality are a living example of how deeply people's lives can be damaged by discrimination.  Many generations of LGBTI people felt victimised and excluded from society as a result of those laws.  Today, the Government and the Houses of the Oireachtas are offering an apology for those laws: an apology for the effect those laws had on the lives of gay men; an apology for how those laws made the LGBTI community feel excluded, isolated and undervalued.<\/p>  <p>  As the Taoiseach has said, it is a commitment of this Government to prevent discrimination of any kind.  I, with the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, am committed to working with the LGBTI community to ensure their voices are heard and listened to in areas which affect their lives and the lives of their families.  In response to Deputy Shortall, I note the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, has begun work on the strategy, which is an important development at this time.  In response to Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire and Deputy Paul Murphy, I have taken careful note of the points raised and the issue surrounding the amendments.<\/p>  <p>  The path to equality has taken some time.  Along with the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993, significant milestones in the recognition of the rights of gay people are recorded in the motion, including the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act 1989, the Equal Status Acts 2000 to 2016, the Employment Equality Acts 1998 to 2016, the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010, the marriage equality referendum, the Marriage Act 2015, the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 and the Gender Recognition Act 2015.  This legislation protects the rights of LGBTI people, recognising their unique needs as members of society.<\/p>  <p>  I know those in the LGBTI community have had to work hard to have their rights recognised and to ensure their rights are protected.  There are important lessons to be learned from how discrimination has affected this community in the past, lessons which can inform how we address discrimination in the future.  I am committed to ensuring that all people in Ireland feel they are free to live their lives as they choose, regardless of ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, disability or ability.  It is now 25 years since the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 was passed.  Our society has changed hugely in the meantime.  The Ireland of today is a more open society.  LGBTI people are free to express their identity without fear of losing their jobs or their families.  We are a young State in relative terms.  We are still moving forward to achieve the type of progress that is both appropriate and necessary.  Ensuring a free and fair society is an ongoing responsibility for the Government and, indeed, for all of us in these Houses.  Human rights must be established and protected.  As Minister for Justice and Equality, I, alongside the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, and my Government colleagues, pledge to work to ensure that all members of our society feel they are valued and that the legislation in place will protect all against discrimination.<\/p> <p>We can and should learn the lessons of the past 25 years as to how a society can advance to become more inclusive and diverse and, most importantly, how it can be a society of which we can all be proud.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900044#RR00200","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1529437200,"counter":475,"content":"<p>That concludes the debate.

I thank the officials and the Chair for allowing me to come back in.  We have come to the Minister, Deputy Ross, numerous times on this Bill.  Ar an gc&eacute;ad dul s&iacute;os, ba mhaith liom a r&aacute;, the reason we are back here is that the Bill was recommitted and the reason for that is the approach of the Minister.  The Attorney General described his judicial appointments Bill as a dog's dinner and this Bill is a sow's breakfast.  Normally, sows eat everything and this is a bit of everything.  It is a mishmash.  It is readjusted and renamed.  Different amendments were tabled by the Minister himself which we were not allowed to discuss on Committee Stage.  Deputy Michael Healy-Rae and I are still awaiting an apology for being described as road traffic terrorists.  I am still waiting for an apology, not for me for being called a you-know-what, but for my daughter, whom the Minister knows well.  He should know better than to use that kind of language in company.  However, I am big enough to understand that we are not going to get that.<\/p>  <p>  What we should have, at least, is some meaningful engagement from the Minister regarding what he is trying to achieve.  We are all with him on many aspects of road safety.  Goodness knows, we have had a terrible past week to ten days on our roads.  Many of the issues the Minister is talking about here, however, were not involved at all.  He has tunnel vision in the direction of soft targets when he should be dealing with a plethora of issues affecting driving conditions across all forms of transports, from sulkies, which are illegal, to bicycles, cars, vans, buses, trains, trams and taxis.  The longer the Bill goes on, the more we hear.  This week, the train drivers and rail worker unions have appealed for their own safety to be protected while they are at work.  I condemn out of hand anyone who attacks any person on public transport.  Yesterday morning, we saw people consuming excessive amounts of alcohol before boarding planes.  Public servants have a tough job and they must be supported.  The legislation, however, is not supportive.  It is draconian, discriminatory and inherently unfair to L plate and young drivers, especially in the rural areas represented by myself, Deputy Healy-Rae and our group of Members.<\/p>  <p>  There are long delays for driving tests.  I have the details here.  Even where one has an appointment for a test, it may be dismissed on arrival for the silliest of reasons.  If one fails, there should be advisory fail matters in the way there are in the NCT process for certain mechanical defects in a vehicle.  I am trying not to be repetitive.  Young people have to take lessons.  They have to procure a vehicle, which is an expense, and insurance costs are massive.  It is obligatory to take 12 lessons, a measure which I support.  Young people are now much better prepared for the driving test than I was when I took mine all those years ago.  Certainly, they are more prepared than those who benefited from the amnesty when licences were given out to people without a test because the numbers were too great to deal with.  The Minister will not accept amendments, but he will have to put in place some mechanism to allow people to get a test within a reasonable time, namely, within two or three weeks.  In my county, there is a five-month waiting list, and if something is wrong, a person might be sent home and the test cancelled.  I condemn totally those who fail to turn up for scheduled tests without notifying the test centre in advance.  That is a waste of time.  There is a serious problem, however, with a testing regime in which a person cannot get a test for five months, and if he or she fails for what ought to be an advisory matter, that person prohibited from reapplying for one month.<\/p>  <p>  Tomorrow is the last day of the leaving certificate for most people.  Many of those young people will want to get expertise and a taste of the career they might wish to pursue in college or elsewhere.  They might like to get work experience.  They can get it given the huge shortages of labour in the hotels sector and among contractors and farmers.  How will they get to work, however?  Cad a dh&eacute;anfaimid feasta gan adhmad?  T&aacute; deireadh na gcoillte ar l&aacute;r.  Cad a dh&eacute;anfaimid feasta gan charr?  T&aacute; daoine ag fanacht sa t&iacute;re, abandoned, if they do not have a car and live in Hollyford, Carrick-on-Suir, Emly or, indeed, in the villages in the hinterland of Nenagh.  They will be unable to get to work or to college without a car.  They cannot walk outside as one can from Leinster House to find hundreds of taxis and dozens of buses.  If a person is stuck, he or she can use his or her card to take a Dublin bike to cycle home.  There is the DART to take a person out to the Minister's country in Bray.  We do not have that in Tipperary.  As such, the legislation is inherently unfair and it discriminates against rural dwellers and L plate drivers.<\/p>  <p>  My children and those of my neighbours want to get on in life and continue their education, get a taste of work or of the careers on which they might like to embark.  The Minister, however, is condemning them to a life of wastefulness.  Their guardians, parents or siblings cannot leave work to be their accompanying drivers at 7 a.m. or at 10 p.m. coming home.  I am all for curfews.  I do not want them driving around recklessly to discos or parties.  I want them to be able to get valuable work experience and to facilitate their families who are hard-pressed as it is.  Many people in my county experienced savage rent increases from our reckless county council only this week.  They are trying to put their kids through education to give them a good start in life.  T&uacute;s maith, leath na hoibre.  A good start is half the job.  The Minister is not listening to any of us or to what we are saying.  I am opposed fundamentally to the Minister condemning the young people of rural Ireland to a lesser ability to achieve their full potential in life.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900045#SS00800","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1529437200,"counter":483,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Dublin Fire Brigade: Motion [Private Members]","time":1529437800,"counter":484,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900046#TT00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1529437800,"counter":485,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>&quot;That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann:recognises that:<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the Dublin Fire Brigade (DFB) has been providing crucial ambulance services to the citizens of Dublin City and County since 1898;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; DFB now operates with life-saving equipment and over 800 trained firefighter\/paramedics working to provide immediate medical assistance to members of the public in need of treatment, 24\/7, 365 days a year; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; staff must be lauded for their ability to respond to thousands of emergency calls across the capital every year;<br \/><br \/>accepts that:<br \/><br \/>&mdash; there are concerns that the Health Service Executive is seeking to remove the delivery of Dublin's ambulance service from DFB and instead merge the service with the National Ambulance Service;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; such a proposal could have a huge negative impact on the delivery of services from the DFB call centre; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; removing any element of DFB's fire-based Emergency Medical Service (EMS) system will have an adverse effect on safeguarding those in our community; and<br \/><br \/>calls on the Government to commit to:<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the provision of full support for the almost 1,000 personnel employed, to maximise service delivery and provide greater efficiency to protect those in fire stations across Dublin who provide a full-time fire, rescue, and ambulance service which serves the whole community;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the design of a direct funding mechanism and the required additional capacity due to the increased population, to allow DFB to continue to operate all areas of their fire-based EMS; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the full retention of ambulance services provided by DFB across Dublin.&quot;<\/blockquote><p>I wish to share time with my colleagues, Deputies Haughey, Darragh O'Brien and Curran.

I suppose that makes its own statement to those in the Gallery, those watching outside and those reading the accounts of this debate, in demonstration of the seriousness or otherwise with which the Government takes this motion from this side of the House.<\/p><p>My colleagues on this side of the House hope that this will be the last occasion on which this matter needs to feature on the D&aacute;il agenda.  My colleagues, Deputies Darragh O&rsquo;Brien and Se&aacute;n Haughey in this House, and Senators Clifford-Lee and Ardagh in the Seanad, have raised this matter repeatedly and will continue to raise it because no progress has been made.<\/p><p>No progress has been made in spite of the subject being previously raised during Private Members' business, Topical Issues and parliamentary questions, and that is merely within the Houses of the Oireachtas.  No progress has been made in spite of a review group and an expert panel having been established to resolve the issue.  That expert panel was made up in part of eminent servants of this city and State and the great bulk of its findings were accepted by all sides to this discussion with very little left to settle.<\/p><p>The Minister for Health, in correspondence, has suggested that there are no plans to allow Dublin Fire Brigade EMS to be taken over by the HSE.  The Minister is also suggesting that he will support calls to consider future funding mechanisms.  I welcome both of these sentiments.  However, so much time has passed on this issue, and so many reviews and reports have been done without any action that the Minister, who is not here, will forgive me for being sceptical.  Perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, will accept my scepticism in his place.<\/p><p>I have to ask why the Minister of State at the Department of Health is even responding for the Government on this issue and ask why the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government is not here in her place because Dublin City Council is funded in part by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  The Dublin Fire Brigade and ambulance service ought to be funded by that Department but it is not, and on this side of the House we will not be satisfied until the Minister of State present here tonight confirms that the future funding mechanisms that the senior Minister has in mind refer to the transfer of the funding of Dublin Fire Brigade and ambulance service from the Department of Health to the Department of Housing Planning and Local Government.  The Taoiseach, in his time as Minister for Health, reinforced this fact in a Seanad debate in 2015, only three years ago, when he stated:<\/p><blockquote>[T]he Dublin ambulance service has been provided by Dublin Fire Brigade under fire services legislation.  Statutory responsibility for this service, therefore, rests [...] within the remit of my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.<\/blockquote><p>However, here we have the charade again of where the Minister for Health and his Minister of State are taking the issue.<\/p><p>This is about a number of key issues, not least of which are patient safety and a patient-centred approach to emergency response.  We support the overriding importance of a person-centred response by emergency services in Dublin and that is why we so strongly support the retention of the fire-based emergency medical service in the hands of Dublin Fire Brigade and ambulance service.<\/p><p>When we examine the Government's assertion that there is no threat to Dublin Fire Brigade and ambulance service, the facts do not support it.  The passage of time does not support it.  Dublin Fire Brigade certainly does not support the assertion.  Events do not support it.  Action does not support it.  Ministerial and Government inaction, unfortunately, reinforces the opposite view.<\/p><p>In spite of the Minister's reassurances, there is compelling evidence that the retention of this service within Dublin City Council and, therefore, within the realm of Dublin Fire Brigade is under threat.  We recall the HSE plan in 2013 - the first attempt to absorb the services of Dublin Fire Brigade into the HSE.  An implementation plan was drawn up &mdash; that is an incontrovertible fact.  However, for the fact that its existence was leaked to a national newspaper, we do not know where we would be regarding this argument.<\/p><p>Around the same time, Dublin City Council and the Dublin Fire Brigade were put on notice effectively that funding for the service was in question.  The demand by the HSE to have one national call centre dispatching ambulances and fire services was the next attempt to strangle Dublin Fire Brigade.  The idea that a chief fire officer would cede control, and more importantly, responsibility for responding to and dispatching personnel to incidents makes no common sense.  Case history informs us that the national call centre does not always dispatch the Dublin Fire Brigade and ambulance service, even when it is more proximate to an incident than other services.  For that reason, the Minister is correct that current call-taking arrangements represent an unacceptably high patient safety risk.<\/p><p>Added to this is a recent warning from SIPTU of staffing issues in the National Emergency Operations Centre, NEOC.  The headquarters of the NEOC is apparently down 35 workers.  If one has an agency of State, that initiated a process, developed that process into an implementation plan for absorbing another service into its own realm and won the support of the so-called custodians of the very same service they were meant to uphold and protect, controlling the budget and unwilling to divest itself of it, which then wants to control the very means by which Dublin Fire Brigade and ambulance gets to do its work, which is through calls, then there are at least grounds for suspecting that someone does not want one around.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900046#TT00200","speaker":"1311"},{"type":"speech","time":1529437800,"counter":486,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this motion which aims to ensure that the full emergency services provided by Dublin Fire Brigade across the city and county remain as they are.<\/p>  <p>  Dublin Fire Brigade, as the House will be aware, has been providing ambulance and emergency services for 120 years.  It is worth putting on the record my own personal appreciation for the work that the men and women of Dublin Fire Brigade carry out on a daily basis.  Too often, we take them for granted.  We see incidents where they put their lives at risk to look after the welfare of the people of this city and I want to acknowledge the work they do.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister has indicated that there is no threat to the future of Dublin Fire Brigade and the ambulance service it provides but the evidence, as put forward by my colleague, indicates the contrary.  Last year Dublin Fire Brigade ambulance service responded to 115,000 calls.  I do not want to get bogged down in the numbers but to make the point that the level of service being operated by Dublin Fire Brigade ambulance service in the capital is growing significantly year on year.<\/p>  <p>  The ambulance service operated by Dublin Fire Brigade benefits from the fact that the firefighters are also all trained paramedics.  There are 830 of them.  That is quite different than many other ambulance services.  We have seen reports on the fire service and ambulance service indicating that the standard in Dublin is second to none.  Internationally, it is acknowledged to have one of the highest standards.<\/p>  <p>  When we look at the level of funding provided, we must question the Government's actions.  In 2017, the National Ambulance Service saw an increase in its funding.  I know this because I asked the relevant parliamentary questions at the time.  However, Dublin Fire Brigade ambulance service did not receive such an increase.  In fact, it did not receive an increase in 2017, 2016 or 2015.  That leads me to ask the following question.<\/p><p>At a time when the National Ambulance Service is seeing an increase in funding, at a time when the activity, requirement, demand and call-out activity is growing, why is it that the ambulance service operated by Dublin Fire Brigade, funded by the HSE through Dublin City Council is not seeing a marked increase in funding as well?  There is an issue there and while the Minister has said it is not his intention and there is no plan to merge the ambulance services, he is not demonstrating it in terms of the funding levels.  The questions have to be asked and I specifically ask the Minister of State to look at them.<\/p> <p> Dublin Fire Brigade operates a fleet of 12 ambulances at the moment as I understand it, which is four fewer than it should have.  There is a funding deficit.  Some of the deficit is clearly made up by the city council but it is insufficient in terms of direct funding from the HSE.  Why is it that the HSE is funding Dublin Fire Brigade ambulance services?  Why is it not the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment directly rather than the HSE?  If those issues were addressed they would allay some of the fears but the concern, as I have demonstrated clearly, is that the funding level to Dublin Fire Brigade's ambulance service has not kept pace with the National Ambulance Service over the last few years.  Those concerns need to be addressed in the Minister of State's response to assure the members of Dublin Fire Brigade who are providing an excellent service for the people of our city that the service they are providing will be maintained, enhanced and supported by the Members of this House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900046#TT00300","speaker":"1298","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1529438400,"counter":488,"content":"<p>Dublin Fire Brigade provides emergency ambulance services in Dublin city and county by arrangement between Dublin City Council and the National Ambulance Service of the HSE.  Dublin Fire Brigade has a proud tradition of providing the fire-based ambulance service in the capital.  International best practice indicates that combining fire rescue and emergency services greatly improves the response to a crisis.  A total of 830 Dublin Fire Brigade firefighters, men and women, are trained paramedics.  They are available to provide immediate, emergency medical assistance and the benefits of this integrated service should not be underestimated.  Dublin Fire Brigade has been providing the ambulance service in the Dublin area since 1898.<\/p>  <p>  Dubliners are rightly proud of their fire brigade and ambulance service and regard it with great affection.  The chief executive of Dublin City Council, Owen Keegan, has stated that he wishes to see a transfer of all call taking and dispatching for ambulances to the national control centre in Tallaght.  He has also stated that this has been agreed by the chief executives of the other Dublin local authorities and the HSE.  Three reports have been commissioned recently on the ambulance service: the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, report published in December 2014, a joint review by the HSE and Dublin City Council of the Dublin ambulance service, and the independent Lightfoot Solutions review.  I suggest that there are flaws in all of these reports and conflicts of interest in some cases.  The Minister of State should be very conscious of that.  The then Minister for Health, Deputy Leo Varadkar, informed the Seanad on 10 March 2015 that staff in Dublin Fire Brigade would be fully consulted before any changes were implemented.  Such a consultation has clearly not taken place.  Dublin City Council recently passed a motion to the effect that the elected members in all the Dublin local authorities and on the regional assembly should be consulted about any proposed changes.  During the same debate on 10 March 2015, the then Minister, Deputy Varadkar, also clarified the position on statutory responsibility for the Dublin ambulance service.<\/p>  <p>  The provisions of the motion speak for themselves.  There are two statutory providers of emergency ambulance services and they should both receive equal treatment and parity of esteem.  Concerns in the HIQA report in particular have to be addressed.  The solution is not to transfer the call taking and dispatch functions from the Dublin Fire Brigade centre in Townsend Street to the National Ambulance Service centre in Tallaght.  In my view, a technical solution, using technology and IT to bring about the necessary co-ordination between the call centres is possible and should be positively examined.<\/p>  <p>  There is also the major issue of governance in Dublin Fire Brigade.  It must be accepted that Dublin Fire Brigade services are provided under fire services legislation.  Therefore, statutory responsibility for these services rests with Dublin City Council and ultimately the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy.  The HSE and the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, must look at this governance issue and accept what I have just said on that.  As a result of the governing practice that is in place, Dublin Fire Brigade is being starved of resources and capacity and this is putting citizens at risk.  A direct funding mechanism for Dublin Fire Brigade must be put in place.  The expert panel on pre-hospital emergency care services in Dublin published its report in December 2015.  These findings should be implemented in order to resolve the problems.  Why is there no political will to do this?  Why has this issue dragged on for so long?<\/p>  <p>  Consultation is required under the provisions of section 32 of the Local Government (Dublin) Act 1993 which states that there must be consultation with local councillors in the four Dublin local authorities and the regional assembly.  These procedures have not been followed in this case.<\/p>  <p>  I will make one concluding remark.  Our motion is no reflection on the personnel working in the National Ambulance Service.  All we are asking for is that there is parity of esteem between the two statutory agencies in the delivery of these services.  If it is not broken do not fix it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900047#UU00200","speaker":"1360"},{"type":"speech","time":1529438400,"counter":489,"content":"<p>I welcome the members of Dublin Fire Brigade who are here with us this evening in the Gallery and I welcome the many that I met earlier today.  It has been a pleasure for me over the last four or five years to work with both current and retired members of Dublin Fire Brigade.  My colleagues have covered in detail a lot of the items within our motion.  I ask the Minister of State directly that this be the last time that we debate this issue.  I have raised this on numerous occasions.  We need to make sure that a clear message goes out from the D&aacute;il tomorrow and this evening that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann supports the operation of Dublin Fire Brigade, the Dublin Fire Brigade ambulance service and the fire-based emergency medical system.<\/p>  <p>  What we have in Dublin is being replicated in other cities across Europe and we have a city manager and people within the HSE tinkering with something that is working.  Worse than tinkering, they are starving it in certain instances.  My colleague, Deputy John Curran, has dealt with the funding aspects of the matter.  We should be further expanding Dublin Fire Brigade's role within the greater Dublin area and looking at how it can be expanded into our other cities across the country, not restricting it.  This is not a question of the National Ambulance Service or Dublin Fire Brigade.  It never has been and those who seek to sow those divisions are being disingenuous at best.  This is about the safety of the citizens of Dublin city and county.  No more can we allow the foot dragging from this Government and the last Government.  This is the last time this should be addressed.  We need to ensure that Dublin Fire Brigade is resourced properly and that a clear statement goes out that there will be no unpicking of its independence and autonomy.  We cannot have a system such as has been proposed in the HIQA report.  I wrote a detailed letter to the Department of Health on 27 March 2018 highlighting a number of my concerns around the expert report and I use the word \"expert\" loosely in this regard.  That letter has not been responded to yet.  Answers given under freedom of information to private citizens contained more information than answers I got by way of parliamentary questions and that is simply not acceptable.<\/p>  <p>  I want to move on in a positive vein in one respect because we want this issue resolved.  I welcome the fact that the Government will not only not be opposing this Fianna F&aacute;il motion but it will be supporting it.  The Minister of State might confirm that in her response.  If that is the case that is a significant step forward.  I spoke with the Minister, Deputy Harris, this evening and I suggested to him that after the planning of this motion I would sit down with him to work on the next steps forward.  Our colleagues in Dublin Fire Brigade want to know what will happen next.  A motion and debate in the D&aacute;il and ventilation of the issues are good and well but the Fianna F&aacute;il Party and I want to see a roadmap forward to investing in Dublin Fire Brigade.  At the moment there should be 133 firefighters and paramedics and 36 officers on duty at all times maintaining front-line fire appliances.  However, there were only 129 and 29 officers due to start work last night.  There is a deficit in staff and appliances.  We need at least another four ambulances within the service and we should be proud of the service that is there.  This is a win win for the Government and the D&aacute;il.<\/p><p>We need to send out a clear statement from this House that Mr. Owen Keegan and the executive of DCC do not run our fire service and they do not make policy.  The D&aacute;il makes policy and makes decisions on behalf of the people who elect us.  Thousands of families in Dublin, including my own, have had experience of being looked after by the members of the DFB.  The members of the fire brigade and their families do not deserve to be denigrated, to have funding withdrawn, or to have their service run down.  They are immensely committed to their job and they have no down time whatsoever.  They look after us 365 days a year, 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  It behoves Government to look after them now and for the D&aacute;il to speak with one voice to ensure we invest in Dublin Fire Brigade, its staff, crews and paramedics.  I hope the D&aacute;il agrees unanimously with the Fianna F&aacute;il motion and early next week moves forward with an implementation plan to ensure this service remains one of the best in Europe and that we further invest in the service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900047#UU00300","speaker":"1228","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1529439000,"counter":491,"content":"<p>I welcome the men and women from Dublin Fire Brigade who are in the Visitors' Gallery.  I am taking this motion on behalf of the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, who, unfortunately, cannot be here this evening.  It is not any criticism of the Minister because I have a detailed reply to the Deputies and we may be able to settle some of the problems we face.<\/p>  <p>  On behalf of the Minister, I accept the motion.  I join Deputies across the House to commend the DFB for the excellent ambulance service it provides to the people of Dublin.  The Dublin fire brigade has a long and very proud tradition of emergency medical service provision, which the Government is pleased to acknowledge.  I assure the House that there are no plans afoot to remove responsibility for the delivery of Dublin's ambulance services from the fire brigade.  I fully agree that any such move would have a negative impact on service delivery.  Services would likely grind to a halt because the NAS does not have the capacity to take over the provision of emergency ambulance services in Dublin.  Even if we wanted all such ambulance services to be provided by the NAS, that would not be achievable.<\/p>  <p>  We are dependent on the approximately 800 men and women, dual qualified paramedic firefighters, who comprise the DFB workforce.  I am happy that the fire brigade's Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council, PHECC, registered paramedics are available to the HSE through a service arrangement.  That workforce is a wonderful resource for all of us.  They have been trained at the expense of the State and there is no reason whatsoever to think that the State might decide that we no longer require their expertise and their services.  It is difficult to recruit trained paramedics; as in other medical disciplines we struggle to retain paramedic staff.  Over recent years we have provided increased funding to the NAS to recruit and train additional paramedics and we will need to do so for many years to come.  Even if we had unlimited funding, we would be unable to recruit at the level we require and, therefore, we need to do so on a phased basis.  With the best will in the world, the NAS could not recruit at the level necessary to displace the DFB paramedic workforce and so cannot, and will not, take ownership of Dublin emergency ambulance service provision.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is mindful of the great service that has been provided down through the years by the fire brigade and long may that service continue.  As a former Lord Mayor of this city, it was a privilege to work with DFB.  Its members were the escorts of the Lord Mayor and continue to do their duty on a daily basis to support the Lord Mayor in his or her role.  The fire brigade provides emergency ambulance services in Dublin city and county by arrangement between DCC and the HSE.<\/p>  <p>  The NAS also provides some emergency capacity in the greater Dublin area, as well as non-emergency patient transport.  Over the years, funding issues have arisen between the HSE and DCC.  It is timely to look again at how the funding arrangements between the two organisations work in an effort to ensure the service is put on a sound financial footing.  The city council should be appropriately reimbursed for ambulance services provided on behalf of the HSE.  In recent times there has been much improved co-ordination between the NAS and the fire brigade, particularly in respect of operations and clinical governance.  I want both organisations to continue to work together to develop and improve ambulance service provision.<\/p>  <p>  In that regard, we must address the current patient safety risk that prevails because of the existence of two separate call and dispatch centres in Dublin.  Emergency 999 or 112 ambulance calls made in Dublin are transferred by the emergency call answering service to either the Dublin Fire Brigade east region communication centre or to the NAS's national emergency operations centre, NEOC, depending on where in Dublin the call originated.  The NEOC in Tallaght is a state-of-the-art ambulance call centre which uses up to date digital telephony technology and bespoke computers to aid dispatch.  The technology allows staff to have visibility of all NAS ambulance resources and, therefore, it can be guaranteed that the nearest available resource will always be dispatched by the service.  The NEOC takes calls for the entire country apart from the Dublin area, and it also has a resilience site in Ballyshannon.  If there are any difficulties in Tallaght for example, a power outage, the Ballyshannon centre will take over all call taking and dispatch operations.<\/p>  <p>  A clinical hub went live in the NEOC in March 2018 and provides an alternative model of care for some patients.  Certain low acuity calls are now transferred to the hub and the caller receives medical advice from nurses over the phone, and this may remove the need to dispatch an ambulance.  Emergency calls for ambulances in the Dublin area are managed from the Dublin Fire Brigade control room in Townsend Street, Dublin.  Fire brigade personnel take calls and dispatch resources for both ambulance and fire services.  However, the analogue telephony system in Townsend Street is outdated and in need of replacement; calls are dispatched over the radio.<\/p>  <p>  DFB has 12 ambulances and 21 fire appliances are available to be dispatched as first responders.  In cases where the fire brigade does not have a resource available or where the resources are deemed to be too far away the call may be stacked to await a resource or telephone contact is made with the NEOC with a request that the NAS responds to the call.  While mechanisms to transfer calls between the call centres exist this, by its nature, carries inherent risks and can give rise to delays, with potentially adverse implications for patients.  In addition, each provider only has visibility of its own resources and, therefore, it is not possible to ensure the nearest available resource is dispatched to emergency calls in the Dublin area.  Data from the NAS indicates that DFB requests for its assistance can be in the region of 1,000 per week.  Sometimes the fire brigade passes calls in batches which presents challenges to the NAS in prioritising batched calls.  This highlights that change is required in ambulance call taking and dispatch arrangements in Dublin.<\/p>  <p>  Since the 1990s a number of reports have raised concerns about the existence of two call and dispatch centres in Dublin.  The 1993 report of the review on ambulance services proposed that the two organisations should function as a single entity using a single command and control facility.  A subsequent review was conducted in 2001 and that also promoted a single command and control centre and no duplication of services.  In 2007, the city council and the HSE conducted a comprehensive review which identified 15 key recommendations.  These were underpinned by the principle that any member of the public or health professional should have a single point of contact with the emergency ambulance services serving Dublin city and county and that they receive a response from the nearest appropriate emergency care resource in the shortest time.<\/p><p>Once again, an integrated command and control unit was advocated.  In 2014, a review of the pre-hospital emergency care services was undertaken by the Health Information and Quality Authority.  The report found that the NAS and DFB were not integrated, and identified poor levels of co-operation between both entities which was not always in the best interests of the patient.<\/p> <p> I am pleased to note that in the following review in 2017, HIQA found evidence of a much better relationship between the NAS and the fire brigade.  However, HIQA identified a high risk in respect of Dublin ambulance services stemming from overall capacity deficit and arrangements for call-handling and dispatch.  HIQA warned that the current arrangements in place can result in high numbers of potential life-threatening calls being queued by DFB rather than receiving an immediate response.  I imagine the House will agree that these successive independent reports over the decades highlight the urgent need for change in the call and dispatch function for ambulance services in the Dublin region.<\/p> <p> The NAS has undergone a significant process of reform and modernisation in recent years.  Several important service initiatives and developments have taken place.  The significant reform programme aims to reconfigure the management and delivery of pre-hospital emergency care services, and includes plans to develop alternative pathways of care such as hear-and-treat clinical hubs and see-and-treat models as well as transferring patients to alternative destinations for treatment.<\/p> <p> I want the people of Dublin to reap the benefits of these developments and innovations.  However, as things currently stand, they do not.  Dublin is the only area in the country where we cannot guarantee that the nearest available resources will be dispatched.  Callers from certain parts of Dublin do not have access to clinical hubs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900048#VV00200","speaker":"1307","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1529439600,"counter":493,"content":"<p>Under Standing Order 144, the proposers have 20 minutes and the Government has ten minutes.

Perhaps one or other of them might be in the House to wrap up the debate.<\/p>  <p>  I echo the comments of others.  The men and women of Dublin Fire Brigade save lives and we cannot say that often enough.  They do so by putting their own lives at extraordinary risk.  I welcome the members of DFB to the Gallery, and on behalf of the constituents I represent, I thank them for continuing to put their lives at risk to keep us safe.<\/p>  <p>  The motion is similar to motions that have been passed unanimously by several Dublin local authorities, which gives a sense of the strong feeling among many political parties on the matter.  The motion speaks to several significant concerns.  One concern is that Dublin City Council does not see the fire brigade as a core service.  Another concern is that the HSE wants to absorb the emergency medical services.  A further concern is that the funding mechanisms are cumbersome and that DFB has not received its fair share of the increase in funding in recent times.  Crucially, there are concerns over the proposed transfer of call-taking from fire brigade to the national control centre in Tallaght.  Certainly, this proposal is one the fire services staff I spoke to earlier believe could cost lives.<\/p>  <p>  What surprises me most of all, however, is that all these concerns fly in the face of the recommendations from the expert panel.  The Minister of State rightly listed several reports from 2007 to the present.  However, she did not mention the report of the expert group established to work out how best to respond to the concerns of the HIQA report.  The fact that it was not mentioned suggests, notwithstanding Government support, the call of Deputy Darragh O'Brien for the Government to enthusiastically embrace the recommendations of this motion, which I fully support, has yet to surface.<\/p>  <p>  I will outline the key issues I want to raise.  The expert group recognised the validity of the two models of ambulance service and it called for parity of esteem among them.  It called for full financing for the two services to be derived from the two lead Departments as well as greater co-operation, co-ordination, governance and clinical governance between the two providers.  Crucially, the report called for the maintenance of call taking and dispatch of both services.  What all of us would like to hear today is that the Government supports the recommendations of that expert group.  What was the point of the city council setting up an expert group and giving it this work if it would not accept the recommendations?  Since it seems the council does not fully support them at management level, it is time for the Government to step in and join the rest of us in calling on the council to do so.<\/p>  <p>  The Government do should do more than allow the motion to pass.  It should ensure that those recommendations become core Government policy.  Let us send a clear signal to Mr. Owen Keegan, Dublin City Council and the HSE to the effect that what they are currently trying to do is unacceptable and that we want a properly funded Dublin Fire Brigade with an emergency medical service and adequate funding.  This will ensure that the men and women who put their lives at risk on a daily basis can continue to do so with full Government support and resourcing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900049#WW00900","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1529439600,"counter":501,"content":"<p>I welcome the members of Dublin Fire Brigade and my former colleagues from the union to the debate.

The motion states that DFB has been providing crucial ambulance services to the citizens of Dublin city and county since 1898.  Today the fire brigade provides immediate medical assistance 24 hours per day, seven days per week.  Those who have been rescued, saved or transferred by the DFB cannot speak highly enough of them.  I have in mind my grandmother.  She is not with us anymore, but when the time came and she needed to be transferred to hospital, she was transferred by the DFB.  Our family will be forever grateful for the care and compassion the personnel showed us.<\/p>  <p>  Dublin Fire Brigade has the knowledge and experience to continue to deliver a full range of services to the capital.  The provision of a fire-based ambulance service is regarded internationally as best practice.  Combining fire, rescue and emergency services greatly improves the response to a crisis.

We need to enhance the service and attract men and women to the service and ensure they can access continuing professional development.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the Minister of State's comment that she believes it is timely to look again at how the funding arrangements between the two organisations work as well as how to put the service on a sound financial footing.  However, we need to understand what exactly this means to have confidence that the great service provided by the men and women of the fire brigade to the people of Dublin will continue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900049#WW01000","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speech","time":1529440200,"counter":502,"content":"<p>Ba mhaith liom mo bhu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il d&oacute;ibh si&uacute;d a chuir an r&uacute;n os comhair an T&iacute; anocht, ach go h&aacute;irithe na fir agus mn&aacute; Briog&aacute;id D&oacute;ite&aacute;in Bhaile &Aacute;tha Cliath, mar thar na blianta, thug siad cuidi&uacute;, n&iacute; hamh&aacute;in domsa agus do mo chlann ach do gach uile duine sa chathair seo a bh&iacute; i gcruach&aacute;s agus a th&aacute;inig an briog&aacute;id d&oacute;ite&aacute;in chucu agus a thug cabhair c&aacute;ime d&oacute;ibh nuair a bh&iacute; g&aacute; ann, ach go h&aacute;irithe i mo theanta f&eacute;in ar an gCarn&aacute;n n&oacute; fi&uacute; lasmuigh i dTamhlacht agus Sr&aacute;id an Phiarsaigh, bhuail m&eacute; leo thar na blianta agus bh&iacute; siad an-mhaith, an-phroifisi&uacute;nta agus bh&iacute; an cuma ar an sc&eacute;al go raibh siad ag caitheamh go maith lena ch&eacute;ile agus nach raibh aon choimhlint eatarthu.

I acknowledge the work they do, in many cases without proper resources.  The Dublin Fire Brigade has a proud history.<\/p>  <p>  There is an adage that if it is not broken, do not fix it.  The first document I contributed within Sinn F&eacute;in was on the Dublin Fire Brigade in 2006.  This is how far back there has been an attempt to undermine the Dublin Fire Brigade.  I am aware that there are difficulties and that the model does not fit every aspect or requirement of small island but rather than enhance it and rather than roll out the Dublin Fire Brigade model throughout the State why does the Government want to change it? Why are other cities in other countries looking at the Dublin Fire Brigade model to roll it out?  It is because the model works.  It fixes people and it saves lives.<\/p>  <p>  In comparison to other public services, the retention levels in the Dublin Fire Brigade are high, which is down to the fact that fire fighters are appreciated by the public.  The Government started to undermine the service in recent years, and it looked as though the service was to be picked off bit by bit, to become parts of other services or through privatisation as originally intended with the proposed call-out centres and ambulance services.  Luckily that attempt was lost in the courts.<\/p>  <p>  For years I have believed there is a need for a proper roll out of the model, but there is also a need to properly resource the Dublin Fire Brigade.  If the Dublin Fire Brigade cannot answer all the calls it is nothing to do with its commitment, it is to do with years of under investment in it.  Its members would love to be able to answer each and every call that comes in; that is their focus and their job and it is why they joined the service in this city.  It is why they undertook the huge amount of training, which stands to them when they respond to a call out, be it a road traffic accident or a person in difficulty in a house.  The Dublin Fire Brigade wants services and ambulances and it wants additional staff, but the brigade has been starved of these resources.<\/p>  <p>  The last piece of the Minister of State's contribution, or what she was trying to get at, exposes the Government's intentions which are to give the National Emergency Operations Centre, NEOC, all the medical call outs rather than enhancing the existing service of the Dublin Fire Brigade.  If it is broken in Pearse Street, then fix it, or find another location, but do not take away a service that is used for the benefit of Dublin city dwellers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900050#XX00100","speaker":"1305"},{"type":"speech","time":1529440200,"counter":503,"content":"<p>Fire fighters with the Dublin Fire Brigade provide fire and emergency medical services to the citizens of Dublin.  The Dublin Fire Brigade has more than 800 paramedics offering a world class service to the citizens of Dublin.  These skills allow trained Dublin Fire Brigade personnel to assist ambulance and medical personnel in the trauma care of patients particularly for those involved in accidents.  Dublin Fire Brigade personnel each day provide care for people with a range of traumas such as spinal injuries, burns, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, broken bones, oxygen therapy, defibrillation and other medical emergencies.  Fire brigade personnel arriving at an incident or medical emergency can immediately begin the process of lifesaving because they are trained to do so.  Such early intervention by the fire brigade ambulance services is crucial for both medical and trauma patients and gives them a greater chance of survival.  When the ambulance service takes over the responsibility for the patient at the scene the fire brigade personnel can then offer a support role to the ambulance service.  When the fire service is first to arrive at the scene of an incident, and where there is an injured or seriously ill patient, it is sensible and logical that fire brigade personnel should have the necessary skills and equipment to provide effective treatment and support for the patient until the ambulance services arrive.  Having such skills allows fire brigade personnel to provide an effective and rapid response to life threatening medical emergencies, especially in locations where the fire brigade will be able to get to a call more quickly.<\/p>  <p>  Why is this service so important?  If a person has an obstructed airway, he or she will die in less than five minutes.  Simply protecting the airway of a seriously ill patient will save his or her life.  A defibrillator is most effective if used within four minutes of a cardiac arrest; after eight minutes have elapsed there is only a very small chance of a successful outcome for the patient.  In rural areas such a service is very important because of the greater travel times involved and the delays caused by traffic and weather conditions.  The Dublin Fire Brigade personnel are trained emergency service professionals and are the ideal people to carry out the function of first responders.  They are not there to undermine the ambulance services but to enhance these services.  If the Government is not opposing this motion, it is time for this House to send out a clear message to Owen Keegan in Dublin City Council and the HSE saying hands off, we love our fire service, it is a great service, there is no reason it should be undermined and we need more funding for our service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900050#XX00200","speaker":"1303"},{"type":"speech","time":1529440200,"counter":504,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1:<\/p><blockquote>To insert the following after &ldquo;ambulance services provided by DFB across Dublin.&rdquo;:<br \/><br \/>&mdash; implement in full the Report of the Expert Panel into Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Services in Dublin, published in December 2015.&rdquo;<\/blockquote><p>The Labour Party fully supports the motion as proposed by Fianna F&aacute;il.  It is very welcome that there seems to be wholehearted support for it in the Chamber.  I hope this means there really will be a strengthening of the resolve to maintain the service of the Dublin Fire Brigade as it is and to properly resource it, which is the main point that is being made here tonight.  On behalf of the Labour Party, I propose an addendum, rather than an amendment, to implement in full the report of the expert panel into pre-hospital emergency care services in Dublin, which was published in December 2015.  In proposing the addendum, the expert panel has made a detailed report and a detailed study.  I believe it would add to the motion and I hope Fianna F&aacute;il will accept it and add it to it.<\/p><p>As other Members have already said, the service is not broken.  It does not, therefore, need to be fixed.  It needs to be strengthened but it certainly does not need to be fixed or changed in any way.  There is a unique advantage in the Dublin Fire Brigade that we may not have in other parts of the State in that all Dublin Fire Brigade fire fighters are fully trained paramedics, many of whom are advanced paramedics.  When an ambulance is not available, or when it is on its way to a call out, the fire tender crew can support the person who is in need of medical intervention.  This is especially useful when attending road accidents.  Some of the crew can attend to the casualties while other crew manage traffic or the other duties required.  This is a real positive.  It also allows for crews to be rotated between fire service ambulance and fire tenders so they are always out on the road responding to calls.  This system reduces crew burnout rates and allows crews, through regular application, to keep their skills finely tuned.<\/p><p>This is a very good and positive service.  The one demand and the one need is to have the service properly resourced.<\/p><p>My understanding is that four more ambulances and their attendant personnel are required.<\/p> <p> The expert group has made a number of detailed recommendations.  The group comprised a retired chief fire officer with 40 years of experience, an experienced chartered accountant, a consultant in emergency medicine and a long-term council official.  Clearly, they had a level of expertise.  In their recommendation on call taking and dispatch, they wrote that, while there were inherent differences in the approach to this work in both organisations, it was the panel's recommendation that the models in both centres be retained.  The panel also believed that the transfer of 999 EMS calls from the Dublin Fire Brigade to the national emergency service would have implications for the safe management of such a large increase in the volume of calls to the latter.  Critically, the panel considered that the removal of any element of the fire-based EMS model would detrimentally affect the safe delivery of that service by the Dublin Fire Brigade to the patient.  However, it recognised that both providers needed to work together.  Following technical advice from Mason Advisory, the panel was satisfied that a technology-based solution would address those concerns and enable mobilisation of the nearest available resource without compromising patient safety.  This follows on from the HIQA reported that was mentioned.<\/p> <p> There are positive recommendations on how the national service and Dublin Fire Brigade could co-operate, but no one is suggesting that the Dublin Fire Brigade should transfer to the national service.  The brigade is doing a very good job and Dublin people are satisfied with its work.  It is safe compared with services elsewhere and it should be maintained and strengthened.<\/p> <p> I wish to acknowledge a conversation I had with a councillor, Ms Alison Gilliland, chair of Dublin City Council's special committee on fire and ambulance services and emergency management.  On behalf of that committee, she has presented motions to the council, as have other councillors.<\/p> <p> We hope that tonight's debate will lead to an assurance that the Dublin Fire Brigade will continue delivering its excellent service and that it will be adequately resourced to do its important job.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900050#XX00300","speaker":"1325","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1529440800,"counter":506,"content":"<p>I thank Fianna F&aacute;il for tabling this motion on the most important of issues.  The provision of fire safety and critical ambulance services is something that cannot remain unresolved and in limbo.  Fire brigade personnel have been in a permanent state of industrial unrest for more than three years.  It is not their fault, but the fault of the Dublin City Council CEO and a lack of leadership from the Government.  It is a testament to the commitment of the Dublin Fire Brigade to the citizens of Dublin that its industrial unrest has not resulted in large-scale industrial action.  We welcome this motion as an opportunity to bring home to the Government the need to resolve these issues once and for all.<\/p>  <p>  We are lucky in Dublin to have two ambulance services, one run by the National Ambulance Service, NAS, and one run by the Dublin Fire Brigade.  We are especially lucky to be served by the latter.  The Dublin Fire Brigade offers a combined service of fire and paramedics, which is a global standard used by 97% of the major cities in the US.  We sometimes look at other countries' practices and lament that we do not have them as well, but we have had this service for 120 years.<\/p>  <p>  The calls in the motion must be delivered upon.  We need to see full and demonstrable support for the Dublin Fire Brigade from the Government.  We cannot forget the sacrifices made by the Dublin Fire Brigade when the country was in an economic crisis.  It implemented cost saving measures through internal agreement.  Difficult measures were agreed upon between workers and management without ever affecting the vital service those workers provided to our city and county.  We must not forget that.  In this era of distrust in public bodies and institutions and when scandals emerge in many corners of our society, the Dublin Fire Brigade remains a organisation that is trusted by the majority of Dubliners.  We cannot put a price on that, and this trust must not be damaged.<\/p>  <p>  As per the Labour Party amendment, we ask that the Government and the House support the Dublin Fire Brigade.  We ask that the Government implement the recommendations of the pre-hospital emergency care services report, which has been lying on a shelf for three years.  Its recommendations need to be implemented immediately.  The report's conclusion states that the governance structures as set out previously would provide the Dublin Fire Brigade and the NAS the autonomy to plan strategically and develop operations and training to the level required of a professional emergency service.  The panel asserted that the removal of any element of the Dublin Fire Brigade's fire-based EMS system would have an adverse effect on patient care and, therefore, it did not support the proposal to transfer call taking and dispatch functions from the Dublin Fire Brigade to the NAS.  It was the panel's recommendation that the call taking and dispatch models in both centres be retained.<\/p>  <p>  The panel's main recommendations included addressing operational deficiencies within the Dublin Fire Brigade as well as the implementation of an integrated ambulance service by the NAS and Dublin Fire Brigade.  The report also highlighted the need for a new funding structure from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government alongside the necessity for individual improvements and collaboration between the two providers in the area of call taking and dispatch.<\/p>  <p>  We need to implement these recommendations without delay and provide certainty to the workers of the Dublin Fire Brigade, whom I welcome to the Chamber.  We need to provide certainty to the people of Dublin city and county, who trust and respect the service provided.  People need to be proud of the service, as we in the Labour Party are.  I am proud of the fire service workers from my full-time service in the Swords station and my retained service in Balbriggan and Skerries.

They were like a small army on the plinth in this evening's sunshine.  We are all proud of them, given their history - fighting recent hotel fires, the accident on Wellington Quay and the Stardust fire, the memory of which is still fresh in our minds 37 years later.  There will be an initiative in Croke Park this weekend to campaign once again for real justice following that fire, which has left a mark on the history of this city and the fire brigade.<\/p>  <p>  When I was a councillor, an expert group was set up in what I believe was an attempt to take the Dublin Fire Brigade out of the control of Dublin City Council dressed up as an examination of the functionality and efficiency of the brigade.  Sir Ken Knight was brought over from, I believe, the Manchester region.  He was an experienced firefighter who had been knighted for his work and expertise.  If memory serves, Dublin City Council spent approximately &euro;100,000 on producing his report, which then sat on a shelf and was never taken down again because Mr. Owen Keegan did not agree with its recommendations.  After returning to the system he had worked under in London and beyond, Sir Ken Knight recommended that the efficiencies the Dublin Fire Brigade had achieved with its combined model of paramedics, ambulances and fire engines be applied in Britain because it was such an impressive system.  He estimated that he could save approximately &pound;200 million for the British system, but we wasted &euro;100,000 on this expert's report and left it sitting on the shelf to gather dust because Mr. Keegan did not agree with it.  As he had done as county manager at D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, he pushed hard to unburden Dublin City Council's budget of the men and women of the Dublin Fire Brigade and their work.<\/p>  <p>  This is an important point when one considers the language.  Mr. Keegan came into the council not as a manager, but as a CEO.  He started to make decisions that were not about the health and safety of the city or the interests of the men and women of the Dublin Fire Brigade and those whom they served, but about efficiencies and running a corporate entity as opposed to a city with all of its complexities.<\/p>  <p>  The men and women of the Dublin Fire Brigade consistently fought to defend the system and won.<\/p><p><i>9 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>Thankfully, they are here tonight for this motion.  They are here because that system is under attack again.<br\/><br\/>I welcome the Government's recognition of the role played by Dublin Fire Brigade and its endorsement of the motion.  Like Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh, I am a little worried about what it actually means.  The Minister of State acknowledged in her speech, copies of which we will give to the firefighters afterwards, &quot;the National Ambulance Service could not recruit at the level necessary to displace the Dublin Fire Brigade paramedic workforce and so cannot, and will not, take ownership of Dublin emergency ambulance service provision.&quot;  That is a welcome acknowledgement.  Dublin Fire Brigade received 7% of the funding that is used to answer 40% of the calls on a national level.  Dublin is home to one third of the country's population and the most complex health and safety issues with which those with responsibility in this regard have to deal probably arise.  There is evidence that the number of such issues in the city is going to increase.  Earlier, we heard reports of the number of accidents and road fatalities increasing again - year on year and month on month - compared with last year.  More importantly, episodes relating to climate change, flooding, wind damage, downed cables, falling trees and sea levels rising are going to cause major problems.  Throughout the country, not just in Dublin, we have witnessed the heroism of Dublin Fire Brigade and other firefighters and emergency service personnel during recent flood and storm events.  These services are going to be required more and more, not less and less.<br\/><br\/>In the context of its review, details of which were published in March 2017 and which involved an examination of the progress made in implementing recommendations of pre-hospital emergency care services - in other words, ambulance services - HIQA states:<\/p><blockquote>A key finding of this Review relates to the provision of services in Dublin.  HIQA found a high level of risk associated with a lack of collective ambulance capacity and arrangements for call handling and dispatch.<\/blockquote><p>This short, two-page document does not indicate exactly what that teases out but I suspect that the problem with the high level of risk is not associated with the service delivered by Dublin Fire Brigade but rather with the lack of delivery on the part of the HSE.  This is not intended as a criticism of the men and women who work in the paramedic ambulance service of the HSE; it is a criticism of the HSE itself.  Such criticism is not unusual.  In light of the recent scandal relating to CervicalCheck, the HSE is well deserving of criticism.  I worry, however, that the criticism is misplaced.  The Minister of State indicated that what is proposed is to transfer all ambulance call-taking and dispatch functions to the NEOC such that all such services across the State will be consolidated in one centre.  She also said that this is required because the current call-taking arrangements represent an unacceptably high patient safety risk and give rise to delays in the allocation of ambulance resources to patients, including in potentially life-threatening situations.  I do not believe that the evidence shows us that this applies to the delivery of service by the men and women of Dublin Fire Brigade.  Rather, it applies to the inefficiencies relating to and lack of leadership and, often, mismanagement on the part of the HSE.  I want to offer a caution about that.<br\/><br\/>We live in a society where we sometimes forget to talk to the people who know what they are talking about.  I refer to those who are out every day in fire stations, on the streets - where major problems can arise - attending accidents, in houses picking up people who are dying or sick and dealing with the impacts of climate change.  Unless we talk to them and hear exactly what they have to say about the changes required - if they are required - and how they can be delivered, then we will run into trouble.  We will certainly run ourselves into trouble and towards a lesser standard of service delivery if we rely on what I believe to be a broken HSE.  The latter has proven, most recently in its handling and mismanagement of health cases of dying women, that it cannot be trusted.  That sounds quite dramatic but I am of the view that before any of this is be implemented, we need to talk in a serious way to the men and women of Dublin Fire Brigade and, indeed, to those who are responsible for operating the National Ambulance Service.  My brother, who has since passed away, worked for the service.  As somebody who was dedicated to his work, for many years he was frustrated that the workers were never listened to when they put across proposals that might help to deliver a better and more efficient service in order to create a better, safer and healthier city for all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900051#YY00300","speaker":"1367","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1529441400,"counter":509,"content":"<p>I support the motion.  I thank Fianna F&aacute;il for tabling it.  I support it because of the men and women here tonight and their colleagues throughout the fire service and the ambulance service.  I am here tonight to state that intention about the motion.  I accept the motion and I will talk to the firefighters between now and any vote taking place on Thursday in order to discover what they think.  While the Government is accepting the motion in general, there are parts of the response relating to the NEOC with which I am not happy.  I reckon the firefighters are not happy with them either.  The Joint Committee on Health could possibly set up a subgroup to work with the firefighters and the ambulance service to look at the report from HIQA in order to ensure that the resources the firefighters need are provided.  The matter could then be referred back to the D&aacute;il.  It should not be placed on the long finger over a period.  There should be a time limit of two or three months; whatever is negotiated with the firefighters and the National Ambulance Service workers.  That might work.  I would like to hear what the firefighters and ambulance service workers have to say about that but the committee could work to move this matter on.  I do not think there would be general agreement with the Government's proposals.<\/p>  <p>  In 2017, 233 people were rescued by Dublin Fire Brigade.  Some 43 persons were rescued from fires, 70 river rescues were attended and there were 79 road traffic collision rescues.  All full-time firefighters are trained as paramedics and rotate continuously between firefighting and providing emergency medical services.  Dublin Fire Brigade's 12 emergency ambulances, of which it needs more, are staffed by paramedics who are available to respond 24 hours a day, 365 days per year.  In addition, there are 21 front-line fire appliances, of which more are needed, with up to 120 paramedics available to respond on a daily basis.  All full-time firefighters are trained to paramedic standard and are required to maintain Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council, PHECC, registration as paramedic practitioners.  All trained firefighters are trained to an emergency first responder level.  Tangible clinical outcomes in 2017, illustrating the work of fire brigade emergency medical service, include: 61,462 patients treated and transported to hospital - that is a huge number; 3,527 critical medical incidents managed; and 435 cardiac arrests manage.  Also in 2017, Dublin Fire Brigade assisted in the delivery of 12 pre-hospital childbirths and mobilised in 86,405 emergency ambulance instances.  That is a tremendous response from the men and women of these services.<\/p>  <p>  I want to make particular reference to Dublin City Council because it has already been alluded to here.  In 2014, the HSE had been attempting to take control of the Dublin ambulance service from Dublin Fire Brigade.  In March 2014, the director of the HSE's National Ambulance Service was called before Dublin City Council councillors to answer questions about his intentions towards Dublin Fire Brigade's ambulance service.  The decision to do this was taken amid growing controversy at the time about a HSE plan - drawn up in 2013 - to take control of Dublin ambulance service from Dublin Fire Brigade by the end of 2015.  The plan in question was drawn up in advance of the HSE-Dublin City Council review of the capital's ambulance service, which was announced in February 2014.<\/p><p>In the same month and year, at a meeting of the council's environment committee, the chief fire officer gave a presentation where he said the major issue for the fire brigade was funding.  He said the fire brigade had provided the ambulance service in Dublin since 1898 on behalf of the city council, while the HSE provides for services outside Dublin.  The council agrees a figure annually with the HSE.  In that year it was approximately &euro;9.8 million.  The chief fire officer stated that the fire brigade's 12 ambulances were working at full capacity and even with the backup of 22 fire tenders, which often responded to 999 emergency ambulance call-outs, the brigade was not able to meet HIQA targets due to factors outside its control.  Those factors were resources in areas that included ambulances and personnel.  The chief fire officer stated that it had been impossible to reach an agreement on a sustainable funding model with the HSE over the years.  That was in 2014.<br\/><br\/>Members from all parties and none across the council support the fire brigade service.  It appears to me that the chief executive officer of Dublin City Council, Owen Keegan, and the HSE are intent on breaking an effective, efficient, state-of-the-art model of service developed over 120 years by removing Dublin Fire Brigade's ability to maintain a full fire-based emergency medical service, EMS.  As other speakers have said, the model is working, so why change it?  Why not expand it?  Why not resource it?  Why not satisfy HIQA standards and support the service?<br\/><br\/>In the time remaining I will read an email I received from a firefighter in recent days.  He gives a sense of the pride the workers have in the service.<\/p><blockquote>[The Dublin Fire Brigade service which] we in the service are extremely proud of, and have provided to the city for 120 years, is now under a very real threat of been removed from us and the citizens of Dublin.  The HSE has proposed the removal of the delivery of this fire\/EMS service from the DFB and instead merge the service with the National Ambulance Service.  I know first hand the value of Dublin File Brigade providing an ambulance service and having the back up of every firefighter being highly trained in fire, rescue and paramedic or advanced paramedic skills.  From a personal point of view, the comfort that I take from knowing that any of the crew members responding to an incident with me, are capable of performing life saving interventions at the scene of an emergency, makes my response a lot easier.<br \/><br \/>In today's world, where there is a constant threat of a large scale terrorist attack or even a small scale attack with high casualty numbers, running alongside the normal everyday emergencies, Dublin Fire Brigade is capable of providing in excess of 100 paramedics on-scene within a very short time frame.<br \/><br \/>Last year Dublin Fire Brigade Emergency Regional Control Centre processed in excess of 114,000 ambulance calls and 23,576 fire calls.  This year to-date the figures are 56,029 for ambulance calls and 9,033 for fire calls.  Dublin Fire Brigade has 12 emergency ambulances strategically located throughout the city and county.  Our service is at capacity, so not only is full retention of the service an urgent matter but an increase in capacity is also required as a matter of urgency.<\/blockquote><p>He goes on to state:<\/p><blockquote>The National Ambulance Service, NAS, provides an emergency ambulance service to the whole of the country.  At times where Dublin Fire Brigade are at capacity a request is made to the NAS for resources and vice versa, [obviously when needed].  Last year the response from NAS to [the Dublin Fire Brigade] requests for resources was 75% negative, i.e., they could not provide us with an ambulance.  The opposite response, where NAS requested resources from the DFB was met with 80% positive response.  [That is down to resources and that must be addressed.  That is the point the writer of the email is making.]<br \/><br \/>Ambulance calls are categorised in accordance with the priority of the emergency, the most urgent calls are designated Echo calls, with Delta being urgent but not life threatening.  Within the DFB response protocols, a fire appliance, staffed by an officer and 4 firefighters-paramedics is automatically dispatched to all Echo calls.  Delta calls may also have a fire appliance attached if the situation warrants one.  This dual response capability is a key component to our strength as an emergency service and cannot be mimicked by the NAS.<\/blockquote><p>That point must be taken on board.  I would like to hear the response of the workers involved in the direct front line.  They are the people who save lives and they are putting their lives at risk.  I think we should respect them and resource them properly.  I wish to emphasise that point.  We should link in with the committee to see whether we can move the issue on and bring the proper services into Dublin and across the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900052#ZZ00200","speaker":"1306","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1529442000,"counter":511,"content":"<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this motion today.  First, I commend the work of the fire brigade service, many of whose members are in the Gallery, on providing a crucial service to the citizens of Dublin city and county.  While I am from west Cork, most weeks I spend three days in Dublin and I may well need the fire brigade service at some stage.  While tonight's issues are very much focused on the Dublin Fire Brigade service, the west Cork fire brigade service also has problems which need to be highlighted.  I will only touch on that briefly today.<\/p>  <p>  I disagree with the HSE's proposal to remove the delivery of Dublin's ambulance service from Dublin Fire Brigade and, instead to merge it with the National Ambulance Service.  At present, Dublin Fire Brigade has 800 trained firefighter-paramedics to provide immediate medical assistance to members of the public in need of treatment on a 24-7 basis, 365 days a year.  If the ambulance service in Dublin is removed from Dublin Fire Brigade it will impact negatively on the delivery of this vital service and have an adverse effect on safeguarding the community of Dublin.  Instead, the Government should be looking at ways to maximise service delivery and to provide greater measures to protect the hard-working firemen who risk their lives every day in order to keep others safe.<\/p>  <p>  In my area of west Cork, the firefighters do tremendous work also and should be recognised for that.  It is a disgrace that Bantry and Bandon fire stations have water tankers that are broken.  They must be replaced immediately.  Bantry's water tanker was put off the road in February of this year and Bandon's water tanker has been off the road in recent years.  A water tanker is a very important asset to a fire service fleet, as it can carry up to 2,000 gallons of water.  In many cases when a fire brigade is called out to a fire there is no water fire hydrant and that is when a water tanker is vital.  It is outrageous that west Cork currently does not have any water tankers and that the nearest ones are in Mallow and Middleton.  In a recent fire at a farm in west Cork, five fire stations had to be called out because of the extent of the fire where there was no hydrant and extra water was needed.  They had no water tanker and if they had, all these stations would not have been needed.<\/p>  <p>  I will return to the issue at hand.  I call on the Government to retain the delivery of Dublin's ambulance service through Dublin Fire Brigade and not to merge Dublin's ambulance service with the National Ambulance Service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900053#AAA00200","speaker":"1263"},{"type":"speech","time":1529442000,"counter":512,"content":"<p>I am happy to speak on the motion this evening which I support.  I compliment my Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues on tabling the motion.  I got very worried when I read in the motion that there are concerns that the Health Service Executive is seeking to remove the delivery of Dublin's ambulance service from Dublin Fire Brigade and instead to merge the service with the National Ambulance Service.  I agree with the motion that such a proposal could have a hugely negative impact on the delivery of services from the Dublin Fire Brigade call centre and that removing any element of its fire-based emergency medical service, EMS, system will have an adverse effect on safeguarding communities.  That is what we are all about here.  Our primary duty as elected politicians is to safeguard the people in our communities.<\/p>  <p>  How can anyone in this day and age think it is a good or progressive move to merge any service within the fold of a completely dysfunctional HSE or even the National Ambulance Service?  The HSE gets more dysfunctional by the hour.  It beggars belief that a health service that is so dysfunctional and chaotic would even seek to have such a move sanctioned.  However, it would, because it has no shame.  We saw today that Professor Hillery resigned.  More people will resign and flee from the HSE because it is utterly dysfunctional, power-grabbing, self-serving and unaccountable.  There are many good workers on the ground but not at management level.  I am afraid that despite the heroic work being performed by ambulance personnel right across the State, the same, sadly, cannot be said of the National Ambulance Service itself.<\/p>  <p>  In my county of Tipperary - in Clonmel, Thurles, Cashel, Tipperary town and Nenagh - we only have one ambulance each to cover night duty from Monday to Sunday each week.  I do not blame the ambulance crews, drivers or paramedics.  I blame management.  It is all about management.  To hell with the people and to hell with the crews according to the HSE bible.  It is absolutely appalling to think that a single ambulance is being provided to cover night duty in each of the towns concerned.  The hinterland of the towns could stretch 20 miles up into the mountains of Hollyford, the Galtee Mountains or the Knockmealdowns.  The towns are major urban centres, not to mention the surrounding rural localities, which rely on efficient ambulance services.<\/p><p>I am informed by the NAS that despite recommendations from its first ever capacity review on the urgent need to recruit additional staff, this will only occur over the next four years.  This is disgusting and represents a blatant disregard for people's safety and lives and for ambulance crews.  This is unacceptable, given the ongoing chaos and numbers attending emergency departments in South Tipperary General Hospital and University Hospital Limerick and the numbers of patients waiting on trolleys.  There also seems to be a significant disparity in the level of ambulances and rapid response vehicles that are assigned to day duties for each of these towns.  Cashel, Roscrea and Tipperary town, for example, have only one ambulance each, covering duty from Monday to Sunday while Nenagh has one ambulance and an initial rapid response vehicle covering the same time period.  <\/p> <p> The NAS is talking about developing a single, cohesive, strategic plan for ambulance services called Vision 2020 - God help us.  Any visions the HSE had are a distant fog on the mountain peaks and are disappearing by the hour.  How many more strategies do we need?  Given all of this, is it any wonder that Dublin Fire Brigade is terrified of having its ambulance service subsumed within the NAS, never mind the HSE?  I salute the members of fire brigade.  A good friend of mine from Tipperary, Mr. Michael O'Donnell, is a proud member and he educated me about the fire brigade when I came to Dublin first because I was not aware of the situation with regard to the fire brigade providing an ambulance service.  They do an excellent job and as the saying goes, \"If it's not broken, don't fix it\".  We must not allow the HSE to get its greedy and greasy paws on this service.  All it wants is prestige and self-preservation and to hell with the people.  I salute the Dublin Fire Brigade whose members do their duty gallantly.  They always do so when we come up here for All Ireland and other matches.  We will not be here this year, unfortunately, but we will be here next year.

They attend accidents on our roads and many times they encounter horrendous situations, including in our cities and on our motorways, where lives are lost.  The DFB does excellent work.  Why we do not leave them alone to continue doing so?  When I hear the words \"reconfiguration of services\", I know that means a reduction in services.  We have found that to be the case in Kerry, whereby a so-called reconfiguration of the ambulance service was simply a reduction.  In many instances now, it can be an hour or more before an ambulance arrives in parts of Kerry because the service is stretched to the limit.  A Tralee-based ambulance that comes out of Cork University Hospital has to press a button to report availability for work and can end up in Kinsale or Kanturk rather than back in Tralee.  When that happens, Kerry is left without an ambulance.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the ambulance workers for the great work they are doing.  I also thank the members of the fire service in Kerry in places like Sneem, Kenmare, Killarney, Tralee and Listowel.  They do great work protecting people when fires break out.  I saw them at work on the night a local pub was burned down and they did everything they could to save as much property as possible.  They do everything really.  They do their level best and while they might not really put their lives in danger, they have a tough time.  When they are called out, they have to get on the road within minutes.  Everything depends on them doing that.  We depend on them so much.  <\/p>  <p>  I ask the Government to leave Dublin Fire Brigade alone and let it continue to do the work it has been doing for the past 50 or 60 years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900054#BBB00200","speaker":"1320"},{"type":"speech","time":1529442600,"counter":515,"content":"<p>It is 120 years, in fact.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900054#BBB00300","speaker":"1311"},{"type":"speech","time":1529442600,"counter":516,"content":"<p>I thank my colleagues, Deputy Lahart, our Dublin spokesperson, and Deputies Daragh O'Brien and Haughey for tabling the motion, which involved a lot of work on their part.  I welcome all of the Dublin Fire Brigade workers who are in the Gallery and I thank all of the people who were outside the D&aacute;il earlier who spoke to us.  Unfortunately, I did not see any Government representatives there today but I know that the front-line workers would have liked to engage with members of Fine Gael and with Independent members of Government.  I met many members of the fire brigade last weekend at Huntstown Community Centre.  They brought with them the true spirit of DFB.  They were out in the community, teaching and engaging with children and providing a community service.  That might not be valued under the HSE's key performance indicator index or the various outputs of the Department of Health but we must value DFB as  a community service first and foremost, which is not recognised.<\/p>  <p>  Last year, I visited Blanchardstown fire station which covers a wide area, including Dublin west and beyond.  I spoke with workers there who are disillusioned with this Government's offer of what can only be described as qualified support.  I read the speech delivered by the Minister of State.  While the Government accepts the motion, it is only doing so on a qualified basis.  Why does the Government not offer full support to the workers in Dublin Fire Brigade?  It would have been worthwhile for members of Government to have met the men and women of the fire brigade and heard what they have to say on this important matter.  They understand the issues at play much better than the Minister of State or anyone in the Department of Health.  This is important because we are talking about life and death and people in an incredibly vulnerable situation getting the necessary care in an emergency.  It is as stark as that.  <\/p>  <p>  I firmly believe in the old adage, \"If it ain't broke, don't fix it\".  Regrettably, there are plenty of things broken in Ireland today.  We have a housing and homelessness crisis, with more than 3,000 children homeless, and we do not have many solutions from Government.  No one can claim the health service is operating well and that the HSE is fit for purpose to deliver healthcare.  However, it wants to absorb a service that is working well and is not broken.  We have chaos in the Department of Justice and Equality, teachers who cannot pay their rent and a massive haemorrhaging of personnel in the Defence Forces.  The Government is again not fixing something that is broken.  The elderly are struggling to get by on a week-to-week basis because their pensions are being raided.  These issues require fixing now.  These are the issues upon which the Government should focus  on rather than only offering qualified support to the workers in DFB.  <\/p>  <p>  Dublin Fire Brigade provides an exemplary, world class ambulance service which saves lives on a daily basis and has done so for more than 100 years.  The men and women of the fire brigade know what they are doing.  They provide a stellar service 24 hours a day, 365 days of the year.  They operate such a good model that other countries have tried to replicate it.  A person who has a heart attack in Dublin is more likely to survive than in most other cities in the world.  This is precisely because our firefighters are all trained paramedics.  Reports have found that we rank second in the world in terms of recovery from heart attacks.  Only Seattle performed better and that city studied the Dublin model when designing its own system.  This is one of the few areas in which we are a world leader and the Government should not try to undo that by allowing the service to be absorbed into the HSE.  Our current model combining fire, rescue and emergency services is internationally recognised as best practice because it works.  This model keeps people alive and it is the difference between life and death.<\/p>  <p>  I have received a massive volume of calls and emails from members of DFB and from worried members of the public.  Much of their concern stems from the dearth of information about what is being planned.  A commitment was given and the Taoiseach himself stated previously that any changes to the ambulance services provided by DFB would only be considered after lengthy engagement but this has not happened.  Fianna F&aacute;il and the public want to improve the capabilities of fire brigade to make it even better than it is now, not to remove or absorb it.  Year on year, as the population grows, calls have increased for additional recruitment but staffing levels are not keeping pace with demand.  This means we are heading towards a major problem unless we recruit more workers and empower and resource fire brigade.  It is tragic that this continues across many aspects of our front-line health services.  <\/p>  <p>  A technical solution can be found, despite the qualified support from the Minister of State earlier.  According to the men and women of DFB, increased co-ordination between Tallaght and Townsend Street will transform the service.  A comprehensive co-ordination programme, resulting in accidents and emergencies being responded to as quickly as possible, would only cost between &euro;10,000 and &euro;20,000 and should be supported by this Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900054#BBB00400","speaker":"1255"},{"type":"speech","time":1529443200,"counter":517,"content":"<p>I welcome the representatives of Dublin Fire Brigade.  I support the motion before the House.  The Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, said earlier that the Government will support the motion.  Her words in expressing support for the motion need to be followed up with actions.  That is what is important to us.  All of us raise issues with the HSE day in, day out.  It is proposed to take responsibility for ambulances from Dublin Fire Brigade and give it to the HSE even though it is having great difficulty in dealing with itself.  As Deputy Haughey said earlier, &quot;If it is not broken, do not fix it.&quot;<\/p><p>Most of the points I wanted to make have been very well made already.  I want to touch on a couple of other aspects of the fire service nationally.  Dave Carroll, who is the chief fire officer for County Tipperary and the president of the Chief Fire Officers Association, recently told the association's annual conference that the recruitment and retention of firefighters is a major concern nationally.  He said in his speech the association must:<\/p><blockquote>acknowledge the very real difficulties that our retained services are facing in terms of recruitment and retention of personnel.  Notwithstanding the incredible commitment given to our communities by members of the retained fire service, it is clear that the current model is not fit for purpose.  This model essentially places our fire-fighters on call 24\/7 for 365 days a year with limited time off outside of this.<\/blockquote><p>In many parts of the country where part-time arrangements are necessary, part-time firefighters are expected to live very close to their fire stations, which limits the kind of work they can get outside firefighting.  Mr. Carroll continued:<\/p><blockquote>This model evolved back in the 1950s and 60s and is patently unsuitable for today's lifestyle.  The increased urbanisation of Ireland presents further challenges as primary employment migrates from the villages and towns to the larger urban centres.  If one thing is abundantly clear it is that there is no easy solution, but neither is there an option to do nothing - the system is not far from falling over so we must arrest that fall, and arrest it now.<\/blockquote><p>Those are not my words, or the words of someone making a political charge.  Those are the words of the chief fire officer for County Tipperary, who is the president of the national Chief Fire Officers Association.  His comments speak for themselves.  The serious problem he has highlighted needs to be addressed.  We expect part-time firemen to live nearby and to be on call 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.  This seriously limits their potential to earn a living, especially as the income provided to part-time firefighters is quite modest.<\/p><p>I would like to mention another issue that has emerged lately.  We need the 218 fire stations in this country because the first responders based in them do an excellent job in fire prevention and, when tragic cases arise, in making sure loss of life, injury and damage to property are limited.  The Department is proposing to close Ballyshannon and Bundoran fire stations in south Donegal and to replace them with a single station.  I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, to raise this matter personally with the Department and to respond to me.  The two stations in question, which are serving the local area very well, sadly respond to many calls throughout the year.  There was a significant tragedy in Bundoran in 1980, when ten people lost their lives in a fire at the Central Hotel.  A whole family was wiped out.  Indeed, such was the extent of the fire that one body was never found.<\/p><p>In 2009, a Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government approved the construction of two new fire stations for both towns and both communities.  The stations cover a very wide catchment.  Indeed, Ballyshannon is the only fire station in the South that provides cover in Northern Ireland.  There are several stations in Northern Ireland, including those in Derry and Strabane, that provide cover to the South from the North.  Ballyshannon is the only fire station in the South that provides cover in the North.  The area it covers stretches into north Leitrim and north Sligo and up towards central Donegal.  The original 2009 plan, which was approved by the Department and the Government of the day, involved the construction of two new fire stations.  That was the policy of the council.  An expert report that was published recently was agnostic on the need to close one of the stations.  It simply referred to response times.  The community in this part of the country will not accept the stripping out of services and the closure of critical infrastructure of this kind.  The Taoiseach and his colleagues, including the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, and Deputies in Sligo and the north west, appear for weekly photo calls to announce plans for things like Ireland 2040.  At the same time, it is delivering the closure of critical infrastructure like Ballyshannon fire station.  I ask the Minister of State to look into this retrograde decision and do all he can to have it reversed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900055#CCC00100","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speech","time":1529443200,"counter":518,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an gCeann Comhairle as ucht deis a thabhairt dom labhairt ar an &aacute;bhar seo.  I thank Deputies for their contributions to this evening's debate.  It is clear that Deputies across the House enjoy a shared appreciation of the important role Dublin Fire Brigade plays in the provision of emergency ambulance services in Dublin.  I applaud and salute the men and women of Dublin Fire Brigade, who are at the forefront of emergency services provision.  People on the front line of emergency services are heroes who dedicate their lives for the safety and protection of others.  Their work and dedication help the rest of us to sleep a little easier.  I can confirm that there are no proposals to replace the fire-based emergency medical service that has served the people of Dublin well for many generations.  I can also confirm that there are no proposals to merge Dublin Fire Brigade and the National Ambulance Service.  However, there is a need to consider funding mechanisms to ensure Dublin City Council is adequately reimbursed for the ambulance services provided by Dublin Fire Brigade on behalf of the HSE.  We also need to look at ambulance capacity in Dublin and we will do this.  A capacity review identified a requirement for increased ambulance resources in the eastern region, which covers counties Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow.  The capacity review underlines the need for a multi-annual programme involving phased investment in ambulance manpower, vehicles and technology.<\/p>  <p>  I assure the House that the Government is committed to the delivery of a high-quality pre-hospital emergency care service throughout the country.  Over recent years, additional investment has been directed towards pre-hospital emergency care each year.  An additional &euro;10.7 million, including &euro;2.8 million to fund new developments, has been made available this year.  New developments include the development of alternative pathways to care.  For example, a \"hear and treat\" clinical hub has been in operation in the national emergency operations centre since March of this year.  This will help to divert some lower acuity patients to alternative care pathways and will, in time, free up some emergency capacity.  At present, the clinical hub is only available to callers whose emergency calls are routed through the national emergency operations centre, which is operated by the National Ambulance Service.<\/p>  <p>  As we heard earlier, there are two separate call centres in Dublin, one operated by the National Ambulance Service and the other by Dublin Fire Brigade.  The existence of two call centres in the capital presents a real risk to patient safety, which we urgently need to address.  It is clear that our current call-taking arrangements give rise to delays in the allocation of ambulance resources to patients, including in potentially life-threatening situations.  A single point of contact is needed to address patient safety risks which have been identified by successive reports over the decades.  While technical solutions have been proposed and independently examined, it has been determined that none of them will resolve the patient safety concerns.  We need Dublin Fire Brigade and the National Ambulance Service to have a more co-ordinated and integrated approach to call-taking and dispatch.  To that end, a mediation process is under way between Dublin City Council and staff associations.  I hope this process will conclude shortly, will pave the way for a safer and more responsive ambulance service for the people of Dublin and will ensure new innovations such as the clinical hub will be available to callers all over the country.  I believe the conclusion of the mediation process will also help to provide certainty to Dublin Fire Brigade personnel regarding the continuation of the fire-based emergency medical service delivery model.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900055#CCC00200","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speech","time":1529443200,"counter":519,"content":"<p>I would like to share time with Deputy Lahart.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900055#CCC00300","speaker":"1344"},{"type":"speech","time":1529443200,"counter":520,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

We know about the services that are out there but it is only when we need a service that we really appreciate the work that is done by many people, including people in my own area.  I come from County Sligo, which is in the north west.  We have a fire service in Ballymote.  I can verify that when one rings the emergency number and then hears the sound of the fire engine coming, it is some relief to know it is on its way.<\/p><p>We should commend those who work in the fire and ambulance services.  They are taken for granted a bit.  It is only when one needs the service that one fully appreciates the work they do.  <\/p> <p> I come from Ballymote, County Sligo.  We have a good fire service there.  As my colleague, Deputy MacSharry mentioned, we have a fire station in Ballyshannon that is to be recommended for closure, which is quite wrong.  As was said earlier, funding was committed for two fire stations, one in Bundoran and one in Ballyshannon.  These are rural towns in which the population can increase tenfold in the summer time and in the tourist season.  I cannot understand why any of those services would be shut down.  It is a retrograde step and I ask the Minister of State to have a talk with the officials in his Department to try to get it resolved.  The people of the north west deserve better than what is being proposed.  <\/p> <p> The retained fire service people work extremely hard.  They attend fires and road traffic accidents.  It is fine for us who are in our beds at night when these people get a call.  They have to go out and God only knows what they face.  That is on a regular basis.  I do not think their work is fully appreciated by the Government.  In my home town, the people who supply that service must live within a mile and a half of the station and to be there within five minutes of the alarm going off.  Ballymote, County Sligo has one of the best rural fire stations in the country time-wise and response-wise.  That is on the record.  These people cannot get ordinary work like anybody else.  One constituent of mine works one day a week and cannot move more than five minutes away from the fire station because he is contracted 24-7 and has no choice but to be in that locality.  He has been refused jobseeker's allowance.  That is very wrong.  He is paid about &euro;70 for the day.  When he was getting jobseeker's payments, he was paid about &euro;140.  He had a net gain of about &euro;10 a day but the man wanted to work.  Now he is told that because he works that one day, he must give up the fire brigade and not work to qualify for a jobseeker's payment.  There is something badly wrong if the likes of this can go on.  It is unfair for people who are putting their lives at risk day in, day out.  They work for us by doing a very dangerous job and they deserve better.  Another Minister has informed me that because it is one day and the same day every week, that man's jobseeker's payment should not be stopped.  I ask the Minister of State to check that out for me. <\/p> <p> The retirement age for retained firemen at present is 55, with an extra three years when people are medically fit to do it  That age limit should be raised to 63.  We are expecting people not to be able to get their pension until they are 68 now.  Provided they are medically fit to carry on, that age limit should be raised in order that they can carry on into the future.  They are experienced people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900055#CCC00500","speaker":"1344","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1529443800,"counter":523,"content":"<p>The acceptance of this motion by the Government is welcome.  Even since this morning, its willingness has changed, not just in not opposing the motion as amended but in supporting it.  This represents a victory for Dublin Fire Brigade and its emergency ambulance service and their supporters.  However, the devil is very much in the detail.  The Ministers of State have kept saying there is no threat to Dublin Fire Brigade and ambulance service and no plan to absorb it into the HSE or place it under the control of the HSE.  We must look again at where the notion of that threat came from.<\/p><p>An agency of the State, the HSE, initiated a process to absorb Dublin Fire Brigade and ambulance service into the HSE.  It developed an implementation plan and won the support of the so-called custodians of that service, namely, the city and county managers.  The HSE controlled the budget and was unwilling to divest itself of it to Dublin Fire Brigade.  The HSE wanted to control the very means by which Dublin Fire Brigade and ambulance service gets to do its work by controlling the call and dispatch centre.  It was then by stealth that the HSE sought to absorb the services of Dublin Fire Brigade into and unto itself.  That is where that threat came from and the notion that the Government had no idea about it is just folly.<\/p><p>Anybody close to this issue will notice the difference in tone in the Minister of State's scripted speech this evening, the first response to the motion.  It is completely different from the tone on previous occasions when we raised this issue and for that we are grateful.  However, there are still a couple of uninformed stings in the initial contribution by the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, who stated:<\/p><blockquote>[Dublin Fire Brigade] requests for [National Ambulance Service] assistance can be in the region of 1,000 per week.  Sometimes [Dublin Fire Brigade] passes calls in batches which presents challenges to the [National Ambulance Service].<\/blockquote><p>This is a question of capacity.  Dublin Fire Brigade had 82,000 mobilisations last year.  If it is not responding it is because it does not have the tenders or ambulances.  It is a question of capacity and resources.  I do not like the little implication in the Minister of State's speech that it is the fault of Dublin Fire Brigade and ambulance service that it did not respond to calls and batches of calls were handed back to the National Ambulance Service.<\/p><p>We would like to see the full implementation of the report of the expert panel on pre-hospital emergency care services in Dublin, which was published in 2015.  We believe, as recommended in that report, that the installation should take place of terminals in both call centres, to which Deputy Jack Chambers referred, with additional resources and funding.  The Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, has gestured towards that tonight and it is new.  When the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, discussed this a number of months ago it was not countenanced.  I acknowledge the real progress that has been made.  However, the call centre issue is not resolved although it is covered in the report of the expert panel.  The measure has a cost of &euro;20,000.  We suggest that it would be possible to trial this technology for a period acceptable to the HSE, the national call centre, Dublin Fire Brigade and Dublin City Council.  As the motion is calling for that anyway, in agreeing to support it, the Government is indicating that it is essentially put in place.<\/p><p>Many messages go out from this Chamber to the fire officers and crews who are in the Gallery this evening.  One is a message to Owen Keegan.  The Minister has essentially gone over the city manager's head.  The city manager was ready to divest himself of an aspect of a service of which he is meant to be custodian.  Legislation provides that he is custodian.  A Minister has given him an answer.  Because crews of Dublin Fire Brigade and ambulance service's fire-based EMS service have at least four paramedics, sometimes including an advanced paramedic - I am told it takes at least four paramedics to deal with a cardiac arrest - 27 lives were saved in 2017 and 20 lives were saved in 2016.<\/p><p>I am happy to commend the motion, together with my colleagues who have spoken tonight, including Deputies Jack Chambers, Haughey, Darragh O'Brien, and Curran.<\/p><p>I am very happy the Government is supportive of it and that it has changed its tune considerably since the last time we raised the issue but the devil is in the detail and we, along with members and representatives of the Dublin Fire Brigade, will be looking for a meeting with the Minister in the next two weeks to drive this process through to completion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900056#DDD00200","speaker":"1311","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1529444400,"counter":525,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 1 in the name of Deputy Jan O'Sullivan was moved.
