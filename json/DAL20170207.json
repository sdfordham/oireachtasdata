We saw the human stories behind the figures and they were quite harrowing, particularly in the case of young children with scoliosis.  The programme was a shameful and disgraceful illustration of how those children were failed.  It is not today or yesterday that the issue pertaining to scoliosis patients was raised.  Less than two years ago, we were given assurances that the issue would be resolved but that has not happened.<\/p>  <p>  The people who volunteered to be interviewed showed great courage and were articulate and brave.  We owe them a great debt of gratitude.  We saw Dara from Kilkenny, a very bright child of seven who has scoliosis and who is exhausted on a daily basis because of the lack of action to address his needs.  His mother, Clare, described the physical impact on his breathing, his ability to eat and so on.  We saw how Megan Halvey Ryan found it impossible to attend school because of her scoliosis.  We heard from Colette, John and Betty, all of whom are living in chronic pain because of the lack of access to vital surgery.  It is difficult to comprehend how a person with a brain tumour could be waiting so long for surgery at Beaumont Hospital.<\/p>  <p>  The National Treatment Purchase Fund was mothballed by the then Minister for Health, now Senator James Reilly, in 2012.  It was not the solution to everything but while it was in operation, between 2002 and 2011, it dramatically reduced waiting times to six months or three months for the vast majority of people waiting for elective surgery.  For some reason, however, it was mothballed and the figures began to deteriorate rapidly from 2012 onwards, particularly for those waiting beyond 12 months, of whom there were up to 12,000 in 2016.  The figure in 2010 was a fraction of that.  It is easy to track what is going on, as well as the lack of capacity and investment in our system.  Many people resisted the re-establishment of the National Treatment Purchase Fund for the purpose of surgery.  Even in our talks on a confidence and supply agreement, many Fine Gael Ministers did not want it brought back.  To be fair, the current Minister for Health has said that he has &euro;20 million for this year and &euro;55 million for next year.<\/p><p>If anything comes out of the programme, I would ask that the Government make it a certainty, no matter what it takes, that no child with scoliosis has to wait beyond when it is medically important for that child to have the operation and that the curvatures do not get so extreme that it damages the child and causes more clinical complications.  Parents want nothing less for their children.  I cannot understand why private capacity was not sourced for those children or why might and main was not moved to ensure those children's operations got done if they could not be done in Crumlin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700003#A00200","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486476300,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Martin.

I, no more than the Minister, found it difficult to watch this programme, and the stories of Betty and Pat, and Peter and Kate and Patricia, and Elaine and John and Alan, and Kira and Darragh and Megan speak for themselves.  This is 2017 and nobody wants to see a situation like this.<\/p>  <p>  A perception that there was an attempt to cover up figures is not true.  Since the National Treatment Purchase Fund started in 2002, this was always the way, according to best international standards at that time, that these figures were presented.  Patients would get a call to say they would have an operation or a treatment.  Those who have had one treatment but need a second were never counted on this figures.  Irrespective of that, it does nothing for the parents of children who have curvature of the spine, which Deputy Martin mentioned.  This is a serious issue, and Deputy Martin raised it in that spirit.<\/p>  <p>  The &euro;2 million that was provided in 2016-2017 specifically for surgery for scoliosis has meant that 133 spinal fusion treatments for scoliosis have been conducted in 2016 for children under the age of 16 years and adolescents between the ages of 16 and 18 years, of which 44 were outsourced to the independent or private sector or the UK under the HSE winter initiative funding.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Martin himself has been through this.  During the previous Minister for Health's time, the big question about scoliosis was whether we had the theatre capacity.  A sum of &euro;3 million was found and invested in a theatre specifically for this purpose in Crumlin and it is still not open.  The Minister is meeting the chief executive later today, as well as the NTPF and the HSE.  He wants to make it clear that the scoliosis issue is an absolute priority, that he will do more and that he will refer again to the question of the private sector to assist with this.  The opening of a brand new theatre is dependent on the recruitment of adequately trained staff and exceptional efforts are being made to recruit staff who are qualified to do this work.  This is an issue the Minister was upset about.<\/p>  <p>  In respect to the situation that applies generally, &euro;900 million more has gone into the health system this year than last year.  It is now &euro;14.5 billion.  The strategy of health reform is correct in the decision in respect of the National Maternity Hospital, the decision in respect of the national children's hospital, the provision of primary care centres throughout the country and the reduction in the waiting list for routine colonoscopies by 90%.  These are all improvements in the health service which both of themselves and in respect of the staff who deliver them are also to be commended.  However, this is not something that we can stand over.<\/p>  <p>  I found it difficult to watch the programme but it is very necessary that these programmes and patients' stories in 2017 be heard.  I would point out that the function of the Minister for Health, on behalf of Government, is to set the overall policy and strategy and to provide funding within what can be provided, that is, &euro;14.5 billion or &euro;900 million more than last year.  Those charged with delivering the services differ in their opinions.  I heard opinions today about bringing in business people.  I heard opinions today about doing a lot of small things together.<\/p><p>There were also other opinions.  None of them deals with the issue of the child who is waiting for scoliosis treatment.  Today the Minister, in seeking a whole-of-Government response, will examine what it takes to open a theatre which the taxpayer paid &euro;3 million for but which is not open and was designed specifically for dealing with children with scoliosis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700004#B00400","speaker":"1245","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486476600,"counter":12,"content":"<p>The way the waiting lists are calculated was changed in many years - 2005, 2007, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2014.  The most recent change has been to extend the targets to 18 months, which is extraordinary.  Why did the Government bury the National Treatment Purchase Fund in 2011?  We could never get an answer as to why the former Minister, Senator James Reilly, did that.  He took away a capacity that got operations carried out for citizens.  Money was allocated and the individual got the hip, cataract or whatever operation was required.  The Government buried that at a time when there was increasing pressure on the public sector.  The Government was warned time and again about the lists getting worse but the former Ministers, Senator Reilly and Deputy Varadkar, were in denial about that and, in particular, the length of time on waiting lists.  That is a key metric here.  The time was down to six and three months for the vast majority of disciplines and procedures, but now the new target is 18 months and 12 months in some cases.<\/p>  <p>  On the scoliosis situation, the Taoiseach says 44 were outsourced.  All of them should be done, whatever it takes.  The Taoiseach knows about the nursing crisis; he has known about it for three years.  We pointed out in the D&aacute;il that the recruitment of theatre nurses was the greatest crisis in nursing recruitment over the last three years, but nothing has been done to incentivise the recruitment and, critically, the retention of theatre nurses.  That exacerbated the situation that already existed due to closing down the treatment purchase fund from 2011 and the stress and strain on capacity in the public system up to recent times.  There is also the issue of clinical prioritisation.  The growth of C contracts, for example, will put greater strain on public sector capacity to carry out surgery as well.  These issues must be examined.<\/p>  <p>  However, it is urgent that the money not be drip-fed to the treatment purchase fund but fast-tracked and accelerated so there are early significant amounts of money going to the purchase of operations for people such as those we saw last night.  It is unacceptable, as the Minister and everybody say.  Those people should not be waiting any longer in their current chronic pain.  There is a way to deal with it - go out, find the capacity and have the operations carried out for those people.  That is the immediate first step, after which there are wider issues to be dealt with.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700005#C00200","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1486476600,"counter":13,"content":"<p>That is exactly what the Minister is going to do.

I heard somebody with considerable experience in the medical profession say this morning that the NTPF was a waste of money.  I agree that it has a role to play here.

They are counted now.  That is fair enough but it does not do anything for those who suffer with the difficulties and challenges of scoliosis.  The Minister will be talking to the chief executive of Crumlin hospital, the HSE and the NTPF today and the focus will be on scoliosis, as the Deputy quite correctly requests, in order that no children will be left in their current difficulties and pain.

It appears that over 80,000 patients have been excluded from the official figures.  In addition, 81,000 others are on waiting lists, some in great difficulties.  The total is twice the capacity of Croke Park.  God knows how many more are waiting to see consultants.  The Minister for Health was aware of the scandal.  How could he not have known?  All of us here have made representations on behalf of citizens who are on waiting lists.  We are not talking about a small number of patients.  We are talking about the lives and well-being of more than 80,000 citizens, some of whom, including children, are, as we saw on last night's programme, languishing in tremendous pain.<\/p> <p> This is just another example of a health service that is in a state of perpetual crisis.  I disagree completely with the Taoiseach.  It is not just about misleading the public about waiting lists, it is about the 587 people who are on trolleys today, cancelled surgeries, thousands of hospital beds removed and a two-tier system in which health workers, particularly nurses, are not properly treated, and where patients suffer.  The plight of patients, especially children with scoliosis, and the bravery and anguish of their families, captured so graphically on last night's programme, has further eroded confidence in the Government, our general politics, our political system and our health service.<\/p> <p> There is a complete lack of accountability.  The Minister is not accountable.  The Taoiseach, while he has Fianna F&aacute;il's support, is not accountable.  We should dispense with the pretence that anyone present will get any real answers from the Taoiseach today - not me, not the patients, not their families, not the people working in the health service.  Instead, I propose a single, integrated hospital waiting list management system.  We published this as part of our Better for Health policy.  In December 2015, we presented it to the Taoiseach and the Minister at the time.  It is a plan for a public health service.  While we do not pretend it is an easy fix, we show it can be done.  On the issue of management of waiting lists, we have proposed a new system called \"Comhliosta\".  This would replace the current system and be responsible for generating maximum waiting times based on a single, integrated hospital waiting list system.<\/p> <p> The Sinn F&eacute;in health spokesperson, Deputy O'Reilly, wrote to the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, on 17 August last requesting a meeting to discuss the proposal.

Last week, I spoke to Deputy Shortall and she asked me for another meeting, which we will hold in the next week or ten days.<\/p>  <p>  The list system is nothing new.  It has been in place since 2002 and the counting of the list has always been the same.  It is nothing new under this or any previous Minister in the 15 years since it was established.  A total of 70% of patients are seen within eight months.  The Deputy's proposal for a single list may have merit.  His spokesperson is on the committee dealing with a ten-year programme for the health system.  It deserves some consideration.  However, what we need is a system that does not change from month to month or year to year.<\/p>  <p>  We have had a counting system since 2002 without changing it.  The other elements, the pre-admittance and people who have had a procedure and who need to be called back for a second one, have never been counted as part of those lists, although they have been published on a monthly basis.<\/p><p>The new orthopaedic unit was completed in 2015.  While it is in use, it has not added to capacity in Crumlin because of rolling closures.  In that sense, two international nurses commenced in Crumlin in January.  Two more are due to commence in March and a further 16 have been offered posts which allows the registration process to commence which can take four months.  The adaptation programme used to be six weeks but has been reduced to two days, which is progress.<\/p> <p> Every opportunity in recruitment and retention is followed through diligently, including working with the HSE and the international recruitment drive to support additional capacity at the hospital.  As of 31 January, there were 193 patients awaiting spinal procedures in Crumlin, of which 143 were for new spinal fusions.  On average there are additional 250 patients every year, 200 additional patients to Crumlin and 50 to Temple Street.

The idea that Governments going back to 2002 were misled about the state of our waiting list is troubling.  I echo the call made by my colleague, Deputy Alan Kelly, who wanted and is calling for an independent probe into how these lists are compiled and published.  The critical issue is what we do into the future.  The work being done by the Committee on the Future of Healthcare is absolutely critical now.  I urge its members to ensure three things.  First, they should finalise the report as quickly as possible so we can begin implementation.  Second, ensure the recommendations are not focused on short-term fixes but on long-term proposals that will expand capacity and increase outputs.  Third, ensure whatever is recommended is accompanied by a clear implementation plan and detailed costings in order that the recommendations can be achieved.<\/p>  <p>  Against this backdrop, we also learned from media reports over the weekend that the cost of the national children's hospital has spiralled by almost 50%.  As we know, when the planning application for this facility was lodged in 2015 we were told the cost would be &euro;650 million.  Less than two years later, and after much continued controversy about the location of the hospital, we now have a successful bidder but with a significantly higher cost.  That is without taking into account the more than &euro;200 million cost of the fitting out of the hospital.  Some serious questions arise.  Why have costs escalated to such an extent in less than two years?  Where will this extra money come from?<\/p>  <p>  Such additional expenditure comes against a backdrop of other health pressures.  Will the cost of the new Central Mental Hospital in north Dublin, which is a similar project, be on budget?  What about the cost of the new maternity hospital, the planning permission for which we still have not seen lodged yet?

First, the committee should finalise the report at an early time.  I support that.  Second, the recommendations should be focused on the long term as distinct from the short term.  I support that.  The third point the Deputy made was there should be a clear implementation plan to deal with it.  If we can have an all-party agreement from an Oireachtas committee on a ten-year fix on issues that will remove politics from that, then so much the better.  The Minister will be very happy to follow that.  The three recommendations the Deputy made are helpful.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to the national children's hospital, which the Deputy was involved with in the beginning, the issue was turned down at the Mater where significant moneys had been spent on excavating the underground car park and the move now to the current site is where I support it should be.  We expect that to be under way very quickly.  The original costs were &euro;450 million, which was estimated when the Deputy was Minister.  That rose to &euro;650 million and we now have speculation that it is somewhere under &euro;1 billion.  It is true to say there are few firms that actually have the competence to build a hospital as complicated and as major as this.  It is also true that during the recession, many construction firms tendered under price and many of them went bust as a consequence.  I am not suggesting that is the reason for the inflation now but there is an element of construction inflation here.  It may well be that in order for the health services to get Government on board they will say they could build for a particular amount.  In any event, once we get on that treadmill, things can rise.

These individuals could possibly be moved to different locations - thereby freeing up beds - and they would still, despite their difficulties, have the same quality of life.  When we consider Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda or the hospital in Galway and see the major operations taking place in terms of construction, clearly, we need a ten-year strategy.

On behalf of my colleagues in this Independent group, Last night's programme was disturbing and distressing and it reflected poorly on the health care system and its inability to respond to serious urgent care needs.  I am delighted with the response from the Taoiseach and that this matter will now be treated as urgent.  However, the message in last night's television programme has been conveyed consistently to the HSE by the consultants and doctors of the patients who featured in it.  I guarantee that every patient had representations made on his or her behalf by probably every Member of this House at some stage and that our recommendations have been ignored.  It takes a television programme to get action.  Where is the response from the HSE to representations made by elected representatives?<\/p><p>The issue I wish to raise with the Taoiseach is the principal health care issue in County Tipperary.  It revolves around the disgraceful situation at South Tipperary General Hospital, which has a grossly inadequate number of acute beds to manage the crisis in acute services.  It routinely has 140% occupancy, whereas the desired occupancy rate for hospitals of its size is approximately 85%.  Therefore, when there is a surge in demand, there is no flexibility in the system, as a result of which we regularly have the highest trolley count in the country.  In South Tipperary General Hospital there are only 150 acute beds per 100,000 of population.  This contrasts with the national average of 230 beds per 100,000.  That speaks for itself.  We have a problem in Clonmel.  It is like a battle zone.  On any day one goes into the hospital there, one will see the walking wounded.  It is completely overcrowded with trolleys literally coming out the door.  There are mixed wards of male and female patients where there is no dignity in the patient care.  There is intolerable pressure on the management and staff of the hospital.  They have been seeking help and looking for support.  The Minister visited the hospital, and we came to the conclusion that an interim solution is required, namely, a modular-type complement of beds, and that South Tipperary General Hospital should be included under the capital programme review.  Many people are criticising the Minister.  My view is he is accessible, approachable, sincere and knowledgeable.  However, he needs the support of Government because this is a national crisis and it needs a collective response from Government to address it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700009#G01300","speaker":"1240","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486478700,"counter":46,"content":"<p>It is a national situation and requires a whole-of-Government response, which it will get.  In the case of South Tipperary General Hospital, Clonmel, and Our Lady's Hospital, Cashel, the Minister has recognised that addressing the capacity issues there must be a priority.  My understanding is that a tender is due in the coming weeks requesting proposals for temporary accommodation in Tipperary.  The HSE has been asked to maximise the use of the Cashel campus and is considering every option to support South Tipperary General Hospital with both community and primary care services, as referred to by the Deputy.  I am also advised that the HSE is working towards providing extra capacity through the fit-out of additional space on the first floor of the hospital to alleviate pressure on the emergency department.  This extra capacity is expected to be available from early May of this year and I understand it could be used to accommodate for space of up to 11 beds.<\/p>  <p>  Also as part of the winter initiative, South Tipperary General Hospital has been identified, as the Deputy is aware, as one of the nine focus sites experiencing the greatest challenge in terms of emergency department pressures.  Consequently, under the initiative, additional measures have been put in place to support the hospital to respond to increases in demand for emergency care over the busy winter period.  These actions include improvement in early discharging and increased access to community intervention teams and to diagnostics.  The winter initiative has allowed for a further additional three home care packages per week at the hospital until the end of February this year.<\/p>  <p>  The winter initiative also recognises that there are specific capacity challenges at South Tipperary General Hospital.  As such, additional options are being considered, including the use of the national framework for alternative accommodation on hospital sites, to which the Deputy referred, to provide additional capacity through a temporary inpatient solution at that site.  The site in Cashel, which includes Our Lady's Hospital, provides mainly primary care services.  There is a small residential facility on the site, together with other services, including day and outreach services.  The residential unit, which includes elderly mental health and intellectual disability beds, is currently fully occupied.  The development of the campus as a centre for non-acute health care services arose from the decision by the former South Eastern Health Board to centralise acute hospital services for the south Tipperary area on one site in Clonmel.  This took place, as the Deputy is aware, in 2007.  The Cashel primary care team is based on the campus.  A range of services are provided on and from the site, including physiotherapy, occupational therapy, public health nursing, social work and disability services, as well as home help co-ordination and community mental health nursing.  Among other services facilitated are the south Tipperary community intervention team, a nurse-led service supporting early discharge and the avoidance of hospital admission.  An ambulance station is also located on the campus.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700010#H00200","speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1486479000,"counter":47,"content":"<p>Many people in County Tipperary cannot understand why major surgery is cancelled in Clonmel with early discharges because of lack of beds, not enough step-down or convalescent beds, insufficient home care packages and reductions in home help hours.  People are baffled and bewildered because while this is happening in Clonmel, there is a magnificent building up the road in Cashel, which was refurbished at a cost of &euro;20 million since 2007.  Three of its floors, which could take between 30 and 35 beds, are empty.  They are in excellent condition.  I ask that Cashel be reopened and developed as a primary, community care centre.  It is a premium facility lying idle.  It is shameful and mind-boggling that the Health Service Executive, HSE, is not using the building to its maximum potential at a time when the other problems exist in Clonmel.

I refer in particular to the need to deliver operations and surgeries on a timely basis to young children with scoliosis and people with gynaecological conditions who have been waiting for far too long.  It was revealed in last night's programme that this is happening across the board.  It would be very useful for all Deputies to be able to participate in a fuller and more comprehensive debate.  Many Deputies on all sides of the House have come across different priority cases in their own areas and in hospitals in their own constituencies and geographic regions.  It is important for the D&aacute;il to be flexible and adaptable.  We should have the capacity to respond to issues of genuine and urgent public concern.  In the aftermath of last night's programme, there is no doubt that people want precise answers that set out what will happen in 2017 to ensure the kinds of harrowing experiences that were revealed by patients during the programme are brought to an end.  These issues need to be prioritised and dealt with adequately.  We need to be reassured that the 2017 health service plan gives the Government and the HSE the capacity to do just that.

Such serious action is mostly unwarranted and highlights the need for the pension rights of workers to be resolutely defended and protected.  It is clearly wrong that shareholders can profit from a corporate restructuring while employees are effectively thrown under the bus and have their pension entitlements reduced.  Their rights are being trampled into the ground and this malaise will continue to spread unless arrested by legislation.  There are more than 700 defined benefit pension schemes in the State, covering more than 100,000 working people.  Those workers thought they had made provision for their retirement and many must be seriously alarmed at the nature and extent of the precedent that has been set.  It is, moreover, a dangerous precedent from a public policy perspective because it deters workers from saving for their retirement, something which is being universally encouraged at a political level.  The prospect that workers' lifetime savings might be drastically reduced at some future point militates against that.  The net result will be to force more people into reliance on public provision.<\/p><p>The pensions regulation regime in the UK has diverged from ours in many respects.  In the UK, the law prevents solvent companies from walking away from their obligations to their employees' occupational pension scheme.  At present, accounting standard FRS 102 requires an employer to recognise its liabilities to a pension scheme in its financial statement.  Removing those liabilities from an employer's accounts can have a transformative effect.  However, an employer's obligation to its pension scheme is not governed by statute law in Ireland but by the terms of the pension trust deeds, which the employer itself will have drawn up.  As a result, there is rarely a binding obligation.  In fact, most direct benefit trust deeds allow the employer to wind up the pension scheme and cease contributions, while ignoring any deficit in the funding of the scheme and the resulting inability to pay out the benefits originally promised.<\/p><p>The Bill I am bringing forward seeks to amend the Pensions Act 1990 by adding to employers' obligations in respect of funding issues, including when a defined benefit scheme is being wound up or when the employer has not become insolvent or both.  There is no point in the Government talking about a universal pension provision scheme if people see those who have saved for retirement all their working lives having their pension pots slashed in the unilateral fashion we have recently seen.  There are currently three pensions (amendment) Bills before the House.  I propose that Deputy O'Dea, Brady and I work together with representatives of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to formulate a policy that will evoke a positive response.  Deputy O'Dea has already indicated he is willing to pursue such an approach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700017#P00700","speaker":"1370"},{"type":"speech","time":1486482000,"counter":159,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700017#P00800","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1486482000,"counter":160,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700017#P00900","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1486482000,"counter":161,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1486482000,"counter":162,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700017#P01100","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1486482000,"counter":163,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700017#P01200","speaker":"1370"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1486482000,"counter":164,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Topical Issue Matters","time":1486482000,"counter":165,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700017#P01400"},{"type":"speech","time":1486482000,"counter":166,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 29A and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputy Bernard J.

The only response to date has been cosmetic.  It has been the addition of the word \"Rural\" to a Minister's title and the announcement that a plan was on the way.  The plan has been published and one would have to wonder why it took so long.  It is a rehash or pulling together of all existing policies.  As Deputy Breathnach informs me, even the schools programme has been in place for quite a number of years.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v quite rightly described it as a reheated dinner.  It is a long list of what is already happening, which the Government has put between two covers and labelled \"Action Plan\".<\/p>  <p>  It is extraordinary that there is not a mention of the blood-stock sector in the plan for rural Ireland.  There are thousands of jobs in the equine sector - trainers, breeders, race courses, from small players up to big players.  There is not a mention of the sector, yet it is sustainable, it is organic and it is in located in rural Ireland.  On fisheries, Deputy Howlin is correct about Brexit.  In the maritime communities of rural Ireland, there is a real crisis coming in the context of Brexit because of so many fish species being caught in British waters.  That is a serious issue.  The most incredible omission is that the plan contains no new commitment to a guaranteed level of access to or quality of public services.  How can the Government realistically claim to have a vision for rural Ireland if it cannot say what level of education, policing, health or other services should be available?

Such a change is particularly important if they are to assist in producing anything like the number of jobs outlined in the ambitions relating to the programme.  The Government also does not appear to have had time to engage in a specific examination of the very real problems that exist in the context of accessing credit, especially relatively small-scale loans for starter and owner-operated businesses in rural towns and villages.  The Government will not create jobs unless it encourages many new small businesses to start up operations.  The Government will not get many large businesses transferring operations to the 300 towns it has identified.  In the context of Brexit, there appears to be no alternative strategy to help small businesses in the areas to which I refer to get up on their feet.

The Taoiseach and the Prime Minister spoke of a seamless and frictionless Border.  They are meaningless terms.  The emerging model of Brexit, as articulated by the Prime Minister, is one that includes a hard Border.  This is as bad as it gets for Ireland.  While the Taoiseach has spoken about a common travel area, the issue is how we mitigate the economic damage which will be caused by the UK's exit from the Single Market and customs union.  This is the central question that faces Ireland.  There has been a pat answer focusing on the common travel.

The report is available on both Departments' websites.  In producing this report, the task force worked with Government Departments; local authorities; the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg; State agencies; the telecoms industry; and other key stakeholders.  The membership of the group included my Department; the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural, and Gaeltacht Affairs; the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government; the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport; the Office of Public Works; NewERA; Transport Infrastructure Ireland; Teagasc; Trinity College CTVR; the County and City Management Association; Irish Rural Link; the Irish Countrywomen's Association; businesses based in rural Ireland; the National Competition and Consumer Protection Commission; and an independent planning adviser.  ComReg participated on the task force as an observer in order to provide advice and guidance in its capacity as the independent regulator of the telecommunications market.  The task force met approximately 20 times with a number of helpful initiatives emerging in the areas of planning, local authority engagement, and consumer information and engagement.<\/p>  <p>  The report of the task force contains 40 actions which will alleviate some of the telecommunications deficits across Ireland and the implementation programme on mobile phone and broadband access identifies 19 of the 40 actions as areas where immediate and direct action can be taken by Government Departments and State agencies to ensure accelerated benefits to consumers.  The work of the task force will also assist local authorities in preparing for the roll out of the new national broadband plan network once the contract or contracts are in place.  Each of the actions contained in the report and implementation programme has its own timeframe for delivery, which is set out in the report.<\/p>  <p>  In order to maintain the momentum created by the task force, an implementation group is being established to drive and monitor the implementation of the actions.  The implementation group will be led by my Department and the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  The implementation group will formally report every 90 days to both the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, and me, who will in turn jointly brief Cabinet on the progress.

Until we understand where the gaps are, how can we begin to tackle it?  People experience dropped calls and patchy coverage.  People are almost offended by some of the campaigns telling them about the 4G services they can start to enjoy when they cannot even get 3G.  They cannot even get 1G in terms of calls.

That has already happened.  I signed a ministerial order in October to allow ComReg to release the 3.5 GHz spectrum.  It will be auctioned off in the first half of this year and will improve mobile phone coverage.  Part of the problem we have with mobile phone coverage at the moment is that the allocation of licences is based on populations rather than geographic coverage.  It is something I am looking at for the release of the 700 MHz spectrum.  I have already given RTE an allocation for funding in the current year to allow it to begin the process of decommissioning its broadcasting equipment on the 700 MHz spectrum so we will hopefully be one of the first countries in Europe to release that spectrum.

What we are doing in the short term, however, is providing a basic level of service that meets families' needs, whether it is to do with downloading information from the Internet or accessing Netflix or video content, to ensure they have the capacity to do that.  The mobile phone and broadband task force will deal with some of those problems in the short term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700023#V01200","speaker":"1234"},{"type":"speech","time":1486485600,"counter":290,"content":"<p>There was also the issue of doughnut areas being created around towns.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700023#V01300","speaker":"1232"},{"type":"speech","time":1486485600,"counter":291,"content":"<p>I advise the Minister and Members that there are 13 minutes allowed for two questions.

The dialogue is much needed, but the sooner the dialogue starts and finishes, the sooner the much-needed action kicks in.  We are well behind on our 2020 targets.  In March of last year, the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, produced a report predicting that Ireland's emissions would be between 6% to 11% below the 2005 levels, which indicates that we have actually stepped backwards in this area.  Given the global context, President Trump's various remarks and his immediate steps to row back Mr. Obama's climate change programme, it is even more a priority that Ireland meets its own obligations and takes immediate steps towards that.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the energy mix, the REFIT programme is still stalled, we have not seen action on solar energy and we have an overemphasis on wind energy.

This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment by the telecommunications sector, and for those areas that will not be covered by commercial operators, the State has committed to intervene and subsidise a network build in order that nobody, no matter how isolated, is left behind.  A formal procurement process is in train to select a company or companies which will roll out a new high-speed broadband network within the State intervention area.  The procurement process is being intensively managed to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland for at least 25 years.

In September 2016, the European Commission published an ambitious proposal for the regulation of the European telecoms sector, which aims to incentivise and encourage increased investment in high-speed broadband networks.

Last November, the Northern Ireland Minister for the Economy, Simon Hamilton, and I confirmed our joint commitment to the ongoing development of the single electricity market.  The new market arrangements will be in place in 2018 and will yield benefits for electricity market customers in the North and in the South.\u00a0 The UK White Paper on Brexit, which was published last Thursday, noted that the UK is considering all options for its future relationship with the EU with regard to energy.  The UK is particularly keen to avoid disruption to the single electricity market operating across the island of Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The North-South interconnector, which will further support the single electricity market and reduce costs for consumers, has received planning permission in Ireland and is in the planning process in Northern Ireland.  This vital project, which will ensure the security of supply in Northern Ireland, is a further example of the interdependence of our energy systems.  The interconnector\u00a0will enhance competitiveness, bolster security of supply and remove a key barrier\u00a0to the efficient operation of the electricity system across the island of Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  It is envisaged that it will lead to initial savings of &euro;20 million per annum, increasing to between &euro;40 million and &euro;60 million each year by 2030, shared between Ireland and Northern Ireland.  Such cost savings will ensure there are benefits for every home and business in the State and will improve the competitiveness of businesses and the household disposable incomes of citizens.  On this basis, I believe the proposed investment in our electricity infrastructure is a sound one.<\/p>  <p>  The costs of developing the North-South interconnector are not borne by the Irish Exchequer.  The project will be funded in the same way as other electricity and gas grid investments are paid for.  These costs are approved by the regulator and charged by EirGrid, ESB Networks and Gas Networks Ireland to energy supply companies.  The energy supply companies generally include these costs in customer bills.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700026#Y01400","speaker":"1234"},{"type":"speech","time":1486487400,"counter":329,"content":"<p>Given that the overall cost of the North-South interconnector is &euro;286 million, I suggest that it would be prudent for the Minister and the Government to put the capital phase of this project on hold until we know what impact Brexit will have on its financing and its viability.  Given that the project is being presented as a key part of the EU electricity grid, what implications will the departure of the UK from the Union have for it?  We are reading various contradictory reports on the possible reintroduction of a hard Border.  It is looking very much like we will have a hard Border.  There are questions surrounding the transfer of goods and services to the UK and through the UK to other European countries.  The potential for associated tariffs is unclear.  I suggest that this, when coupled with the concerns of those who are opposed to the project, means the Minister should put the interconnector on hold at this stage.  I remind the House that &euro;286 million is a phenomenal amount of State funds.  There is huge opposition to this project at present.  I thank the Minister for agreeing to meet representatives of anti-pylon groups in counties Monaghan, Cavan and Meath tomorrow.

The example that has been given in the past is the Aachen to Liege project, where there was undergrounding, but over a much shorter distance and with a lower capacity.

Following a more recent public consultation process in 2012, it was extended and now applies to 26 urban areas nationwide.  The ban has proved very effective in reducing particulate matter and sulphur dioxide levels, and has had the effect of significantly improving public\u00a0health.\u00a0 Research indicates, for example, that the ban has resulted in over 350 fewer annual deaths in Dublin alone.<\/p><p>An all-island research study commenced in 2014 into policy options to deal with the problem of airborne pollution from residential fuel combustion, in particular, smoky coal.  The study, undertaken under the auspices of the North-South Ministerial Council, was finalised in December 2015 and subsequently presented to Ministers.\u00a0 The report supports the extension of the ban areas in the Republic and smoke control areas in the North.  While I would like to see a joint approach by authorities to the introduction of an all-island ban on smoky coal, it is, of course, also a matter for authorities in the North to consider.<\/p><p>Notwithstanding the timing of decisions in the North and the position taken there, I am committed to extending a ban nationwide in this jurisdiction.  The process necessarily involves discussion and consultation with a wide number of stakeholders, including the European Commission, relevant Government\u00a0Departments and agencies, the residential fuel industry and the general public.\u00a0 Preliminary discussions on issues that may arise in connection with the proposed nationwide ban have already taken place with some of these stakeholders.<\/p><p>My Department is\u00a0currently developing a national clean air strategy which will provide the strategic framework for a set of cross-Government policies and actions to reduce harmful emissions, and consequential health impacts, by improving our air quality.  The strategy will also address a wide range of other national policies that are relevant to air quality, such as transport, energy and agriculture.  Residential home heating is a key source of air pollution, in particular heating generated from solid fuel and smoky coal.  As such, there is a pre-existing commitment to extend the smoky coal ban nationwide by 2018.  This issue will be addressed in the strategy and a consultation process on the strategy will commence shortly.

Anyone who has seen a child gasping for breath knows how serious this issue is.  That is why I want to see it prioritised.  One of the first speeches I gave as Minister was to an Energy Ireland conference.  I made the point that for me the issue of clear air and air quality is crucial.  Deputy Kelly is right to say the coal ban is a crucial part of this.<\/p>  <p>  I am keen to demonstrate my commitment.  The renewable heat incentive scheme discussion document was published some weeks ago.  I have specifically included in the document provisions relating to dealing with issues of particulate matter and nitrogen oxides.  The provisions probably would not have been part of the document had the environment division not come to our Department.

If this fails to resolve matters, customers can and should refer a complaint to the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, which will investigate the service provider's compliance with its contractual obligations.  Mobile operators have invested significantly in rolling out improved services, following ComReg's multi-band spectrum auction.  At least one operator now has in excess of 90% 4G population coverage.  The rate of demand for data services has, however, increased by 500% in the last four years and this presents a continuing challenge for mobile operators, regulators and policy makers both in Ireland and internationally. <\/p><p>Recognising this challenge, I specifically included in the programme for Government, a commitment to a mobile phone and broadband task force.  In July 2016, I established the task force together with the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, which has identified immediate solutions to broadband and mobile phone coverage deficits and investigating how better services could be provided to consumers prior to the full build and roll-out of the network planned under the national broadband plan, NBP, State intervention.  The\u00a0report was published in December and\u00a0is available on both Departments' websites. <\/p><p>In producing this report, the task force worked with Departments, local authorities,\u00a0ComReg, State agencies, the telecoms industry and other key stakeholders.<\/p><p>The report contains 40 actions that will alleviate\u00a0some of the telecommunications deficits across Ireland and the implementation programme on mobile phone and broadband access identifies 19 of these\u00a0actions as areas where immediate and direct action by Departments and State agencies can ensure accelerated benefits to consumers.  Included in the actions is a commitment made by ComReg to produce a mobile phone coverage map and another action for the regulator to\u00a0carry out a mobile handset sensitivity testing programme.\u00a0\u00a0Both actions will be of great value to consumers, including those in County Kildare.<\/p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/i><\/p><p>The work of the task force will also assist\u00a0local authorities in preparing for the roll-out of the new NBP network once contracts are in place.<\/p><p>In addition, I recently signed regulations allowing ComReg to proceed with an early 2017 allocation of spectrum in the 3.6 GHz radio spectrum band.  This will\u00a0provide an 86% increase in total spectrum available for mobile and fixed wireless services. <\/p><p>In my Department's Estimates for 2017, I have secured an &euro;8 million provision for RTE to allow it to free up the 700 MHz spectrum band.  ComReg in turn will make plans to allocate\u00a0this spectrum to provide for significantly enhanced mobile coverage.  The 700 MHz band is particularly suited to rural environments where the signal can travel long distances.\u00a0 <\/p><p>These initiatives should assist in enhancing the quality of mobile phone and data services across Ireland and particularly in rural Ireland. <\/p><p>In parallel, the national broadband plan aims to deliver high-speed services to every city, town, village and individual premises in Ireland, through private investment and a State intervention in areas where commercial investment have not been fully demonstrated. <\/p><p>The management of radio spectrum is a statutory function of ComReg, which is\u00a0the independent regulator of the telecommunications sector.  Licences issued by ComReg impose terms and conditions on mobile network operators, including minimum population coverage obligations.  ComReg monitors compliance in this regard by means of biannual drive tests.  However, given ComReg&rsquo;s independence, I have no statutory function in the matter of auditing mobile coverage. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700029#BB01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"speech","time":1486489200,"counter":376,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and I am glad to hear that progress has been made.

The Minister of State has still not answered the key question I have asked on three occasions.  Will he answer it on the third time?  On the basis of the ObSERVE programme, if there are certain areas where there are very large populations or where it is important for that natural world, will he exclude those areas from any future gas and oil exploration?  Or is this just to measure what is there so when we ruin it with further exploration we will know what has gone?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700030#CC00800","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1486489800,"counter":388,"content":"<p>It is not the intention to ruin any areas.

The Paris Agreement aims to increase the ability of countries to deal with the impacts of climate change through resilience and adaptation and to foster climate resilience and low greenhouse gas emissions development in a manner that does not threaten food production.  It also aims to make finance flows consistent with the pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development.  The Paris Agreement will achieve its goals\u00a0through a range of climate action plans, known as nationally determined contributions, NDCs, to be carried out by all parties and\u00a0which will ultimately\u00a0tackle 95% of the world&rsquo;s emissions.  These NDCs are required to be ambitious and to increase in ambition over time in order to achieve the peaking of global greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible and to undertake rapid reductions thereafter.<\/p>  <p>  The policy implications of the overall goals of the Paris Agreement will be evaluated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, in a special report to be published next year.  This report will assist the UNFCCC in establishing a system for measuring\u00a0the effectiveness of the\u00a0NDCs submitted\u00a0by\u00a0the parties.  A facilitative dialogue in 2018, informed by the IPCC report,\u00a0will evaluate the overall contribution of the NDCs to the goals of the Paris Agreement.  Beginning in 2023, a five-yearly global stocktake\u00a0of the efforts made by the parties to combat climate change\u00a0will measure their effectiveness and\u00a0drive the ambition of future NDCs.<\/p><p>The reality is that the European Union has been leading the agenda on this, and many other countries have followed suit.

I recognise it is an issue of great concern to all parties and none in this House and I continue to believe that improving our health service requires an all-party collective effort.  However, what the programme last night really brought home is the genuine pain and suffering of patients who are waiting far too long for treatment and the impact this has on their lives and on the lives of their families.<\/p>  <p>  I said I was ashamed.  That was not just a word; I meant it.  It is simply wrong.  How can anyone watching that programme not be ashamed?  It is not good enough for me to just be sorry or for me to say we feel ashamed.  What are we going to do about it?  That is why I began unapologetically targeting resources at the specialties with particularly long waiting lists, such as scoliosis and orthopaedics, and at treating those patients waiting the longest - something that did not always happen.<\/p>  <p>  More that 50 additional children and teenagers with scoliosis were treated with funding made available from the winter initiative but I recognise that this has not been enough for children such as Megan, Kira and Darragh.  However, the additional investment achieved progress for those children and young people waiting over 18 months, which is obviously a completely inexcusable length of time for children with this condition to continue to wait.  We also made progress on the overall waiting list of over 18 months.  This was done in 2016 with limited additional funding and in a limited timeframe.  Now, we must do more and I will make sure we do more.<\/p>  <p>  I have just come from a meeting with the CEO of Crumlin children's hospital and the CEO of the Children's Hospital Group and the director of nursing.  I am pleased to inform the House that from April, the new theatre built for the purpose of scoliosis will open.  This will see 194 spinal procedures carried out in Crumlin - significantly more than last year - and will see significant reductions in waiting lists for scoliosis and waiting times for scoliosis patients.  At the end of this month, I will receive from the HSE and the Children's Hospital Group an action plan for scoliosis and I will engage with all parties and none in this House and with advocacy groups in respect of that.  In addition, by June we will have an additional orthopaedic post filled within Crumlin.<\/p>  <p>  Therefore, we are responding to what we saw last night, which was unacceptable and needs to be addressed.  Everybody in this House highlighted the many issues in the programme last night that need to be addressed.  The issue of scoliosis in our children and the length of time they are waiting is not acceptable.  That theatre will open in April as a result of the nurse recruitment, an extra orthopaedic post will be in place by June and we will see at least 194 procedures carried out.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, we will have a priority initiative on scoliosis as part of the HSE 2017 waiting list action plan with the aim of every child being treated within the clinical timeframe and if that means outsourcing, that is what we will do as well.  We will eliminate the day-case waiting list of over 18 months by the end of June through the NTPF.  This will see more than 2,000 patients begin to receive their treatment from March.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE action plan, which I will receive at the end of this month, will work in conjunction with the NTPF to utilise capacity within the private sector and maximise capacity and co-ordination within and between hospital groups to treat the patients waiting the longest.  This will be supported by a further &euro;10 million fund for the NTPF.<\/p>  <p>  I expect the action plan combining these measures to be complete by the end of this month and for patients to begin to be treated under it by March.<\/p>  <p>  These measures are to support us moving towards a position where no patient waits for any procedure or any hospital appointment longer than 15 months by the end of October, which still is too long but constitutes progress.<\/p>  <p>  I have also today directed separately that the NTPF will audit the practices in the hospitals highlighted by the individual cases featured in the programme last night.  It is important that lessons are learnt and that the NTPF carries out its audit function to see exactly how each of those cases was dealt with in each of the hospitals.  The NTPF is already undertaking a review of best international practice on waiting list data publication models and I look forward to that work being concluded.<\/p>  <p>  Let me be clear.  When people ask about these waiting lists, this is the waiting list model that has been in place since 2002 under six Ministers for Health and five successive Governments.  It did not alter and it did not change.  Perhaps I say things are \"unacceptable\" too much but I say it because I mean it and we will work to fix this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700032#EE00200","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1486491000,"counter":415,"content":"<p>The Deputies have one minute each.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700032#EE00300","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1486491000,"counter":416,"content":"<p>I welcome the changes the Minister has made.

I will ask the CEO of the children's hospital group to revert to the Deputy directly about Megan's situation, because she would be better placed than me to do so.  I will arrange for that to happen.<\/p>  <p>  I agree with Deputy Murphy O'Mahony about utilising our smaller hospitals.  That is the reason I said earlier that part of the HSE's plan for this year must be about hospital groups.  Where some of our larger, level four hospitals are busy there is no reason that there cannot be more elective procedures carried out in the others.  I expect that to be a feature of the HSE's waiting list action plan, which we will publish at the end of the month.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to issues such as cataract procedures, raised by Deputy O'Dowd, these are part of the more than 2,000 day case procedures that will be carried out with &euro;5 million of funding from the NTPF.  That will start in March.  The Deputy is correct with regard to CUMH.  I spoke about this yesterday on the Claire Byrne programme.  I am concerned about what has happened in CUMH and I have asked the new clinical director of maternity services to report to me on that matter.<\/p>  <p>  I intend to publish an action plan for scoliosis and I will take what Deputy Aylward said on board in that context.  The plan for scoliosis will take on board the concerns of the advocacy groups and will dramatically reduce waiting times and waiting lists for scoliosis treatment for children and teenagers in this country.  That is what we all wish to do and I will make sure we do it.  If that involves outsourcing, we will do that also.<\/p>  <p>  I have asked the NTPF to audit the practices in each of the hospitals featured in the \"RTE Investigates\" programme.  I have asked it to use its audit function and check exactly how the waiting list procedure was dealt with and if everything was done correctly.  We saw one case where there was a clinical note and the child did not go on a waiting list for a period of eight months.  What happened there is not acceptable.  I look forward to the results of the NTPF audit, which today I directed it to undertake.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Murphy O'Mahony spoke about performance and accountability.  I believe managers must be accountable.  I am the Minister for Health, so I set policy and provide funding.  Then I expect our managers to get on with doing the job.  I have written to the director general to ask how each of the managers across the health service measure up in respect of performance and accountability not just on the financial side, which they are good at measuring, but also with regard to access to services.<\/p>  <p>  To respond to Deputy Mick Barry about the lists, this is the same way the NTPF has calculated the list since it was set up in 2002 by the then Minister.  There is nothing new here.  Did I know, and did many Members of the House who have been talking about health for a long time know, that when people have their procedures and an appointment for a procedure they do not appear on the waiting list?  I did.  Did I know the size of that?  I did not.  Did I know there was a specific other list?  I did not.  However, I am concerned about the people who do not have appointments for hospitals and who clinically need procedures and about getting that done as quickly as possible.  We are going to make serious inroads and, in response to Deputy Lahart, I did not mean to talk about scoliosis alone.  Across a range of issues we will utilise the NTPF and the capacity in our public hospitals.  We will hold our managers to account.  I hope we will work in a cross-party way to address these serious issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700033#FF00400","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1486491600,"counter":426,"content":"<p>I should point out to Deputies that, on foot of the proposal made by Deputy Martin and others this morning, the Business Committee is proposing to hold a special debate on Thursday morning on these matters which will be more extensive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700033#FF00500","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Autism Support Services","time":1486491600,"counter":427,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700033#FF00600"},{"type":"speech","time":1486491600,"counter":428,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter.  I am speaking on behalf of the Maher family in south Kilkenny.  Their son has autism and for the duration of his life the family has fought for any services they have received for him, be they educational or health.  The family has always had to fight long and hard battles to get anything for him.  I commend them.  I have much respect and admiration for them because they have had a very hard battle.<\/p>  <p>  Their son is now 16 years old and when I say the family is at a crisis point I do not do so lightly.  This is not something I would have considered raising as a Topical Issue if it were not important to do so.  Their son is no longer in school.  When this matter came to a head the family was promised 36 hours of home support by the HSE.  A behavioural therapist visited their home and it was a very positive intervention.  They were very happy with it and felt it would result in many improvements for their son, with a positive knock-on effect on the rest of the family.  However, without explanation or consultation, the hours were cut to ten and the behavioural therapist was not seen again in the home.  The hours were increased to 15 two weeks ago, but that is still less than half the number the family were promised.  The boy is unable to be in school which is detrimental not only from an educational point of view but also from a social point of view and all that is associated with being a teenager in school.  He has already been denied that, so it is rather disgraceful that it is proposed to deny him the home support hours.<\/p>  <p>  I have the family's permission to raise this matter.  The boy's father is a paramedic and he has had to take indefinite leave from his job to help his wife in the home each day.  This will have a negative impact on the family from a financial perspective.  They will end up needing a great deal more support down the line if no intervention is made now.  They need the 36 hours of home support.  It is not a huge amount to seek, given everything else they have gone through.  The hours were agreed and decided, so obviously they were considered necessary.  The family also needs the behavioural therapist to come to the home to carry out his work, as agreed.<\/p>  <p>  I ask the Minister to intervene and ensure the family gets this support.  I also ask him to meet with the family to hear directly from them about their experiences.  They represent not only themselves but many families in Carlow-Kilkenny who have had difficulties.  There appears to be a difficulty with services for people with autism in the constituency.  The family will be delighted to travel to Dublin to meet the Minister of State.  I ask him to facilitate that visit and also to intervene and ensure they get the 36 hours of home support and the behavioural therapist visits they badly need for their son.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700033#FF00700","speaker":"1266"},{"type":"speech","time":1486491600,"counter":429,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Funchion for raising the important issue of home support hours for people with disabilities.  I will take this opportunity to outline the current situation with this matter.<\/p>  <p>  I assure the Deputy of the Government's commitment to providing services and supports to people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives, provide greater independence in accessing the services they choose and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.  The commitment is outlined in A Programme for a Partnership Government.  It is guided by two principles: equality of opportunity and improving the quality of life for people with disabilities.<\/p><p>One way the HSE is working to improving the quality of life for people with disabilities is through the provision of home support hours.  In the HSE&rsquo;s National Service Plan 2016, the priority was to provide 2.6 million home support hours to more than 7,300 people with a disability.  The actual number of home support hours provided in 2016 was higher, at 2.9 million hours.  This reflects the responsive nature of the service and takes account of the fluctuation of assessed need over time, as the needs of individual people change.  This is particularly relevant in the Deputy's case.<\/p> <p> This year the Health Service Executive is committed to maximising the provision of health and personal social services, including home support services, within available resources.  In its National Service Plan 2017, the HSE expects to deliver 2.75 million home support hours to more than 7,400 people with a disability.  This is an increase of 150,000 hours more than the last year&rsquo;s target.  The goal is to help as many people as we can.  This is a positive development, which I hope we can build on in years to come.<\/p> <p> The Deputy has raised the matter of an individual case and the home support hours which are being provided to that person.  I am reluctant to speak in any great detail about the specifics of any one case.  This is especially true when it comes to speaking on the floor of the D&aacute;il.  However, given that the Deputy has permission from the family, it is fine by me.  I have made enquiries about the case and I understand the HSE is engaging closely with the family involved.<\/p> <p> Due to the specific nature of the needs of the person in question, it was agreed to introduce home supports on a gradual basis.  Initially, the person is receiving home support at a ratio of two staff working with the person with a disability for ten hours.  Given that there are two staff involved, this equates to 20 hours of home support.  The hope is to increase this gradually to 15 hours, or 30 hours when we take the two staff into account.  The HSE has informed me that the family is aware that the service will be closely monitored and reviewed by relevant professionals, in consultation with the individual, his parents and a family advocate.  I will meet the family and will arrange it through the Deputy any time over the next few weeks.  Parents of autistic children and teenagers have to be a major priority in the delivery of services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700033#FF00800","speaker":"1359","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486492200,"counter":431,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State and I welcome the fact he will meet the family.

The ten hours of home support is in place for a year.  How gradual is it?  Will they have to wait another year for the hours to increase?  I take exception to the issue of the two staff.  There is possibly a need for two staff and I have no difficulty with it.  However, the family should not be classed as having 20 hours because two staff are there.  The two people are in the home for only ten or 15 hours and it is an unfair calculation on the part of the HSE.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome that the Minister of State is willing to meet the family and maybe we can discuss it further at that stage.  Although I would be reluctant to raise something like this as a Topical Issue matter, it is important and sometimes it is the best way to highlight the situation on behalf of the family and many others in my constituency who suffer as a result of a lack of support services for children, particularly teenagers who have autism.  It can be very difficult when a person reaches the teenage years and is in that in-between stage between child and adult.

They are very important.  I will ensure the Carlow-Kilkenny disability services will continue to engage with the family on an ongoing basis regarding their son.  An inter-agency and interdisciplinary case review was held on 25 January when health professionals recommended that, given the person's situation, it would be appropriate to introduce home community support for him on a phased basis.  The home support services started on 30 January, one week ago.  Further meetings will take place as determined by the individual's needs and will involve relevant inter-agency and professionals, the family and their advocate.  The HSE has also advised the family that it is available to collaborate with the relevant professionals in the Department of Education and Skills.  This is important.<\/p>  <p>  I was directly involved in the negotiations regarding the HSE social care plan and I saw the gap there.  The Deputy probably noticed that in the plan, funding for personal assistant, PA, hours has increased for 2017.  In 2017, we expect to deliver 1.4 million PA hours to 2,357 adults with physical or sensory disabilities.  This is an increase of 100,000 hours compared with 2016.  When dealing with individuals and huge sums of money, we must ensure the service is delivered, in this case, to the particular young person with the intellectual disability.  These are issues I want to hear about from the Deputy and the family at our meeting in the coming weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700034#GG00300","speaker":"1359"},{"type":"speech","time":1486492200,"counter":433,"content":"<p>The Minister of State's response suggested two staff were working with the person for ten hours.

I wish to share time with Deputy Martin Kenny, who also has a keen interest in the issue.  In 2009, when the Citizens Information Board took over responsibility for the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, MABS, offices from the Department of Social Protection, unequivocal commitments were given that MABS would be a separate and distinct service within the Citizens Information Board.  MABS companies were to remain independent with their own voluntary boards of management providing crucial local services.<\/p>  <p>  The proposed restructuring of the local confederation of MABS towards a regional set-up, which would involve six to eight regional offices being established, would be a retrograde step and should be rejected outright.  There are 51 MABS companies with 43 Citizens Information services all operating efficiently and effectively at the coalface, dealing with individuals and families who come with the full spectrum of problems and difficulties, especially mortgage issues.<\/p>  <p>  I do not accept the excuse put forward for restructuring, namely, the difficulty of managing the 94 boards.  The Citizens Information Board employs 74 staff and regularly uses consultants when required.  I recall that originally only four staff were dealing with MABS when it was established by the Department of Social Welfare , as the Ceann Comhairle will probably recall himself.  I have no doubt the employees and voluntary boards of management are prepared to play a constructive role in addressing any issues the Minister or Citizens Information Board has about their operations.  However, nobody has spoken directly to them in this regard.  Last week, the Minister of State told Deputy Martin Kenny there would be no change in the provision of front-line services.<\/p>  <p>  Why are six to eight regional companies being established and how much will they cost?  It would be interesting to cost them against the voluntary boards whose members come from various voluntary, State and semi-State organisations, bringing great experience.  Some of them are retired and giving their time and effort voluntarily.  What would be the management cost of the new regional companies and who would supervise the allocation process?  The essence of MABS is about direct access at local levels to the communities it serves.  Managing remotely has its own difficulties, hurdles and perspectives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700034#GG01000","speaker":"1370"},{"type":"speech","time":1486492200,"counter":440,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy and I appreciate the time he has given to me.  Tomorrow, a group is coming from the MABS organisations throughout the country to do a presentation on this in the audio-visual room.  There are 51 boards, each of which is independent and managed by local people from the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Department of Social Protection and various agencies and organisations in the communities where they exist.  They have local knowledge and input and they give their time freely to manage the organisations.  The system works perfectly and without a hitch, and has done since the establishment of the MABS organisations.<\/p>  <p>  The MABS companies have an excellent model for value for money.  The spend 80% of their funds on the salaries of the people who provide the front-line services.  The other 20% goes to rent the offices and pay overheads.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700034#GG01100","speaker":"1345"}]
