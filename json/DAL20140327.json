Between 2008 and 2011, &euro;384 million, or 60%, was removed from it.  Between 2011 and 2014, I increased overall funding to the early years child care sector by &euro;14 million.  These are the financial and overall economic challenges that we face in dealing with the issue of affordable and accessible child care, which the Deputy rightly stated was a key issue.<\/p><p>  My Department administers two targeted schemes that provide subvention for low-income parents to take up child care places, namely, the community child care subvention, CCS, and the child care education and training programme.  As the Deputy is aware, two new elements were introduced in 2013 to support eligible parents in taking up employment opportunities and to provide child care for community employment, CE, scheme participants.<\/p><p>  The CCS programme provides funding to community child care services to enable them to provide high-quality child care at reduced rates to low-income working parents.  The programme is also accessible to parents who have relatively average incomes on the basis of their entitlement to hold general practitioner, GP, visit cards.  As well as assisting families with the cost of such child care, the objective of the programme is to ensure that funding is focused where lifetime benefits are highest for families.  We want to provide high-quality child care for children as well.<\/p><p>  A number of issues have been identified with the schemes, including varying rates of subvention and different eligibilities, leading to inefficiencies and difficulties for those operating the schemes.  I have decided to review the two programmes to consider how best to structure future child care support for working families and to incentivise labour market activation.<\/p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/i><\/p><p>  The participation of the wider child care sector in the review will be considered as the internal review progresses.

This figure includes &euro;175 million allocated for the free preschool year under the early childhood care and education programme.  The total number of children benefiting from support under the programmes is in excess of 100,000.  It should be noted that while a review of the schemes should support more effective targeting, I do not expect that this review on its own will result in increased capacity.  Any overall increase in supports is likely to require additional investment.  The difficult position in the public finances that this Government has had to contend with has worked against increased investment to date but, as they recover in the coming years, it will be important to channel any funding that becomes available to schemes that fulfil their objectives as effectively as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032700003#A00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"speech","time":1395912600,"counter":11,"content":"<p>We are all as one in agreeing that high-quality child care is paramount.

Recent years have seen a significant fall-off in the number of inter-country adoptions taking place internationally.  The total number of children adopted into the top 12 receiving states in 2004 was 43,142.  In 2011, this figure had dropped to 21,911, which is a drop of 50%.  The United States, which receives by far the largest number of adoptions, has seen a reduction of almost 60% over this period.<\/p><p>  These trends reflect the significant decline in recent years in the number of children, particularly infants, available for adoption, as child protection safeguards have improved in developing countries which previously placed large numbers of children for adoption.  In many cases, these reforms in countries of origin have been given expression and impetus by their ratification of the Hague convention.  The convention requires members to strengthen protections for children, birth parents and prospective adoptive parents in the adoption process and to prioritise the improvement of systems for the care and adoption of children.<\/p><p>  The rate of inter-country adoptions into Ireland has been comparatively very high.  In 2008, when adjusted for population size, it was higher than for all other European countries and others such as the United States, Canada and Australia.  Therefore, in 2008 Ireland was still experiencing a higher rate of inter-country adoption at a time when a sharp downward trend had commenced globally.  However, reforms in a number of countries of origin from where most Irish adoptions took place meant that adoptions from these countries had peaked.  Vietnam, from which 182 adoptions into Ireland took place in 2007, closed to foreign adoptions in May 2009.   There were 160 adoptions in 2007 from Russia, but this had already fallen to 117 in 2008.  <\/p><p>  With the passing of the Adoption Act 2010, Ireland ratified the Hague convention, and this had important implications for the number of adoptions in Ireland.  Very significant efforts have been under way on the part of the Adoption Authority of Ireland - with strong support from myself and the Department - to promote co-operation.  I visited Vietnam and Washington DC in relation to adoption matters.  In both cases, we successfully concluded administrative agreements.<\/p><p>  We have been working on bilateral agreements with Russia.  We have made a proposal to the Russian authorities.  We have done everything to encourage and support the development of a bilateral agreement that will work.  We are awaiting a response in April from the Russian authorities.<\/p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/i><\/p><p>In the case of Vietnam, it was the first such agreement concluded with any country.  The Adoption Authority is currently engaging with a number of Hague convention countries in relation to inter-country adoptions, including the central authority for India, which I visited last year, China, Thailand and the Philippines.  Haiti is due to enter into the Hague convention next month and a delegation from the Adoption Authority is due to visit there next week.<\/p><p>  It is important to recognise that although a country may be a member of the Hague group, legal and administrative obstacles may remain.  There may be no children available for adoption or restrictions may be imposed on the categories of children or prospective adoptive parents qualifying.  I am also aware that Ethiopia is currently seeking to bring its adoption standards up to those required under the Hague convention and I have asked the Adoption Authority to keep me updated on the position.<\/p><p>   Russia has not ratified the Hague convention.  However, my Department is continuing its discussion with the Russian authorities with a view to exploring the possibilities of establishing a bilateral agreement.  I visited Russia last year to further these relations and my Department and the Adoption Authority subsequently hosted a visit from the Russian authorities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032700004#B01300","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"speech","time":1395913200,"counter":28,"content":"<p>The international statistics are welcome in so far as this is about children in the first instance, and giving young children a new chance of a home for their care and happiness through life.

I have made a decision in line with parliamentary reforms that the heads of that Bill will go to the Committee on Health and Children.  When they do, the complexities and parameters of the situation regarding access to information for those people who have been adopted will emerge quickly once discussions begin on the heads of the Bill.  It will provide an opportunity to tease out the very question the Deputy has asked.<\/p><p>  The right to privacy has been firmly established as a constitutional right through a series of legal cases which began in 1974 with the Magee <i>v.<\/i> the Attorney General case, which concerned marital privacy.  It culminated in the Kennedy <i>v.<\/i> Ireland case in 1987 where a general constitutional right to privacy was recognised.<\/p><p>  The right to privacy was also recognised in the IO'T <i>v.<\/i> B case, a Supreme Court case from 1998.  The case concerned two people who were the subject of &quot;informal&quot; adoptions.  The majority of the court held that a natural child had an implied constitutional right to know the identity of his or her mother, though this had to be balanced against the right of the natural mother to privacy.  <\/p><p>  In considering the right to privacy of a birth mother in the context of the adoption (information and tracing) Bill, as I have previously advised the House, very complex legal and constitutional issues have arisen in the drafting of the Bill.  A particular difficulty has arisen in seeking to reconcile an adopted person&rsquo;s request for information about his or her identity with the right to privacy of his or her birth parent.  We are therefore in a different position to other countries that do not have a constitution.<\/p><p>  While I am anxious to improve the legal basis for access to adoption records, my proposals to Government have to reflect the constraints on the Legislature in providing such access if they are not to fall foul of constitutional challenge.  The Office of the Attorney General has provided comprehensive legal advice to my Department that has assisted in identifying the constitutional parameters within which the heads of the Bill have to be drafted.  It is on the basis of that legal advice that I have indicated there is a need to take into consideration the constitutional right to privacy of the birth mother.<\/p><p>  I understand that the legal advice did consider the IO'T <i>v.<\/i> B case, while noting, as I did earlier, that the circumstances there did not involve a case where an adoption order was made.  In circumstances where an adoption order is made, thus under law severing parental rights and duties, a birth mother's right to privacy may have more force.<\/p><p>  That is the legal advice I have at present.  A huge amount of work has been done to date.  I can say more in the subsequent reply concerning what actually can be done.<\/p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.  <\/i><\/p><p>My Department is continuing to work on the adoption (information and tracing) Bill and I hope to be in a position to seek Government approval to publish the heads of the Bill as soon as possible.  Subsequent consideration by the Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children will provide an opportunity to tease out the relevant considerations in detail and to hear the views of interested parties.

The good thing is that the heads of the Bill will be going to the committee and I hope the Minister can given some indication of when that might happen.  She seems to be adamant that the opinion being given, on what I would still call an alleged right to privacy, has some right way above the rights of children to their identity, which I cannot see.  Maybe I will be enlightened at the committee but I cannot see the basis of it.  The IO'T <i>v.<\/i> B case concerned a fostering arrangement.<\/p><p>  I note that 11 years after the judgment, when in opposition, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter - who we have been hearing in recent days is the foremost legal expert of modern times - deemed that the issue was not rocket science.  He said it had been addressed in neighbouring jurisdictions and that someone who was adopted across the Border in Northern Ireland had substantially greater rights than someone had in this State, and that it could be addressed here.  Maybe his advice could be sought on this matter as well.  <\/p><p>  The difficulty is that the judgment in that case made the assumption that a natural parent would not want to be contacted.  That does not have any basis in reality, however, because most of the adoptions were forced adoptions.  Some of those from the past were not proper adoptions at all.  All experience shows that most parents do want to link up with their children later on.  When they do not initially, it can be overcome and other measures can be put in place then.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032700005#C01000","speaker":"1015"},{"type":"speech","time":1395913800,"counter":53,"content":"<p>The Deputy's points are very interesting.  A certain amount of the scenario she has painted can be dealt with in legislation.  For example, where a birth mother has no objection to contact being made, it is possible to put in place a scheme and a system, perhaps with mediation and counselling, whereby if there is agreement to contact, that can be facilitated.  I do not think it has been facilitated enough in the past where there was agreement.  In circumstances, for example, where the birth mother is deceased that could be dealt with in legislation.  Where the mother cannot be traced but where it is reasonable to presume that she is deceased, that can be dealt with also.  Perhaps we need to examine carefully what non-identifying information can be given.<\/p><p>  A birth mother may be adamant and absolutely object to contact being made.  I do not think we have evidence for what the Deputy has said, but perhaps it is instinctive to say that there may be many birth mothers who would be happy for contact to be made.  In those circumstances, I believe the legislation should facilitate getting the records together in a way that makes them more accessible.  I intend doing this as quickly as possible.  There will be a statutory basis for ensuring that church authorities, GPs and whoever else has records would be under an obligation to provide those records and make it known that they exist.

In the case of historical adoptions we will examine the legislation and ensure it will go as far as is possible.

Fully 68,000 children are availing of the free preschool year in the academic year 2012-13 at a cost of &euro;175 million.  As Deputy Troy is aware, there are several additional provisions to take account of children with special needs.  These include an exemption from the upper age limit for qualification under the programme where a child is developmentally delayed.  In addition, children with special needs can apply to have the preschool year split over two years on a <i>pro rata<\/i> basis - for example, availing of the programme for two days a week in the first year and three days a week in the second year.  Applications for these exemptions can be made prior to the child's commencing the programme and they are granted to all eligible children.  However, most children with disabilities participate in the free preschool year without seeking these exemptions.  Therefore, the figure for the take-up of these provisions is far smaller than the number of children in the programme.  There are many more children with disabilities in the programme availing of the general one-year scheme.<\/p><p>  My Department has been actively working with the Department of Health, specifically the office of disability and mental health, in the context of building better supports to facilitate the inclusion of special needs children in mainstream preschool settings.  Furthermore, budget 2013 includes a capital funding programme providing grants under four strands, one of which was specifically for grants to improve the accessibility of services for children with disabilities.  This was secured and included by my Department in the budget.<\/p><p>  I believe a second year would be particularly beneficial for children with special needs and I would like to be in a position to deliver on this.  However, the introduction of a second preschool year for children with special needs alone at this point would require the introduction of a detailed evaluation and appeals process, which would require extra funding.  I discussed the issue with the National Disability Authority last year.  The representatives of the authority were not in favour of a second year for children with disabilities on their own.  They took the view that it would not be in line with the mainstream policy for children with disabilities.  In other words, they would prefer a second year to be available to all children, and children with disabilities would be able to benefit from that.<\/p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/i><\/p><p>  Future developments relating to early years care and education are being considered as part of the preparation of the new national early years strategy.

One of the recommendations in the report for consideration in the preparation of the strategy is to extend the free preschool provision, but only after achieving higher quality standards, more investment in training and mentoring and professionalisation of the early years workforce.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032700006#D00600","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"speech","time":1395914400,"counter":61,"content":"<p>I do not expect the Minister to have the information I am seeking today.

The HSE is involved, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs is involved and the Department of Education and Skills is involved.  The current contract for the free preschool year gives child care providers the option to refuse children with special educational needs if they do not have the resources to cater for their individual needs, and that is what is happening.  This was raised when we discussed the matter under Private Members' business.  There is anecdotal evidence of this taking place throughout the country because of the <i>ad hoc<\/i> nature of how the service is being administered.  It raises the question of whether this is truly a universal scheme, since the legislation enables contractors to refuse a child with special educational needs on the grounds that the State is not giving them the necessary supports to ensure service provision for these children.

My focus on quality services and the qualifications of staff means the support children get will improve continously.

It is also the case that there are now more than 2,000 inspection reports online.<\/p><p>  I have commenced the review of CCS and CETS as a number of issues have been identified in the schemes, including varying rates for subvention and different eligibility criteria.  I have commenced an internal review of these child-care support programmes to consider how best to structure them going forward.

Sustainability is an issue.  I believe that the sector needs to grow and be supported and that the people working in the sector need to have a career path.  This is the reason we are introducing the mentoring schemes.

I welcome the opportunity to speak about the child care committees.  Thirty-three city and county child care committees were established in 2001 under the office of the Minister of State with responsibility for children to help support the development of local child care.  The current role of the committees is to assist the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in improving and expanding the quality of child care services available to parents in their area.  The committees offer information and guidance locally on a wide variety of services, including advice on establishing a child care business, organising child care information sessions and supporting parents by providing information on local facilities and parent networks.  The committees also have a significant role in the delivery of a range of child care support programmes which are currently implemented by the Department.<\/p><p>  Each committee submits an annual implementation plan which outlines its strategy for the year and the annual funding level is determined on the basis of this plan.  The implementation plan provides for a range of activities to be undertaken by the committees and identifies locally focused initiatives which are designed to address specific local needs.  In 2014, a total of just over &euro;10 million has been allocated to the child care committees.  All Deputies will acknowledge that these committees have played an important role in the development of child care services in local areas since their introduction in 2001.  They have worked closely with this Department and previously with the former office of the Minister for Children in co-ordinating the increase in the number of child care places in their areas.  The introduction of the additional support programmes and the expansion of the existing programmes have significantly increased the workload undertaken by the committees.<\/p><p>  In answer to the Deputy's question, the committees will continue to play a key role in the ongoing development of child care services and will have a central role in supporting the implementation of new and emerging child care policy developments, including in the area of quality improvements.  Future developments with respect to child care committees can be further considered in the context of the establishment this year of a new national quality support service for early years and child care services which forms a key objective of my eight-point agenda to improve quality standards in early years and child care services.  Increasingly, the Department works collectively with the committees.  It is important to bring together the information and the views of the child care committees in order to have a national picture of their work.  They have tended to work locally, but we are focusing on bringing them together and obtaining good-quality data from them and also having the benefit of their insights about what is happening in order to identify key issues in the sector and, indeed, key solutions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032700008#F00600","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"speech","time":1395915600,"counter":91,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for her reply.

Accepting that tax breaks represent the only loose money in the system, is the Minister going to make a strong case that tax breaks between now and 2016 should be targeted at reducing the cost of child care for people who are working so as to make it worth their while to work and pay for good quality and registered care providers?

I am keen to progress it as soon as possible, as a lot of work has been done on it.  Legal advice has been sought in detailed discussions with the Attorney General.  I met her in recent weeks to consider how we could progress the legislation and what could be included in the heads of the Bill.  I will have these finalised as soon as possible and submitted for the consideration of the Government in advance of referral to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children.  As I stated, it has involved complex legal and constitutional issues.  The legislative proposals will address the circumstances in which identifying and non-identifying information may be provided.  They will also examine the processes needed to be put in place to assist those seeking information.  The most difficult situations to be addressed are those where the consent of other parties such as natural mothers has not been given for the release of information.<\/p><p>  We also need to build an infrastructure that will support those seeking information, as well as for the maintenance and accessibility of the relevant records.  Recently I had discussions with Gordon Jeyes who assured me this was one of the priorities in the Child and Family Agency&rsquo;s business plan, with five social workers allocated to work in this area to ensure those seeking information received a quality service.  A lot of work still has to be done in this area as it has been neglected in the past.  Considerable infrastructure will have to be provided to deal with at least 50,000 files, if not more, as we will not have the full number until we introduce the statutory obligation on the agencies which hold these records.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032700010#H00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"speech","time":1395916800,"counter":120,"content":"<p>I heard the Minister's earlier reply on the strong legal advice about the constitutional protection of the rights of the natural mother to privacy.

Obviously, there are many demands on the Child and Family Agency and this is one of many.  I have, however, identified it as an important priority area because the needs of those seeking adoption information are important.  There has not been enough focus up to now on bringing the records together.  It is an urgent task to have them brought together and made accessible.<\/p><p>  The focus of my approach has been on examining how far the legislation can go within the constitutional parameters, meaning that my focus has not been on constitutional change.  I have been seeking to clarify how much can be contained in the legislation.  I have already given a lot of detail to the House today on the range of areas in which information can be provided.  I believe information can be provided where the birth mother has given consent or is deceased.  In cases in which the birth mother cannot be traced, it might be possible for information to be given.  Non-identifying information which would not infringe on the privacy of the relevant person may be provided, subject to the requirement that the person be consulted.  Information could be provided in exceptional or compelling circumstances through an application to the High Court.  I want the health committee to examine how wide the legislation can be in making information more accessible.  The proposed legislation could do a lot in improving the current position.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032700010#H00900","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"speech","time":1395917400,"counter":122,"content":"<p>We have gone over time, but as the Deputy said, it is Thursday.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032700011#J00100","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1395917400,"counter":123,"content":"<p>With the Chair's indulgence, given that the greatest volume of cases would be historic, is consideration being given to drawing a line in the sand, so to speak, where these issues of competing rights and conflicts would be confined to the past and not continue?
