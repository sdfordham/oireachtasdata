We will have two hours to discuss the budget later in the day.  I hope the Government will take the opportunity afforded by the budget to reverse the cuts to the home help service it introduced this year.  I also hope it will live up to the commitments it made in the programme for Government.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, will have the opportunity later today to indicate in clear terms that he wants to protect the least well off, the disabled and the infirm.  I hope the Government will take the opportunities to which I refer but we will discuss that matter later.<\/p><p>Will the Deputy Leader arrange a debate in due course in respect of the resourcing of An Bord Plean\u00e1la?  I make this request because I have become aware of a number of shovel-ready projects in Dublin in respect of which finance is available but which have been delayed because they are before An Bord Plean\u00e1la.  I accept that this is through no fault of the staff of An Bord Plean\u00e1la.  I am of the view that we must give consideration to the overall resourcing relating to this organisation.  There are two projects of which I am aware where there is a danger of the finance being withdrawn as a result of the objections of a single individual.  Objections are fine and people are entitled to make them but An Bord Plean\u00e1la has extended its periods of consideration in respect of the projects to which I refer.  I am sure there are similar projects throughout the country which could give rise to job creation and attract investment in these very difficult economic times.<\/p><p>Will the Deputy Leader arrange for a debate with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan - when he returns from abroad - in respect of this matter?  Such a debate would allow the Minister to outline the plans he has to properly resource An Bord Plean\u00e1la.  Everyone is aware that local authorities each have similar numbers of staff in their planning offices as were there when there was much more work to be done.  How many of these staff could be transferred to An Bord Plean\u00e1la in order to try to expedite planning decisions?  I am concerned that we will lose a number of quite significant projects as a result of delays within An Bord Plean\u00e1la.  It would be worthwhile discussing this matter, particularly if it assists in getting projects off the ground and attracting investment to towns and cities throughout the country.  This is a serious matter of which, I am sure, colleagues have been made aware.<\/p><p>Will the Deputy Leader arrange a debate in respect of palliative care as soon as possible?  I have made requests to the Leader on four different occasions in respect of the holding of such a debate.  Many Members met representatives from the One Day More group in July and I was given a commitment immediately after that meeting that a proper debate would be held in respect of this matter.  It is very important that such a debate should take place.

When created, this will be the second largest agency in the State and it will have the potential to impact on the lives of all children in Ireland.  I am extremely concerned by the fact that the report of the relevant task force into the agency was published in July.  I have requested a debate on this and other issues relating to children on a number of occasions.  I am of the view that this is a particularly pressing matter.  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs is supposed to introduce a Bill to facilitate the establishment of the agency, which was due to be in place by 1 January next.  In order to facilitate a debate on this matter, I took the opportunity this morning to write to the Cathaoirleach and suggest the names of three people who could be invited to address the House on the proposed new child and family support agency.  Even if the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs is not available, the Seanad should proceed to engage in a debate on this matter.  This agency is too important and we should not be obliged to await the publication of the Bill before engaging in a discussion on it.  As already stated, a report has been produced in respect of what will be the second largest agency in the State.  Regardless of whether it is resources or children's lives, we should engage in a debate on this matter at the very earliest opportunity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120500003#B00700","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1354703400,"counter":12,"content":"<p>This is a very important day.

The sums in this regard are easy.  Why are we paying these people off?  The money in question is just going to be put into an incinerator.

While we are currently involved with the budget, I ask the Leader to arrange a debate early in the new year on the measures being taken by Ireland to address climate change.  I am familiar with the foresight programme which is being developed by Teagasc.  This is a measure to prepare the agriculture sector for what faces us.  We need to be well briefed and well informed about this issue.  Climate change is not just about buying salt for icy driveways or clamps for walking on icy footpaths or sexy wellingtons; there is much more at stake.

The time allowed for appeals to the board is extended on a regular basis and this is very unprofessional in my view.  There should be a set time period and An Bord Plean\u00e1la should stick to it.

It is inappropriate that highly-placed senior officials and board members, when they leave, can within a reasonably short period of time, engage in advising and preparing submissions to the board.

All Government Deputies must show solidarity and unity of purpose as we act in the national interest.  Some recent utterances from Deputies, who are not in the Cabinet, are most unhelpful.  When the budget furore has died down, I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on the jobs potential in the restaurant and hospitality industry as The Gathering will bring large numbers of people to Ireland in 2013.  Recently I attended a presentation by the Restaurants Association of Ireland which highlighted a major shortage of chefs.  It claims it has the potential to create 1,000 apprenticeships and many other jobs in the hospitality industry.  Recently the association submitted a proposal to train 220 chefs and had 140 jobs available immediately.  It offered to train the chefs for half what it costs in some of the colleges and had the facilities to do so but the proposal was rejected.  Any opportunity to create employment, particularly in an industry that has been on its knees for some time and which may see a revival, should be discussed and I ask the Leader to arrange for a debate in the near future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120500005#D00300","speaker":"1118"},{"type":"speech","time":1354704600,"counter":37,"content":"<p>I am concerned about the length of time it takes to get anything done in the State, particularly in Government areas.

I hope it is near completion at this stage because it is badly needed.  Dr. Declan Bedford addressed the Irish Medical Organisation in the Royal College of Surgeons last week about the dangers of alcohol and the fact that Ireland is a nation of binge drinkers \"with a dangerous ambivalence towards alcohol\".  That should ring true for many of us.  He called for restrictions on the point of sale of alcohol and price controls.  He also told delegates that we had more places in the country where alcohol is sold than shops to buy fruit, vegetables or milk.  Time and again, we hear that the number of outlets where alcohol is for sale is at a dangerous level and it needs to be restricted.  Minimum pricing is needed.  A recent 10% increase in the minimum price of alcohol led to a significant decrease in consumption.  Will the Deputy Leader ask the Minister of State about progress on the sale of alcohol Bill and the development of his policy in this regard and schedule an urgent debate on this issue?

We have had a great deal of discussion about supporting business and attracting foreign direct investment but a startling report has been published by Transparency International, which says Ireland has suffered the sharpest fall in the corruption perception index in its history.  It shows that our international reputation is that corruption is on the increase from a business perspective.  The index is one of the most commonly used measures of political risk and it is used by credit risk agency, Standard &amp; Poors, to assess the likelihood of sovereign debt default.  Internationally, our reputation has not improved.  The report says the poor result comes after a succession of political controversies.  The Moriarty and Mahon tribunals published negative findings against politicians and business people.  There was further controversy following the publication of the final Moriarty tribunal report when the Taoiseach shared a platform on Wall Street with Denis O'Brien.<\/p><p>The report says that Ireland's failure to hold people to account for wrongdoing is also having a negative impact on international perceptions of Ireland and little action appears to have been taken on foot of the publication of the final Moriarty tribunal report.  Transparency International says that 45% of businesses have been deterred from investing in a country because of its reputation for corruption and Ireland could be losing \u20ac1 billion a year in FDI having slipped 11 places on the index.  This is startling and worrying and we should have a debate on corruption in business, our international image and the effect this might have on our credit rating in the financial markets.

It is impossible for us to deal with our very severe problems if we ring-fence 80% of expenditure yet try to resolve the fiscal issues with just 20%.  I thought that the Labour Party's requirement that people earning over \u20ac100,000 would pay extra tax, either through the PAYE system or through the universal service charge, was eminently sensible.  It was also a central plank in the Fianna F\u00e1il policy.  Not too many politicians would stand up and say the following for fear of being unpopular.  I thought that the suggestion made by Fine Gael of a 3% cut across all of the rates of social welfare was eminently sensible as it would be a small adjustment for people.

They have made it not so much a strategic asset but a valuable asset in terms of the social, economic and tourism development of the west and northwest of Ireland.  The work is vitally important.

Pyrite is a problem affecting thousands of homeowners in his area and predominately along the east coast.  I wish to start on a positive note.  A good deal of focus has been brought to the problem.  The figure captured by the pyrite panel is a little under 10,000 dwellings but our research suggests that the figure could be anything up to 70,000 dwellings.  Anyway, we all agree it is a major problem that needs a political solution.<\/p><p>One of the recommendations of the pyrite panel in its report of July was an extension of the Statute of Limitations.  We had prepared the Bill in advance of the publication of that report.  There is a grey area and this is not the solution to the problem - I wish to be clear on that.  It is only one small part of the jigsaw with regard to what needs to be done.  It is not necessarily the solution but, should he wish, a homeowner should be able to take an action against the builder or quarry from the date of knowledge as it stands.  There is a grey area because if someone saw a problem occur in his house in 2006 or 2007 then the Statute of Limitations would apply in many cases.  This proposal was prepared my myself and Senators Averil Power, Thomas Byrne and Diarmuid Wilson.  Under our proposal the Statute of Limitations would kick in from the date a homeowner received an independent, verified and approved pyrite test which showed that pyrite was prevalent above safe levels in a dwelling, whether a house or an apartment.  This would give the Government more time, and time is of the essence.  The longer this goes on, the more people become statute-barred from action.<\/p><p>We have an issue with another aspect of the Statute of Limitations, which relates to building enforcement by Fingal County Council.  The council is not proceeding in 31 cases against builders on the basis that it is statute-barred.  I believe this needs to be addressed, and the Bill can do that.  Some small changes need to be made to the Bill but above all the purpose is to give certainly to homeowners and to demonstrate that the law is on their side should they need to go down the route of taking a builder or quarry to court.<\/p><p>I have held discussions with officials in the Department.  I understand certain issues need to be ironed out with the Department of Justice and Equality and that it is not only a matter for the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  I realise the Department of Justice and Equality requires additional time to examine the Bill.  We do not propose to put the Bill to a vote today, but we intend to leave it on the Order Paper and give the Government a little more time.  However, if some of the issues are not addressed we will re-introduce the Bill in January.<\/p><p>I welcome representatives of the Pyrite Action Group, the Lusk Village action group and other groups from the Dublin and the north-east region to the Visitors' Gallery.  A substantial report was published in July at a committee meeting which I attended and during which I asked several questions.  At this stage homeowners need to see some real action.  Will the Minister of State indicate when the Department believes the pyrite resolution board will be established?  We have missed several deadlines up to now.  I understand there is complexity in this regard.  As the Minister of State is aware, this is a progressive problem; it gets worse and worse.  Will the Minister of State provide an update?  When does he believe the resolution board will be established?  Most importantly, has a decision been arrived at among the stakeholders?  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, gave additional time one month ago for the stakeholders to come forward with proposed solutions.  Everyone needs to know the position at this stage.<\/p><p>I put it to the Minister of State that I have visited houses in my area in north Dublin which are unsafe to live in.  It is not only that floors have been raised and doors cannot be closed; there are also problems with underground services, particularly gas, electricity, water and sewerage.<\/p> <p>Only a very small number of such houses have been remediated.  As I said earlier, based on research conducted by Fianna F\u00e1il, there could be upwards of 72,000 housing units affected by pyrite but less than 1,000 have been remediated to date.  An overall political solution is required.  The fundamental flaw in the pyrite panel's report is that it proposes a card system that would only bring about the remediation of the worst affected homes.  Anyone who understands pyrite will know that the longer it is left untreated, the worse it gets.  We cannot draw a line and declare that we will only fix and remediate a certain number of homes because the ones that remain will get worse over time, as the experts will affirm.  We need a political commitment to the effect that all dwellings that are affected by pyrite will be remediated and we need a systematic plan for this.  We also need a certified testing system and to provide assistance to homeowners to fund necessary tests.  Such funding could come from the industry and those who caused this problem or failing that, at the very least, testing such be deductible against the homeowner's future tax liabilities.  Most people only found out that their homes were affected by pyrite when their neighbours got independent confirmation through a pyrite test.  <\/p><p>Anyone who has visited a house or apartment that is badly affected by pyrite will know that this is one of the most serious housing issues that this Government will face.  I welcome the fact that there is focus here but what the pyrite action groups and the homeowners need is a clear timeline and a solution.  If we fall short by simply saying we will remediate only the worst affected dwellings, then we are simply pushing the problem into the future.  Admittedly there is a substantial cost to remediation, with estimates of up to \u20ac30,000 for an average dwelling.  The cost is substantial but the work is highly specialised, as I have seen in those houses which have been remediated.  We need to be sure that, for example, the new infill for the houses to be fixed will be properly tested.  Are we going to run with the British standards for pyrite or are we going to stick with the &quot;acceptable level&quot; of 1% of infill, which many believe is too high?   Before we move ahead with fixing the affected houses, we must ensure that we have proper standards laid down for the new infill that will be used and for the operators, that is, the people who will carry out the work.  We must be sure that those carrying out the work are certified, approved and have the requisite expertise.  <\/p><p>Local authorities have been very slow to deal with private houses in this area.  Dublin City Council has dealt with affected houses in its own housing stock, as have some other local authorities.  There is some evidence that this problem is not confined to the east coast.  I have heard reports of cases in Mayo and Clare.  It is also important to point out that the pyrite problem is not solely a housing issue.  Schools, other buildings and some major infrastructure may also be affected.  This issue must be dealt with without further delay.  We have already missed four deadlines and I ask the Minister of State to provide information on the timeline for the establishment of the resolution board and to indicate when the proposed solutions will be published.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government asked the stakeholders to come up with solutions and we need to see them as soon as possible.  However, if those solutions do not include a full remediation of all dwellings affected by pyrite, we will simply be pushing the problem into the future.  <\/p><p>Specifically regarding the statute of limitations and the Bill before the House today, it will go some way towards removing a legal grey area with regard to the date of knowledge.  Many people put the initial signs of pyrite down to settling, plastering cracks and so forth and it was only as matters got worse that they realised that they actually had a structural problem in their homes.  Most of the homeowners in question bought their properties from 2003 onwards and many of them are now in negative equity.  Indeed, for many, their homes have no value at all and will remain valueless until they are fixed and properly re-certified.  <\/p><p>The Government must examine closely the issue of insurers such as HomeBond failing to deal with this problem.  It has simply washed its hands of it.  When people bought their houses, they paid for their bond and believed it would protect them against structural defects in their homes but HomeBond effectively walked away from them.  We must continue to pursue insurers such as HomeBond which have not stepped up to the plate.  I know of instances where HomeBond has paid for remediation works in houses that are owned by banks but it has not paid for work on houses owned by individual mortgage holders.  The State should not be left alone in carrying the cost for this.  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government is the main body overseeing the local authorities and the latter are responsible for building controls.  Under the regulations governing building control and various EU regulations, the State itself will be liable for the cost of remediation unless a workable solution is found.  The insurers should be paying towards this but have simply decided not to.  I would like to know if there is any further update in this regard, particularly with reference to HomeBond.  I know that Premier has dealt with this in a different manner, to give credit where it is due.  <\/p><p>Regarding the number of homes affected, in my own area of north Dublin I know of at least 4,000 to 5,000 dwellings.  The pyrite panel reports that the total number affected is 10,000 but that is incorrect.  The figure is definitely higher and this question must be looked at again.  I do not intend to push this Bill to a vote today because I appreciate that the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Department of Justice and Equality have examined this issue in detail but that further work needs to be done.  However, I will leave it on the Order Paper for January to give the Government more time to come back with some real timelines and real solutions.  I earnestly ask the Minister of State to convey to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government our firm belief that unless the pyrite problem is solved for all affected dwellings, the solution will only be a half measure.  Having been in some of the worst affected houses, I agree they must be fixed now.  I have been in houses where the floors are inverted, tiles are pushed up, sinks and toilets do not work and where there is a real danger with regard to underground services such as gas.  We certainly need to prioritise and make sure that those worst affected are fixed first but we cannot close the door on all the other dwellings that are affected and that will get progressively worse as time goes by.  The cost of fixing such dwellings will only increase unless the problem is tackled in a systematic way.  <\/p><p>I thank the Minister of State for his attendance and look forward to his comments on the matter.  The problem must be tackled and testing is crucially important.  We must work out how we can assist people in getting their houses tested.  Standards are vitally important.  We have seen bad practice in the building industry in many estates over the last five to ten years and the last thing we need is unqualified operators coming in to fix the houses and not doing a proper job.  We must work with the NSAI to draw up appropriate testing standards and to ensure that those who are contracted to carry out the remediation works are properly qualified.<\/p> <p> One issue of concern for me in the pyrite panel report was the suggestion of talking to the banks that lent the original mortgages to see whether more money could be got from them by way of a loan for homeowners to fix their own houses.  In most cases these properties will have no value and their mortgages will be far more than the owners could get for them at market value.  Therefore, to ask individual homeowners who bought in good faith houses certified by local authorities, and who took out insurance with HomeBond and other such companies and did everything right, to go to their financial institution and borrow another \u20ac30,000 to fix a problem not of their making is unacceptable.<\/p><p>I thank the Minister of State for attending this debate and I look forward to the debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120500009#J00800","speaker":"1139","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354708200,"counter":106,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House for this important debate.  As Senator O'Brien has pointed out, this is a short and straightforward Bill.  It is designed simply to stop the clock running against families who have been affected by pyrite and to ensure there will not be a legal impediment to them getting justice and having their homes remediated.<\/p><p>This issue has been ongoing for a number of years.  Initially, when many families first noticed cracks in their walls, they could not possibly have realised what the source was.  Many people assumed these first cracks were the normal type of cracks that appear over time after moving into a building, but when they became more severe the real horror of what was happening to their homes became apparent.  In the legal context, it is important that the when cases are brought forward the date of knowledge is not thrown back at people as the day they first saw a crack.  Rather, it is the date on which they received an independent verified report that identified the problem as a pyrite problem rather than a normal structural building problem.  This is what the Bill is designed to do.<\/p><p>I am sure Members on all sides have had contact with families affected by pyrite, as there are thousands of such families throughout the country.  These people bought their homes in good faith and thought they were investing in a future family home, only to discover with horror that their homes have major building deficiencies.  Some people cannot even live in their homes now because their floors are so bad or they have other significant problems with the house.  In my area, some families have been affected in the north fringe area of Dublin North-East.  People are paying mortgages on properties they feel they will never be able to sell.<\/p><p>I have dealt with families who took out mortgages with companies that charge excessively high rates who have found they cannot switch their mortgages to one of the banks because they will not take on the mortgages of these properties.  Therefore, these people are paying punitive rates to mortgage providers and cannot change.  I have seen at first hand the impact of pyrite in homes on affected families.  This is an important Bill for them and we want to see it move forward and to see cross-party agreement on that.  We do not intend to push the Bill to a vote today, but hope Members on all sides will support it and stress the urgency of the issue. <\/p><p>There is a broader issue in terms of how the testing will be carried out, how properties will be prioritised for remediation and finding a fair funding solution.  I know from families I have dealt with that they were in shock when they realised HomeBond would not cover this issue.  They assumed that when they bought a property with the HomeBond guarantee, it would cover this problem.  We need to put a proper solution in place as soon as possible to ensure the remediation can be carried out and that the people responsible, who are liable, are brought to book and compelled to make their contribution.<\/p><p>In the broader context, in regard to both this issue and the issue concerning Priory Hall where there were fire and safety problems, families have found they have been left in a situation where they have had to chase builders and get involved in complex litigation, without any real backup from the State.  I have debated the issue of Priory Hall here with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, on many occasions and have debated the dereliction I believe exists in terms of Government responsibility.  Not alone should we deal with the issue of pyrite, but we should look at the broader issue of how the State should support families who find they have a problem with their homes.  These are the people who pay development levies, VAT and stamp duty, but when they find something has gone wrong, they are left on their own to fight these cases.<\/p><p>With regard to the families who have been dealing with pyrite for the past few years, we are now getting to a situation where we have the pyrite panel report published and, hopefully, a solution will be put in place for remediation.  However, we need to look at the broader issue of State responsibility for supporting people who find a problem with their homes.  The State, with all its might, should be the one to chase after those responsible and to recover moneys from developers, insurance and the banks.  It is unfair to leave families in a situation where they must take on legal cases themselves.<\/p><p>I appreciate the Minister of State is standing in for the Minister, but I hope he can respond to some of the issues I and Senator O'Brien have raised.  Senator O'Brien asked about the timescale involved.  We understand some of the houses with the highest priority will be done earliest, but we need to ensure everybody will get assistance.  How long will the process take and how will properties be prioritised?  Who will pay for testing?  One area of concern relates to multi-unit developments.  How will the process apply there.  The process is more straightforward in respect of houses, but how will it work when an entire block needs remediation?<\/p><p>What is the position with regard to families who have already paid out for their homes to be fixed?  They felt they had no choice but to pay out as the state of their property was so bad they could not live in them without getting them fixed.  Will they be refunded?  Will the Minister of State give us the general timeframe as to when the process will start?  When will the remediation panel be in place and begin its work?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120500011#L00200","speaker":"1154"},{"type":"speech","time":1354708200,"counter":107,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I am aware he is standing in for the Minister, but this is also his baby.  I thank those who brought forward this Bill as it deals with an important issue.  It is important to keep this issue and debate live and to ensure that every pressure possible is applied to ensure action is taken.  On that basis, I welcome the Bill.  I am not sure the Bill deals with all it should deal with in regard to the report and the recommendations, but as Senator Power said, Fianna F\u00e1il will not push it to a vote.  Looking at the recommendations put forward and the proposed red light system, I believe there are shortcomings in the Bill as it stands.<\/p><p>While pyrite is an important issue, it is not new to the table.  Pyrite has been a huge problem for families who have had to move out of their homes and some families will still be out of their homes for Christmas due to this sad situation.  The problem has been an issue since 2006 and 2007.  We need to ensure legislation is enforced and to ensure that local authorities have sufficient staff to ensure this happens.  This should be a priority and I ask the Minister of State to comment on this.<\/p><p>I understand that when the problem was mooted initially, the Department was in contact with the National Standards Authority of Ireland, which subsequently published a new amended standard recommendation on the use of aggregates as infill for civil engineering.  It is fine to publish a strategy, but it needs to be implemented and there must be sufficient staff to sure it is enforced.  It is important that those who sign off on contracts are aware of and comply with new regulations.  We must ensure these are implemented.<\/p><p>The new standard recommendation came into effect on 7 December 2007 and addresses the quality standards of new homes and buildings in so far as problems relating to pyrite are concerned.  If the problem had been addressed then in 2007 and if the regulations had been enforced, the situation would not be as bad as it is and the people in Priory Hall and elsewhere in north Dublin and around the country would not now find themselves in the fix they are in.<\/p> <p>More recently, in September 2011, the Minister announced the establishment of an independent panel to explore options to find a solution to the problem of pyrite contamination.  He took this action in response to the very difficult situation faced by homeowners who, through no fault of their own, had been left to deal with the consequences of pyrite in their homes.  These consequences have been outlined clearly by the two Senators who have spoken.  The report of the pyrite panel was published in July this year and its findings are comprehensive.  While the State is not responsible for the pyrite problem, it has a duty of care to ensure the regulations are implemented, if possible, in order that those who live in these houses are not left totally out of pocket through no fault of their own.  The builders and everyone else involved should be held responsible.  We need to find solutions to this complex problem for homeowners.<\/p><p> The report of the pyrite panel contains 24 recommendations and provides the Department and the various stakeholders with a roadmap to move forward and make progress towards rapidly solving this difficult problem for homeowners.  I am sure the Minister of State will comment on this.  The report examines a number of factors that have contributed to the pyrite problem, the most obvious of which is the building control system which is based on the Building Control Acts.  I have mentioned the building regulations.  I ask the Minister of State to comment on the new building regulations and the issue of enforcement.  The report of the pyrite panel states:<blockquote>Traditionally, Building Regulations in Ireland dealt with hardcore [the name given to infill materials such as broken bricks and concrete which do not really absorb water or deteriorate] in a general way through fitness for purpose and performance of the elements of a building.  Prior to 2008, Technical Guidance Document C stated as follows: &quot;The hardcore bed should be at least 150mm thick and should be broken stones, broken brick or similar suitable material well compacted and clean and free from matter liable to cause damage to the concrete&quot;.<\/blockquote>This would not have happened if the regulations, as written, had been enforced. <b><\/b>It should not have happened.  The expert panel concluded that before 2007, &quot;there was not an effective testing and inspection regime in place in quarries to identify the presence of pyrite or to ensure that the hardcore material being supplied was of an acceptable quality&quot;.  This is a fundamental aspect of the pyrite problem.  It is regrettable that an adequate inspection regime was not in place at the time, as it could have prevented the damage caused to homes and much other damage also.  That is the history of how the problem developed.  The Government and the other stakeholders are required to try to provide relevant ways of solving the problem.  We have a responsibility to the homeowners to do our best to ensure they are not discommoded further as a result of this problem.<\/p><p> I would like to refer specifically to a few of the 24 recommendations made in the report that are logical and in the best interests of the homeowners affected.  The report recommends that a series of certificates be developed for dwellings affected by pyrite.  It suggests the insurance industry should not penalise homeowners in estates where pyrite damage has been proved but should continue to provide standard insurance cover for all dwellings.  I hope this issue will be addressed when the Minister brings forward his proposals.  I agree with these recommendations.  It is particularly important for the stakeholders who played a part in causing these problems to take responsibility for their actions.  The two previous speakers have said those who are responsible for the construction of substandard buildings that do not conform to the regulations should take responsibility.  Last month the Construction Industry Federation and the Irish Concrete Federation were asked to discuss proposals arising from the engagement of the financial sector at upcoming meetings.  I have been told by officials in the Department that the pyrite resolution board is to be established shortly.  Perhaps the Minister of State will comment on when he expects it to be up and running.  How will the construction sector be forced to pay?  Will a levy be introduced to ensure homeowners are not out of pocket?  Some of them have left their homes, as Senator Averil Power mentioned.  How will those who have engaged in remediation action on their homes be addressed?<\/p><p> I have read various figures for the numbers of homes affected.  The report was contradicted when it was suggested information on the ground was indicating that the number in question was more than 10,300.  That needs to be sorted out.  If we do not know how big the problem is, how can it be dealt with by the building and insurance sectors?  The only recognised method of remediation of home damage by pyrite is its removal and replacement.  The report estimates that this could cost approximately &#8364;45,000 per house, which is not to be sneezed at.  When people bought their houses, they did not expect to have another &#8364;45,000 on their backs within a few years.  I appreciate that pyrite does not cause an immediate effect in all dwellings.  However, problems might be noted down the road.  While we cannot legislate for this now, we should ensure the regulations we bring forward will not prevent people from seeking redress in the future.  They should not be told they cannot be included in this legislation because they did not report the problems by a certain date.  Pyrite takes years to establish itself.  We cannot say there is a cut-off date by which all cases have to be reported.  It would cost more if everyone had to be dealt with at the same time, rather than being spaced out over time.  I have mentioned the panel's recommendations with regard to insurance.  It also recommended that the Statute of Limitations Act 1957 be reviewed, which is what the Bill is about.  I know the Statute of Limitations covers a period of limitations.  The Bill defines who will establish what pyrite actually is.  Perhaps the Minister might make a statement on how he is going to deal with the different recommendations in the report.  I know the Department is actively working on it.<\/p><p> I commend Senator Darragh O'Brien of Fianna F\u00e1il for bringing this legislation to the House.  I do not know if the amendment proposed is the way to go.  It has been suggested all of the bodies and stakeholders identified in the report might come together voluntarily.  I refer to the Construction Industry Federation, the Irish Concrete Federation, HomeBond, the Irish Insurance Federation and the Irish Banking Federation.  HomeBond has stepped out, but it should be made step in again.  The bodies I have mentioned which are directly or indirectly responsible for this problem should come together voluntarily.  If they do not, they should be dragged together kicking and screaming.  I do not know how that might be done, but they should be made do something.  As I said, the State did not actually build the houses affected - the industry did.  If it is allowed to get away with this type of thing, it will lead to more cowboys coming on stream because they know they will get away with it.  They have to be shown that they will not.  They should have to demonstrate where the funding needed for remediation action will come from.  HomeBond was established to ensure insurance would be available for this type of remediation action when builders and buildings failed.  <\/p><p> I will conclude by asking the Minister of State to speak about the pyrite resolution board.  A report on this matter is supposed to be brought before the Government.  Perhaps the Minister of State might comment on it also.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120500011#L00300","speaker":"1135","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354708800,"counter":109,"content":"<p>This is an important debate.  I welcome the opportunity Fianna F\u00e1il has given to us by organising a discussion on this important issue.  It is welcome that the legislation will remain on the Order Paper for further debate as this issue develops.  It is a major issue for the thousands of homeowners affected.  Senator Averil Power has spoken about the concerns of people she knows in her constituency.  However, this serious problem affects thousands of homes.  One of the issues that have been raised is the need to ascertain how many are affected.  As Senator C\u00e1it Keane said, one does not know one's home is affected until the damage happens.  One cannot know in advance.  In Ireland these problems generally manifest themselves after between one and nine years.  I am aware that it can take up to 20 years in Canada, perhaps due to climatic reasons.<\/p><p>At the bottom of this issue are the actions of those who supplied the building material from quarries.  As far we know, just five of the country's 1,200 quarries have been involved in the provision of pyrite material for the construction industry.  The main counties or geographical areas identified as being affected are Fingal, Dublin, Kildare, Offaly and Meath.<\/p> <p> On the question of the number of households, the report, which is very clear and independent, outlined the worst possible scenario and the figure it came up with was approximately 12,000 homes in all.  However, if other homes are found to have pyrite, that will obviously have to be addressed.  There is no question of the political system, either the Government or the Opposition, avoiding a proper, real and permanent resolution of this problem.  That is what we are all about.<\/p><p> In particular, I acknowledge, as every speaker has, the very difficult and distressing situations faced by homeowners throughout the country, who, through no fault of their own, are living with the appalling legacy of building failures, including unfinished estates, dwellings affected by pyrite or dwellings and developments subject to serious fire and other safety risks.  Homeowners affected by pyrite have been waiting for a considerable time, without success, for a resolution to this problem.<\/p><p> The purchase of a home is the largest single investment most people will make in their entire lifetime and they have a justifiable expectation that the home they buy will be a place of enjoyment for themselves and their families for many years.  They would also have a belief that if serious problems arose, they would be dealt with promptly and efficiently by those who are responsible, including materials suppliers, builders-developers and the guarantee or insurance companies.  However, for a significant number of homeowners affected by pyrite, living in their homes has not turned out to be the enjoyable lifelong experience they had hoped for and, in many cases, they rightly feel let down by those parties whom they believed would provide effective solutions in the event of problems.<\/p><p> I know all of us here empathise with those homeowners, and it was against this background that the Minister, Deputy Hogan, set up the independent Pyrite Panel in September 2011 as the first step to assist in finding a resolution to the pyrite problems for homeowners.  The panel's report is one of the better reports I have read and it is very clear, concise, focused and factual.  It is particularly clear in its conclusions and analysis.  Nobody I have listened to has said, and the report did not suggest, that any of the parties they discussed this issue with was shifting the blame for all of the building failures onto the State and onto a supposedly light-touch regulatory system.  That would be to very conveniently ignore the role and responsibilities of the primary actors involved in the delivery of &quot;fit for purpose&quot; building projects, including, in particular, builders-developers, construction professionals and the legal profession.<\/p><p> The key point made is that in terms of the training of building and construction professionals, there was no reference to the possibility of pyrite being a problem, so the professionals employed by the local authorities would have had no knowledge of this.  However, as soon as knowledge became available, the issue was addressed.  For example, in Fingal the issue first came to notice in June 2007, and by July and August of that year the county council had dealt with it and sent out notices to everybody concerned.  Effectively, the action it took prevented further use of pyrite in construction, which is clearly acknowledged in the report.<\/p><p> A strong statutory framework for the regulation of construction activity exists under the Building Control Acts 1990 and 2007.  The building regulations clearly set out the legal requirements for the design and construction of buildings, including those applicable to houses and extensions, while detailed technical guidance documents outline how these standards can be achieved in practice.  Responsibility for compliance rests primarily with developers and builders who engage construction professionals as required to ensure the requirements are met.<\/p><p> During the course of its work, the Pyrite Panel compared the guidance on hardcore as set out in our national building regulations with that provided in both the UK and Canada, and it concluded that Ireland's building regulations compared favourably with those countries.  Furthermore, the Pyrite Panel concluded that the guidance was reflective of the knowledge and experience available at that time in Ireland and that, on balance, it would have been unreasonable to expect that the unprecedented issue of pyrite in hardcore could have been identified by building control officers during normal inspections.<\/p><p> This Bill proposes to amend the existing discovery provisions of the Statute of Limitations Act 1957 to enable householders whose dwellings have been damaged by pyrite to institute a claim within a period of time commencing from the date the presence of pyrite in a dwelling or a neighbouring dwelling has been certified by an engineer.  This Bill, while well-intentioned, is flawed.  The amendment proposed is a very wide ranging proposal which suggests that the limitation period should run from either of two dates: (<i>a<\/i>) the date the dwelling or the other neighbouring dwelling has been certified by an engineer as containing pyrite that, in his or her opinion, has or is likely to cause structural damage to the dwelling; or (<i>b<\/i>) the date the house owner has been informed by the party who built the dwelling that the infill within the house contains pyrite that, in the opinion of the builder of the dwelling, has or is likely to cause structural damage to the dwelling.<\/p><p> Part (<i>a<\/i>) of the proposed amendment would alter the contractual relationship between the vendor-purchaser and the builder as it extends the responsibility beyond the subject matter of the contract.  In addition, in the case of pyrite, a significant characteristic of pyritic heave in Ireland has been its unpredictability within a development, with adjacent dwellings often reacting differently.  The recently published report of the Pyrite Panel alludes to this fact and discusses possible influences for this phenomena, including hardcore coming from different sources, the depth of the fill, compaction issues and so on.<\/p><p> Part (<i>b<\/i>), by only requiring that a house owner be informed by the builder that the infill has pyrite, alters current legal responsibilities.  The law must be certain.  The open nature of this proposal offends this concept as it provides no time limits in regard to liability.  Such a proposal could increase the costs of doing business in the State for those involved in the construction and insurance industries.  The law governing the limitation of actions must ensure that a balance is struck between the competing rights of the plaintiff to access the courts and the defendant to fair procedures.<\/p><p> The independent Pyrite Panel which the Minister, Deputy Hogan, established in September 2011 to explore options for the resolution of pyrite problems in private housing submitted its report to him at the end of June.  The report contains the following recommendation relevant to the Statute of Limitations Act 1957:<blockquote>The Panel recommends that the current legislation governing the Statute of Limitations should be reviewed with a view to ensuring that latent defects in buildings, such as those experienced from reactive pyrite, remain covered for a reasonable period during which the defects might be expected to manifest themselves.  The Panel notes that work has been done by the Law Reform Commission (LRC) and it would ask that the LRC would address this issue.<\/blockquote>I understand the Pyrite Panel had concerns that homeowners affected by pyrite could be statute-barred from taking an action against the builder or insurer because of the period it takes for pyrite to manifest itself.  To date in Ireland, the rate of presentation ranges from two to nine years.  While I do not believe that legal recourse is a viable option for many homeowners affected by pyrite as the resources required to sustain such actions is probably outside the financial capacity of many of the people involved, nevertheless, I believe there is merit in giving further consideration to that recommendation.<\/p><p> In December 2011, the Law Reform Commission published a report entitled, &quot;Report on Limitation of Actions (Statute of Limitations)&quot;.  The report examines the rules on the time limits for bringing civil claims in the court and makes 26 recommendations for the reform of the law in this area, including the date of knowledge.  I believe this report should provide useful guidance in considering the recommendation in the pyrite report.<\/p><p> The Statute of Limitations Act 1957 comes within the remit of the Minister for Justice and Equality and, as part of the implementation of the pyrite report, officials from my Department will discuss implementation of the recommendation from the report dealing with the review of the limitation periods in the Statute of Limitations Act with colleagues in that Department.  In this context, it is premature to consider the issue of the statute of limitations in isolation from all other aspects of the pyrite problem, in particular, proposals for the urgent remediation of homes affected.<\/p><p> The pyrite report which was published in July 2012 is clear in its view that the State was not responsible for the pyrite problem and those identified as having responsibility for delivering remediation solutions for homeowners include quarries, material suppliers, builders-developers, vendors and relevant insurance companies.<\/p> <p>However, while the State is not responsible for the pyrite problem or liable for the costs of remediating pyrite affected dwellings, it has a role and duty to assist homeowners to find a solution to the problem.  This was one of the key objectives of the Minister in setting up the independent Pyrite Panel.  Many homeowners have been trying to find a solution to pyrite problems, without success, for a considerable time.  There is a necessity to bring this waiting to an end and provide clarity for affected homeowners. <\/p><p> It should be noted that a sizeable number of dwellings have been and continue to be remediated under various processes, including by some responsible builders who are undertaking remediation works, works being undertaken under structural defects insurance and other types of insurance.  I welcome the progress being made and believe this is the correct approach to addressing the pyrite problem.  These processes should continue and should not be impacted on by remediation processes to be agreed for homeowners who have no other recourse for remediation open to them.  I do not believe the taxpayer should be liable for the costs associated with the remediation of pyrite damaged dwellings.  These costs should fall to those responsible.  I welcome the panel's clear view on this matter.  It is clear that the parties with direct or indirect responsibility for the pyrite problem must face up to their legal and moral responsibilities in providing solutions for homeowners.  <\/p><p> Two issues in the pyrite report which have generated some debate are the number of suspected developments-dwellings and the categorisation of dwellings.  Following a desktop study by the panel, it is estimated that there are 12,250 ground floor dwellings in 74 estates that may be affected by pyrite.  These figures are significantly lower than the figures which have been speculated in the public domain.  However, the figures which represented the position in March 2012 are supported by a robust methodology which is set out in the report.  Having regard to the methodology used by the panel to arrive at these figures and taking account of the rate of presentation to date in Ireland, the figures represent a reasonably accurate picture of potential future exposure.  No substantive basis, of which I am aware, has been put forward for the 60,000 or 70,000 dwellings quoted in some quarters.  <\/p><p> Not all dwellings in estates where pyrite has been identified will manifest pyritic heave and significant damage.  The reasons for this are outlined in the report.  Recognising this position, the panel recommends a categorisation of dwellings to determine appropriate remediation approaches which are detailed in the report.  I agree with the recommendation that it would be unreasonable to expect dwellings not exhibiting damage to be remediated simply because there is pyrite in the hardcore.  This position is supported in the High Court judgment of Mr. Justice Charleton in the case of JEC <i>v. <\/i>lrish Asphalt which is on appeal to the Supreme Court.  The pyrite report details the basis for arriving at this decision.  The approach suggested by the pyrite panel to classify the dwellings into red, amber and green is a practical methodology to prioritise the remediation of affected dwellings.  However, a system needs to be in place to repair such dwellings if and when they exhibit damage in the future.<\/p><p> Discussions on possible funding mechanisms for a remediation scheme have been ongoing with stakeholders since the Minister received the pyrite report at the end of June.  While the outcome of the initial discussions was disappointing and the responses from the stakeholders did not offer the type of comprehensive and meaningful solution necessary to address the difficulties being faced by affected homeowners, there were some positive elements in the detailed responses received which have formed the basis for further constructive engagement with the parties since last June.  While the discussions have taken longer than initially anticipated, it is considered that sufficient progress has been made to justify the continuation of the contacts for a short period.  The discussions are now at an advanced stage and are anticipated to conclude very shortly.<\/p><p> The Minister has announced the establishment of a resolution board as recommended by the pyrite panel.  In addition to the discussions that have taken place, the stakeholders have been invited to make final submissions, which they are now doing.  These will be evaluated in conjunction with the outcome of the discussions and will inform the next steps in providing a solution for affected homeowners.  The Minister is anxious to finalise this phase of the process without delay and provide homeowners with some certainty as to how it is proposed to provide for a remediation scheme.<\/p><p> On HomeBond, we do not accept or believe it can be allowed to walk away from its responsibilities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120500012#M00400","speaker":"1069","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354710000,"counter":112,"content":"<p>Good.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120500014#O00175","speaker":"1139"},{"type":"speech","time":1354710000,"counter":113,"content":"<p>Departmental officials continue to engage with HomeBond with a view to getting it to re-enter the negotiations to solve this problem.

As stated, that may be the best time for the reintroduction of this proposal for further debate, when we can review what progress has been made.  The priority system will be based on the traffic light system, with red indicating immediate work, green indicating no work is required and amber indicating continuous monitoring is required.

I welcome some of the Minister of State's unscripted statements at the end of his contribution, in particular, those relating to the establishment of the pyrite resolution board, the commencement of operations in the first quarter of next year and the desire to bring this issue back before the House to monitor progress.  However, I am not clear on the proposed use of the traffic light system, on which I will comment further.<\/p><p>The Minister of State referred to the unpredictability of pyrite, which suggests there is no way of telling when pyritic heave could occur.  As such, all dwellings should be remediated.  When I originally heard about issues with pyrite in north county Dublin, I did not understand the nature of the problem.  However, I gradually realised it was one involving a chemical substance, one form of which I recall was once called fool's gold because people in the 18th century were misled into believing that because of its metallic and golden appearance it was gold.  The pyrite we are discussing is a naturally occurring mineral, with elements of iron and sulphur, which, when exposed to moisture, be it rain or dampness in the atmosphere, produces sulphuric acid which creates gypsum which then expands.  This is dynamite in the foundations of a house and deeply worrying.  <\/p><p>There are a number of parties involved, including the quarries which irresponsibly produced low grade material combined with pyrite and the builders, some of whom I understand have taken action against quarry owners and suppliers.  We cannot exculpate completely the local authorities.  Some local authority housing in Lusk contains pyrite.  I would have thought that local authorities had a duty of care when advertising and inducing people to purchase houses described as affordable.  How affordable are they if they are affected by pyrite?<\/p> <p>One can have any amount of certificates, but the certificates are not worth the paper on which they are written.  One hopes they will give peace of mind, but they will not assist in the sale of a house should that becomes necessary, as nobody wants them.  Many local people would share my opinion in this regard.  It would be entirely appropriate on budget day to introduce a measure that could be put in place immediately.  I ask the Minister of State to make this clear to his colleagues, particularly those in the Cabinet who have responsibility for financial matters in order to ensure no property tax is levied on these properties.  That would be outrageous for those who bought these houses in good faith.  I refer not only to affordable houses but to all houses which contain pyrite.  Regardless of financial circumstances, because we are all in a similar position, how can we possibly expect people to pay for the privilege of their houses being threatened with a chronic and systemic difficulty?<\/p><p>According to his script, the Minister of State appears to want to either shift or evade responsibility because he has stated it would be convenient for some if this matter became the responsibility of local authorities.  I have no doubt that local authorities and central government have a role to play.  The Minister of State made a comparison with the guidance on hardcore set out in the United Kingdom and Canada, claiming ours compared favourably.  However, he was very short on specifics.  How do they compare favourably?  What comparisons were made?  If remediation is to be applied only in areas categorised as particularly dangerous, what will happen if there is a row of houses involved or, in the case of semi-detached houses, if one house is excluded while there is a problem with a neighbouring house?  The problem will affect these houses, too, but this has not been taken into account, although the Minister of State acknowledges the unpredictability of pyrite.<\/p><p>There is the Statute of Limitations which I realise is troubling.  We dealt with this issue in dealing with the Magdalene laundries and it will arise again in dealing with the symphysiotomy issue, in respect of which there is a proposal concerning the timing of knowledge, although this may be difficult to prove.  The Minister of State has stated the report makes recommendations, but he did not say what, if anything, was being done to address this issue in a practical sense.  There can be talk - &quot;We must look into this&quot; or &quot;There is merit in that suggestion.&quot;  However, it would be much better if something was actually done, rather than having its merit acknowledged because this is something that affects people directly and on a daily basis.<\/p><p>The Minister of State quoted the Pyrite Panel as stating there were 12,250 buildings in question, nothing in the order of 60,000 or 70,000.  However, the report states there are probably another 10,000, which is a considerable extra number.  If one takes the sum of \u20ac45,000 for remediation purposes, that gives an idea of the measure of the problem.  However, it does not only involve houses.  What about the surrounding areas, including front paths and footpaths?  If this material is also found in these areas, they, too, could contribute to the problem of gas leaks.  I suggest this information should be directly transmitted to the gas and electricity authorities as a matter of urgency. <\/p><p>I have a series of questions posed by people who sought confirmation of the process of mediation and asked how it would take place, how cases would be prioritised and about the make-up of the pyrite resolution board.  Has information been given on these matters?  Will testing be carried out systematically and who will pay for it?  How will the scheme be project managed and who will do it?  <\/p><p>I very much welcome what the Minister of State said about HomeBond and the various insurance companies involved.  It seems extraordinary, but there is a suggestion of a degree of collusion between banks and HomeBond in that the banks if they had an involvement would pressurise HomeBond to look after the repairs.  If the banks can do this, surely the State could also lean on the companies to ensure they did the work.  What about compensation for those who have already paid, who, having been alerted, got in early?  Have they any chance of getting their money back?  There is also a question of standards concerning the infill.  We need to look at all of these issues and learn from the experience.<\/p><p>It is significant that the vast majority of instances, if not all, took place between 2002 and 2006 during the boom when there was a lack of governance and responsibility.  Former Senator Joe O'Toole had connections with north County Dublin and I remember him raising the question of building standards.  We were very lax; the lack of regulation was significant.  After all, people are supposed to sign off on projects, including architects, engineers and planners.  Presumably, they signed off in cases in which there was this problem.  I refer to the inspection of houses and associated matters.  Will the Minister of State give us an undertaking that houses will be inspected not only for the presence of pyrite but for fire safety and other issues?  There is the example of Priory Hall.  What happens if a project gets the all-clear for pyrite and six months later there is a planning problem because the buildings are found not to be fire regulations compliant?  It will be back to stage one.  This is an opportunity for us to insist on full certification that houses meet all planning and safety requirements.  Ultimately, it is not just a matter of planning or compensation but people's welfare, peace of mind in their house and their safety and protection against injury or death.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120500014#O00400","speaker":"1136","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354710600,"counter":116,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State for the debate on the Bill.  I also welcome the representatives of the pyrite action group, some of whom I met earlier this year with Deputy Brendan Ryan whose work on this matter I acknowledge.  He has worked with residents associations and in the Lower House has been extremely active on this issue.  <\/p><p>I listened closely to the Minister of State's statement.  As other speakers have noted, this problem started seven or eight years ago.  The real action to find a solution began 20 months ago when the Government came into being.  Although I respect that Senator Darragh O'Brien has brought forward the Bill, I put it to him and his colleague, Senator Averil Power, that their party was in government while the problem had been apparent for some four or five years and it took no action in the matter.  Although I welcome the Bill and the efforts being made, it is not right to erase the fact that the problem has been apparent since at least 2005 and was at its height by 2008.<\/p><p>I am glad that the Minister of State has clarified the number of houses directly affected.  During the time they were being built, builders and developers were running riot across the city, particularly in north County Dublin.  They did whatever they liked in building, charged whatever they wanted and ignored every building regulation in place.  The planners could not keep up with them; there were not enough of them to do the job.  The professionals who signed off on projects obviously did not practise due diligence.  I do not accept that the issue of pyrite was not on the horizon for professional bodies at the time.  There is no excuse for signing off on such defective buildings.  <\/p><p>I commend the Government for the head-on approach it has taken to the problem.  The Pyrite Panel's report has been in the public domain for a number of weeks and clearly shows that in most cases stakeholders did not respond to the problem.  Very few builders have gone back to fix it.  Most ran to NAMA or went under cover, while some ran out of the country - that is the way they dealt with the problem.  In the main, developers are only concerned with defending their own quarter, not with trying to fix the problem they created.<\/p> <p> When I hear the word \"HomeBond\", it makes my blood boil.  This organisation should be struck off as a result of the way it has treated people.  When I built my house almost 13 years ago, I encountered a difficulty.  I contacted HomeBond but in view of the response I received I might as well have contacted Donald Duck.  HomeBond is an absolutely disgraceful organisation and it should not be allowed to continue to trade.<\/p><p>I am pleased by the Minister of State's indication to the effect that the Statute of Limitations has been examined by the Law Reform Commission.  There is a need for movement in respect of this issue and the State must play a role in finding a solution.  The first step in this regard was the establishment of the Pyrite Panel and the next will be the setting up of the resolution board.  I welcome the Minister of State's confirmation to the effect that the latter will be in place by the first quarter of 2013.  We can then move forward and find a solution to the problems which have arisen in respect of the properties affected by pyrite.  I do not know whether there are 12,500 or 20,500 such properties but the overall number will be clearly defined.  The cost in respect of this matter should fall to those responsible to pay.  In the main, those responsible - both named players and others - are to be found in the construction industry.  The relevant stakeholders must come forward with responses in respect of this matter.  If they do not do so, they should be brought to heel.  This matter has been allowed to drag on for too long.  The day of judgment has come.<\/p><p>On this, the day on which the budget for 2013 is to be introduced, I will try to speak calmly.  Members of Fianna F\u00e1il introduced the Bill before the House in good faith.  However, it was their party which allowed the building industry to run riot for 15 years.  Fianna F\u00e1il drove the country into bankruptcy, it threw away the money that would help us to solve this problem and it is now showing concern for those who are sitting in the Gallery.  I do not accept what Fianna F\u00e1il is doing.  Senator Darragh O'Brien's Bill is welcome.  However, I hope his action is the equivalent of him putting his foot to a ball that is already heading for the net.  The Government intends to resolve this matter.  In that context, what is done must represent a victory for those who have been affected.  I hope that victory will become apparent in the near future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120500015#P00200","speaker":"1162","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354711200,"counter":118,"content":"<p>Ba mhaith liom f\u00e1ilte a chur roimh an Aire st\u00e1it, an Teachta McGinley.

Since I became a Member of the Seanad, Senator Darragh O'Brien has raised this hugely important issue on an almost weekly basis.  The Bill does not provide a resolution in any sense of the word and, unfortunately, is probably just the initial step on a much longer journey.  The Government must act in a much more expeditious manner in order to resolve this issue.<\/p><p>I agree with Senator Norris in a general sense in that this is definitely an issue in respect of which the Statute of Limitations must be addressed.  However, there is also a need to address that statute in the context of the victims of the procedure known as symphysiotomy and those who were victims of the Magdalene laundries.  The Government must consider lifting the statute of limitations in respect of these matters in order that people might have their rights vindicated.<\/p><p>The pyrite panel's report has been a long time coming and action in respect of it is still awaited.  Sinn F\u00e9in supports the Bill before the House as an essential measure in ensuring that those whose homes have been affected by pyrite contamination will have the necessary repairs carried out, regardless of when those homes were built.  The carrying out of such repairs should depend on the finding of pyrite within a property as a result of the carrying out of an independent test.  The pyrite report, which was published earlier in the year, indicates that some 12,500 homes - excluding those not in private ownership - have been affected by pyrite.  The report also indicates that while many properties require work - and many others will possibly require work in the future - approximately 850 are in need of immediate repair.  The report recommends that a monitoring system be put in place in order to ensure that properties which have been identified as being affected by pyrite will be dealt with swiftly if serious problems arise in the future.<\/p><p>People are extremely concerned because the problems with their homes must be addressed right now.  Regardless of whether we are pointing the finger at builders, at the fact that regulation was lax or at the current Government for dragging its feet, there is no doubt that people's homes must be restored to the state in which they would expect them to be.  This matter must be remedied as a matter of urgency.  The families living in the homes to which I refer and which sought to discover whether they were covered by their insurers were sorely disappointed when groups such as HomeBond - which behaved disgracefully and which refused to attend meetings of an Oireachtas committee on two occasions - turned them away.  I welcome the comment made by the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd, to the effect that HomeBond will not be let off the hook and that it will be held to account for its actions in respect of this matter.<\/p><p>Pyrite caught the concrete industry, the construction industry and regulators by surprise.  However, it should not have done so because there have been a number of serious difficulties with pyrite in other parts of the world.  Any industry should work to prevent problems such as those to which I refer from arising.  Many homes have been affected by pyrite; we cannot be sure that 12,000 is not a conservative estimate and that difficulties will not arise with other houses in the future.  The Bill contains a good measure in respect of providing proper cover to families who discover that their homes are affected by pyrite.  However, there is also a need for real regulation to ensure that pyrite-contaminated materials are not being used at present and will not be used in the future.  Such regulation should include a mandatory requirement in respect of the testing of heave potential in proposed building materials and more thorough inspections at quarry, wholesale and site level.<\/p><p>I take this opportunity to call on the Minister of State to redouble his efforts to ensure that HomeBond will be held responsible for its actions and that it will use its large profits to assist the families it disgracefully abandoned.  Will the Minister of State indicate how he proposes to proceed and what his intentions are in this regard?  There is also a need for him to report on the progress made with other responsible bodies which are contributing to the repair works.  We have called for the State to fill the funding gap in respect of repairs that are immediately required until the necessary arrangements are put in place.  If families are left in limbo while the negotiations continue, then the State has a duty of care in the context of providing them with immediate assistance.  Those to whom I refer should not be obliged to wait.  Will the Minister of State indicate when the resolution committee recommended in the report of the Pyrite Panel will be established?<\/p><p>There is a need for cross-party support in respect of this Bill.  I call on all Government Senators to support it.  As already stated, it is just the first step on the road towards justice for the people whose homes have been affected by pyrite.  These individuals have suffered enough stress and they should not be obliged to cope with the stress of fighting the system as well.  The State should support them and ensure that remedial works are carried out to their properties now.  Let us play the blame game after matters have been put to rights and these people's homes have been made fit to live in once more.  Those to whom I refer should be the first priority and we can then identify the culprits who should ultimately pay the bill.  The State should step up and do the right thing.<\/p><p>Ba mhaith liom d\u00e1 dtabharfadh Seanad\u00f3ir\u00ed an Rialtais taca\u00edocht ioml\u00e1n don Bhille seo.

His colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy O'Dowd, provided an outline of how it is proposed to deal with this matter.  It is important that the resolution committee be put in place at an early date in order that it might begin to deal with the issue.  I come from the legal profession and have acted for both builders and householders.  In that context, I am aware that there is nothing worse than arbitration relating to a building dispute.  Such arbitrations tend to drag on and the solutions always seem to be far more complicated than necessary.<\/p> <p>This situation has been continuing for a number of years.  It is important for householders that it is brought to a conclusion.  There is a level of uncertainty.  Many people bought houses at the top end of the market, not only have they suffered under the downturn of house prices but have this added problem in addition to the problem of trying to secure insurance in the long term.  There is a question mark over the properties, should they ever wish to sell on.  It is important that we try to find a solution to this problem.  We will not be able to bring a solution to all of the issues that have been raised but let us try to resolve the issues where work is required on the property.  The Minister has outlined the traffic lights system which require immediate remedial action.  I agree with Senator O'Brien that many who are caught in this problem are not able to get the funding to do the necessary work.  This is the reason it must be given priority.<\/p><p>We need to look at the issue of insurance.  It always amazes me that insurance companies love people when they want to try to sell a policy, but when a person tries to claim, they wish that he or she would please go away.  We need to readjust how the insurance companies approach that.  We have had this problem when dealing with flooding in Cork.  I have come across a number of problems.  One person paid insurance for eight years and because they had a claim for subsidence the insurance company does not wish to cover the property for flooding, even though subsidence and flooding are not connected in any way.  Insurance companies are looking for angles so as not to own up to their responsibilities.  We need to deal with that issue.  This has been already outlined by earlier speakers.  There are many players involved in coming to a resolution of this problem.  We all have a part to play through the Government, building industry, quarry owners and insurance companies.  If all the parties were involved in trying to come to a solution, the problem would be dealt with earlier.  We must give priority to the house owners who have suffered.  It was not their fault that problems arose.  They relied on the skill and judgment of builders, of the people who were supplying the materials.  They relied also on the skill and judgment of the people they employed to inspect their properties and also to ensure that regulations were complied with.  Questions must be asked about the first indications that the item being supplied was defective.  Why was action not taken at that stage to ensure that the supply of that material would cease and that it would no longer continue to be supplied to housing estates?  Who was responsible for not implementing that?  <\/p><p>Supplying building material for building is analogous to the car manufacturer who supplies cars and is under a duty and obligation to the people who purchase the cars.  It often happens that car manufacturers must recall cars so that remedial work can be carried out to make them safe.  We seem to have moved from that level of care in the building industry.  That is wrong.  A builder contracts to provide a house for somebody and contracts that it is of merchantable quality and that people can live safely in the house.  One contracts also that if there is a defect, that it is remediated within a period.  The problem is that the defects are identified after the six year limit period, which we need to consider.  We must be able to find a solution for the house owners at the earliest possible date so that they can go back to living in a normal way.  It is important to keep the pressure on all the players.<\/p><p>The other issue that arises is that the insurance cover limit is specified in cases.  If, for example, a quarry has \u20ac6.5 million insurance cover for any single event and if the quarry is supplying materials for a housing estate of 100 houses, is the fund for that entire estate confined to \u20ac6.5 million or \u20ac6.5 million for each individual house?.  We need to have that matter clarified.  That is one of the things that insurance companies are hiding behind, the limitation as regard the cover they provide and whether it is for the entire housing estate or for each individual house.  That must be clarified as we cannot ignore it any longer.  Senator O'Brien has suggested we deal with it again early in the new year.  We need to keep up the momentum to bring about a solution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120500016#Q00500","speaker":"1150","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354711800,"counter":123,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I welcome also the members of the pyrite action group.  My colleague, Senator Denis Landy summed up the disgraceful handling of this issue.  Senator Landy has dotted all the i's and crossed all the t's.  We know who is responsible and we know where we need to end up to resolve this issue.<\/p><p>I have not spoken on this issue in the House, but I have the greatest sympathy for the people who are affected by it.  I know that people did not know what they were buying into at an early stage.  People were depending on construction professionals to guide them so that they would not make mistakes but they were led astray.  This is a scandal.  It was symptomatic of what was permissible by the administration that drove housing developments, leading to the boom and subsequent bust.  When I categorise administration, I also categorise planning authorities as well.<\/p><p>From my layman's reading of it, there seems to have been three different phases in building development.  When I built my house in 1994 I had to employ an engineer in order to get a mortgage.  The engineer had to come out approximately six times during the building of my house and sign off at every single stage.  She had to witness every stage as the work was done.  If anything went wrong subsequent to getting the mortgage, I had the right to sue her.  I am assuming that right exists for everybody else.  Thankfully I did not have to resort to that.<\/p><p>Some years later, during the boom we were building houses that we did not need.  There was no doubt that there seemed to have been very much light touch regulation.  I was very critical of planners during that time.  I had experienced great difficulty over a six month period in reaching agreement with a planner on the orientation of the house.  We spent six months arguing until we agreed on a place in the middle.  During the boom if a builder wanted to build 40 houses in an area, the planners were more or less encouraging him to build 80 in the same area.  They were blinded by development levies as this was the only sector the local authorities were interested in at that time.  Today, we are in the third phase of building development.  The planners are sitting in offices with nothing to do.  They have one file on their desk and they might have it between six and 12 months.  They might find any number of problems.  Let me give an example, a constituent of mine applied for planning permission and the planner came out and met the applicant and the engineer.  There were eight areas of contention that the planner had identified.  The applicant rang me and told me that he could solve the eight identified problems.  All the problems were addressed by the engineer.  When we spoke I told him not be to surprised if the planner would identify additional problems.  Sure enough, it did happen.  When he had addressed the eight problems, the planner wrote asking how he would supply water to his house, to which he responded, saying he would drill a well.  The planner responded seeking a sample of the water.  He replied that he would send in a sample of the water as soon as he has the planning permission as it would cost \u20ac6,000 to drill for water.  We thought that was a logical response.  <\/p> <p>His planning application was refused on grounds that were never discussed or raised with him as a problem, the zoning.  We are now back to this nonsense because the planners have nothing to do.  They took their eye off the ball during the building boom.  It is ironic that pyrite is known as \"fools' gold\".  I hope the fools who introduced it and those who were complicit in it being used pay dearly for all the problems they have caused.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120500017#R00200","speaker":"1161","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354712400,"counter":125,"content":"<p>Cuirim f\u00e1ilte roimh an Aire St\u00e1it go dt\u00ed an Teach.

Unfortunately I have become very aware of what it means to many thousands of households throughout the length and breadth of the country.<\/p><p>Colleagues have pointed out that pyrite has affected more than 72,500 households to date.  I understand that only 1,000 houses have been remediated to date.  I join in calling for immediate action to be taken to remedy the situation that is causing enormous hardship to these families.  It affects not only the Dublin and the east coast area, where there is the greatest concentration, but almost every county, to a lesser extent in some counties.  One case, however, is a case too many.<\/p><p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy McGinley, to the House.  May I ask him to relay the concerns expressed in the Seanad to his Cabinet colleagues.  Grant aid must be provided so that the houses can be remediated.  I understand it can cost up to \u20ac30,000, which is an enormous sum of money.  In some instances, the premises might not be worth that amount.

Despite continuing to meet our targets set out under the EU-IMF programme, Ireland's general government deficit of just over 8% for 2012 is likely to be one of the largest deficits within the EU.  If Ireland is to prosper into the future we have to come to terms with the fact that borrowing at such elevated levels is not a viable option and, simply put, must be addressed.  Budget 2013 is the next step by the Government towards achieving this aim and ambition.<\/p><p>However, mirroring its predecessor, budget 2013 is not merely about expenditure cuts and increased revenue, it is also about supporting the emerging economic recovery and protecting the most vulnerable in our society.  It is fair to say that this budget achieves the core objectives and principles of consolidating a growth-friendly and fair mannered budget.  One of the keys to achieving such objectives will be the recovery of the labour market and getting people back to work.  The Government has never shirked its responsibilities in addressing the poor state of the labour market.  Measures introduced during 2012 such as the action plan for jobs and the Pathways to Work initiatives are aimed at tackling the unprecedented high level of unemployment and seek to complement the various measures introduced in budget 2012 to support employment growth, particularly in the job-rich indigenous sectors.  Budget 2013 aims to build upon these foundations by once again putting in place supports to aid key sectors capable of creating and sustaining employment within our economy.<\/p><p>Before addressing the specific measures in budget 2013, I would like to contextualise them by providing the economic and fiscal background against which the budget will play out.  Last year, following three successive years of decline, Irish GDP increased by 1.4%, and a second year of modest positive growth is anticipated this year.  For next year, the budgetary arithmetic is based on a GDP projection of 1.5%, a figure which is in line with the prevailing consensus.<\/p><p>I realise that for many people in Ireland these figures seem at odds with what they are experiencing in their lives and that such talk of a &quot;return to growth&quot; is not reflected in the difficulties they face in their day to day struggle.  The reason for this is that exports are the only engine of growth at present.  On the other hand, domestic economic conditions - spending by households, the Government and SMEs - remain weak.  Unfortunately, the overhang from the bubble period still lingers, as good, hard-working people struggle to find employment, as families are burdened by debts accumulated during the boom, and as parents are forced to watch their young leave the country to find employment.<\/p><p>There can be no illusions about the gravity of the task facing the Government in addressing these issues but significant progress has been made on a number of fronts.  As I mentioned, the exporting sectors are leading the recovery and the strong performance of these sectors during the past few years is a welcome development.  Exports of services, in particular, are playing an increasingly vital role, having experienced double digit growth in the first half of this year.  Looking at the year as a whole, the Department of Finance is expecting export growth of 3% this year.  Furthermore, last year was a record year for inward foreign direct investment and the pipeline for this year remains strong also.  I see this as a vote of confidence by the international business community in our economy.  The strong export performance and inflows of foreign direct investment have been facilitated by the continued improvements in competitiveness that Ireland has achieved in recent years, as relative reductions in prices and costs continue to bear fruit.<\/p> <p>The strong export performance and inflows of foreign direct investment have been facilitated by the continued improvements in competitiveness that Ireland has achieved in recent years as relative reductions in prices and costs continue to bear fruit.  This means our balance of payments with the rest of the world is in a very healthy position, with surpluses in each of the past three years, following a decade of deficits.  The most recent figures show a surplus of &#8364;3.2 billion in the second quarter of 2012, representing the largest nominal surplus for Ireland since records began in 1981.  Notwithstanding these improvements regarding exports, it is clear the domestic economy is not progressing in the same manner.  Although recent data provide some grounds for optimism - with retail sales figures having seen year-on-year increases in each of the past two months and with property prices showing their first signs of stabilisation - domestic economic conditions remain weak.<\/p><p> Let me refer to the labour market.  Figures released today by the CSO show an improvement regarding unemployment.  The standardised unemployment rate fell for the second consecutive month and stood at 14.6% in November.  Nevertheless, despite these encouraging signs, the rate remains unacceptably high.  I reassure the House that reducing unemployment remains the key priority for the Government.<\/p><p> On the budgetary position, the Government remains committed to achieving the deficit limits set under the terms of the EU-IMF programme and, in particular, to reducing the deficit to below 3% of GDP by 2015.  The target for 2012 was for a deficit of 8.6% and the budgetary documentation confirms an estimated outturn of 8.2%.  Therefore, this will be the second successive year in which the target has been more than achieved.  I am confident that clear progress is being made.  Our international funders and the international community recognise that our deficit, which is currently too high, is coming down and that we are meeting our targets in this regard.  Meeting budgetary targets is essential.  Ireland's return to the bond markets this year - yields on Government bonds fell significantly over the course of the year - provides a clear and tangible indication that Ireland's efforts are being recognised internationally.<\/p><p> For next year, the Government is targeting a deficit of 7.6% of GDP, a target that requires further consolidation measures worth &#8364;3.5 billion.  While the Government is under no illusion that consolidation of this magnitude could be achieved without having some negative impact on short-term economic growth, budget 2013 has been constructed with the explicit aim of seeking to minimise such an impact.  A key facet of this has been the decision, once again, to concentrate the adjustment on the expenditure side according to best practice internationally in order to support job creation and ultimately encourage economic growth.  No economy in the world with a deficit such as ours can lower it by pretending more can be done on the tax side than the expenditure side.  It simply has not happened internationally and that is why more must be done on the expenditure side than the taxation side.  If someone can show me evidence to the contrary I will consider it, but I believe there is no international evidence suggesting the quickest way to resolve a deficit and get an economy working again is by having a more vigorous approach to tax than to expenditure.<\/p><p> While some of the measures may seem unpalatable, all are necessary.  Despite the progress made in recent years, the gap between the State's revenue and expenditure remains formidable.  Large deficits mean large amounts of borrowing, and devoting an ever-increasing share of revenue to debt servicing is a waste of resources in a time of need for public service provision.  This year, it is likely that over 11% of all Government revenue will go towards servicing debt.  To put this figure in context, it is close to two-thirds of all the revenue the State will collect in VAT this year.  If we are serious about putting the debt ratio on a declining path and regaining our sovereignty, then these measures are essential.<\/p><p> Today, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, announced the introduction of a ten-point tax reform plan to support the SME sector.  ISME stated publicly this evening that this has been the most pro-jobs budget for small businesses.  I welcome its assessment given the announcement earlier by the Ministers, Deputy Howlin and Deputy Noonan.  The renewed focus on assisting the SME sector is a very welcome step.  While growth in the export sector is a strong starting point for a recovery in an open economy such as ours, it is our SMEs that comprise the job-rich sector of the economy.  SMEs provide almost 70% of Irish employment.  It is our continued support for these businesses that remains the key to addressing the unemployment problem we face.  The measures contained in the tax reform plan will, <i>inter alia, <\/i>aim to increase the accessibility of capital for SMEs, help in boosting international demand for their products and, most important, support the creation of jobs in these sectors.<\/p><p> Long-term unemployment, in particular, remains a problem, with the long-term unemployed now accounting for nearly 60% of the total number unemployed.  The development of the Plus One initiative, which aims to encourage employers to hire those who are long-term unemployed, will provide a welcome relief for these individuals.  Supplementing this, the Minister also announced a series of measures aimed at supporting job creation in specific job-rich industries.  Included are the introduction of a relief from capital gains tax arising on disposals of farm land for restructuring purposes, as well as the extension of the stock reliefs for the agrifood sector announced in budget 2012 and the extension of the film tax relief scheme, which will run to 2020.<\/p><p> Next year, 2013, looks set to be an important year for tourism.  The Gathering, although it has drawn criticism from some of the usual suspects, looks set to play a vital role in this regard.  The confirmation early today by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, that the reduced VAT rate of 9% for the tourism sector, introduced last year, is to be maintained will support further this crucial job-rich sector, which is a key part of the service industry.<\/p><p> This budget also sees the introduction of the much-discussed local property tax, which is to commence on 1<sup><\/sup>July 2013.  The benefits of a property tax are well stated.  Property taxes are shown to be less harmful to economic growth than comparable revenue-generating measures such as income tax.  Property taxes are a standard feature of many other countries.  They provide a stable income stream and help to reinforce local democratic decision-making by providing a funding base for local authorities.  If ever there were a decision recognised as wrong in our political system, it was the decision in 1977 to abolish rates, thus removing a key aspect of revenue-generating power.  Everyone accepts that this kind of short-term decision making is ultimately not sustainable where there is a considerable gap between expenditure and taxation revenue.  The new property tax is a step in the right direction, not only because it will create a new means of funding but because it will extend the tax base in a radical way.  Some 42% of all the taxes we take in are income related.  This is no way to generate employment or encourage people to work or move from social welfare benefits to work.  So much revenue is taken from the pockets of those who work.  Any western European civilised society has within it a property tax to generate the revenue needed for public services and to act as a counterbalance in respect of income tax.<\/p><p> The local property tax has been structured in a fair and progressive manner.  Those with the most valuable properties are to pay the most and those who are unable to pay in the current climate will be given the option of a voluntary deferral.  The Government has recognised the need for clarity on this matter.  Allowing the initial valuations of property to remain valid up to 2016 eliminates a cloud of uncertainty surrounding property tax.  As the Minister for Finance said in his statement to the House, in addition to the valuations remaining valid until 2016, the rates of taxation, 0.18% on the first &#8364;1 million and 0.25% thereafter, will also remain until that year, thus giving some certainty to homeowners.<\/p> <p>A key principle underpinning this budget is the need to ensure that the policies we are introducing are equitable and those who can afford to pay a little bit more bear the majority of the burden of adjustment.  Budget 2013 has introduced a number of measures with this in mind to protect the most vulnerable in our society.  Ireland's income tax system is the most progressive in the EU and a continuation of this fairness in our tax system means reducing reliefs which can be availed of by higher income earners.  The Government has announced a number of measures in accordance with this, including the introduction of standard rates of USC to those aged 70 or older who earn \u20ac60,000 or more.<\/p><p>Other measures of note which will ensure a fair adjustment include increases in the rates of capital acquisitions tax, capital gains tax and DIRT tax.  Last year we increased the rate of capital acquisitions tax and capital gains tax from 25% to 30% and this year we are proposing to further increase it to 33%, which is fair in the context of those who are making money in this economy paying a little bit more.<\/p><p>The budget represents the next step forward in terms of correcting the imbalances in the public finances and getting people back to work.  It provides clarity and certainty to the people of Ireland and addresses many of the pressing issues facing our economy today.  The Minister for Finance made an important point in his speech when he stressed that once this budget is implemented, most of the tax consolidation committed to by the Government will have been completed.  We were told this year that the adjustment is at \u20ac3.5 billion, with \u20ac1.25 billion on the tax side and \u20ac2.25 billion on expenditure.  The full impact of these taxation measures will mean an adjustment of \u20ac3 billion next year.  Assuming tax increases of \u20ac1 billion, half of this amount is already catered for by virtue of the taxation measures announced today.  There is, therefore, some certainty that what we have done on the taxation side, difficult as it may be for people to accept, is bringing us to the end of an adjustment process which has removed \u20ac24 billion from the Irish economy since 2008, or \u20ac27.5 billion after today's budget.  The cumulative effect of the next two years will mean that the great majority of the heavy lifting has been done.  I know that knowledge does not make it any more palatable for people.  I live in the real world, in a real community and in a real housing estate with ordinary people.  I am aware of the impact this is having on our community because I am also in the middle of it but this is being done in the fairest way possible.  I ask Senators to give the budget a fair wind and to ensure that we stay on the path of recovery.  The only way we can create jobs as a small and open trading economy is by putting our public finances in order.  I contend that the measures announced in today's budget are another step towards that goal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120500019#T00300","speaker":"958","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354713600,"counter":135,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the budget.

There is also a capital acquisitions threshold reduction of \u20ac130 million.  That is in conjunction with the property tax, which will bring in over \u20ac600 million.  That is a lot of money coming in.<\/p><p>With regard to pension funds, there are a small number of very wealthy people who will not have the opportunity to put money away.  I am talking about putting \u20ac1,200 per week towards a fund of \u20ac60,000 fund per annum.  While the measure will be difficult for some, it will be a lot more difficult for others.<\/p><p>I have a concern about the PRSI increase, which will bring in around \u20ac300 million to the Exchequer, as this will have an impact on people's take-home pay.  I have always said there is a real difficulty when people in receipt of social welfare get as much as people who are working, particularly the lower paid.  I shall outline an example given by the Department of Social Welfare - it is not mine - of two people who are not working and have two children.  The net total they will receive in jobseeker's allowance is \u20ac23,304.  I will compare those figures with the budget 2012 analysis by the Department of Finance.  Those people would have to pay 17% in tax and earn \u20ac27,500 before they would receive the same amount of money as somebody in receipt of social welfare payments - just to get the same amount.  We know that the average industrial wage here is \u20ac32,000.  This is a real problem which has been exacerbated somewhat by the increase in PRSI.  The matter must be examined and something needs to be done.  There is not a wide enough gap in earnings between people who work and those who do not.<\/p><p>An increase in alcohol excise will raise \u20ac180 million, but there has not been much reference to below-cost selling by supermarkets and I want something done about it.  The increases in motor tax and VRT have been well flagged.<\/p><p>We were told that social welfare was going to be hammered.  A figure of \u20ac500 million was quoted prior the budget and if one factored it backwards one would calculate that this equates to a 2.5% reduction.  That is not being hammered.  A reduction of 10% or 20% would be a hammering.  Not only did the 2.5% reduction not happen, but there was an increase of \u20ac150 million, which I support.  Nobody wants to see people poor but we must strike a balance.<\/p> <p>As I said earlier, a balance must involve people being rewarded.  I am keen to see an increase in what is perhaps the most beneficial social welfare payment we have - that is, the family income supplement.  It is a superb payment and it works well.<\/p><p>In his final comments, the Minister of State, Deputy Hayes, remarked that the budgets for 2014 and 2015 will each include tax increases of \u20ac500 million per annum.  This will represent a \u20ac1 billion increase between now and budget 2016, which I welcome.  We now have certainly about it.  No one wishes to see tax increases but this is the reality of where we are.  We are not in charge of our own financial destiny; others dictate the running here.  The people who dictate it are from New York and Frankfurt, not from Dublin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120500022#W04200","speaker":"1160","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354714800,"counter":190,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State.  I welcome several progressive measures in the budget.  The Minister of State has identified them, including the extension of PRSI to non-earned income, changes related to capital acquisitions tax and capital gains tax and the clampdown on sick pay in public service, to which the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, referred as well.  I welcome the reforms related to political expenses.  For some time my Independent colleagues and I have called for the abolition of the system of unvouched expenses, especially as it relates to the party leader's allowance.<\/p><p>However, the signalled change to tax relief on pension contributions is not a brave move; it is a missed opportunity.  It will not produce the more significant savings that would accrue from standardising the rate of tax relief, amounting to \u20ac700 million.  Most important, it will not take effect until 2014 and therefore there will be no savings in 2013.  There are no progressive measures on pensions for 2013.<\/p><p>One key aspect of the Government's taxation policy calls into question the reference to the budget overall as fair and progressive inasmuch as such measures are contained in the budget.  I am referring to the Government commitment to maintain the corporate tax rate.  There is a significant difference between the nominal rate of corporation tax of 12.5% and the effective rate of tax that multinational corporations operating in Ireland actually pay.  Due to a variety of tax breaks available to multinational companies, some sources put the effective tax rate for many of them as low as 5% or 6%.  These breaks are essentially a form of public spending.  The choice to have a low effective corporation tax rate represents a decision to provide subsidies to corporations.  I realise my remarks are significantly at odds with the earlier comments of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan.  While the 12.5% rate may have been of extraordinary benefit to the Irish economy in the past - I acknowledge as much - its effect is waning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120500023#X00200","speaker":"1176"},{"type":"speech","time":1354714800,"counter":191,"content":"<p>It remains.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120500023#X00300","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1354714800,"counter":192,"content":"<p>In the context of a race to the bottom in which other states are cutting their corporation tax rates, we should look to broaden the strengths of our economy beyond a dependence on multinational corporations.  Our low corporation tax rate has several negative effects on brand Ireland and the domestic economy.  It has the potential to cause real reputational damage.  Increasingly, we are being mentioned in the same sentences as genuine tax havens, including the Bahamas and the Cayman Islands, in the international media.  Ireland is not a tax haven but it shares some of their worrying features.<\/p><p>We should also be concerned about the medium-term sustainability of our corporation tax model.  There are several threats to the competitive edge Ireland has gained from it.  There has been movement by Germany, France and the European Union towards creating a common consolidated tax base.  It is also true that a downward shift in the corporation tax rate in another major economy - it has been discussed in the United States - could wipe out our advantage overnight.  Whether it disappears as a result of the race to the bottom or due to pressure to create a consolidated tax base, this advantage will not last.  We should recognise this and begin a discussion on how to wean the economy off our dependence on low corporate tax rates.<\/p><p>This situation is also damaging to the development of small and medium-sized enterprises within Ireland and abroad, in spite of the welcome ten-point plan for SMEs.  Large-scale tax avoidance by multinational corporations places small and medium-sized enterprises, which cannot avail of methods such as transfer price manipulation or fixing, at a competitive disadvantage.  It also means that SMEs contribute to the maintenance of the public services that sustain their businesses while multinational corporations simply freeload off these public goods.<\/p><p>Low corporation tax rates also have a negative impact on many developing nations as a consequence of transfer pricing through Ireland.  These aggressive tax avoidance strategies undermine the tax base of nations in the global south, hampering their development.  The point is that we have high public spending on wealthy multinational corporations while putting through a budget that has significant characteristics of austerity and features cutting the deficit by reducing benefits and public services.<\/p><p>I will conclude by referring to one or two of the prime austerity measures in the budget.  The first is the reduction in the age of the youngest child of qualifying one-parent families to seven years, at which stage the families no longer receive the one-parent family payment.  Coupled with the 2012 budget change that reduced the earnings disregard for one-parent families, it represents a significant and adverse measure.  My concerns in this regard are shared by my colleague, Senator van Turnhout.  The statistics show that one-parent families experience the highest level of deprivation and poverty but they also suggest that 60% of single parents are working while 20% are engaged in education or training.  This demonstrates their fierce desire for economic independence, not dependence.  The Government policy evident in the budget will continue to move single parents from the one-parent family payment onto jobseeker's allowance while the youngest child still needs to be cared for by an adult.<\/p><p>The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, promised that this reform would only come into play if Ireland started to develop a safe, affordable and accessible child care system.  I welcome the commitment to a \u20ac16.5 million investment in child care.  However, as my colleague across the room has noted already, there is also a \u20ac10 reduction in child benefit for every child of rich and poor parents alike.  This is not a progressive measure; it disproportionately affects lone parents.  It will block the healthy development and well-being of children of lone parents.  Savings from this change will amount to \u20ac136 million, a far cry from the money identified to be invested in child care.  It is a regressive approach to cutting child benefit.  A choice could have been made for a more equitable two-tier approach or a tax on child benefit.  This does not bode well for the most vulnerable families.  A single parent said on the news yesterday evening: &quot;If they cut child benefit, I don't really know what I am going to do.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120500023#X00400","speaker":"1176"},{"type":"speech","time":1354714800,"counter":193,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State back to the Chamber.

The Minister for Public Enterprise and Reform, Deputy Howlin, has stated that this represents the vast bulk of the total adjustment required.<\/p> <p>It is a massive amount of money and represents 85% of what needs to be done.  The general Government deficit this year is just below \u20ac13.5 billion or 8.2% of GDP.  While it is still appallingly high, it is well within the parameters of what is required.  The primary deficit after the budget is to be reduced by \u20ac2 billion.  <\/p><p>This is a fair budget in which we have protected the most vulnerable in society.  Of course, everybody will be worse off after it, but higher earners will contribute more and it is right that they should do so.  The Labour Party and everyone present would prefer if none of this was necessary, but it is absolutely impossible to close the gap in the public finances without tackling the bigger spending Departments of Health, Education and Skills and Social Protection.  No matter where reductions are made in the various Departments, the cuts will be painful and cause upset and there is no point in denying this.  All parties have agreed that a fiscal adjustment of \u20ac3.5 billion is required to meet the deficit targets up to 2015.  All parties have also stated how that is done is a matter of political choice, as Senator Marc MacSharry said.  At times of normal budgets it might well be the case that it is a matter of political choice but for a country in a programme, the choices are limited.  It must be pointed out - I have no doubt that Senator Darragh O'Brien will read this later - that the troika has stated a measure can be substituted for another if it will raise the same amount of money.  However, the same people who point this out usually fail to point to the tiny caveat attached to the end of that sentence, that is, if agreement can be reached with the troika.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120500023#X02000","speaker":"1117","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354715400,"counter":210,"content":"<p>It is up to the Government to put measures on the table for negotiation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120500024#Y00200","speaker":"1139"},{"type":"speech","time":1354715400,"counter":211,"content":"<p>It is a little disingenuous for Members-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120500024#Y00300","speaker":"1117"},{"type":"speech","time":1354715400,"counter":212,"content":"<p>Did the Government even ask the troika?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120500024#Y00400","speaker":"1159"},{"type":"speech","time":1354715400,"counter":213,"content":"<p>I will come to that and I am glad that the Senator is giving me the opportunity to deal with it.  This morning it was stated here and outside the House that any money raised in the budget would go towards payment of the promissory notes, but that is incorrect.  It is wrong and demonstrates either a misunderstanding or a deliberate attempt to portray something as what it is not.  If there was no promissory note to be paid, this budget would still be required and \u20ac3.5 billion would still have to be taken out of the economy.<\/p><p>I wish to deal with the details of the budget, but I do not think the Cathaoirleach will indulge me as much as he indulged Senator Marc MacSharry.  The change in the PRSI system means that people will pay an extra \u20ac5 a week.  While no one likes to see a decrease in entitlements, a fiver a week is not excessive.  The measure will bring in about \u20ac800 million in a full year and make a significant contribution to the Government's attempts to spread the pain across the entire economy.  I acknowledge the reduction of \u20ac10 per month in child benefit and, as Senator Marc MacSharry pointed out to me, my party stated before the general election that it would protect child benefit.  We attempted to do so but found it impossible.  However, we have offset this by an initiative to provide 6,000 after-school child care places for children in primary school, as well as an additional investment in the school meals programme.  I could say a lot about the property tax but an interesting point is that anybody who lives in a house worth \u20ac100,000 or less will be \u20ac10 per year better off under the new property tax regime than he or she was under the previous household charge regime.  That is a decent enough move.  Somebody living in a house worth \u20ac200,000, around the average for those on middle incomes, will pay \u20ac306 per year.  That is a long way from the forecasts of \u20ac400, \u20ac500 and \u20ac600 from the Opposition benches in recent weeks.  Perhaps they might now have the good grace to admit that they got it wrong.  <\/p><p>On education, we have managed to protect the pupil-teacher ratio in public schools.  I spoke to some teachers at a meeting last night who expressed huge concern about this issue and, to be honest, they were very sceptical about our ability to maintain that ratio.  Now that we have done so, I am sure that those involved in the education sector will be happy.  It was not possible to do the same in fee paying schools, but in terms of reducing the subsidy to fee paying schools from the public purse, we have done this in a reasonably fair way.  The increase in student fees in third level colleges is regrettable and, admittedly, something the Labour Party stated before the general election it would try not to do.

However, in this case the Minister, Deputy Noonan, listened to the voices that said we must prioritise jobs.  He spoke about their being the lifeblood of the future.  He listened and took a number of steps in that direction.  He also recognised the importance of the SMEs and a great number of the steps he has taken will bring improvements in that sector.  SMEs are so important that if the Minister is to succeed, it will be because he has encouraged investment in that area.  One of the first steps the Minister took in this regard concerns allowing access to a percentage of one's AVC funds.  I was one of the voices asking how we could encourage people to invest in Ireland and the Minister has recognised this need in taking this step.  This is something that will not be a cost to the Exchequer but will bring in revenue from the investment.  My fear is that we have not gone far enough in this area.  I am concerned when I see so many lawyers and teachers but not enough grocers running the State.  I am aware I am biased in that regard.  However, grocers know that sometimes a tax rate can be reduced and income will increase.  This has been done before.  When Charlie McCreevy reduced the betting tax in a budget from 20% to 10%, everybody howled and said he was looking after his friends in the horse business.  He came in the following year and informed us he had taken in far more money at 10% than he had at 20% and was now going to reduce the tax to 5% and take in even more.  In France, restaurant tax was reduced to 5.5%, resulting in 35,000 new jobs and an increase of 10% in trade.  I mention the restaurant business because the Minister has recognised how tax works in the tourist sector and has not increased taxes.<\/p><p>The Minister has also recognised the importance of the agrifood and film business sectors and is moving in the right direction with regard to these.  However, I would like to have seen him take other steps also.  I would like to have seen initiatives in the construction area.  It would be possible to reduce taxes there and increase income and jobs.  I would also like to have seen him do something about upward-only rents, although they may not be his baby.  This is an issue the Minister responsible should grasp and do something about.<\/p><p>There is a danger that increasing some taxes, such as the tax on cigarettes - nobody would disagree with increasing the tax on cigarettes, and certainly not Senator Crown - will encourage smuggling and the black economy.  There is some evidence that in the past year businesses have been paying less in VAT because people in the black economy do not register for it.<\/p><p>Tourism is a very important sector and I am delighted the Minister has maintained the reduced 9% VAT rate.  We must encourage investment in all areas, but particularly in SMEs.  The Minister has done that and has taken many steps in the right direction.  We will never be pleased that so much money is being removed from the economy, but at least the Minister has been listening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120500025#Z01200","speaker":"1145"},{"type":"speech","time":1354716000,"counter":241,"content":"<p>We should all remember we are in a programme with the EU and IMF and the situation is difficult for everybody, but today we are 85% of the way there and the end is in sight.  It was interesting to note that both Ministers, Deputy Noonan and Deputy Howlin, made the point that the end is in sight.  However, the situation remains difficult for people.  We cannot take \u20ac3.5 billion from any economy easily, but all the major parties are agreed that it is necessary to do this in order to get our finances back on track.  There have been positive signs of recovery recently.  The NTMA raised \u20ac7 billion in the markets and the ESB, Bord G\u00e1is, AIB and Bank of Ireland have all been successful in raising funds.  We have not reached the end yet, but within another 12 or 18 months we will be a long way along the road.  The record results of the IDA last year were very positive.<\/p><p>I welcome the focus on SMEs in the budget and the various measures announced by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan - particularly his ten-point tax reform plan - and I hope we will have the opportunity to examine that plan in detail in another debate.  I also welcome the various initiatives outlined with regard to supporting SMEs.  The Credit Review Office has been the subject of much discussion in this House and the fact that the Minister is providing extra resources for it is welcome.  The office is working and engaging with SMEs and has been a positive force.  I was encouraged to hear members of both ISME and IBEC say in a media interview this afternoon that this was a positive, pro-jobs budget.  This is welcome.  I do not say this as a Government supporter, but because it is important.  The creation of jobs is the only way to get people back working and restore the economy.  Therefore, the endorsement from ISME and IBEC is very positive.<\/p><p>The agrifood industry has been mentioned, as well as the tourism sector.  The retention of the 9% VAT rate is very important, particularly for 2013 when The Gathering is to take place.  That initiative has been successful, with some 3,500 jobs developed, and both the hotel and restaurant sectors have been very supportive of it.  With regard to property, some of the initiatives announced last year have been gaining traction.  Stamp duty was reduced from 6% to 2% for commercial property and this is showing some benefit.  The Minister announced some initiatives in this area, such as real estate investment trusts, to encourage individuals and investors to get involved in investing in commercial properties.  NAMA has a fund of \u20ac2 billion to help with this and with the upgrading of both commercial and residential projects.  We need to get to the nub of the property problem and need to ensure that properties under NAMA's remit can be moved onto the open market or developed. <\/p><p>I welcome the Minister's statement with regard to the regeneration of certain areas.  In Cork, the docklands have been identified as an area with huge potential.<\/p> <p>The regeneration of this area, which is close to the city centre, has not been as successful as the regeneration of other areas in terms of attracting private sector investment.  The Minister, Deputy Noonan, acknowledged this factor today.  He is hoping to bring forward measures to encourage regeneration projects.  We would welcome that because a number of local authorities throughout the country have identified areas that could be regenerated in order to attract investment.  We need to do what we can to leverage funding from any possible source.<\/p><p>I welcome the announcement regarding the aviation industry.  When the Minister mentioned that the details which were announced for the Shannon Airport area this week could be transferred to other areas, it immediately struck me that the Cork Airport area would be suitable for that type of development.<\/p><p>My time is almost up.  I would have liked to have mentioned other areas.  I will conclude by asking the Minister of State about the capital gains tax changes, particularly where individual land owners have received compulsory purchase orders from the National Roads Authority.  Will the changes in the capital gains tax regime be applied to cases in which that process is already in place?  I do not know if the Minister of State can answer that question now.  It has cropped up.  If the process is in place and the deal has been agreed, will the higher level of capital gains tax apply?  I would like some details on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120500025#Z01300","speaker":"1114","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354716600,"counter":243,"content":"<p>I would like to share time with Senator Mooney.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120500026#AA00200","speaker":"1139"},{"type":"speech","time":1354716600,"counter":244,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

I think hauliers should be happy with the diesel rebate.<\/p><p>We should be straight about the fact that the property tax will crucify Dublin and other urban areas.  It was a plank of Labour Party policy that there was to be no decrease in child benefit, but it has rolled over like an old dog that allows its master do whatever he wants by agreeing to a \u20ac10 decrease in the monthly payment.  Fine Gael has rubbed the Labour Party on the belly by agreeing to a mansion tax that will bring in approximately \u20ac15 million, according to figures I have worked out on the basis of the number of properties I believe to be worth over \u20ac1 million.  I am worried about the property tax.<\/p><p>It is not too late for the Government to have a look at the cut in the back to school allowance, especially in light of the savings to be made.  When the \u20ac10 decrease in child benefit is taken with the \u20ac50 decrease in this allowance, it is clear that the squeezed middle will be hit in a regressive way.  The increase in the third level registration fee and the increase of 3% in the income threshold at which students are eligible for grants will also affect the squeezed middle.<\/p><p>The respite grant is to be cut from \u20ac1,700 to \u20ac1,375.  I heard the Minister, Deputy Howlin, saying the Government was going to protect all basic social welfare payments.  In the next breath, he announced a cut of 25% in jobseeker's benefit, in effect, when he said it will be paid for nine months rather than 12 months.  People would have preferred a \u20ac5 cut across the board as long as they continued to receive it for a further three months.<\/p><p>I agree with Senator Norris that we need to have a full and proper debate on today's announcements.  I will speak to the Leader of the House about it tomorrow.  The Minister of State has been good enough to attend our debates on a regular basis.

As stated by him in the final sentence of his contribution, the task of restoring the public finances is not an easy one.  I would like to make some points in response to the speeches of the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform.  We have not yet received the full details on the ten point tax reform plan for enterprise.  As such it might be better to leave that issue to next week.  As stated by the Minister of State in his speech the banks got us into this trouble.  I am concerned about the reference by the Minister for Finance to relief of capital gains on disposal of farm land for three years.  We do not want relief of capital gains on disposal of farm land, we want output.  I opposed the film industry relief last year.  The Minister said in his speech that it was abused yet he has extended it.  When I tried to have it voted down I was told that the anomaly by which investors received a disproportion amount of tax relief as opposed to the funds going into production was removed.  We tried to save the Government money last year by seeking to have that relief removed.  The study was published today but we have not yet had sight of it.  Is this the fruits of lobbying, which got us into this mess, or will sound economic benefits ensue from it?<\/p><p>There is also a skirting around with the property sector again.  Any commercial property bought between now and end 2013 will be exempt from capital gains tax for at least seven years.  The Government should not go there.  It is what got us into trouble before.  Mention was also made of real estate investment trusts to promote investment in real estate.  We need to bring all of these costs down so that, as stated by the Minister of State, the development sector of the Irish economy and exports will gain.  I am concerned about the property tax because I do not believe the property market has recovered.  NAMA is holding up prices, as is forbearance by the banks and there are houses in ghost estates that have not been sold.  What are the real property prices at which people will be paying this tax?  <\/p><p>On the expenditure side, I note that the pay bill for 21 of the 40 Departments has increased.  Where is the Croke Park Agreement delivering?  The budget for the Attorney General's office also increases to 11.6% and the increase in respect of the Office of the Minister for Finance is 16.5%.  There is not much austerity in those areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120500028#CC00600","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1354717800,"counter":324,"content":"<p>It is in respect of the economists which we were asked to take on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120500028#CC00700","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1354717800,"counter":325,"content":"<p>There is a 9.2% increase for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  <\/p><p>The budget provides for a 1% increase on interests on deposits and savings, which is unearned income.  Much of that income was hard earned.  Perhaps the Minister would consider looking at this again in the context of the exemption scheme in relation to post office savings.  There may be some people on low income who are trying to do their best with the assistance of their savings.  The extension of the PRSI was always a highly regressive tax.<\/p><p>The Minister, Deputy Howlin, referred in his speech to critical infrastructure deficits.  I hope there was no lobbying in this regard by the construction industry.  Our GDP next year will be approximately 40% lower than stated in the national development plan.  I do not know where the infrastructure deficits are when economic activity is so depressed.  I plead with the Minister to ensure public private partnerships are analysed so that the taxpayer is not taken to the cleaners.  I am uncertain from where the \u20ac323 million referred to on page 13 will be saved in the health service.  Some \u20ac70 million is to be taken from pharmacists and general practitioners.  How many of them are there that it is possible to save \u20ac70 million in this way?  It is also stated in the Minister's speech that better income collection will result in savings of \u20ac150 million.  <\/p><p>I am concerned that the proposed legislation in respect of commercial health insurance does not get the benefits of competition, which could reduce the cost of health for people who have commercial health insurance and in the public sector.  The Government appears to be defensive of the State company.  We regularly hear in this House of projects such as \u20ac290 million for railway signals between Lansdowne Road and Howth Junction.  What type of signals are being installed?  Is anybody evaluating the project?  Another project, in relation to rail safety, cost \u20ac1.6 billion.

Over the years, numerous academics cited the fact that people in this country, particularly older people, own their own homes as one of the measures that prevents poverty in older age.  We all agree we need to have a much wider tax network.  Can this measure be kept under review during the coming years?  There are options for deferral within the proposed measures but for older people their houses are very dear.  I have gone into the homes of older people and seen them sitting in front of two-bar electric heaters, although the house may be a mansion.  We must be conscious that logic does not always enter into the equation.<\/p><p>There may be an anomaly in the property tax provisions.  I refer to appendix B in budget 2013, which states that local authority and social housing will not be exempt from the property tax measures.  I would like some clarification on that.  If local authorities and voluntary housing bodies must pay property tax on their own housing, the logic is similar to that of robbing Peter to pay Paul.  For the voluntary housing bodies this could be an enormous imposition.  The Respond housing association, for example, has in the region of 6,000 units.  I alert the Minister of State to the fact there may be unintended consequences to this measure. <\/p><p>One third of buy-to-let mortgages in this country are in arrears.

We know from the credit union survey that 1.8 million people have less than \u20ac100 left at the end of the month, yet we are bringing a property tax down on their heads.  In October last year Bill Clinton remarked that Ireland needed to resolve its mortgage issue but we have not done so.  Some 27% of people have mortgage arrears or have restructured their mortgages but we are now imposing a property tax on those who are clearly struggling.  It is unbelievable that a property tax is being hoisted onto this economy at this time when we have not resolved the mortgage issue, or given our people and our citizens a way to ensure they have a decent standard of living and are able to turn on the heat and feed and clothe their children.  The Taoiseach famously said, many moons ago, that it was morally wrong to bring in a property tax.  I am sure he is reflecting on that now as many people are calculating the amount of tax they must pay, as well as the cuts to child benefit and the new PRSI contributions.

I worked out a quick calculation when I came into the Chamber.  A couple with three young children who have an income of \u20ac37,000 will have their property worth \u20ac175,000 valued at \u20ac316 for property tax; they will be hit by \u20ac456 on child benefit, and because they are both working they will be hit by \u20ac540 in PSRI.  Effectively, their income will decrease by \u20ac1,300 per annum, without factoring in some of the other costs in terms of spending cuts and stealth tax increases.

It is fair to state that if we engage in a more reflective debate at a later date, we can discuss the various issues raised in greater detail.  One of the aspects of the budget about which I am most proud - Senator Aideen Hayden referred to this - relates to something on which many of us have been campaigning for many years, namely, the appalling way in which young people, particularly those who offend, are treated.  I am delighted - with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs - to be part of the project due to proceed at Oberstown.  This is a good development and shows that even in difficult times, the State can do wonderful things, particularly those which should have done many years ago.  In fairness, a former Taoiseach, Mr. Charles Haughey, had a flair for bringing forward imaginative proposals in very difficult times.  A couple of examples in this regard are the IFSC and certain projects in Temple Bar.  We must all be constructive and creative in circumstances where there is very little money available.<\/p><p>I do not wish to revisit matters to which I referred earlier.  However, I take Senator David Norris's point that the dilemma we face is that if we had not made savings of \u20ac24 billion from 2008 up to this year and we were not making additional savings of \u20ac3.5 billion in the budget for next year, the position of the country and the economy would be significantly worse.  We have confirmed to the international community that the country is going to make a comeback on the basis of having stabilised its public finances.  I agree with the Senator that we will not extricate ourselves from our current difficulties unless the issues relating to the promissory notes and the national debt are resolved.

There is a need to recognise that there has been no industrial rest.<\/p><p>The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has told the Lower House that the bill in this regard has to be reduced by a further \u20ac1 billion in the next three years.  This will be very difficult to achieve.  Up to now, we have managed to achieve reductions in a climate of industrial peace.  Effectively, 30,000 people have been taken out of the public sector.  At the same time, 80,000 young people have entered the education system and an additional 400,000 individuals have applied for medical cards.  This has all happened at a time when extraordinary demands have been placed on the public service.  We often ignore what has been achieved in reducing the numbers employed in the public service and cutting the pay and pensions bill.<\/p><p>No Government wants to reduce child benefit.  As stated, I live in an ordinary housing estate in a very nice part of Dublin.  I am very proud to live there.

During the general election campaign Sinn F\u00e9in stated that it would abolish the universal social charge.  In the first Private Members' motion it tabled following the election, it reiterated that it would do this.  In his most recent speech Deputy Pearse Doherty confirmed that it was still intent on abolishing the charge.  If this was done, we would owe a further \u20ac4 billion.  The Senator attacked Labour Party Senators for what they had said during the general election campaign.  However, he must account for himself in this regard.

This is a difficult budget, but we have done everything in our power to make it fair, with increases in capital taxation.  It is only right and proper that PRSI is being extended to unearned income such as rental income.  Some people have very substantial properties and should pay more.  People over 70 years who have substantial income should pay a little more in the universal social charge.  I very much agree with the point made by Senator Aideen Hayden on the transfer from medical cards to GP only cards for a group who have in excess of \u20ac60,000 a year on which to live.  It is a fair measure.  When I made this point three months ago, I was attacked left, right and centre.  It is only fair for intergenerational equity that a group who are really struggling, those in their 30s and 40s and out of their mind with worry about debt obtain some relief.  This requires that the burden be spread in the fairest way possible.  Will we make mistakes?  Of course, we will.  We will not get everything right in the budget and need to make changes in the fairest way possible to get the country working.

This section empowers the insolvency service to make regulations regarding bank accounts which may be opened by personal insolvency practitioners for the keeping of moneys received from debtors; the rights, duties and responsibilities of a personal insolvency practitioner in respect of moneys received from debtors; the accounting records which must be maintained and also verification and enforcement of compliance with regulations.  In making regulations under this section, the insolvency service must have regard to the need to protect debtors and creditors who are or may become parties to debt settlement arrangements or personal insolvency arrangements.  <\/p><p>Amendment No. 151 proposes the insertion of section 162 to provide that the insolvency service may, where necessary for the protection of debtors and creditors who are parties to a debt settlement arrangement or personal insolvency arrangement in relation to which a personal insolvency practitioner is or has been acting, apply to the High Court for certain orders in relation to the banking accounts kept by the personal insolvency practitioner in his or her company as such or in relation to the assets of the personal insolvency practitioner.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 152 proposes the insertion of section 162 which aims to address situations where a personal insolvency practitioner is no longer authorised to carry on practice as such and the insolvency service is of the opinion that the person has not made adequate arrangements for handing over documents relating to his or her practice as a personal insolvency practitioner.  In such a case, the insolvency service may issue a notice requiring the production of the documents to it.  Where the person fails to comply with such a requirement, the service may apply to the Circuit Court for an order requiring compliance with the requirement within a specified period of time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120500032#GG02000","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1354720200,"counter":470,"content":"<p>Amendment

investigation and disciplinary procedures that will apply where there is an allegation of improper conduct by a personal insolvency practitioner under the new Part 5 of the Bill.  Chapter 4, comprising sections 164 to 174, provides for a comprehensive system of complaints and investigations where improper conduct by a personal insolvency practitioner is alleged and for the imposition of appropriate sanctions.  Amendment No. 153 proposes the insertion of section 164 which empowers the director of the insolvency service to appoint members of the staff of the service or other appropriate persons to act as inspectors for the purpose of the Bill.  <\/p><p>Amendment No. 154 proposes the insertion of section 165.  This section provides for the establishment of a panel of persons to act on a committee to be known as the personal insolvency practitioners complaints committee.  The new Schedule 3, to be inserted by amendment No. 180, will make detailed provision for the complaints committee.  When the insolvency service appoints an inspector to carry out an investigation into a personal insolvency practitioner's conduct, it must request the Minister to appoint a complaints committee from the panel to act in relation to the investigation.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 155 proposes the insertion of section 166.  This section provides for the making of written complaints to the insolvency service alleging improper conduct by a personal insolvency practitioner and sets out the procedure for the handling of such complaints by the service.  The service must investigate if the complaint provided is made in good faith, is not frivolous or vexatious or without substance or foundation, is not likely to be resolved by mediation or other informal means between the parties.  <\/p><p>Amendment No. 156 proposes the insertion of section 167.  This section provides that where the insolvency service considers that immediate suspension of an authorisation to carry on practice as a personal insolvency practitioner is necessary to protect debtors and creditors who are or may become parties to a debt settlement arrangement or a personal insolvency arrangement, it may make an application to the High Court for an order to suspend the personal insolvency practitioner's authorisation.<\/p> <p>In exceptional circumstances where there is an immediate risk of financial harm to debtors and creditors who are or may become parties to debt settlement arrangements or personal insolvency arrangements, the service is empowered to apply to the High Court on an <i>ex parte <\/i>basis for interim suspension of a PIP's authorisation.  An interim order can ask for a maximum of 14 days and an application for such order must be held otherwise than in public unless the High Court considers it appropriate to hear the application in public.  <\/p><p> Amendment No. 157 proposes the insertion of section 168 which provides that an investigation may be carried out by the insolvency service on foot of a complaint or on the service's own initiative.  It provides for the appointment of an inspector or inspectors to carry out such an investigation to prepare an investigation report.  The terms of appointment of an inspector may define the scope of the investigation to be carried out by the inspector.  The inspector will be required to give notice of the investigation to the PIP concerned.  Where the investigation takes place on foot of a complaint to the insolvency service the inspector must also keep the complainant informed of progress on the investigation.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 158 proposes the insertion of section 169.  The section gives inspectors comprehensive powers to assist them in carrying out investigations, including powers to enter and search premises, carry out examinations and inquiries and conduct oral hearings.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 159 proposes the insertion of section 170.  The section sets out the actions to be taken by inspectors and the complaints committee on the completion of an investigation that includes provisions to ensure that fair procedures are applied.  On completion of an investigation the inspector must submit an investigation report to the complaints committee.  Before doing so, a draft of the report must be sent for comment to the PIP, the insolvency service, and where relevant, the complainant.  After receiving the investigation report the complaints committee must invite the PIP, the insolvency service and complainant to the investigation that arose from a complaint to make submissions on the report.  The complaints committee may conduct an oral hearing if appropriate for the purposes of observing fair procedures.  The complaints committee will be required to make a determination as to whether the PIP's conduct constitutes improper conduct.  If the PIP's conduct is found to constitute improper conduct, the complaints committee must make a determination as to the appropriate sanction and may, if appropriate, impose a minor sanction on the PIP.  A minor sanction is defined in section 147 as advice, a caution, a warning or a reprimand while a major sanction is defined as a revocation or suspension of a PIP's authorisation or payment to the insolvency service of up to &#8364;30,000 towards the costs of the investigation.  Where the complaints committee determines that the appropriate sanction is a major sanction it has to refer the matter to the High Court and make a recommendation as to the appropriate sanction.  The court having given all the parties an opportunity to make submissions then imposes the sanction it considers appropriate in the circumstances of a particular case.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 160 proposes the insertion of section 171 which provides that the PIP may appeal to the High Court against a decision of the complaints committee to impose a minor sanction.  Amendment No. 161 proposes the insertion of section 172.  The section sets out the matters to be considered by the complaints committee or the High Court, in considering whether a sanction ought or ought not to be imposed on a PIP or the appropriate sanction to be imposed.  These matters include: the need to ensure that the sanction is appropriate and proportionate to the improper conduct; the need to ensure the sanction will act as a sufficient deterrent to discourage improper conduct of that or a similar nature in the future; the seriousness of the improper conduct and any gain made by the PIP as a result of the improper conduct; and the amount of any loss suffered or costs incurred as a result of the improper conduct.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 162 proposes the insertion of section 173 which provides for the publication by the insolvency service of particulars of convictions and sanctions imposed under this Part. <\/p><p> Amendment No. 163 proposes the insertion of section 174 which provides that the right of access to personal data under section 4 of the Data Protection Act 1988 does not apply to data processed by the insolvency service, an inspector or the complaints committee in the performance of their functions relating to investigations under this Part of the Bill.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 179 proposes the insertion of a new Schedule  2.  The Schedule sets out the provisions applicable to oral hearings conducted in accordance with sections 169 and 170.  Part 1 sets out the provisions in regard to an oral hearing conducted by an inspector under section 169 while Part 2 provides for hearings conducted by the complaints committee under section 170.  <\/p><p> As I mentioned earlier, amendment No. 180 proposes to insert a new Schedule 3.  It contains detailed provision for the establishment and membership of the complaints panel and complaints committee.  The complaints panel must contain at least seven persons, all of whom must have relevant experience or knowledge to enable them to carry out their functions under the legislation. The complaints committee will be composed of at least three persons, at least one of whom must be a barrister or a solicitor.  The complaints committee must be independent in the discharge of its functions and that is so provided for.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120500032#GG03400","speaker":"1025","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1354720800,"counter":485,"content":"<p>Amendment

They propose to insert a Part 6 with new sections 148 to 160 into the Bill.  These amendments together create a new cadre of judges of the Circuit Court and are necessary to facilitate the speedy consideration of insolvency applications by that court.  As I have mentioned previously, the tentative estimate of applications is roughly 15,000 applications for the two main non-judicial debt resolution processes, the debt settlement arrangement and the personal insolvency arrangement, and 3,000 to 4,000 applications for debt relief notices.  <\/p><p>The Bill sets out two applications which will be made to the Circuit Court by the insolvency service in respect of debtors.  The Bill allows that a creditor may seek to object on specified grounds.  Every effort is being made to design these court applications in a straightforward and streamlined manner.  However, this work was to be added to the existing volume of work of the Circuit Court without increasing its capacity and there is little doubt the applications would suffer some delay.  The Government therefore agreed to my proposal to create a small new cadre of specialty or specialist judges of the Circuit Court who will be dedicated to applications under this Bill and other similar work.  They will, for example, be assigned the functions to be created also by the forthcoming mental capacity assisted decision-making Bill which I hope will shortly be published, and other suitable functions may be assigned by statute to them in due course.  I expect that approximately six such judges will be required.  Rather than seeking to appoint additional judges with associated extra salary and pension costs to the Exchequer, the Government has decided that eligibility for these new judgeships will be initially confined to serving county registrars with the necessary legal qualifications and practice experience.<\/p> <p>The posts will be advertised via the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, JAAB, which will forward a list of suitable applications to Government in the same manner that applies to other judicial appointments.  The appointments of a country registrar as a specialist judge will be largely cost neutral as he or she will not be replaced.  This will have the effect of creating the necessary additional judicial resources and maximising the contribution of existing officeholders at little additional cost.<\/p><p> The detailed technical amendments to the Courts Act to provide for these new judgeships are set out in amendments Nos. 166 to 179, inclusive, as follows.  Amendment No. 166 proposes the insertion of a new section 148 amending the main Courts (Establishment and Constitution) Act 1961.  Subsection (<i>a<\/i>) amends section 4(2) which provides that circuit judges be styled in their Irish language titles with English titles a second option.  The appropriate term in designated in the amendment.  Subsection (<i>b<\/i>) adds specialist judges to the list of judges that make up the Circuit Court.  These judges will also be regarded as full judges of the Circuit Court.  The effect of the amendment is that the term &#8220;judges of the Circuit Court&#8221; will mean the President, &quot;ordinary&quot; judges and specialist judges of that court.  Subsection (<i>c<\/i>) amends section 6A(1)(<i>b<\/i>) of the 1961 Act - inserted by section 12 of the Courts and Court Officers Act 2002 - to allow completion of partly heard cases by a judge, including a specialist judge, who is elevated to another judicial office.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 167 inserts a new section 149 to amend section 17 of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act 1961 providing for eligibility for appointment as a Circuit Court judge.  A specialist judge is a judge of the Circuit Court, but not what the legislation terms an &#8220;ordinary judge of the Circuit Court&#8221;.  This gave rise to the need to amend subsections (2), (2A) and (2B), all inserted by section 5 of the Court and Court Officers Act 2002, to make clear that these provisions apply to the appointment of ordinary judges only, and not to the appointment of specialty judges who are dealt with in the new subsection (4).<\/p><p> Subsection (1)(<i>d<\/i>) allows a specialist judge to apply to appointment as an ordinary judge of the Circuit Court.  Subsection (1)(<i>e<\/i>) deals with the qualification for appointment as a specialist judge, by inserting new subsections (4) and (5) in section 17 of the 1961 Act.  This is to provide that the first applicants are confined to serving, qualified county registrars.  Subsection 4(<i>b<\/i>) also gives effect to this by providing that the standard eligibility criteria for practising solicitors and barristers who are qualified for appointment may not come into effect until 1 January 2014, that is, after the first round of appointments of specialist judges has finished.  A key aim of this measure is to achieve the essential additional capacity in a largely cost neutral manner.  If, however, insufficient numbers of county registrars apply or are deemed suitable by the JAAB, the wider eligibility provision may be triggered at an earlier date by ministerial order.  Given that the provision deals with the appointment of a category of judge, it also specifies a safeguard that the ministerial power to commence the wider eligibility is &quot;grandfathered&quot; out and the eligibility automatically broadens out to the standard no later than 1 January 2014.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 168 inserts a new section 150 into the Bill amending the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act 1961 to insert a new section 26A setting out the extent of the functions, powers and jurisdiction of a specialist judge.  Subsection 1 provides that a specialist judge may only perform the functions and exercise the powers and jurisdiction conferred by this statute.  The other subsections then go on to detail those functions, powers and jurisdiction as follows.  Subsection 2 relates to the functions of the Circuit Court which is the court granted jurisdiction in section 5 of this Bill for all applications other than those specified in section 5(1)(<i>a<\/i>) of this Bill.  Subsection 3 also gives a parallel power to specialist judges to make any order that may be made by a County Registrar under section 34(1) of the Courts and Court Officers Act 1995.  Subsection 3(<i>b<\/i>) means that such orders, if made by a specialist judge, will be appealable to the High Court rather than the Circuit Court.  Subsections (4) to (9), inclusive, are provisions to ensure that a specialist judge may have powers to deal appropriately with any case before him or her, including, for example, a standard power to adjourn a case under subsection (7).<\/p><p> Amendment No. 169 inserts a new section 155, amending section 46 of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act 1961 to provide for the salary of the specialist judge.  This is set at the same rate as that applicable from 1 January last to ordinary judges of the Circuit Court, that is, &#8364;140,623.  County registrars are paid between &#8364;123,000 and &#8364;145,000 thus where a serving county registrar is appointed, this will give rise to little or no additional cost to the Exchequer.<\/p><p> With regard to amendment No. 170, the new section 152 amends the Courts and Court Officers Act 1995 to set a maximum of eight specialist judges.  As specialist judges may be appointed to more than one circuit, I anticipate that six may be appointed in the first instance.  An increase to the maximum of eight will depend on the volume of work involved, which will only become apparent some months after the Bill has been in force.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 171 proposes to add the category of &quot;specialist judges&quot; to the existing provisions for the appointment of judges.  It is intended that all the current requirements of the JAAB will be applied to the new cadre of judges.  Applications will be invited by the board which will then forward a list of those deemed suitable to the Minister for the consideration of the Government.  The Government will nominate persons for appointment by the President under the Constitution.<\/p><p> Amendment No.172 inserts a new section 154 dealing with assignment of specialist judges.  This is achieved by inserting a new provision into the Courts Act 1977.  A key provision here is section 154(2) which provides that a specialist judge may be assigned to more than one circuit.  The volume of insolvency applications has been estimated at 15,000 for the two main non-judicial debt resolution processes &#8211; DSA and PIA - and between 3,000 and 4,000 applications for debt relief notices.  These provisions have been drafted with care to allow for sufficient flexibility to ensure that the judges can be diverted from circuits where fewer applications are lodged to circuits where the volume is greater.  More than one judge can be assigned to a single circuit.  The other provisions are standard to uphold the principles of judicial independence by ensuring that permanently assigned judges can only be reassigned with their consent.<\/p><p>  Amendment No. 173 proposes a new section 155 to amend section 10 of the Courts of Justice Act 1947 to provide that the allocation and organisation of business, sittings and times of sittings of specialist judges is the responsibility of the President of the Circuit Court.  Sections 155(9) to 155(12), inclusive, provide the powers for the President to organise the business of the court including the sittings, times during the year and hours between which the court might sit.  These powers also allow him or her to consult, where necessary, with the relevant judges.  The provisions are intended to ensure there will be sufficient availability of these judges to make sure applications can be dealt with by the court without delay and, therefore, for example, I envisage these judges will be available between Monday and Friday each week throughout the calendar year, rather than being restricted to the current legal terms.  On a small technicality, as the original section 10(7) had been repealed, one might think the numbering of the new subsections being inserted should start at seven.  However, I am advised by the Office of Parliamentary Counsel that the practice is not to replace repealed provisions in this way, as it would create confusion if there were any old cross-references to the repealed provision on the Statute Book and, therefore, the numbering starts at eight.  I wish anyone luck who wants to debate that issue.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 174 proposes a new section 156 amending section 38 of the Courts of Justice Act 1924 to provide in subsection (1)(<i>a<\/i>) that the manner of address shall be fixed by rules of court and subsection (2) that no order of precedence shall apply to specialist judges.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 175  proposes that vacations may be set by the Minister of the day.  This mirrors a long-standing provision applying to District Court judges.  The District Court sits throughout the year, including regularly providing a service on Christmas Day, Sundays, etc., to deal with charges as they arise.  The accessibility provided by the District Court will, I hope, not be required to quite the same extent in specialist judges but the general model of flexibility and accessibility is important and that is why we are copying it.<\/p><p> Amendment Nos. 176 and 177 propose sections 158 and 159, which update the relevant sections of the 1973 Court Act and the Law Reform Commission Act 1975 allowing that certain service as a judge or member of the Law Reform Commission is reckonable in calculating service as a barrister or solicitor for the purposes of section 17 of the 1961 Act, which sets out the service requirements for eligibility for appointment as a judge and will now include &quot;specialist judge&quot;.<\/p> <p> Finally, amendment 178 extends the new cadre of specialist judges.  There are a number of standard provisions in the Courts Acts to ensure that no cases are affected by the introduction of the new provisions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120500033#HH02900","speaker":"1025","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354722000,"counter":515,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and I call Senators \u00d3 Clochartaigh, Mooney and Paul Coghlan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120500035#KK00200","speaker":"1118"},{"type":"speech","time":1354722000,"counter":516,"content":"<p>The Minister has said that appointing the six judges is cost neutral but I want to tease out his claim.  These people, who are possibly county registrars at the moment, could be appointed judges.  He mentioned that their current pay scale is \u20ac126,000 or between \u20ac123,000 and \u20ac140,000 and that the judge's pay scale would start at around \u20ac140,000.  How does it benefit the registrar to accept a position with different responsibilities that also needs certain qualifications?  Obviously he or she would become a full-time judge under the new system but who will replace them and become the new county registrar?  Will a replacement mean that a person is bumped up the system?  Does that involve a cost?  Will there be replacements down the line?  Will they be from within the system?<\/p><p>There have been quite a number of redundancies in the Courts Service and the organisation is quite stretched.  The Minister said that he hoped that six registrars will apply for the positions.  If that does not happen and he must invoke the other appointment mechanism, will the registrars then become additional staff in the judicial service?  If so, and in the worst case scenario, the Department would have to employ the six of them incurring a large cost to the State.  It would mean multiplying the basic pay of \u20ac140,000 by six plus their other earnings and the final cost could total almost \u20ac750,000.  That is a potentially large cost to the Exchequer if the county registrars do not take up the offer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120500035#KK00300","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1354722000,"counter":517,"content":"<p>It is cost neutral in the context of the first six being appointed from the existing number of county registrars.  That is quite clear.  The County Registrars Association has made the case that it feels that the grade is underutilised.  I would be very surprised if a number of county registrars, and exceeding six, did not apply for these positions.  Let us assume that appropriate individuals do apply, and who are recommended by the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, their appointment is cost neutral because it is not intended to replace them at present.  We believe that the existing county registrars will be able to continue and maintain the work that is required by county registrars at the moment.  Some of the tasks that county registrars used to undertake years ago are no longer undertaken by them.  The new specialist judges will retain powers to do certain court work that county registrars currently do.  To that extent it is cost neutral.  Of course it is not cost neutral if no county registrar applies because then we will have to appoint additional individuals.  If only three apply who are appropriate then clearly the position would have to be advertised and other individuals would be appointed.<\/p><p>It is important that the insolvency legislation is up and running and works efficiently.  We must have the insolvency agency in place.  We cannot expect that the anticipated volume of work that would arise would be coped with and dealt with by the existing court judges because they already have a very large amount of work.  I am sure that they could cope with it after a fashion.  That would be in the context of building up court lists of debt relief notices, debt settlement arrangements or personal insolvency arrangements awaiting either approval or, where a creditor raised a difficulty, some form of hearing would be needed to address the difficulty.  The idea is that once a debt settlement is agreed and put in place it would be signed off and approved rapidly both in the interest of a debtor and a creditor.  We cannot have a backlog of a year before the matter is dealt with.  The only choice is to create an additional group of judges who have a specialist function in the area.<\/p><p>The objective and the manner in which the legislation has been crafted aims to ensure that we do not impose additional costs on the Exchequer.  I must be realistic about it.  As a result of the budget 2013 my Department will get an additional \u20ac7.5 million or \u20ac7.6 million to cover the cost of establishing the insolvency service, to pay salaries in the service, and for everything that comes with it, such as software and back-up facilities.  Overall, in the context of the Department of Justice and Equality, for the same services in 2013 we will have \u20ac62.5 million less available than we had in 2012 and part of our funding allocation goes to the Courts Service.  Therefore, it is important to see if we can set up the structure without incurring unnecessary expense both in the interests of taxpayers and to ensure that we maintain our budgetary position and comply with our Estimates during the course of the year.  There are some really good qualified county registrars who can fill these positions if they apply for them.  As I said, I would be surprised if there was not a surplus of applications.  If it turns out that there are no appropriate people or not enough applications well so be it.  We will then have to find the funding for a minimum number of six judges that we believe that we require.    <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120500035#KK00400","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1354722000,"counter":518,"content":"<p>I compliment the Minister for introducing the amendments.

The commercial court judge, Mr. Justice Peter Kelly, is proof that appointing a specialist judge with a particular focus means that business will be dealt with efficiently and quickly.

I believe they will welcome the new functions assigned here and the opportunity afforded to their role effectively as a specialist judge of the Circuit Court rather than a county registrar.

Our court systems are prescribed in the Constitution.  We have what are known as courts of local and limited jurisdiction, which the Oireachtas can create by legislation.  These include the District and Circuit Courts.  Then there are courts specified in the Constitution, in particular, the High Court and the Supreme Court.  The Chief Justice remarked on something we are committed to under the programme for Government, that is, a court of civil appeal, which is badly needed.  Many of the appeals that go from the High Court on the civil side are currently part of the backlog of the Supreme Court and could be dealt with more speedily if we had a court of civil appeal.  This would mean only cases of major public importance or interest or cases involving a peculiarly difficult legal issue would have to go to the Supreme Court on appeal.  Other specialist courts could be established.<\/p><p>The Senator might recall that last July I announced a decision made by the Government to establish a court of civil appeal and a special integrated family court structure.  We have been considering other constitutional changes of relevance to the court system and we anticipate that a referendum will address these issues in 2013.  The objective at present is to hold such a referendum in the autumn of 2013.  The initial Government decision was announced but work must be progressed on this issue.  It would require a referendum.  We proposed a suggestion that would allow the Houses of the Oireachtas to create courts of unlimited jurisdiction by way of statute.  This would mean any time one wished to create a specialist court, one would not of necessity have to hold a referendum.  However, we would create a court of civil appeal by way of referendum.  It is not envisaged that there would be a separate individualised constitutional court because within our constitutional framework the Supreme Court is the ultimate court of appeal on constitutional issues.  It is the court of reference under Article 26.  It is appropriate that the most important issues in the land relating to constitutional rights or the constitutional validity of legislation be determined by the Supreme Court.  There is a broad range of possibilities with regard to the actual functioning of a court of civil appeal.  For example, on the civil litigation or judicial review side it might be the appropriate court for all appeals.  However, if the High Court made a decision on a constitutional issue, it might be appropriate to retain the provision whereby any appeals on a constitutional challenge would go directly from the High Court to the Supreme Court.  We did not create a whole trilogy of applications in these areas.  These issues are worth discussing and debating.<\/p><p>I wish to use this opportunity as an advertisement.  My Department intends to hold a conference in March of next year to allow Members of the Houses, lawyers, legal academics and others who may be interested to give consideration to some of these issues.  We anticipate the conference will be held on a Saturday.  We hope to have some guest speakers with degrees of expertise in these areas and we hope to open up the debate on the floor of the conference as part of the consultative process leading in to the holding of a referendum next autumn.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120500036#LL00300","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1354722600,"counter":526,"content":"<p>I

We had an exchange of views on various provisions in the Bill and while I was obviously not able to take on board all amendments that were proposed, they did give us an opportunity to discuss issues of concern.  I will examine any additional amendments that might be appropriate to ensure that we have the best possible legislation in place following the coming into force of this Bill, prior to us taking on Report Stage.<\/p><p>I wish to advise the House that I will be introducing some further amendments to the Bill on Report Stage.  These will include some further definitions that I believe will be of assistance if added to section 2 of the Bill, to provide for further clarity, some further refinement of the functions of the Insolvency Service and also some necessary improvements to the text designed to improve the workability of the new debt resolution arrangements.  In particular, I have promised to address certain issues regarding the asset exemption limits in the debt relief notice.  Senators will remember that we had long discussions on that matter, particularly regarding items of a &quot;ceremonial&quot; nature.  I do not wish to reopen that debate now.  I refuse to go any further but those who were present will know what I mean.  Additional amendments will also include any necessary technical and legal adjustments in areas such as taxation or pensions that are consequent on this very comprehensive and complex reform of our insolvency law.  There will also be some further refinements to bankruptcy law.  It is important, before concluding today, that I so advise Members of the House.

I wish to speak about an episode that took place in a school in Kilfinane almost two weeks ago, which was widely reported on in the media.  A number of subcontractors who were going to be left out of pocket by the main contractor involved in building the new school took action.  They decided that the only way to get recompense for their loss was to go into the school and take out what they believed belonged to them.  Incidents such as this badly affect small communities.  The people involved were from places like Ballinderreen, Elton, Bruff and Murroe.  One of the men involved is the father of seven children and one of his daughters babysat for my sister.  A brother of the guy from Elton is married to a second cousin of mine and the sister of another guy taught me in primary school.  That gives some indication of how closely connected everybody involved was.  The Minister of State will appreciate that the entire episode really cut close to the bone in the local community.  I wish to praise the staff and parents in the school who, when they saw their school being stripped of equipment, intervened because they had fought to have the school built for many years.  I also wish to praise the local garda\u00ed for ensuring that a volatile situation did not get out of hand.<\/p><p>The crux of the matter is that many of the subcontractors who worked on the site and who were left short had also been left short previously by a different contractor.  When the first contractor on the school project went bust, some of the subcontractors were down considerable sums of money.  One guy in particular was owed almost \u20ac80,000.  That kind of money is make or break for subcontractors.  For a main contractor, it might not be the end of the world but for subcontractors, it is.  One guy in particular had remortgaged his house in order to buy equipment.  Losses such as those incurred could easily have sent the subcontractors over the edge.  When the second contract was awarded I was delighted to see the same subcontractors who had lost out on the first contract being given a chance to recoup some of the money lost and to finish the work they had started.  I welcomed that at the time but eyebrows were raised locally when the name of contractor who was awarded the second contract became known.  It begs the question as to what type of research is done when tenders are submitted, when contracts can be awarded to people who have not got a great reputation locally.  I spoke to an engineer shortly after the contract was announced and he threw his eyes up to heaven and said &quot;forget about it, that is not going to be finished&quot;.   However, that is a separate issue which I will not go into now.<\/p><p>The subcontractors were left in absolute desperation and I am concerned about the delay in bringing forward the construction contracts legislation.  A motion was before Limerick County Council in May calling for the legislation to be introduced before the summer recess.  The Construction Industry Federation wrote to me again last week concerning this issue.  The federation said that it has been almost two and half years since this legislation was first introduced in the Seanad by Senator Feargal Quinn, which was long before my time in the House.  Will this legislation be expedited so that subcontractors are given the protection they need and deserve?  Will the law be passed soon?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120500037#MM00900","speaker":"1119"},{"type":"speech","time":1354723200,"counter":572,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Heffernan for raising this issue.  I am aware of the case to which he referred in Kilfinane, County Limerick and the circumstances surrounding the subcontractors on the national school project there.  It emphasises the need to swiftly enact this legislation and if I can be as bold as to say, it is not for the want of trying on my part.<\/p> <p>That is a shift in the responsibilities and there is a sense of frustration on my part that we have not made more progress.<\/p><p>The Bill in question is not a Government Bill, but one put forward by Senator Quinn.  The Government has accepted the Bill and it has concluded Second Stage in the D\u00e1il.  I have set out the areas of it on which I intend to bring amendments on Committee Stage and I hope that by early in the new year the Government will have agreed to those amendments, through the Office of the Attorney General and the Department.  This will allow me take the Bill to Committee Stage as soon as possible and on to Report Stage and then back to this House to where it started over two and a half years ago.<\/p><p>I wish to acknowledge the work of Senator Quinn, who has been a partner with me in trying to get this Bill on the Statute Book.  I had a meeting recently with representatives of the construction industry and I outlined to them the new timetable we have for the passage of this Bill early in the new year.  The case in Kilfinane highlights the need for this legislation.  Although the Bill will not have retrospective effect with regard to cases that happened some years ago, it will have effect from when it is enacted.  We must ensure the rules and procedures are right for subcontractors. <\/p><p>Last summer, we had a full regulatory impact statement on the legislation, when all of the interested players, on the supplier and construction side, large and small, worked with me and spokespersons to work out a number of amendments.  As a result of that regulatory impact statement, I have given commitments to the D\u00e1il with regard to amendments on thresholds and adjudication.  I want to go ahead with this Bill, but the problem is getting the time to do it and I am frustrated that we have not made more progress on it.<\/p><p>I wish to assure the Senator that the Government intends to get the Bill over the line as soon as possible.  I hope to be back to this House early in the new year to report progress on the Bill so that it can be enacted and so that a case like the one that occurred in Kilfinane will never happen again.  With regard to the particular case to which the Senator has referred today, I am not sure the Act, if it was in place, would make a difference.  My officials have said it would not have applied because of the circumstances, but that highlights even further the need to make progress on this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120500037#MM01000","speaker":"958","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354723800,"counter":574,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State's response and his commitment to bringing the legislation through as soon as possible.

The objective is to ensure these cases do not go to court.  It is to work up an adjudication system which will arrive at some agreement for both suppliers and contractors.  This system has worked well in the United Kingdom without thresholds and should work equally well here in our smaller market.  Margins are very tight currently because of the reduction in cost of approximately one third in the total amounts for these contracts.  I am minded to have no threshold, but we will wait to see the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120500038#NN00300","speaker":"958"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Registration of Architects","time":1354723800,"counter":576,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120500038#NN00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1354723800,"counter":577,"content":"<p>I am delighted to have this opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment and thank my colleagues for not availing of the opportunity too often, which lets me in by default much of the time.<\/p><p>This issue relates to the proposal for a so-called grandfather clause with regard to people who can practise as architects.  What is the Government doing on this issue?  This has been an issue for some time, but the current registration process is time limited and concerns people who are not members of the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland but who effectively do the same job and get the same recognition.  I understand this has become more of an issue as banks have tightened up with regard to who can certify planning permission applications, certificates of compliance with building regulations and other general structural assessments of property.  It is only right that banks tighten up on this, as there has been too much laxity in recent years.  However, there are many people who can do the same job as an officially qualified architect and who have been recognised as qualified until now.  What is the Government position on this situation, because there are many practitioners who do not have the official qualifications who are finding the current situation very difficult?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120500038#NN00500","speaker":"1116"},{"type":"speech","time":1354723800,"counter":578,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Byrne for raising this issue.<\/p><p>  There are no plans to amend the arrangements in place for the registration of architects along the lines suggested.  Part 3 of the Building Control Act 2007 provides for the registration of persons permitted to use the title of architect.  The Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland, RIAI, has been designated as the registration body.<\/p><p>  Section 22 of the Act makes specific provision for a category of practically trained persons who for a period of ten years, at the time the Act became law, had been providing architectural services in Ireland commensurate with those understood as being provided by architects for the purpose of the Building Control Act.  This provision is transitional in nature and enables this category of persons to become registered once they have been assessed as eligible for registration by the technical assessment board in accordance with the practical experience assessment procedure.  This process assesses work submitted by the applicant and does not involve or rely on any examination or any formal academic requirements.  In effect, this route to registration may be regarded as a grandfather clause along the lines suggested.  There is and can be no question, however, of any individual being allowed to use the title of architect without having first demonstrated in a fair and objective manner that the services he or she has been providing are commensurate with those of persons who are registered to use the title of architect.<\/p><p>  There has been some disquiet with regard to the fee specified for candidates who apply for registration, which has been set at &#8364;4,500.  This is a significant reduction on the figure originally proposed.  The costs involved are considerable and the scale of the fee necessarily reflects this.  Section 62 deals with the specification of registration fees and, importantly, requires that the fee specified must not in any case exceed the total of the costs in providing the services for which the fee is paid and the reasonable costs incurred by the registration body.  I understand that the registration body has confirmed that the recommended fees are in line with the requirements of section 62.<\/p><p>  In addition to the technical assessment route, which is limited to certain persons already providing architectural services in Ireland prior to the 2007 Act, section 14(<i>f<\/i>) provides a permanent route to registration for practically trained persons who have seven years appropriate practical experience and who have passed the prescribed register examination.  Taken in their totality, the various routes to registration provided for under Part 3 of the Act represent a registration process that is open, fair and transparent.  The factual position is that specific provisions have been put in place to ensure that practically trained architects can be included on the register.<\/p><p>  I understand that 14 candidates have sought to undergo the technical assessment procedure two date.  Of these, eight candidates have been successful, three candidates have been unsuccessful and the remaining three candidates are currently under consideration.  Candidates who are unsuccessful have a right of appeal.  In addition, the inaugural register admission examination resulted in 26 practically trained persons being deemed eligible for inclusion on the register of architects.  It is anticipated that a regular throughput of practically trained persons will come through the register admission route each year.<\/p><p>  I would encourage all practically trained persons to pursue the routes to registration which are currently open to them, with a view to joining the small but significant and growing numbers of practically trained architects already on the register.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120500038#NN00600","speaker":"1069"},{"type":"speech","time":1354723800,"counter":579,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for that clarification, but I intend to pursue the issue.

I was in the Merrion Hotel.  Secretary of State Clinton is in residence there.<\/p><p>I recently met a family that was taken aback after being asked to pay \u20ac25 a week in addition to what the Government is paying to nursing homes under the fair deal scheme.  As I do not have a huge knowledge of the intricacies of the scheme, perhaps I am wrong in my understanding that the arrangement with nursing homes is that all bills relating to a person's medicine and care, etc., are discharged by the State.  I understand that people declare their means and their assets, including the moneys they have in the bank, when they enter into the scheme and the figures to be paid by such people and by the State are determined on that basis.  The family in this case was recently asked to pay an additional \u20ac100 a month.  Those involved feel this is unjustified because their loved one who is in the nursing home had a small amount of disposable income, but that is now gone.  The explanation they have been given is that this money is needed to cover the cost of providing additional services to their loved one.<\/p><p>I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, is in a position to provide the clarity I am looking for.  Is this request for an additional payment appropriate and proper?  Is it legal?  If it is contrary to the ethos of the scheme, what means of recourse are open to the family to try to get this dealt with?  If it is not possible to get the money paid back, the family would at least like to prevent this from happening in the future.  If this request is being made in one nursing home, I am sure it is being made in many others.  Perhaps some sort of audit or investigation is required.  I know the Minister of State is deeply committed to the care of the elderly.  I am sure she will be most anxious to ensure proper and appropriate things are being done.  I look forward to hearing her response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120500039#OO00500","speaker":"1158"},{"type":"speech","time":1354724400,"counter":586,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this matter.  At the end of October 2012, almost 22,200 people were receiving financial support towards the cost of long-term nursing home care.  In addition to residents who receive financial support under the scheme, this figure includes people who were in public nursing homes before the scheme commenced, people in receipt of subvention and people in contract beds.  A further 769 people had been approved for funding, but were not yet in payment.  In addition, some 371 people were on the placement list for funding.  It takes approximately three to four weeks for funding to issue.  All individuals who are approved for funding under the scheme are placed on a national placement list in chronological order, based on the date of determination of their application.  Funding is issued to individuals in chronological order to ensure equity nationally.<\/p><p>When the nursing homes support scheme commenced in October 2009, a commitment was made that it would be reviewed after three years.  A public consultation process to inform the review, concluded in mid-July.  The Department will publish a summary report of the submissions received and thereafter seek tenders through the public procurement process for the carrying out of the review.  A considerable amount of preparatory work for the review has been completed.  It will be progressed within the constraints of available staff and other priorities.  It is envisaged that the review will be completed in 2013.  The scheme provides financial support towards the cost of long-term residential care services.  The services which fall within the scope of long-term residential care are nursing and personal care appropriate to the level of care needs of the person, bed and board, basic aids and appliances necessary to assist the person with the activities of daily living and laundry service.  Incontinence wear, where required, is provided free of charge by the HSE to all nursing homes support scheme residents who possess a medical card.  Individuals availing of the scheme should not be charged an additional fee over and above the contribution calculated by the HSE, unless they have chosen to obtain additional services over and above long-term residential care services.<\/p><p>Under the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2009, the registered provider must agree a contract with each resident within one month of his or her admission.  This contract must include details of the services to be provided to that resident and the fees to be charged.  Residents should not be charged fees which are not set out in the contract and agreed with the resident.  The Health Act 2007 gives statutory responsibility to the chief inspector of social services, who is part of the Health Information and Quality Authority structure, for the independent inspection and registration of certain categories of designated centres.  This includes residential care settings for older people.  The chief inspector has the power to refuse to register, attach conditions to a registration or cancel the registration of a designated centre in the event of non-compliance with the care and welfare regulations or the national quality standards for residential care settings for older people in Ireland.

I will be glad to see the back of it.  I thank the Minister of State for her efforts in ensuring funds have been returned to people who were under threat of losing money from their home care packages.  The protection of the home help budget has been a major achievement by our side of the House today.  I believe the children of County Roscommon are not getting the same treatment as the children of every other county in the country.  For the last four years, no occupational therapist has been available to assist those who need to avail of the child and adolescent mental health service.  Although those of us in the HSE west are in the same common bond, to put it in credit union terms, people in Roscommon cannot avail of the services of an occupational therapist who might work out of Galway or Mayo.  It just cannot be done.  In other areas of the health system, it is possible for those with certain specialties to cross county boundaries and assist where needed.  A person working for the HSE in Roscommon could get a job in Mayo, and <i>vice versa<\/i>, if that was happening for promotional purposes.  Somebody in Galway could get a promotion in Roscommon.  There would be no border issues in such circumstances.<\/p><p>  The community occupational therapist who is employed by the health service in Roscommon does not feel qualified to deal with most severe or acute cases of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, in particular.

I am not sure whether the Minister of State saw the recent edition of &quot;Prime Time&quot; that dealt with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

It is the intention that, over time, access to modern mental health services in the community will be significantly improved.<\/p><p>This House will appreciate that the current economic environment presents a significant challenge for the health system generally in delivering services.  However, the provision of mental health services is being treated as a priority, in so far as we can do so.  In that regard, a special allocation of \u20ac35 million for mental health was provided in budget 2012, in line with commitments in the programme for Government, to further strengthen existing community mental health teams in both adult and children's mental health services.<\/p><p>Some 414 posts were approved to implement the \u20ac35 million package of special measures for mental health, of which 150 posts were allocated specifically to child and adolescent mental health services.  Under this process, Roscommon-east Galway child and adolescent mental health services received three additional posts, one of which is the senior occupational therapist post referred to by the Senator.  To date, 17 posts have been filled nationally and over 270 offers of employment have been accepted from the overall figure of 414.  It is expected they will be in post in the next week and the others will be in post, at the very latest, at the end of January next, so the appointments are proceeding.  In addition, interviews for the ten posts for the psychological and counselling services in primary care, which will also be funded from the \u20ac35 million special allocation, were completed recently and the results will issue shortly.  The start dates for these ten posts are expected to be in early 2013 to allow for the process of checking references and so on, while most of the other start dates for the community mental health teams are expected to commence this month.<\/p><p>With regard to the specific issue of the occupational therapist post in Roscommon, the HSE has confirmed that the filling of this vacant post has been approved.  The HSE national recruitment service has been in contact with the successful candidates inviting them to express an interest in the post.  This expression of interest expired on 30 November.  The national recruitment service will now issue a recommendation to proceed with the appointment of the candidate who is highest in order of merit and who has expressed an interest in the post.  Once the appropriate clearances for the candidate have been processed and finalised, a start date will be agreed and the national recruitment service will issue a contract to the successful candidate.<\/p><p>To conclude, I wish to assure the House that the Government remains committed to the development of community mental health services and, in this regard, the recruitment of the nurses and allied health professionals required to augment community mental health teams will be completed as early as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120500040#PP00200","speaker":"982"},{"type":"speech","time":1354725000,"counter":592,"content":"<p>What can I say to the Minister of State but \"Thank you very much\"?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012120500040#PP00300","speaker":"1161"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1354725000,"counter":593,"content":"<p>The Seanad adjourned at 9.05 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 6 December 2012.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
