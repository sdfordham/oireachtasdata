This is a political matter, not a legal or technical matter. It will have to be solved by political leadership and will require creativity, imagination and innovation.<\/p>  <p>  The retention of the open border we enjoy today is one of the benefits of the peace process which my Government colleagues and I are so determined to secure as part of the EU-UK negotiations.<\/p>  <p>  Every county in Ireland will be impacted by the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU, but I am keenly aware of the particular concerns in the Border region, given the deep economic and social links across the border. <\/p>  <p>  Consequently, the Government&rsquo;s preparation for the forthcoming negotiations has been extensive. Dealing with the impact of Brexit is at the very top of our agenda and it has been since well before the referendum vote in the UK.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has been clear and consistent on our priorities for protecting Ireland&rsquo;s interests in the upcoming EU-UK negotiations. This includes minimising impact on trade and the economy, protecting the peace process and Northern Ireland including border issues and maintaining the Common Travel Area. <\/p>  <p>  We have to be clear, however, that in relation to the border - and indeed in relation to many other areas &ndash; both the UK and the EU will need to compromise if we are to achieve the demanding objectives that the Government has set.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach discussed with Prime Minister May the serious implications of Brexit for Northern Ireland and the imperative of retaining the open border on the island of Ireland, at their meeting in Dublin on 30 January.  There will be a need for the British Government to reflect the unique challenges Brexit poses for Northern Ireland in the position they adopt in the negotiations with the EU27.  I reinforced this message in my meeting with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland James Brokenshire in our meeting on 14 February.<\/p>  <p>  When the negotiations on the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the European Union commence, we, together with our EU partners, will face the UK across the negotiating table and will strive for a deal that everyone can accept but, more importantly, that protects Ireland&rsquo;s fundamental interests, including maintaining the open border on this island.  However, the Government is under no illusions about the hard work needed to deliver this.<\/p>  <p>  As part of our preparations for the negotiations, I have been in contact with all of my EU counterparts in order to sensitise them to the need for specific arrangements which protect the key gains of the peace process on this island &ndash; a process to which the EU has already made a key contribution.<\/p>  <p>  From my engagement with all of my EU counterparts, as well as with the EU Institutions, most notably my recent discussions with Michel Barnier, Chair of the European Commission Taskforce on Brexit and Guy Verhofstadt, Brexit negotiator for the European Parliament, there is deep appreciation of the EU&rsquo;s role and contribution in support of the peace process and a wish to continue that support, regardless of the challenges and changes of Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  The Government will continue to engage with all of our EU partners to highlight the unique circumstances of Northern Ireland, and the consequences for North-South cooperation on the island as a whole, which must be factored into any new EU relationship with the UK.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200070#WRB00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Middle East Issues","counter":15,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200070#WRB00700"},{"type":"question","counter":16,"qnumday":33,"qnumall":"[8699\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200070#WRB00800","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"when Ireland will officially recognise the state of Palestine; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1366","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":17,"content":"<p>In my reply earlier to a Priority Question on this subject, I said:&ldquo;As I have reported to the House, I am keeping under continuous review whether the immediate recognition by Ireland of a state of Palestine, prior to its real achievement on the ground, could be a helpful step towards the goal of resolving the conflict.

The visit was historic in that it was the first by a serving President of Ireland to Cuba.<\/p>  <p>  During the visit, a Memorandum of Cooperation between the Government of Ireland and the Government of the Republic of Cuba was signed by David Stanton TD, Minister of State with special responsibility for Equality, Immigration and Integration.  I warmly welcome the signature of this agreement, the core aim of which is to open channels of dialogue and cooperation between Ireland and Cuba, particularly in trade and cultural engagement.<\/p>  <p>  The Agreement commits Ireland and Cuba to promoting cooperation in many areas including economic, commercial, industrial, agricultural, academic, cultural, scientific and tourism relations.  Together with the EU-Cuba Political Dialogue and Cooperation Agreement, this Memorandum will place the Ireland-Cuba relationship on a more forward-looking footing, and will give Ireland the means to engage more positively with Cuba, and to respond promptly and positively to future developments in the country.<\/p>  <p>  The President's visit was the first by an EU Head of State to Cuba since the signing in 2016 of the EU-Cuba Political Dialogue and Cooperation Agreement.  I had the honour to sign this Agreement on behalf of Ireland, along with my EU colleagues and the Cuban Minister for Foreign Affairs, in the margins of the Foreign Affairs Council on 12 December 2016.  As the Deputy will be aware, this is the first such agreement between the EU and Cuba.  Its signature marks a further positive step forward in relations between Cuba and the EU, which have improved considerably in recent years.  I believe that improvements in the EU-Cuba relationship will in turn have helpful consequences for the Ireland-Cuba relationship.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to both the EU-Cuba PDCA and the Ireland-Cuba Memorandum, there has been an increased frequency of contacts between Ireland and Cuba at official level in recent times, both directly from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and via our Embassy in Mexico which is accredited to Cuba.  Political consultations, led by the Secretary General of my Department, took place in 2015 and again en marge of the visit of the President last week.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to banking issues, my officials have in the past raised the difficulties that emerged, insofar as the extraterritorial application of US legislation is relevant, with the US side.  In response, the US have noted the concerns of banks everywhere to reduce risk in the face of heightened financial regulation and oversight.  They have stated that the US government does not direct financial institutions to maintain particular financial relationships and have recommended contact by relevant parties with the US Department of the Treasury&rsquo;s Office of Foreign Asset Control for information regarding Cuba-related transactions.  I am not aware of current difficulties being experienced by Irish citizens but would be glad to consider same if the Deputy wished to follow up with details.<\/p>  <p>  The enhanced relationship between the EU and Cuba as supported by the EU-Cuba PDCA, and the signature of the Memorandum of Cooperation between Ireland and Cuba last week, together provide a solid framework and welcome opportunity to strengthen Ireland&rsquo;s bilateral relations with Cuba.  This strengthening of the bilateral relationship was cemented by the historic visit of President Higgins to Cuba.  I look forward to continued positive developments in the period ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200071#WRC01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Catalan Referendum","counter":28,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200071#WRC01100"},{"type":"question","counter":29,"qnumday":37,"qnumall":"[8688\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200071#WRC01200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the pending prosecution of persons (details supplied) for facilitating a non-binding consultation on Catalan independence; and his views on whether the Spanish Government should resolve its disagreements with Catalan politicians, including on an independence referendum, through a process of mutual dialogue and respect rather than through prosecuting democratically elected politicians.","asker":"1309","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":30,"content":"<p>The constitutional status of Catalonia is the subject of ongoing debate in Spain.

I note with serious concern the report of the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights which issued on 3 February, which outlined experiences of the Rohingya community who recently entered Bangladesh from Rakhine State.  I am also aware of the media reports, to which the deputy has referred, which indicate that two senior UN officials estimate that more than 1,000 Rohingya Muslims may have been killed by Myanmar security forces in their response to the October 2016 attacks.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has been active in raising concerns regarding the treatment of the Rohingya community at bilateral level with the authorities in Myanmar\/Burma and in the context of our membership of the EU and the UN.

This resolution conveyed the HRC&rsquo;s serious concerns over human rights violations in the country, including the situation in Rakhine State and particularly with respect to religious and ethnic minorities, including the Rohingya minority.  Ireland also raised this issue in a statement at the 32nd session of the HRC in June 2016 and during the review of Myanmar&rsquo;s human rights record at the HRC&rsquo;s Universal Periodic Review in November 2015.  Ireland has also supported the inclusion of this issue in the EU&rsquo;s contact with the Government of Myanmar, including in the most recent EU-Myanmar Human Rights Dialogue which took place on 22 November 2016.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200071#WRC01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Official Engagements","counter":34,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200071#WRC01700"},{"type":"question","counter":35,"qnumday":39,"qnumall":"[8764\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200071#WRC01800","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his views on the appropriateness of the planned visit by senior members of the Government to the President of the United States of America in view of the recent positions taken by the US President on immigration, human rights, foreign affairs and other issues; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1308","askee":"1233"},{"type":"question","counter":36,"qnumday":59,"qnumall":"[8769\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200071#WRC01900","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he has had or is planning any discussions with the Taoiseach on issues that he should raise when he visits the White House in March 2017; if these issues include changes to US foreign policy with regards to Palestine; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1238","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":37,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 39 and 59 together.<\/p>  <p>  The US President has extended an invitation to the Taoiseach to visit the White House for the traditional St Patrick&rsquo;s Day events this March.

In December 2016, I directed that Ireland advocate at the Council of Europe on the urgent need for progress on legacy issues in Northern Ireland, including a properly resourced legacy inquests system, so that the long-outstanding investigations can finally proceed in a manner that is compliant with Article 2 of the Convention.<\/p>  <p>  I will continue to engage with the British Government and the parties in Northern Ireland, as appropriate, to support the implementation of the Lord Chief Justice&rsquo;s proposals on legacy inquests and the establishment of the legacy institutions provided for under the Stormont House Agreement, as soon as possible.  The formation of a new power-sharing Executive following the election to be held on 2 March will, I hope, contribute to progress on these issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200071#WRC02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":42,"content":"<p>Question No. 43 answered with Question No. 32.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":43,"content":"<p>Question No. 44 answered with Question No. 34.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Migration Crisis","counter":45,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200072#WRD00150"},{"type":"question","counter":46,"qnumday":45,"qnumall":"[8690\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200072#WRD00200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he has had discussions at EU level regarding the arrangements in place with Turkey regarding migrants; his views on whether it is appropriate to implement agreements with countries that disrespect human rights records; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1291","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":47,"content":"<p>Last March, EU leaders and Turkey agreed on the terms of a Statement to address the mass movement of people entering the EU from Turkey. The core intention of the EU Turkey Statement is to break the business model of the people smugglers profiting from the suffering of the vulnerable and to discourage migrants from risking their lives in dangerous sea journeys. The period since the Statement was agreed has seen a very substantial reduction in the number of migrants risking their lives at sea and entering the EU from Turkey, which suggests that the Statement is achieving its aims.<\/p>  <p>  The need for the Statement to comply with EU and international law was a key concern for very many EU Member States, including Ireland. The legal advice of the EU institutions and the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office was that the terms of the Statement were not in breach of EU or international law.<\/p>  <p>  The European Council, the Justice and Home Affairs Council as well as the Foreign Affairs Council have all addressed the migration crisis on many occasions since the crisis developed in the Spring of 2015 and I have taken an active part in those discussions.<\/p>  <p>  Human rights and humanitarian values are at the core of the EU and Member States&rsquo; approach to all negotiations on migration and mobility and we are committed to enhancing human rights safeguards in such negotiations. <\/p>  <p>  Although the EU and Turkey are working well together to address the migrant crisis, the EU as a whole nonetheless has grave concerns about negative developments in Turkey in respect of human rights, democracy, the rule of law and freedom of expression, in the aftermath of the attempted coup in July 2016 and under the extended state of emergency, which is still in place. I share the concerns of our EU partners, which were set out very clearly in a statement on 8 November last. Unfortunately, these concerns persist. We will continue to monitor the situation in Turkey closely, and to engage with the Turkish authorities to encourage a renewed commitment to democracy and respect for human freedoms and to the core principles which we value so highly.  We do not underestimate the challenges faced by Turkey, or the role it plays in the migrant crisis, but believe that the rule of law and democracy must always be respected.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200072#WRD00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foreign Conflicts","counter":48,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200072#WRD00350"},{"type":"question","counter":49,"qnumday":46,"qnumall":"[8692\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200072#WRD00400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the specific proposals or contributions Ireland is making to the Foreign Affairs Council to ensure the safety of the Yazidi people subjected to genocide and slavery in northern Iraq by ISIS.","asker":"1291","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":50,"content":"<p>I wish to record my absolute and unreserved condemnation of the vile and criminal acts committed against the Yazidis by the terrorist group Da&rsquo;esh. These crimes continue to this day, against Yazidis held captive by Da&rsquo;esh.  The protection of the Yazidi population and other populations from these crimes is a matter for the United Nations, in particular the Security Council of the United Nations, rather than the European Union.<\/p>  <p>  In September 2015, Ireland addressed UN Human Rights Council on the findings of the UN Commission of Inquiry report which stated that the crime of genocide had been committed against the Yazidis, saying &ldquo;the Commission&rsquo;s report details unimaginable crimes. The suffering of the victims of Daesh&rsquo;s terrorism and hatred is laid bare before this Council in the report. This Council and the membership of the United Nations have an inarguable duty to end these crimes and work to achieve justice and accountability for the victims of these crimes.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has long made clear its full support for referral of the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court. Together with over 50 Member States of the United Nations, Ireland co-sponsored a proposed resolution to this effect in 2014. Ireland regards the failure of the proposed resolution as a breach of the Security Council&rsquo;s obligations under the UN Charter. Ireland repeats its call for the Security Council to uphold international law and act on this report by referring the situation in Syria to the Court. It is intolerable that the terrorist perpetrators of the most heinous crimes would be granted impunity by the action of any member of the United Nations.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland urges that all States engaged in countering Daesh in Syria and Iraq should place the protection of civilian populations, especially minorities at particular risk from Daesh&rsquo;s murderous ideology of hate, as a priority in their instructions to members of their security forces.&rdquo;<\/p>  <p>  The responsibility for a legal determination of the crime of genocide is a matter for a legally competent and internationally recognised court. These atrocities took place in both Syria and Iraq and reported crimes in both States need to be investigated and prosecuted. I regard the report of the Commission of Inquiry and its findings of genocide as authoritative and I repeat our long-standing demand that the Security Council fulfil its obligations under international law and act to ensure that the Yazidis can seek accountability for Daesh&rsquo;s crimes before the International Criminal Court or another legally competent international tribunal. <\/p>  <p>  I welcome the December 2016 decision of the UN General Assembly to establish an independent, impartial independent accountability mechanism for Syria. Ireland was one of the large majority of States voting in favour of its establishment. Our Mission to the United Nations have reported on the steps taken to implement the decision and we will consider all options Ireland can take to give practical support to United Nations in ensuring its effectiveness. <\/p>  <p>  Funding from the Irish Aid programme, managed by my Department, has been provided to meet the urgent needs of the most vulnerable people inside Iraq, particularly in besieged and hard-to-reach areas, and those who have been displaced internally, or who have fled to neighbouring countries. Funding is channelled through Irish Aid&rsquo;s NGO partners and UN organisations, who are best placed to respond, and is used to provide humanitarian supplies and urgently needed access to food, health, water and sanitation services, with a particular focus on the protection of children, women and the most vulnerable. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland provided almost &euro;3 million in humanitarian assistance to Iraq during 2016. &euro;2.5 million was channelled through the UN Iraq Humanitarian Pooled Fund, which is used to provide life-saving assistance and meet the critical humanitarian needs of the estimated 10 million people affected by violence in Iraq. In Erbil and Dahuk Governorates, in particular, this includes members of the Yazidi community.<\/p>  <p>  In addition the Irish Government dispatched 80 tonnes of humanitarian relief supplies under the Rapid Response initiative. The relief items, which included blankets, jerry cans, cooking sets, water tanks, tarpaulins and shelter kits, at a total approximate value of &euro;462,813, were donated to Oxfam for distribution to conflict affected communities.<\/p>  <p>  During 2015, Ireland also provided &euro;1 million to the Iraq Humanitarian Pooled Fund and &euro;250,000 in support of UNICEF&rsquo;s Iraq Strategic Response Plan, which prioritised the protection of civilians displaced by conflict, as well as &euro;330,000 to Christian Aid Ireland to support activities promoting the protection of displaced women and girls in the Kurdish region of northern Iraq, where the Yazidi population is concentrated.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland continues to closely monitor the situation in Iraq, and given its complexity and severity, it is likely that further support will be provided to affected communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200072#WRD00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":51,"content":"<p>Question No. 47 answered with Question No. 34.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Immigration Controls","counter":52,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200072#WRD00650"},{"type":"question","counter":53,"qnumday":48,"qnumall":"[8520\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200072#WRD00700","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the impact here of the new US immigration policy in view of the restrictions announced by the US President, Mr. Trump, recently (details supplied); and the actions his Department will take to minimise the negative impact of US immigration policy for Ireland.","asker":"1276","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":54,"content":"<p>As I made clear in my statement of 29 January, 2017, concerning the Executive Order signed by President Trump on 27 January last, while US immigration policy is a matter for the US authorities, it is clear that this decision could have far-reaching implications &ndash; both on humanitarian grounds and on relations between the US and the global Muslim community.

The Government&rsquo;s preparations for these negotiations have been extensive. But it is also critical that our priorities are heard and understood across Europe and are reflected in the EU&rsquo;s position for the forthcoming negotiations. To that end, an extensive programme of engagement with all other EU Governments and the EU institutions, including the European Commission&rsquo;s Brexit Negotiations Task Force, is under way. To date, there has been over 120 engagements at either political or senior official level.   The Taoiseach is in regular contact with EU leaders and recently travelled to Madrid and Warsaw for meetings with his Spanish and Polish counterparts. [He will travel to Brussels later this week, where he will have a meeting with the President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker.]<\/p>  <p>  For my own part, I spoke with each of my EU Foreign Minister counterparts in the period immediately following the referendum in the UK. I then undertook a second round of discussions with my EU colleagues which most recently has included bilateral meetings with the Italian, Spanish and Finnish Foreign Ministers. [Today, I welcomed the French Foreign Minister to Dublin for discussions, and plans are advancing for a visit by my Luxembourg counterpart at the beginning of March.] Engagement with the European Commission&rsquo;s Task Force on Brexit and the Commission&rsquo;s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has also been a central part of the Government&rsquo;s programme of engagement. The Government&rsquo;s position on Brexit was outlined in meetings with Mr. Barnier in Dublin on 12 October. During a recent visit to Brussels (9 February) I met with Mr Barnier and had an excellent exchange with him about preparations for the negotiations phase. Engagement with the Commission&rsquo;s Task Force at a technical level has been regular and is ongoing. There have been a number of exchanges on key aspects of the negotiations process and the Irish-specific aspects, including on the Common Travel Area and on border issues. <\/p>  <p>  In the same vein, Minister of State Murphy also remains actively engaged; visiting Romania and Greece on 30 January to 1 February and this week he travels to Bratislava, Vienna and Budapest.  In addition, meetings at senior official level took place with Latvia, Lithuania and Belgium most recently, and engagements are scheduled with France, Poland and Slovakia in the coming weeks. <\/p>  <p>  Feedback to date from this comprehensive engagement has been very encouraging. There is as sound understanding among EU partners of our priority issues and a strong willingness and openness to work closely with Ireland on addressing them.  <\/p>  <p>  When the negotiations start, we, together with our EU partners, will face the UK across the negotiating table and will strive for a deal that everyone can accept but more importantly that protects Ireland&rsquo;s fundamental interests. There will be a need for the British Government to also factor into their negotiating position with the European Union their objectives in relation to the maintenance of the open border and the protection of the gains of the peace process in Northern Ireland, as underpinned by the Good Friday Agreement.

In the aftermath of the referendum in the United Kingdom on 23 June 2016, there was a Plenary meeting of the North South Ministerial Council on 4 July 2016 in Dublin Castle.  At that meeting the Government and the Northern Ireland Executive agreed to work closely together to optimise North South planning in the phases preceding and following the United Kingdom&rsquo;s withdrawal from the European Union.  It was also agreed that full sectorial audits would be carried out by Departments North and South to identify the possible impacts, risks, opportunities and contingencies which may arise following the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal.  At the subsequent NSMC Plenary meeting on 18 November 2016 in Armagh the Government and the Northern Ireland Executive agreed on a number of important common principles for dealing with Brexit on an all-island basis. <\/p>  <p>  It was also agreed that this work would be taken forward through continuing bilateral discussions within the NSMC at sectorial level, as well as through a high-level working group comprising senior officials from the Government and from the Northern Ireland Executive Office.<\/p>  <p>  The Government remains engaged with the political parties in Northern Ireland and I would hope that the new Northern Ireland Executive will be in place soon after the Assembly election on 2 March and that dates for the next NSMC Plenary meeting will be agreed as soon as possible thereafter.  <\/p>  <p>  The Executive is responsible for politically representing Northern Ireland&rsquo;s interests, including in relation to the upcoming EU-UK negotiations.

Ireland&rsquo;s engagement with Mr Barnier and his taskforce at political and official level has been and continues to be very constructive. Dublin was one of the first capitals visited by Mr Barnier in his Brexit role and during his visit on 12 October last, in addition to my own bilateral meeting with him, he had very positive discussions with the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister of State for European Affairs.  Our meeting on 9 February provided an opportunity to take stock of Ireland&rsquo;s regular and ongoing engagement with Mr Barnier&rsquo;s team on key aspects of the negotiations process and the Irish-specific aspects, including the Common Travel Area and on border issues. I also welcomed the fact that Mr Barnier has highlighted the need to address Ireland&rsquo;s specific concerns as a priority in the upcoming negotiations. <\/p>  <p>  I shared the Government&rsquo;s perspective on recent developments, including Prime Minister May&rsquo;s speech and the recent British Government White Paper.

I would also like to assure the Deputy that the Chairperson and members of the Legal Services Regulatory Authority, its Interim Chief Executive and my Department are working closely to ensure that we can successfully coordinate the identification of the necessary steps and commencements by the Department, and the delivery, by the Authority as the new independent statutory regulator, of the various provisions concerned. This will include key milestones such as the coming on stream of the new public complaints and professional conduct provisions contained in Part 6 of the 2015 Act which are a bedrock of the new regulatory regime. It will also include the compilation, within a six-month period, of the new Roll of Practising Barristers which forms the basis, for the first time in legislation, for the regulation of barristers. Underlying all of these matters is the fact that the Legal Services Regulatory Authority has been established, in the public interest, as an independent regulator in terms of both its appointment and the discharge of its functions. This protects the independence of the legal professions and of the courts as well as the interests and confidentiality of legal clients. It is important in this context that the Regulatory Authority be afforded a reasonable opportunity to deliver its mandate efficiently and effectively and, most importantly, with the necessary working supports in place.

The DEIS Plan 2017 sets out our vision for future intervention in the critical area of social inclusion in education policy. <\/p><p>A key element of the DEIS Plan 2017 is the availability of a new identification process for the assessment of schools for inclusion in DEIS using centrally held CSO and DES data.\u00a0 <\/p><p>The key data sources are the DES Primary Online Database (POD) and Post-Primary Online (PPOD) Databases, and CSO data from the National Census of Population as represented in the Pobal HP Index for Small Areas,\u00a0which is a method of measuring the relative affluence or disadvantage of a particular geographical area.\u00a0 Variables used in the\u00a0compilation of the\u00a0HP Index include\u00a0those related to demographic growth, social class composition and labour market situation.This data is combined with pupil data, anonymised and aggregated to small area, to provide information on the relative level of concentrated disadvantage present in the pupil cohort of individual schools.Further information on the development of the identification process is available in the DEIS Review report which can be found on my Department's website at <\/p><p>In its initial application, the new identification model has identified that there are schools in disadvantaged areas, not previously included in DEIS, whose level of disadvantage is significantly higher than many schools already in the programme.\u00a0 Accordingly, we are moving as a first step to include these schools within the DEIS School Support Programme.<\/p><p>Schools included in the list published\u00a0by the Department on\u00a013th February are those whose level of concentrated disadvantage has been identified as being at the same level as the current DEIS category for schools serving the highest concentrations of disadvantage.\u00a0<\/p><p>Schools which have not been included at this stage, including the school referred to by the Deputy,\u00a0are those which have not been identified as having the highest levels of concentrated disadvantage amongst their pupil cohort.<\/p><p>The new DEIS Plan provides for a verification process and any school wishing

disadvantage.\u00a0 I am fully aware that there are further schools whose concentrated level of disadvantage may not be at the highest level, but may nevertheless be at a level which warrants additional supports for pupils under DEIS. <\/p><p>However, as noted in the DEIS Plan, the implementation of a new objective central data-based model of identifying levels of disadvantage within school populations will be followed by a further programme of work to create a more dynamic model where levels of resource more accurately follow the levels of need identified by that model.<\/p><p>Once this work\u00a0has been\u00a0completed, consideration will be given to extending DEIS supports to a further group of schools as resources permit.<\/p><p>In delivering on the DEIS Plan 2017, we must be conscious that there are ongoing changes in demographics which may be more marked in some areas than others.\u00a0 Populations in some areas have changed considerably since schools were originally evaluated for inclusion in DEIS in 2006.\u00a0 The new model may reveal that some schools currently included in DEIS have a level of disadvantage within their school population much lower than that in some schools not included within DEIS.\u00a0 If this turns out to be the case, then we must consider whether it is fair that those schools continue receiving these additional resources, using resources that may be more fairly allocated to the schools with greater levels of disadvantage.<\/p><p>It is important to note that the fact that a school has not been included in the

A Reasoned Opinion was issued on 30 September 2016, with the Commission deciding to refer the case to the Court of Justice of the EU on 15 February 2017.<\/p>  <p>  The supplementary letter of formal notice of September 2015 identified compliance concerns around a total of 82 agglomerations.  Ireland has satisfied the Commission, through their responses to date, that 44 agglomerations should be removed from the case.  This demonstrates that considerable progress has been made in addressing these issues. However, 38 agglomerations remain of concern to the Commission and have now been referred to the Court.   <\/p>  <p>  Since taking over responsibility for water services on 1 January 2014, Irish Water has put in place a prioritised range of projects to deal with the historic deficits and lack of investment in waste water collection and treatment across the country.  Irish Water has identified key projects, in both their current and recently approved future capital investment plans, to address all non-compliances in their waste water treatment plants by 2021 for each of the areas identified by the Commission in this ECJ case.  The cost of these works is estimated at &euro;1 billion.<\/p>  <p>  However, further significant and sustained investment will be essential to ensure ongoing compliance, to cater for growth and to provide waste water services that protect the environment and meet our obligations under the directive.<\/p>  <p>  Irish Water has established a dedicated team to deal with representations and queries from public representatives.

While the development and implementation of an allocation scheme is a matter for the housing authority concerned, being a reserved function of the elected members, Section 22(17) of the 2009 Act provides that the Minister may issue directions to a housing authority regarding the operation of an allocation scheme and the housing authority shall comply with any such direction in operating the scheme.  In this regard, a Ministerial Direction was put in place in January 2015 which required the Dublin Region housing authorities to allocate at least 50% of tenancies under their control to homeless and other vulnerable households.  The Direction was subsequently renewed on two occasions, with the last renewal expiring on 30 April 2016.   <\/p>  <p>  At the time of the last renewal in February 2016, the Housing Agency was requested to conduct a review of the operation of the Direction and provide an impartial assessment.<\/p>  <p>  The Agency recommended that the Direction should be allowed to lapse upon its expiry. <\/p>  <p>  This Direction was only ever intended to operate for a short period of time to provide an immediate increase in the number of social housing tenancies being allocated to homeless households.

This analysis is vindicated by the fact that during 2016 local authorities nationally achieved in the region of 2,700 sustainable exits from homelessness into independent tenancies; this is a record level of exits, with the comparable figure for 2015 having been 2,300. <\/p>  <p>  Taking account of the Housing Agency's report, my predecessor decided not to renew the Ministerial Direction after 30 April 2016 and I do not propose to revisit the issue.

It is the role of the staff of these services to provide Jobseekers with a range of practical supports and assistance to help them enter\/re-enter employment. The range of supports provided relate to the jobseekers preparation for, search for, the securing of and the sustaining of employment in the open labour market.<\/p>  <p>  With JobPath the department has procured additional resources to enable it to provide a high quality case managed employment support service to people who are long term unemployed and those most at risk of becoming long-term unemployed.  The JobPath service was designed to augment and complement the Department&rsquo;s existing employment service capacity, including that provided by LES and Job Club contractors.  The additional capacity provided through the JobPath service has allowed the department to provide the type and intensity of services required by Jobseekers, particularly those most distant from the labour market.<\/p>  <p>  Prior to the introduction of Intreo and JobPath the Department had a case officer to live register ratio of approximately 1,500:1 compared to international benchmarks of less than 200:1.  Today with the reduction in the unemployment rate and the increase in capacity, both internally through Intreo and externally through JobPath, the ratio is circa 230:1.  Nevertheless with a ratio of 230:1 as compared with international norms of less than 200:1 JobPath continues to play a key role in the delivery of the services required by Jobseekers.<\/p>  <p>  The JobPath service was rolled out on a phased basis over the period mid-2015 to July 2016, as a result the first groups of participants have only recently completed their engagement period with the service.  It is important to note, that through the service jobseekers have access to a personal adviser (PA) who works with them over two phases. During the first phase, of 12 months duration, the PA provides practical assistance in searching, preparing for, securing and sustaining employment.  The second phase starts if the jobseeker is successful in finding work. During this phase the PA continues to work with the jobseeker for a further period of at least three months, and up to 12 months.  It will take time therefore to accumulate a sufficient number of clients (who have completed their engagement period) for complete and robust outcome data to be available.  However for 2017, the Department will publish a report on the performance of the service on a quarterly basis, with the first such report having just been published recently (17th of January).<\/p>  <p>  The initial data on the impact of the service is encouraging.<\/p>  <p>- Employment outcome data shows that compared to people who did not take part in the service, people who availed of the service were 23% more likely to have started a job (as of October 2016).  The difference appears to be more marked for very long-term unemployed people, with those out of work for more than three years some 44% more likely to have found a job if they engaged with the service.<\/p>  <p>- The results from the first independently conducted customer satisfaction survey indicates that jobseekers feel that they are receiving a good service under JobPath (76 &ndash; 81% satisfaction vs 5 &ndash; 8% dissatisfaction), that the staff of the service make them feel valued (90%+) and they have a good relationship with their personal adviser (90%+). They also feel that the service has improved their chances of getting a job (68% - 77%).<\/p>  <p>  Given that only a small number of people have completed their full engagement period with the service these results can only be treated as indicative, nevertheless they are encouraging.<\/p>  <p>  As the number of people who have completed their engagement period with the service increases the department will be in a position to provide greater granularity in the reports to be published each quarter this year.<\/p>  <p>  The first report (with results together with a copy of the independent customer satisfaction survey findings for both companies) is available on the department&rsquo;s website at &ndash; www.welfare.ie\/en\/downloads\/JobPath-performance-report-January-2017.pdf.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200079#WRL01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Employment Support Services","counter":278,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200079#WRL01950"},{"type":"question","counter":279,"qnumday":131,"qnumall":"[8861\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200079#WRL02000","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the fact that employment scheme sponsors, such as rural social schemes and community employment schemes, are no longer receiving recommendations from local social welfare offices for vacancies that arise on such schemes; the reason this is the case; his views on whether JobPath is obstructing such schemes from filling vacancies that arise; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1335","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":280,"content":"<p>My Department provides a range of activation supports and programmes catering for long-term unemployed jobseekers and those most distant from the labour market.

The full roll-out of the free travel variant of Public Services Card will allow for more comprehensive data to be collected on usage or non-usage of free travel when all transport operators have implemented the Integrated Ticketing System.

New private operators seeking to enter the free travel scheme or existing private free travel operators seeking an increase in their payments must go through the survey process.  Where surveys of operators have not been undertaken in recent years my Department has asked operators to put such surveys in train as part of its control and review strategy.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the surveys my Department carries out periodic inspections of private operators within the free travel scheme.  The inspections are a means of monitoring the scheme to ensure compliance with my Department&rsquo;s requirements and to confirm information already held on file in relation to operators, routes and schedules.

This support has been based on clear reasoning and analysis of the various options and alternatives, and those reasons remain valid, despite growing concerns about the possibility of achieving such a solution.<\/p>  <p>  The inescapable fact is that a two state outcome remains better than any other model that has been considered, and is the only one which can deliver peace, security, freedom and justice for both Israeli and Palestinian peoples. <\/p>  <p>  An acceptable one state outcome could only be on the basis of full equality between all those living under its jurisdiction.  Any belief that it will be possible instead to simply continue a version of the present occupation would be wholly unacceptable. <\/p>  <p>  The recent remarks of President Trump have stepped back from the clear support for the two state solution which previous Presidents have given, but without putting an alternative view in its place.

I hope very much that when it does so, it will recognise the logic which has guided US policy for many years.<\/p>  <p>  For our part, the European Union has made clear that our support and advocacy for a two state solution remain unaltered.  The strong international consensus on this basis was expressed only last month at the Paris Conference, which I attended, and in Security Council Resolution 2334 in December.  We will continue to represent this view in our discussions with the new US Administration, bilaterally and at EU level, and in international fora such as the UN and the Quartet.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200081#WRN00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Passport Services","counter":329,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200081#WRN00850"},{"type":"question","counter":330,"qnumday":148,"qnumall":"[8924\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200081#WRN00900","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the planned changes to renewal of adult passports online; when he expects this to take place; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1254","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":331,"content":"<p>The introduction of on-line enrolment for passport applications is a key customer service initiative under the Passport Reform Programme.

We have been concerned for some time at the increasing trend of governments to prevent human rights defenders from engaging with the UN and by reports that some have been punished and even imprisoned on return from participation in meetings of the Human Rights Council.  As a member of the Human Rights Council, Ireland prioritised the role of civil society and took the lead on a resolution in 2013 which addressed this issue for the first time as a human rights concern and called on states to create an maintain a safe and enabling environment for civil society.  <\/p>  <p>  We have continued to follow this issue very closely following the conclusion of our term on the Human Rights Council.  At its 32nd session in July 2016, Ireland led negotiations which resulted in the adoption of a further resolution on civil society space which, among other measures, called on the High Commissioner for Human Rights to prepare a report compiling information on the procedures and practices in respect of civil society involvement with regional and international organisations, including United Nations bodies, agencies, funds and programmes.  It is expected that this report will be presented to the Human Rights Council at its 35th session in July 2017.<\/p>  <p>  While the accreditation of participants to Human Rights Council meetings in Geneva is ultimately a matter for the UN Office in Geneva and the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, Ireland has actively supported the position that civil society actors, including human rights defenders, should be free to participate in such meetings without fear of reprisals.  Ireland is a member of a core group, together with Fiji, Ghana, Hungary and Uruguay, which will deliver a joint statement at the next meeting of the Human Rights Council in March welcoming the mandate given to the Assistant Secretary General of the UN for Human Rights to receive, consider and respond to allegations of intimidation and reprisals against human rights defenders and other civil society actors engaging with the UN.  We strongly believe that this long awaited and important development will ensure a more systematised and coordinated response to this issue of concern and help to put an end to intimidation and reprisals against those cooperating with the UN on human rights issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200081#WRN01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Agreements","counter":338,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200081#WRN01450"},{"type":"question","counter":339,"qnumday":151,"qnumall":"[8960\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200081#WRN01500","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the countries that have an association agreement with the European Union in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1228","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":340,"content":"<p>Article 217 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union provides that the Union may conclude with one or more third countries or international organisations agreements establishing an association involving reciprocal rights and obligations, common action and special procedure.

It does this primarily through the UN Security Council which has a variety of tools at its disposal to address threats to international peace and to contribute towards the resolution of conflicts: it has the power to deploy peacekeeping and political missions, to authorise military action and to impose sanctions against non-compliant States. Ireland is convinced that the principle of multilateralism upon which the UN is founded offers the best approach to address conflict and crisis situations.  At the World Humanitarian Summit in 2016, Ireland endorsed the UN&rsquo;s commitments to help improve the humanitarian system so it can better respond to the needs of those affected by crises.  This reform places affected people at the centre of all humanitarian action, to better ensure their protection.  A coordinated humanitarian response is vital for the protection of civilians to ensure the most vulnerable receive the assistance they require, through safe and secure channels.  The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) plays a key role in strengthening the humanitarian system and improving international humanitarian coordination during emergencies.  In 2016, Ireland provided &euro;4.5 million of core funding to UNOCHA.  Ireland also provided &euro;12.75 million to the UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) and just over &euro;28 million to Country Based Pooled Funds (CBPFs) which are managed by UNOCHA.  <\/p>  <p>  The protection of vulnerable communities in emergencies is an essential element of Ireland&rsquo;s humanitarian action.  In addition to ensuring the humanitarian response is coordinated and safe, we provide support to UN agencies best placed to respond to those in need of protection services.  In 2016 Ireland provided over &euro;2.4 million to UNICEF for their work under the No Lost Generation initiative, which is dedicated to providing education and protection programmes to Syrian children and youth affected by the Syria crisis, both inside Syria and in the neighbouring countries. <\/p>  <p>  However, we recognise that, in addition to the UN&rsquo;s many successes and achievements, there have also been failures, and the need for the protection of the fundamental well-being of civilians caught up in conflicts remains a priority.  The ongoing crises in the Middle East and Africa illustrate clearly the importance of the UN enhancing its capacity to respond more effectively to conflict and the associated need for humanitarian protection.  <\/p>  <p>  The blockages at the Security Council in recent years have prevented the international community from acting together in a way that would allow civilians in conflict zones to be afforded greater protection.  Ireland is of the view that, in addition to the terrible consequences for civilian populations, including children, this inaction has resulted in considerable damage to the standing of the Security Council.  <\/p>  <p>  As a member of the Accountability, Coherence and Transparency (ACT) group of states, Ireland advocates for reforms to the membership and working methods of the Security Council, including the use of the veto which, on some occasions, has led to inaction by the Security Council at critical moments.  <\/p>  <p>  While decisions of the Security Council, which are key to the maintenance of international peace and security and to the welfare of civilians in conflict zones, are the preserve of Member States, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Guterres, who took office on 1 January, has announced a number of reform measures aimed at improving the management of the peace and security work of the UN Secretariat.  <\/p>  <p>  These measures include steps to remove structural and administrative barriers to better integrate the work of staff whose jobs address situations in conflict zones.  Mr. Guterres, whose own work as UN High Commissioner for Refugees from 2005-2015 gives him a particularly clear insight into the scale of the humanitarian crises facing the world, is to focus on the implementation of recommendations from three major peace and security reviews which were completed in 2015. Ireland engaged fully with all three reviews, calling for the recommendations to be discussed and implemented as part of our broader calls for UN reform.  We will continue to engage on these reviews in the period ahead.  <\/p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to advocate for reform of the UN to ensure that it is equipped to fulfil its critical role in the prevention, reduction or resolution of conflict, and also for the protection of civilians who are trapped in the many humanitarian crises arising from conflicts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200081#WRN01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Election Monitoring Missions","counter":344,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200081#WRN01850"},{"type":"question","counter":345,"qnumday":153,"qnumall":"[8982\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200081#WRN01900","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the amount spent on sending Irish election observers abroad in each of the past three years; the reason his department declined the invitation from the OSCE to provide Irish election observers to the recent US election; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1259","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":346,"content":"<p>International election monitoring missions play an important role in the promotion of democracy and human rights.

Engagement with third countries to prevent violent extremism and to strengthen their capacity to detect and prevent terrorism, in full compliance with international law and human rights, is at the heart of the EU&rsquo;s strategy and is reflected in a substantial increase in assistance to third countries in this respect.  The EU has placed considerable emphasis on its immediate neighbourhood: Western Balkans, Turkey, and Middle East and North Africa (MENA) countries.

In 2006, the McKinsey report, Children&rsquo;s Health First, recommended that the population of Ireland and projected demand could support only one world-class tertiary paediatric centre, that this should be in Dublin and that it should ideally be co-located with a leading adult academic hospital, to ensure relevant sub-specialty and academic linkages.  The McKinsey report recognised the importance for quality of healthcare of having a critical mass of sub-specialist skills in a tertiary centre and stated this could be achieved, firstly, by serving a large enough population to support a full complement of sub-specialists and, secondly, by co-locating with an adult teaching hospital thus enabling access to specialties that encompass both adult and paediatric patients, facilitating clinical and academic &ldquo;cross fertilisation&rdquo;, and attracting the top staff. <\/p>  <p>Reviews since 2006 have reaffirmed the importance of co-location with a major adult academic teaching hospital.  In 2011, Minister Reilly established an Independent Review Group to examine the project at the Mater.  The clinical aspect of this review was carried out by a team of four Chief Executive Officers drawn from the National Association of Children&rsquo;s Hospitals (NACHRI) and the Children&rsquo;s Hospitals International Executive Forum (CHIEF).  Their report stated that &ldquo;co-locating with tertiary adult and maternity hospitals is essential to the development of an excellent paediatric service.  This has become best practice internationally and was recognised in the McKinsey report.&rdquo;   <\/p>  <p>  In 2012, following the refusal of planning permission for the project at the Mater campus, Minister Reilly established the Dolphin Review Group to advise on next steps.  Their report stated that &ldquo;Having reviewed the reports already prepared and considered their analysis and opinions, and having also consulted with a wide range of professionals in the field, we are also of the view that co-location is essential and tri-location optimal.  We recommend that the Minister remains on this path.&rdquo;  Co-location with an adult hospital is the norm internationally, driven by four major advantages, namely access to adult specialists; access to expensive equipment (such as PET, MRI scanners); research and educational synergies; and facilitation of continuity in the care of the adolescent\/young adult with chronic disease.  A clinicians' sub-group of the Dolphin Group examined issues relating to clinical specialties and sub-specialties, transitional care for adolescents, and the integration of paediatric health research and education in the new children's hospital.  From a clinical and academic perspective, the Dolphin Group identified St James's Hospital as the existing Dublin Academic Teaching Hospital that best meets the criteria to be the adult partner in co-location because it has the broadest range of national specialties and excellent research and education infrastructure.  <\/p>  <p>  The Government decision to co-locate the hospital with St James's was announced on 6 November 2012.  In identifying the location, the Government considered the report of the Dolphin Group, and detailed supplementary information on cost, time and planning which was subsequently sought from those members of the Group with the relevant technical expertise.  The decision was made in the best interests of children, with clinical considerations paramount in the decision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200083#WRP02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Charges","counter":420,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200084#WRQ00200"},{"type":"question","counter":421,"qnumday":177,"qnumall":"[8880\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200084#WRQ00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will have a specific charge waived in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Cork.","asker":"1278","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":422,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200084#WRQ00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1337"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Screening Programmes","counter":423,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200084#WRQ00500"},{"type":"question","counter":424,"qnumday":178,"qnumall":"[8881\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200084#WRQ00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of the implementation of the HSE universal newborn hearing screening programme; if the programme is available for newborn children in every county; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1347","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":425,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the HSE for reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200084#WRQ00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services","counter":426,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200084#WRQ00800"},{"type":"question","counter":427,"qnumday":179,"qnumall":"[8883\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200084#WRQ00900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of the case of a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":428,"content":"<p>As this is a service issue, this question has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200084#WRQ01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1337"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medicinal Products Reimbursement","counter":429,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200084#WRQ01100"},{"type":"question","counter":430,"qnumday":180,"qnumall":"[8889\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200084#WRQ01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a decision will be made to make Orkambi available to cystic fibrosis sufferers here.","asker":"1259","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":431,"content":"<p>The HSE has statutory responsibility for decisions on pricing and reimbursement of medicines under the community drugs schemes, in accordance with the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013.<\/p>  <p>  In reaching its decision, the HSE examines all the evidence which may be relevant in its view for the decision (including the information \/dossier submitted by the Company) and will take into account such expert opinions and recommendations which may have been sought by the HSE at its sole discretion (for example, from the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics).<\/p>  <p>  In considering an application, the HSE will also have regard to Part 1 and Part 3 of Schedule 3 of the 2013 Act.

The NCPE have confirmed that all relevant costs were included in the analysis.  In line with the HSE's assessment process, the HSE Drugs Committee considered the NCPE recommendation, the manufacturers submissions and commercial offer and other information.

Part 3 requires the HSE to have regard to the following criteria:<\/p>  <p>  1. the health needs of the public;<\/p>  <p>  2. the cost-effectiveness of meeting health needs by supplying the item concerned rather than providing other health services;<\/p>  <p>  3. the availability and suitability of items for supply or reimbursement;<\/p>  <p>  4. the proposed costs, benefits and risks of the item or listed item relative to therapeutically similar items or listed items provided in other health service settings and the level of certainty in relation to the evidence of those costs, benefits and risks;<\/p>  <p>  5. the potential or actual budget impact of the item or listed item;<\/p>  <p>  6. the clinical need for the item or listed item;<\/p>  <p>  7. the appropriate level of clinical supervision required in relation to the item to ensure patient safety;<\/p>  <p>  8. the efficacy (performance in trial), effectiveness (performance in real situations) and added therapeutic benefit against existing standards of treatment (how much better it treats a condition than existing therapies); and<\/p>  <p>  9. the resources available to the HSE. <\/p>  <p>  I am informed that, following a request from the HSE, the NCPE carried out an assessment of the manufacturer's economic dossier submitted in March 2016 on the cost effectiveness of Orkambi and Kalydeco.  This dossier included details on all relevant costs and relevant cost offsets including those associated with hospitalisation, disease management costs, intravenous antibiotics, adverse events and any additional costs arising in patients not taking Orkambi or Kalydeco.<\/p>  <p>  The NCPE has completed its Health Technology Assessment and this is available on its website.  It was submitted to the HSE in June 2016. The NCPE determined, following an evaluation of the economic dossier, that the manufacturer failed to demonstrate cost-effectiveness or value for money from using the drug.  The NCPE have confirmed that all relevant costs were included in the analysis.  In line with the HSE's assessment process, the HSE Drugs Committee considered the NCPE recommendation, the manufacturers submissions and commercial offer and other information.  Following this consideration the Drugs Committee did not recommend reimbursement at the current price.  The HSE Directorate considered the Drugs Committee&rsquo;s recommendation in December and the Directorate took the decision not to reimburse at the current price offered by the company. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE has since re-entered into negotiations with Vertex, the manufacturer of Orkambi and Kalydeco, with a view to significantly reducing the cost of both drugs.  A meeting was held in December and again in early January.  Following completion of the negotiation process, I am advised that the HSE&rsquo;s Drugs Committee met at the end of January and considered the manufacturer's latest price offerings.  No decision has been reached regarding Orkambi and discussions are ongoing with regard to Kalydeco.  The matter is currently under consideration by the HSE Directorate. <\/p>  <p>  I understand how patients and their families must feel in these circumstances, as they await the decisions by the HSE in relation to reimbursement.  However, as with all new drugs developed, the HSE must follow a statutory process, as set out in the 2013 Act.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200085#WRR02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services","counter":486,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200086#WRS00200"},{"type":"question","counter":487,"qnumday":200,"qnumall":"[9010\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200086#WRS00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of the case of a person (details supplied) who is waiting for a prosthetic leg; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":488,"content":"<p>As the particular issue raised relates to an individual case, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the HSE for direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200086#WRS00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medicinal Products Data","counter":489,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200086#WRS00500"},{"type":"question","counter":490,"qnumday":201,"qnumall":"[9011\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200086#WRS00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his views on a matter (details supplied) with regard to Roaccutane; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":491,"content":"<p>Information held by the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) on suspected adverse reactions in association with Roaccutane has been forwarded to the Deputy by post.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200086#WRS00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Nursing Staff Recruitment","counter":492,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200086#WRS00800"},{"type":"question","counter":493,"qnumday":202,"qnumall":"[9070\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200086#WRS00900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the Cork University Maternity Hospital has a full complement of nursing staff; if not, the efforts being made to recruit; the timeframe that he expects to have the unit fully staffed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1229","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":494,"content":"<p>In relation to this particular issue, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200086#WRS01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Provision","counter":495,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200086#WRS01100"},{"type":"question","counter":496,"qnumday":203,"qnumall":"[9074\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200086#WRS01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of a radiology unit for an area (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":497,"content":"<p>It is proposed to build a replacement community nursing unit, that is, a long-stay residential centre for older people, in Killarney as part of a public private partnership or alternative funding mechanism by the end of 2021.

As such, they are recognised as valuable landscape features under the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS) and thus are eligible for BPS payments.  It is also recognised that such features must be appropriately managed and maintained by appropriate trimming of hedgerows to keep them in optimum condition, both as field boundary features and to help maintain the optimum structure and thickness to encourage bird nesting etc., and best practice prevails where this is done as part of an appropriate cutting rotation.<\/p>  <p>  Their importance is further recognised through the inclusion of a number of hedgerow specific actions within the GLAS (Agri-environment Scheme under pillar II) where 7,627 farmers have committed to planting an additional 1,298 km of new hedges.  These new hedges must be planted by 31 March 2017.  In addition, farmers in GLAS can select the action of coppicing of hedges and\/or laying of hedges which seek to improve the biodiversity value of escaped or abandoned hedges.<\/p>  <p>  Based on the research article Valuing the C sequestration potential for European agriculture from Aerstens, Nocker and Gobin (2013) it could be estimated that new hedges planted in GLAS could sequester 4858 tonnes of CO2 per year.<\/p>  <p>  The new LULUCF flexibility in the 2030 effort sharing regulation proposals offers opportunities to capture these credits in line with the LULUCF decision 2013 but in reality this is quite small against agri-emission approaching 20 mt.<\/p>  <p>  In contrast, unmaintained hedges grow tall and become gappy at the base, becoming less useful for wildlife and as a landscape feature.  Similarly, burning of growing vegetation can be an important land management tool in certain situations, where fire is used as a means to control scrub or to help improve cultivated land or as a means to develop and maintain fire breaks to protect forestry plantations and mitigating the risk of larger landscape scale fires, especially to put vital fire breaks in place to protect wider upland landscapes and forestry plantations.  Thus, well timed and controlled burning activities can lead to an overall reduction in fire risk and prevent even larger wildfires occurring,\u00a0which can offer farmers increased flexibility to carry out necessary land management activities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200086#WRS03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Single Payment Scheme Payments","counter":517,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200087#WRT00200"},{"type":"question","counter":518,"qnumday":210,"qnumall":"[8846\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200087#WRT00300","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the reason the single payment scheme penalty that was imposed on a person (details supplied) for 2013 has not been reviewed despite an appeal being sent in; and the reason it was deemed eligible for exclusion under the 2013 direct payment schemes.","asker":"1231","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":519,"content":"<p>Under the Terms and Conditions of the Direct Aid Schemes, which includes the 2013 Single Payment Scheme, farmers are obliged to declare only eligible land when making their applications.

The focus on the larger heat users was underpinned by analysis completed in 2014 which indicated that it would not be cost effective, at this stage, to include the domestic heating sector in the RHI.\u00a0 This is due to a number of factors including the much higher support tariff per kilowatt hour of energy that would be required to incentivise households to change heating systems, as well as the significantly greater costs associated with administering the scheme for a large number of households in what is an unregulated sector. <\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#0D0D0D\">In order to support on-going investment in renewable heat installations, the Department will seek clearance from the European Commission that RHI support can apply to RHI applicants, who meet the criteria of the scheme, and were completed and first commissioned between the Government announcement on the RHI in 2014 and the start date of the RHI.A final decision on whether this will be facilitated is a matter for the European Commission to decide and will be formally announced at the time the scheme is cleared by the European Commission. <\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#0D0D0D\">  I announced the final public consultation\u00a0on the design\u00a0and implementation of the new RHI scheme on\u00a026 January, 2017 which is available on<\/font><i>www.dccae.gov.ie.<\/i><font color=\"#0D0D0D\">I encourage all interested parties to submit a response to this consultation.

First, if a person is a holder of a driving licence issued by another EU Member State, then on taking up residence here they can exchange if for the Irish equivalent.

If a person with a driving licence from a State with which we have a bilateral agreement takes up residence here, they too may exchange their licence for an Irish one.  Finally, if the person comes from a State with which we do not have an exchange arrangement, they are treated as a learner and must go through the driver learning process.

She will be offered support and guidance by the Agency and advised that the adopted person has also been also been offered support and guidance.  The birth mother will be advised that the information will be provided to the adopted person unless she advises Tusla within 12 weeks, that she considers that there are compelling reasons not to release this information.  Where the Agency having considered any information, either provided by a birth parent or otherwise available to it, considers that there are compelling reasons for not disclosing information, it will refer the matter to the Circuit Court for determination.

No service will be forced to close. <\/p>  <p>  Delivering high quality, accessible and affordable childcare is my key goal, and this funding will ensure that every child will be cared for by a qualified professional, and that services can sustain existing levels of provision, while they prepare for the new Affordable Childcare Scheme. Services are also providing more ECCE places than ever before, and I am confident that over 125,000 children will be receiving free pre-school care and education this summer. <\/p>  <p>  All Community Childcare services around the country were afforded an opportunity to engage with the Childcare Committees Ireland project during 2016; over 200 did so, and detailed analysis has been completed.  As some services clearly needed additional funding to maintain service levels,  this money has now been allocated from the provision made for Sustainability Funding in Budget 2017, and will be available for drawdown very shortly, with Pobal making payments on behalf of the local Childcare Committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200091#WRX01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Early Childhood Care and Education Data","counter":670,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200092#WRY00150"},{"type":"question","counter":671,"qnumday":265,"qnumall":"[8963\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200092#WRY00200","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the cost to expand the second year child care ECCE scheme from 22 weeks to 32 weeks; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1231","askee":"1358"},{"type":"question","counter":672,"qnumday":266,"qnumall":"[8964\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200092#WRY00300","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the cost to expand the second year child care ECCE scheme from 22 weeks to 36 weeks; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1231","askee":"1358"},{"type":"question","counter":673,"qnumday":267,"qnumall":"[8965\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200092#WRY00400","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the cost to expand the second year child care ECCE scheme from 22 weeks to 38 weeks; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1231","askee":"1358"},{"type":"question","counter":674,"qnumday":268,"qnumall":"[8966\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200092#WRY00500","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the cost to expand the first year child care ECCE scheme from 38 to 40 weeks.","asker":"1231","askee":"1358"},{"type":"question","counter":675,"qnumday":269,"qnumall":"[8967\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200092#WRY00600","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the cost to expand the first year child care ECCE scheme from 38 to 42 weeks.","asker":"1231","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":676,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 265 to 269, inclusive, together.<\/p>  <p>  When introduced, the ECCE scheme provided free-preschool for 38 weeks of the year, the 38 weeks broadly mirrored the primary school academic year.  When ECCE was expanded as a result of Budget 2016, it enabled all children to attend ECCE from the age of three, entering at one of three entry points after their third birthday, September, January or April, and remain there until they started in primary school, with the exception that they could not be more than 5 years and 6 months when they finished ECCE in June.  This followed a recommendation from the Expert Group \" Right from the Start\".<\/p>  <p>  The expansion of ECCE  increased the average time in ECCE from 38 weeks to 61 weeks with children benefitting from a range of 51 weeks to 88  weeks.  Whilst the terminology of  \"a second year\" is often used, it is important to recognise that most children do not benefit from a full second year.  All children currently finish in ECCE in June regardless of when they start (September, January or April). <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy has a number of questions relating to an increase from 22 weeks, in the &ldquo;second&rdquo; ECCE year (the first chronological year), to the weeks outlined hereunder.  There are three intakes for the additional weeks provided in Budget 2016 (September, January and April).  The questions have been answered using the assumption that the January and April intake of children would be extended so that each intake would be entitled instead to 32, 36 and 38 weeks for their first year in the respective questions; September intakes will always have 38 weeks.<\/p>  <p>  The cost to increase the January and April ECCE intakes to 32 weeks in their first year would potentially be &euro;38 million.<\/p>  <p>  The cost to increase the January and April ECCE intakes to 36 weeks in their first year would be &euro;48 million.<\/p>  <p>  The cost to increase the January and April ECCE intakes to 38 weeks in their first year would potentially be &euro;53 million.<\/p>  <p>  The cost to increase the first year of the ECCE scheme from 38 to 40 weeks would potentially be &euro;8 million.<\/p>  <p>  The cost to increase the first year of the ECCE scheme from 38 to 42 weeks would potentially be &euro;17 million.<\/p>  <p>  As a general principle and to provide a guideline, we can consider that each additional week for the April intake in their first year would cost &euro;1m, each additional week for the January intake in their first year would cost &euro;1.5m and each additional week for September intakes (including year 1 and year 2 children) would cost &euro;6million.<\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that this question only addresses the financial aspect of such increases.  Any such changes would require revision of rules around eligibility and  enrolment dates and would need to look at issues of capacity with regard to physical space, staffing capacities and other associated matters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200092#WRY00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child and Family Agency Services","counter":677,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200092#WRY00750"},{"type":"question","counter":678,"qnumday":270,"qnumall":"[8968\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200092#WRY00800","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the amount of the Tusla budget that goes directly to aftercare; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1231","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":679,"content":"<p>I am committed to implementing the Child Care (Amendment) Act 2015 which entitles eligible young people to a formal aftercare plan, prepared by Tusla in collaboration with the young person leaving care.

Fourteen committees are currently in operation with a final three committees in development. Tusla has also further developed the information it provides regarding aftercare services.<\/p>  <p>  Consultation is underway with all key stakeholders in order to finalise the revision of Tusla&rsquo;s Aftercare policy.  The consultation process has included foster carers, young people\/young adults, aftercare staff, social work staff, NGO's, private foster care and residential care providers and other State departments.  All have been invited to events and offered the opportunity to make written submissions.  Ten events have taken place to date with two remaining.

This data was not collated prior to 2015.  In 2016, of the 467 young adults discharged prior to the end of September by reason of reaching 18 years of age, 457 were eligible for aftercare supports and 412 were availing of these.  2016 is the first year for which Tusla has collated data regarding uptake of aftercare supports. There were a total of 1,841 young people aged 18 to 22 years in receipt of aftercare supports from Tusla at the end of the third quarter in 2016, and 82% of these young people had an aftercare plan in place.  <\/p>  <p>  Once the amendments to the Child Care Act are commenced there will be a statutory obligation on Tusla to have an aftercare plan prior to the young person leaving care.

A key factor in achieving success is ensuring that assessment, preparation and planning for leaving care begins in the years prior to leaving care and continues as part of the care planning process.

The care leavers most vulnerable to homelessness are those leaving residential or short-term foster care placements.  Children who come into care late, in their mid to late teens, may not have developed the relationships with staff or aftercare workers that help them achieve good outcomes.
