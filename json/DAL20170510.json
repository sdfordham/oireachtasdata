Over recent years, unfortunately, the force has been mired in scandal and debacle, lowering morale and confidence within the force.  We have had the whistleblowers' stories, the penalty points, the malpractice, the phone recordings, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, bugging, the 1 million fake breathalyser tests and, of course, the fixed charge notices which resulted in many thousands of people being wrongly charged.  Now we have had very damning revelations pertaining to Templemore Garda College and the whole issue around the 42 bank accounts and the complete breach of procedures, law and accountability, which is an extraordinary story in itself.<\/p>  <p>  The revelations of the director of human resources, John Barrett, are particularly damning about the culture that has protected this edifice for so long and the inaction of the senior management of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including the Garda Commissioner, in dealing with this issue in a transparent, accountable and effective way.  Mr. Barrett met the Commissioner and other senior members of the force in July 2015.  It was a two hour meeting, as far as he and others have testified, but in addition to that, it was clear that the head of legal affairs in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Mr. Ken Ruane, had written to the Commissioner stating that she had a legal obligation under section 41 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act to make a section 41 report to the Minister.  Section 41 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act is very clear that significant developments that might reasonably be expected adversely to affect public confidence in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should be notified to the Minister.  That did not happen, even though the Garda Commissioner was given written notice by the head of legal affairs to do that, given all that had transpired in regard to Templemore Garda College.<\/p>  <p>  Does the Taoiseach accept the Garda Commissioner did not discharge her legal obligations to inform the Minister for Justice and Equality of significant developments that would clearly adversely affect public confidence in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, namely, the issues relating to Templemore?<\/p><p>It took 15 months from the date of being told she should do it by her legal adviser to having the Minister informed.  Is that good enough?  Could the Taoiseach indicate what the Minister for Justice and Equality has to say about this?  Will the Minister come into this House and make a statement on these issues, and on that specific matter?  Why would the Commissioner tell the Minister at that time?  What is the issue?  What was the problem?  In the light of all that, do the Taoiseach and the Government still have confidence in the Garda Commissioner to discharge her duties and manage the Garda out of this series of debacles?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000003#A00200","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1494414300,"counter":8,"content":"<p>The first point Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin makes is important.  I agree it is critical that the public and the Government have absolute faith and trust in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and, clearly, that has been a matter in respect of which there has been pressure for quite some time.  I have faith and every confidence in the Garda Commissioner to do her job.  I must point out to the Deputy that the issues here are being examined by the Committee of Public Accounts, the Policing Authority and the Comptroller and Auditor General.  It is appropriate that the work under way in that process should be able to be completed.<\/p>  <p>  I would further point out that the work initiated here relates to a period quite a number of years ago.  Action was taken by the Commissioner - when it was brought to her attention - in order that these matters would be dealt with conclusively.  The Committee of Public Accounts is to meet again on 13 July.  As I understand it, the Garda Commissioner will attend again at the committee to give evidence.<\/p>  <p>  When the information was brought to the attention of the Minister, she sent it to the Policing Authority.  The Deputy will be aware that the report contains recommendations which must be overseen by the Policing Authority.  Obviously, the authority acts completely independently of both the Commissioner and the Government.  I note that earlier today it made another appointment of an assistant commissioner in accordance with the new method of making senior appointments to the Garda.<\/p>  <p>  Section 41 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act enables the Commissioner of the day to send notices to the Minister for Justice and Equality.  That is a matter of judgment for the Garda Commissioner.<\/p>  <p>  Clearly, this process has not been completed and needs to be dealt with so that all of the evidence and facts can not only be ascertained but also judged.  For that reason, the reform that is under way is quite extensive.  The Deputy will be aware of the enhanced powers being sought in respect of GSOC, the Garda Inspectorate report, the independent Policing Authority and now the appointment of a commission to examine the structure of the Garda in the context of the way it is run and the mechanics of how it does its business.  The commission will not be examining the qualities of any individual personality within the ranks of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but will be looking at the structure overall so that the force can be seen to be professional and competent in terms of how it does its job in the interests of the people of the country, as one would expect.<\/p>  <p>  The Government retains confidence in the Garda Commissioner.  Obviously, in my view, it would be a mistake to personalise issues in respect of the new commission looking at the structure and the culture of the Garda.  It is not about that.  The work is under way by the Committee of Public Accounts, the Policing Authority and the Comptroller and Auditor General.  They should be entitled to finish their work and report on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000004#B00200","speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1494414300,"counter":9,"content":"<p>The Act does not enable the Commissioner, it legally obliges the Commissioner.

Mr. Barrett points out that requests for copies of previous audits in 2008 and 2010 were denied to the audit committee and described this as a \"bizarre course of action\".

In fact, it was kept from him.  Yesterday, I raised these matters with the Taoiseach and the fact that John Barrett, the head of Garda human resources, had handed over documentation to the Committee of Public Accounts that completely contradicts the evidence provided to the committee by Garda Commissioner N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan last Thursday.  I raised that along with a raft of other scandals that have shaped Ms O'Sullivan's leadership of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and, once again, the Taoiseach expressed his confidence in the Commissioner and he did that again a moment ago.<\/p>  <p>  Last night the details of the 122-page document provided by Mr. Barrett emerged in the public domain.  The information provided is damning.  Mr. Barrett states that the actions taken by senior garda&iacute; in response to financial irregularities at Templemore would be seen as a cover-up.  The financial irregularities include how moneys generated from various Garda College areas were moved outside the purview of the normal accounting practices and into some 42 unauthorised accounts.  Mr. Barrett further claims that Garda auditors were purposely kept in the dark about what was happening.  The Garda Commissioner has claimed she was not aware of the scale of the irregularities two years ago.  She said it was mentioned in a brief chat.  However, the documents provided by Mr. Barrett support his position that he first raised these concerns about financial irregularities at Templemore in July 2015 with Commissioner O'Sullivan, Assistant Commissioner John Twomey and the head of Garda legal affairs, Ken Ruane.  The meeting was a detailed discussion that lasted for over two hours.  Mr. Barrett also claims that Commissioner O'Sullivan failed to act on advice from the head of Garda legal affairs to inform the Minister for Justice and Equality about the irregularities discussed in July 2015.<\/p><p>The Commissioner does not have flexibility.  She has a statutory obligation to do so under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act, yet the Minister remained silent this morning.  In fact, the Minister remains absent this afternoon.  As I told the Taoiseach yesterday, accountability or the lack of it is the key issue underpinning all of these controversies and scandals.  That goes to the heart of public alienation in public life and politics, and disillusionment with State agencies.  This is unacceptable.  What is happening is a waste of taxpayers' money.  It is all the more alarming because An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is the body that is supposed to be enforcing the law.  Those are not my words, they are the words of the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Leo Varadkar, this morning.<\/p> <p> The fact is that there is no accountability for those in high places.  Can one imagine a poor, powerless person getting away with even a smidgen of these offences?  My question to the Taoiseach is simple.  He says he has confidence in the Commissioner and maybe he has good reason for that.  We do not know it or share that, but he should explain to us why he has confidence in the leadership of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000005#C01900","speaker":"1330","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1494415200,"counter":30,"content":"<p>Deputy Adams made a point about the leadership of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under Commissioner O'Sullivan.

That is why the Committee of Public Accounts is investigating this matter and looking at it.

During that debate, I also touched on the fact that elderly people are having their homes invaded and are being attacked.  Very sadly, since then a man aged 94 years and his wife, who is 87, had their home invaded last Sunday.  Two men attacked him.  They broke his walking stick over his head.  They ransacked his house and stole money.  Representatives of the active retirement associations around the country have said that politicians will have to step up.  I agree.<\/p>  <p>  This type of behaviour from any human being should not be tolerated.  I am not blaming Government or An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  These people are scumbags.  They are the worst type of cowardly blackguards that God ever had the misfortune to create and bring into this world.  They are horrible people.  I know that they will not hear this because they are all thrown in a slumber somewhere sound asleep and would not be up until evening time, but if any one of them is awake I would send a message to them out of this House: they are cowards; they are horrible blackguards.<\/p>  <p>  I commend the Government that was in office at the time of Veronica Guerin's death.  It came in here and worked diligently - Opposition and Government together.  It brought in new rules and regulations that ensured the formation of the Criminal Assets Bureau.  The Taoiseach and others that were here tackled organised crime in a very diligent and workmanlike way.  We, as Government and Opposition and as elected Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, have to stand up and say that we will not tolerate this type of behaviour.<\/p><p>We will ensure elderly people in their homes will be safe, secure and happy in the knowledge that if any person is stupid enough to enter their homes and hurt a hair on their heads, they will be dealt with severely.  I am talking about punishments such as tagging.  This is not an outrageous thing to say.  They should be tagged for life because people should know where they are if any person is cowardly enough to do this.  Why do they not take on big strong men in their homes and see how they would come out of it?  I am very supportive of what the Government did in the Criminal Law (Defence and the Dwelling) Act 2011 under which a person is entitled, and rightly so, to use reasonable force to protect their home.

I do not know who the people who broke into that house are, the condition they were in or the state of their minds, but to do that to an elderly person is unforgivable in so many ways.  Unfortunately, it is not the first time it has happened and probably will not be the last.  I hope Mr. Campion is making a recovery.  I note the reports of the walking stick being broken and the effect this is having on his wife, Maura, with the post traumatic stress caused by people entering a house and beating up a man in his senior years.  I saw his neighbour and colleague on television saying that he was a gentleman of the first type against whom he had played hurling so many years ago.  They would not have attempted to break into the house if he had been in his younger years as a hurler.  I share the Deputy's view on this matter.<\/p>  <p>  It is a fact of life that we have made serious attempts to involve communities through the text alert system and Macra na Tuaithe where communities are advised to be in contact with the Garda and Garda stations when unusual happenings and these type of suspicious movements take place.  The TheftStop partnership with the IFA aims to deal with the stealing of livestock and machinery.  As the Deputy is aware, efforts are under way to deal with this through various technological chips and so on to prevent machinery being stolen and to ensure that if it is stolen, people will know where it is.  A total of 75% of burglaries are committed by about 25% of these people.  Some of those involved are professional gangs.  Operation Thor, which has been funded by the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Government, has put a stop to a great deal of that because many of those professional gangs who leave particular areas to travel throughout the country in high-speed cars have had their run ended.<\/p>  <p>  I hope the local garda&iacute; in Roscrea are able to apprehend these people.  It will be for the courts to punish them.  The Deputy made a very clear case about how he feels they should be punished.  It is simply unforgivable that a man and his wife in the comfort of their own home who expect they will be able to live their lives in peace and tranquility should have that breached by thugs who enter a house for no other reason than to beat someone up and rob money.  I hope the local garda&iacute; find these people, that they are brought before the courts and that the judge on the bench will deal with them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000008#F00200","speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1494416400,"counter":54,"content":"<p>I cannot agree with the Taoiseach about Operation Thor because I believe it has sent these criminals underground and into rural areas.

I want an end to these people being treated with kid gloves.  There is free legal aid and every sort of pampering and nonsense for them.  The full rigours of the law must be applied to them.  Every one of us has parents or grandparents who grew older and more frail until we possibly lost them.  We became more protective of them.  We want to protect our elderly people.

The Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Act 2015 was targeted at burglars with previous convictions and who are charged with multiple residential break-ins.  That Act requires that the courts provide for consecutive jail sentences when a burglar is being sentenced for multiple offences.  It also allows courts to refuse bail to offenders who have a previous conviction for domestic burglary.<\/p>  <p>  This case involves an aggravated situation where the burglars beat up an elderly man.  The criminal justice forensic evidence and DNA database system was commenced a year ago and introduced the DNA database, which provides the Garda with investigative links between people and unsolved crimes, including burglary.  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, this morning turned the sod on a new forensic laboratory in County Kildare, which will cost over &euro;30 million.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Michael Healy-Rae should not underestimate the impact of Operation Thor, which began in November 2015 at a time of straitened public finances.  It led to a sharp decline in the national rate of burglary, which has been reflected in successive statistics published by the CSO.  The full year figures for 2016 are the most recent available.  They indicate a 30 % reduction in burglary over that 12-month period.  <\/p>  <p>  That does not excuse what happened to the Campion couple in Roscrea.  I hope that the Garda is able to apprehend the perpetrators and that they are brought before a court to be dealt with by a judge.  The Deputy&rsquo;s point is valid.  Whether they be urban, semi-rural or what one might call really rural, communities need to be on the alert.  Facilities such as the text alert scheme and so on are available that allow suspicious vehicles or people acting suspiciously to be reported in the hope that issues such as this one will not arise again or at least will be reduced.  Should an incident unfortunately occur, those facilities will mean that the perpetrators can be apprehended.  <\/p>  <p>  I hope that Jimmy Campion makes a full recovery.

However, our draft national climate mitigation plan is an unmitigated disaster.  The head of the EPA says that the Government&rsquo;s policy measures are failing.  John FitzGerald, the head of the climate advisory group, says the plan lacks substance, detail and analysis.  The environmental NGOs have given it an F rating and it is lucky not to have been given a G rating.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the European Union, we are now mentioned in the same breath as Poland.  There are only two countries in the EU that will not meet their emission targets and we are one of them.  There are only four countries which are not going to meet the renewable targets.  This country, which has some of the richest renewable resources in the world, is unfortunately in that category and heading in the wrong direction.  The Institute of International and European Affairs estimates that those failure could cost us between &euro;3 billion and &euro;6 billion over the next decade.<\/p>  <p>  What do we have?  We have a Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Naughten, who has the cheek to say the problem is that we were too ambitious.  During the Green Party&rsquo;s period in Government between 2008 and 2011, emissions fell by 15 %.  Half of that drop was due to the economic downturn but the EPA recognised that the other half was because of political commitment in government to the issue at that time.  The EPA projects that we are now facing a 15 % increase in emissions up to 2030.  If we were to take this issue seriously and grab the opportunity, we would go in the opposite direction.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, was absent from the talks and had no interest whatsoever.  The plan has many gaps where there should be transport initiatives.<\/p><p>The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine says to count agriculture out because that sector has nothing to do with it.  This is part of the reason - and it is not just because there are thousands of acres of forestry burning in the west today - that we are turning this green island brown.   This is not in the interests of farmers, landowners or foresters.<\/p> <p> We do not have a single public transport project ready to go to tender.  We cannot get a cycle lane built along the Liffey quays because of a lack of funding from the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and as a result of a lack of political support at council level.  We cannot build a greenway to Galway; it could even go by that plant in Athenry that the Government can get built for Apple, which will be an innovative part of the new green economy because it will be 100% powered by renewable energy.  The Danes are building a similar plant and while matters here are stuck in planning, they are actually going to commission that facility.  Will the Taoiseach tell us what is going to change and what the Government is going to do differently? The lack of political ambition and lack of economic understanding in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is at the core of our failure.

In the context of the scale of transformation, there is a real challenge for the State to meet its targets between 2020 and 2030.  It is not a case of being ambitious enough; it is a case of having letting this slip in Tokyo in the first instance, where our profile - for what it was - was not recognised.  It should have been the case of building the ambition on top of that and of not in making the target completely unreachable.  The extent of the challenge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in line our EU and international commitments - including the Paris Agreement - is well understood by Government.  The best technical minds are working on this to see how we can be ambitious between 2020 and 2030 and meet with our requirements in that regard.  These are reflected in the 2014 national policy position on climate action and low-carbon development, which is underpinned by the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015.  The national policy and the 2015 Act provide the high-level policy and statutory direction for the adoption and implementation of successive national mitigation plans.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy spoke of building the greenway from Athlone to Galway.  Does he not appreciate the difficulties that arise when one tries to do something like that?  It is now virtually impossible to make any move in this country without taking into account the litigious nature of people.  This presents difficulties and, under the law of the land, there are opportunities for people to object to everything.  It is not possible to walk in on farmer X or farmer Y and say that we are suddenly putting in place compulsory purchase orders in respect of their land in order that we might put in place a greenway to allow people to pass through.  There must be a process of consultation and discussion in the same way that I hope Ministers will be able to bring forward the regulations relating to wind turbines in the next weeks.

Sinn F&eacute;in believes that pay restoration must prioritise those earning below &euro;65,000, with pay increases for the low paid.

It has been found by the review group to be equal to what is available in the private sector and confers no pension benefit over and above what would be normal.  Does the Taoiseach accept that public servants employed prior to 2013 were employed on the basis of a contract which specified getting a pension after payments for 40 years based on their final salary?  That is what they contractually worked for over a period approaching 40 years and it would be invidious and wrong to change the goalposts now towards the end of their working career.  Does the Taoiseach also accept that many public servants now have an integrated pension, so the notion that there is not provision for it is untrue because people who pay PRSI and have the contributory State pension calculated as part of their benefits are paid from the Social Insurance Fund?  There is provision on an annual basis for that.  Does the Taoiseach debunk the notion that because of real difficulties in private sector pensions that somehow the solution is to worsen public sector pensions significantly?

Deputy Howlin raised an important point.  The report sets out a basic bedrock for valuable discussions and it is not for me to predetermine what the Government outcome on it might be.  As I understand it, the next step is that officials from what was at one time Deputy Howlin's Department will engage with personnel in the public sector unions and the Minister will start the negotiations as soon as possible for an extension of the Lansdowne Road agreement.<\/p>  <p>  In respect of pensions, the commission was tasked, first, with assessing the overall value of the public service remuneration package, which includes not only pay but pensions.  That was provided for in the terms of reference of the commission.  The work undertaken in that regard was both significant and important and I commend Mr. Duffy on his report.  The approach of the Government to the issue of public service pensions is based on the fiscal sustainability of providing public service pensioners, current employees and future employees with public service pensions now and into the future.  Deputy Howlin made a specific point on that.  Both the State and its employees who are public servants have a shared interest in securing the sustainability of the pension system.  Reform measures over the years such as integrating the occupational pension with the contributory State pension, extending the minimum retirement date from 60 to 65 and the introduction of a new career single public service pension scheme linked to the Civil Service pensions, CSP, age and the consumer price index, CPI, have contributed to the future sustainability of the public service occupational pension system.<\/p>  <p>  However, we know from right across the economy that pensions have become increasingly expensive.  The outputs from the commission confirm that and they reflect the values of the pension entitlements for various pension cohorts currently within the public service.  The proposal by the commission that any agreed adjustment in pension contributions for public servants in respect of pension benefits should be linked with the discontinuance of the pension related deduction, PRD, imposed by the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest, FEMPI, 2009 Act has been noted.  Those are matters which will undoubtedly feature in the proposed public service pay discussions.  That is best left for that engagement and interaction to take place.<\/p>  <p>  The commission considers that the values identified for those on legacy standard accrual pension schemes and fast accrual schemes should be addressed by providing for an increased employee contribution for those who continue to benefit from such schemes.  Rates of contribution are a matter for negotiation.  While the commission considers it would be reasonable to apply any agreed adjustments in contributions in conjunction with the discontinuance of the pension related deduction currently imposed on public servants under the FEMPI Act, in the commission's view the value of public service pensions could be reasonably fixed in a range of 12% to 18% over private sector norms for pre-2013 standard-accrual pension schemes but that fast accrual schemes incur greater costs.  The point raised by Deputy Howlin is an important one and I expect it will feature centrally in the discussions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000019#R01300","speaker":"1245"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Commissions of Investigation","time":1494421800,"counter":200,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000019#R01400"},{"type":"question","time":1494421800,"counter":201,"qnumday":3,"qnumall":"[20723\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000019#R01500","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"when he received the Fennelly commission report; and the actions he took thereafter.","asker":"1224","askee":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1494421800,"counter":202,"content":"<p>I received the final report of the Fennelly commission on 31 March 2017 and it was published on my Department's website on 6 April 2017.  The commission's final report made findings of great concern to the Government and, I am sure, to this House.<\/p>  <p>  The commission found that recording and retaining non-999 calls was not authorised by common law or by statute and that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na therefore infringed the constitutional rights of those recorded.  The commission also made damning findings about the lack of effective oversight and procedures within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na over a lengthy period and the failure to respond when some technicians and officers raised concerns and questions.  However, the commission also found that it is \"reasonable to conclude, based on the evidence before it, that no widespread or systematic, indeed probably no significant, misuse of information derived from non-999 recordings took place\".  The commission also found no evidence of knowledge of the recording of non-999 telephone calls on the part of relevant Ministers for Justice and Equality, the Department of Justice and Equality, or other State agencies.<\/p>  <p>  Taken together, the findings of the Fennelly commission reinforce the Government's determination to carry out a fundamental review of the future of policing in Ireland.  In April, the Government approved draft terms of reference for a commission on the future of policing in Ireland, and the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality is consulting all parties in the House before those are finalised.  The review will look at all functions carried out by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including community safety, State security and immigration.  It will also consider the full range of bodies that provide oversight and accountability for policing in Ireland.  It will take account of the changing nature of crime, society and public expectations; best practice in other countries; previous reports concerning policing in Ireland; and any specific challenges to delivering consistent reform in policing.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to this comprehensive reform agenda, the Government has also agreed that the T&aacute;naiste will refer the Fennelly report to the Policing Authority to oversee implementation of its recommendations in the context of its oversight of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; examine the need for legislation on the recording of calls and related matters on foot of the recommendations of the Fennelly commission; and refer matters in the report relating to the Bailey case to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, to consider whether it believes any further investigation is necessary against the background of the investigation it has been carrying out already into the case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000019#R01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1494422400,"counter":203,"content":"<p>This question was submitted before Easter.  In his reply the Taoiseach made the point that the Fennelly report made damning findings about the lack of effective oversight and procedures in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na over a lengthy period of time, and the failure to respond when some technicians and officers raised concerns and questions.  This goes to the heart of the issue that I raised again this morning, which is that when the current Garda Commissioner was made aware, back in 2015, about the situation in Templemore and when the head of legal services in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na made it very clear in writing to the Commissioner that she had a legal obligation under section 41 to report that issue to the Minister for Justice and Equality, the Commissioner decided not to do so at that time, and took a further 15 months.<\/p>  <p>  That is exactly the lack of oversight or action that Fennelly refers to in relation to the phone recordings.  It is evident here again.  The matter has been raised for quite some time by the head of legal services.  It is akin to the Attorney General saying to the Taoiseach \"You legally have to do this, Taoiseach.\"  The head of legal services told the Commissioner that she legally had to tell the Minister, yet the Commissioner did not do so.  That is quite fundamental and we need a serious answer as to why the Commissioner did not follow through on that legal advice that came from the head of legal services.<\/p>  <p>  I am not satisfied by the Taoiseach's response this morning.  I am not sure he has grasped the key point that there was a legal obligation which was not upheld.  It is a very serious issue in terms of the discharge of one's duties.  I put it to the Taoiseach, however, that the lessons have not been learned.  In the midst of everything that has happened, that failure to discharge a legal obligation is quite damning for the current Commissioner, given the level of awareness she should have had concerning all the other issues that were swimming around An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na back in 2015, including whistleblowers and GSOC.  With everything that was going on, surely the Commissioner should have said this was something she had to go to the Minister with immediately.  At least the Minister should have been made aware of an issue that would involve reputational damage to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na because of the issues that have been revealed in the context of the Templemore report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000020#S00100","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1494422400,"counter":204,"content":"<p>First, the interim internal audit report in relation to the finances of the Garda College were submitted to the T&aacute;naiste's Department on 27 March this year.  That raises serious issues concerning the governance and accountability in the college, which the T&aacute;naiste has stated must be addressed comprehensively and thoroughly.  Some of the main issues of concern highlighted by that report include the manner in which the college was run, the existence of a large number of bank accounts and investment accounts linked to the college, staffing issues, and issues relating to the ownership and use of certain lands, the previous 2008 report raising issues in relation to the college, and the non-implementation of its recommendations.<\/p>  <p>  The accounting officer for the purposes of the Comptroller and Auditor General Acts is the Garda Commissioner.  The Commissioner has accepted the findings set out in the report and has put in place arrangements to ensure the recommendations are implemented.  The Commissioner sent the report to the Committee of Public Accounts as well as to the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The Committee of Public Accounts commenced its examination of the report on 4 May and will continue its work on 13 July.<\/p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste has been assured that the Garda authorities recognise the gravity of the issues raised here and that they are taking active steps to progress the recommendations in the report.  External governance expertise and auditors have been engaged.  A steering committee, chaired by the chief administrative officer and including a representative from the T&aacute;naiste's Department, is overseeing the implementation of the recommendations.  There are several aspects to that implementation of the recommendations that do require further consideration to ensure there is a full understanding of the extent of the issues identified, the implications of the actions required to put the appropriate governance structures and financial and operational processes and procedures in place in the college to address fully the recommendations, and the future development of the Garda College.  This work is under way.<\/p>  <p>  On receipt of the report and in view of the gravity of the issues raised, the T&aacute;naiste immediately requested the Policing Authority to oversee the implementation of the recommendations and to report back to her on a quarterly basis in relation to the progress being made.  The authority intends to submit its first report in July.<\/p>  <p>  In the course of the Committee of Public Accounts hearing on 4 May, a discrepancy emerged in the evidence given by the Garda Commissioner and the executive director of human resources and people development, Mr. Barrett, over the length of a discussion in late July during which the executive director raised concerns about the college's finances.  The Commissioner recollected what she described as a brief discussion when she and a number of other senior officers were having tea after a long meeting at the college.

Anybody who read the documents submitted yesterday by Mr. Barrett could not come to the conclusion that this can be reduced to an internal management dispute, a difference of views.  Mr. Barrett has no axe to grind.  He was brought in as an external person with extraordinary human resource management experience in the private sector.  He has taken comprehensive notes.  It is not reconcilable that the Commissioner would view this as a chat for a few minutes over a cup of tea.

It is sent to some review body, or sent to the Committee of Public Accounts, or sent somewhere, but nobody is ever fundamentally held to account.

Unfortunately for the Taoiseach, his term of office has been dogged by these issues.  He has responsibility for the Garda Commissioner because he refused to give that responsibility to the Policing Authority.  If he had done so, the issue would have been dealt with there.  It would have decided whether the Garda Commissioner should stay or go.  The buck stops with the Taoiseach.  That is where it stops.

The timeline for that is the point.  There was a report in 2008 and another in 2010.  The internal audit committee was denied access to them for some reason.  The essence of what has been suggested and said here in respect of the documentation from Mr. Barrett, is that there was an overall attempt to prevent this from getting into the public domain, or an attempt to massage or manage this internally.  There is the suggestion that everybody in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na knew about Templemore, this elephant in the room, and all of the issues around it.  To use Mr. Barrett's language, it was in plain view.  It was nonetheless not getting the traction it should have gotten in terms of proper accountability and so on.<\/p>  <p>  There is a part to which I have not gotten a satisfactory response.  If we go back 15 months from the time the report was given to the Minister, when the head of legal services wrote to the Commissioner telling her that she was legally obliged to refer this to the Minister.  Despite this, the Commissioner did not take that legal advice and did not refer it to the Minister.  Has the Taoiseach or the Minister received any response from the Commissioner as to why she did not act at that time on that legal advice from the head of legal services of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?  Why did she take a decision not to act on this and not to bring it to the Minister's attention?  There was a legal obligation, but in my view there was also a moral obligation.  In terms of due process and procedure and accountability, the Minister should have been made aware of this given the comprehensive nature of the reports that were there at the time - the audits and so on.<\/p><p>There was no argument at this stage about the 42 accounts or the OPW lands.  Clearly, if this got out, it would be very problematic for the Minister of the day.  It seems extraordinary that the Minister would have been kept in the dark about all of this for what seems to have been up to 15 months.  The Taoiseach has not really responded to that specific point.  Why did the Commissioner not alert the Minister?  Can the Minister come in to the House and explain that sequence of events and the failure of the Commissioner to tell her at the time?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000021#T03500","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1494423600,"counter":256,"content":"<p>That question was put to the Commissioner at a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts.  Her response was that she subsequently called for a committee to be put in place and the Department of Justice and Equality was represented on the committee and as far as she was concerned, that addressed her legal obligations.  I do not think anybody could accept that.  The senior legal adviser to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na told the Commissioner that under the law, she must notify the Minister because she was now aware of these very serious allegations relating to the Garda training college.  Were the Taoiseach to get a letter from his senior legal adviser, namely, the Attorney General, he would have to act on it.  The notion that the problem would be solved by setting up a committee on which an official from the Department might sit and who might tell the Minister is not believable.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach spoke about the Commissioner acting with alacrity.  She did not act with alacrity.  That is the problem.  It was always the case that we need to do something at the last minute and do the minimum.

The Taoiseach conceded earlier that all is not well, which was an understatement and the most I could get out of him.  So all is not well.  Deputy Enda Kenny is the Taoiseach.  He has responsibility for this issue because he refused to give it over to an independent authority.  This is one of the very few places where a Minister still has responsibility for policing.  I invite the Taoiseach to do something which he has so far refused to do.  He has said time out of number that he has confidence in the Garda Commissioner.  I do not know the Commissioner.  I have met her a few times, mostly in Croke Park, so this is not personal.  The Taoiseach says he has confidence in her leadership.  Could he tell us why he has such confidence in her leadership?

That is the question I was asked but we are now in detailed discussion about the meetings that took place and the actions that did or did not happen, as the case may be, in respect of the issues relating to Templemore.  I do not have all of that paperwork.  I will read the documentation from Mr. Barrett.  I do not think I said that the Commissioner acted with alacrity.  I did say that she accepted the findings of the report, put in place arrangements to ensure the recommendations were implemented and sent the report to the Committee of Public Accounts and the Comptroller and Auditor General because she is the Accounting Officer for the purposes of the Comptroller and Auditor General Acts.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Howlin mentioned a sub-committee and said that the question was asked regarding the purpose of the sub-committee.  Its purpose was to find out further information that the Commissioner required in order to satisfy herself that she was happy that the section 41 requirement would be completed and a response sent to the Minister.  These questions are being actively pursued by the Committee of Public Accounts.  I do not speak for the Commissioner here but all these events and issues took place long before she became Commissioner.  I read in some of the newspapers that her function when she was in Templemore was specialist training and that she did not deal with that side of the activities at the Garda College.  In respect of what Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin pointed out, I read about Mr. Barrett, that he received quite serious push-back in respect of the issues he was raising here and that he was counselled by people to be careful.  These are matters that need to be teased out at the Committee of Public Accounts, as I am sure they will be.  I have no doubt that the Commissioner will attend there and defend her position as Garda Commissioner and as the only Garda Commissioner who took action in this matter to see that it was sorted out.  Everybody knows that we have had a range of issues relating to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for six, eight or ten years and before.  Deputy Howlin was very forthright in making the point that we should have a totally independent police authority and repeated that on many occasions.  That has been a fundamental change in the way we look at all of this.  I hope that the commission looking at the structure with a root-and-branch focus on An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, its culture and competence and the way it is run will produce serious dividends for the community and the force itself in the time ahead.  What has happened in the past has not been to the benefit of the pride of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in many respects but yet there are so many garda&iacute; who do their job as one would expect - professionally and in the interests of the State and the uniform they wear.  I hope that 13 July will be the next opportunity for the Committee of Public Accounts to follow through on further details about the issues surrounding Templemore.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000022#U00600","speaker":"1245"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Topical Issue Matters","time":1494423600,"counter":261,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000022#U00700"},{"type":"speech","time":1494423600,"counter":262,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 29A and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputy James Browne - facilities for provision of mental health services in University Hospital Waterford; (2) Deputy Margaret Murphy O'Mahony - the deadline imposed on applications to the knowledge transfer group scheme; (3) Deputy Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n - the need for a rail service from Navan to Dublin; (4) Deputy David Cullinane - development on the north quays in Waterford; (5) Deputy Thomas P.

I want to see a public transport system that provides a viable and popular alternative to travel by car.  That is\u00a0an objective\u00a0upon which nearly all parties in the House agree.  We have been through a difficult period in recent years and investment levels in both infrastructure and services were reduced.  My\u00a0Department's strategic investment framework for land transport, published in 2015,\u00a0states that the top priority is to achieve\u00a0steady-state levels of investment.  However, the period of reductions in funding is behind us.<\/p>  <p>  Whether the Deputy wishes to acknowledge that or not, progress has been made in the past two years or so.  More money continues to be made available to support transport services and infrastructure.  That increased investment is bearing fruit, as can be seen from the increased passenger numbers across nearly all elements of our public transport system, including PSO bus, PSO rail, light rail and commercial bus services.  I want to make more progress.  For that reason, I will be seeking further increases in both the review of the capital plan and budget 2018 in order to build upon the progress made and provide for even more services and better infrastructure across the public transport system.<\/p><p>At a policy level, A Programme for a Partnership Government contains a commitment to reviewing public transport policy to ensure services are sustainable into the future and are meeting the needs of a modern economy and my Department is preparing to move forward with this commitment.<\/p> <p> The Deputy will also be aware that I recently announced my intention to establish a stakeholder dialogue on the issue of public transport.

The area of public transport is in deep crisis.  I asked this question because the Minister has refused to engage with the discourse around the future of public transport amidst the recent crisis in Bus &Eacute;ireann and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.  Industrial action at Dublin Bus, Bus &Eacute;ireann and the Luas should have been a wake-up call that the sector is in real trouble; that and the fact of workers willing to put their necks on the line for the sake of CIE and public transport.  It is fair to say that the current state of Bus &Eacute;ireann and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is alarming, but that is an understatement in itself.  Both companies have indicated that they are close to insolvency.<\/p>  <p>  I would like some clarity from the Minister about his intentions in this regard.  The Minister has said he does not intend to privatise Bus &Eacute;ireann.  Does this intention stretch as far as CIE companies?  How does that statement stand up to scrutiny when 10% of bus routes have already been put out to tender?  These are bus routes on Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann and we have no idea what the NTA intends to do in the next year or the year after.  Is it correct that the NTA can privatise as many routes as it wants?  I know the Minister will say that it is putting routes out to tender and that it is not privatisation, but it is privatisation.  Will the Minister give a commitment that no further routes will be put out to tender to protect our services? Will he also give clarity on the issue around the legislation that can be misinterpreted by the NTA with regard to having an obligation to outsource all the routes?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000024#W00200","speaker":"1333"},{"type":"speech","time":1494424800,"counter":279,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Munster.

The answer is the same as the one I have given to the Deputy and to others in the House many times and this remains the case.<\/p>  <p>  On the issue of public transport generally, it is not true just to come in with a broad sweep and be a foreteller of doom.  The situation has improved.  It had been on a terrible downward spiral for a very long time, but the Deputy will know that in recent years public service obligation, PSO, funding has increased in each of the last two budgets.  Budget 2016 provided for a 13% increase and budget 2017 provided for a further 11% increase.  In 2017, almost &euro;263 million has been made available to the NTA to support the PSO in bus and rail services.  Things were pretty bad but they are improving.

It could put all the routes out to tender or outsource them or whatever words the Minister wants to use other than privatisation, although it is still privatisation at the end of the day.

The airport is now the fifth most important European hub for connectivity to North America, ahead of such competing airports as Rome, Munich and Z&uuml;rich.<\/p>  <p>  New capacity at Dublin Airport is essential to meet growing demand and delivery of the runway is urgently required to minimise constraints on service expansion. The north runway project is a critical piece of airport infrastructure which will ensure Ireland's international connectivity into the future.  Moreover, despite the challenges presented by Brexit and the wider international geopolitical uncertainty, international aviation associations forecast demand for air travel to nearly double over the next two decades.  Ireland, as an island and a small, open economy, must be well placed to expand our connections with the rest of the world.  Failure to build the runway now would incur the loss of a major economic opportunity for Ireland to support trade, foreign direct investment and tourism.  Increased costs, more delays and more congestion at Dublin Airport would offer reduced service levels for the travelling public.<\/p>  <p>  Work on the project has commenced with the runway scheduled to be operational in 2020.  On 6 March, Fingal County Council approved an extension to the time limit of the planning permission in relation to the second parallel runway.

The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for local authorities.  Maintenance of laneways and roads not taken in charge by local authorities is the responsibility of the landowners concerned.  Due to the major cutbacks in roads funding, it was necessary for my Department to cease making separate allocations to local authorities in respect of the local improvement scheme, LIS.  The approved scheme remains intact and local authorities can use a proportion of State grant funding for LIS should they wish to do so.  While there is a modest increase in funding for roads this year, it will take some years yet under the capital plan to restore steady-state funding levels for regional and local roads.  The primary focus has to continue to be on the maintenance and renewal of public roads.  All grant funding in respect of regional and local roads for 2017 has been allocated.

He should not quote something to me that is not true.  It has not happened yet.  That is the Deputy's anticipation.  I hope he will not be disappointed.<\/p>  <p>  In order for Ireland to effectively and equitably contribute to the EU emissions reduction commitments in line with the Paris agreement and the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015, a low-carbon development strategy is being developed.  My Department is working closely with the Departments of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and Agriculture, Food and the Marine to prepare this national mitigation plan.  The responsibility for emissions reduction is collective and Ireland's emissions reduction targets are national rather than sectoral in nature.  Transport is one of four key sectors requiring development of sectoral plans, each forming a key component of the overall national plan.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland's first national mitigation plan will set out the challenges to meeting emissions reductions targets and chart a clear and quantified path towards Ireland's long-term objective of transition to a low-carbon and climate resilient economy by 2050.  Transport will, of course, have to play a significant role in the national mitigation effort.  Transport emissions are projected by the EPA to show growth over the period to 2020, with a 10% to 12% increase on 2015 levels.  This reflects forecast strong economic growth and growing transport demand.<\/p>  <p>  In 2015, transport accounted for 27% of Ireland's non-emissions trading scheme emissions.  By 2020, under the EPA projected scenario of 10,000 electric vehicles on the road and further development of the biofuel obligation scheme, transport will have increased its projected sectoral share of non-emissions trading scheme greenhouse gas emissions to 29%, rising further to 32% by 2030.<\/p>  <p>  A draft national mitigation plan, including transport proposals, was recently released as part of an extensive public consultation process.  I figure that this draft plan is what Deputy Ryan is referring to, and that is fair enough.  The public consultation has now come to a close and submissions are currently under review.  Alongside this, officials in my Department have been working with key stakeholders such as the Climate Change Advisory Council in developing the proposed final transport elements.  The measures under consideration for transport will be wide-ranging and will focus primarily on modal shift to public transport in urban areas, movement to alternatively-fuelled vehicles, and targeted behavioural change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000026#Y01200","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1494426000,"counter":313,"content":"<p>Is the Minister happy that the transport projected emissions are due to increased from 27% to 29%, then to 32% and to continue rising after that?

In the process, such measures should improve our economy and free us from the &euro;2 billion congestion costs that we face in this city alone because of the absolute inadequacy of our investment in public transport, including cycling and walking infrastructure.<\/p>  <p>  I was shocked when I looked at the draft plan because there is effectively next to nothing relating to cycling or other projects that could vastly improve capacity and help our cities to work.  No such projects are funded by the Department at present.  I was also shocked at a recent meeting of the Committee on Budgetary Oversight.  The commissioning authority for new infrastructure admitted that there is not a single rail-based public transport project ready to go to tender that would influence how our emissions develop in the coming five, ten, 20 or 30 years.<\/p><p>If the Minister states that I have got it wrong and am just reading the draft plan, I have to put a question back to him.

If the Minister wishes to extend his list, he should take 10% of his budget for transport next year and put it into such cycling and pedestrian measures.

Tourism Ireland has sought additional funding for the tourism marketing fund to address urgently the declining share of voice advertising awareness in key markets overseas; increase focus and investment in the short to medium term in mainland Europe and North America; defend Ireland's tourism position in the vital Great Britain market, dealing with the emerging threats and securing business while also maximising opportunities for the future; and accelerate investment in developing markets, building on the outcomes of the developing markets review recently completed-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000028#AA01000","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1494427200,"counter":339,"content":"<p>I must ask the Minister to stick to the time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000028#AA01100","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speech","time":1494427200,"counter":340,"content":"<p>-----for the medium to long term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000028#AA01200","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1494427200,"counter":341,"content":"<p>I ask Deputy Troy to be brief.

The Government's response to Brexit acknowledges that a number of key sectors will be impacted significantly, including tourism.  To mitigate these risks, the Government is taking a five-pronged approach, as part of which we will continue to manage our economy and the public finances prudently to enable us to meet future challenges; negotiate effectively as part of the EU 27 with the objective of reaching an agreement that sees the closest possible relationship between the EU and the UK while ensuring a strong and well-functioning EU; and continue supporting business and the economy through Government measures, programmes and strategies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000028#AA01500","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Projects Expenditure","time":1494427200,"counter":344,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000028#AA01600"},{"type":"question","time":1494427200,"counter":345,"qnumday":47,"qnumall":"[21960\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000028#AA01700","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the estimated cost of the proposed upgrade to the M11 as outlined in Transport Infrastructure Ireland's recently published M11-N11 corridor study; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1355","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1494427200,"counter":346,"content":"<p>I was a little disheartened to read the recent AECOM report which came out last month, carried out for Transport Infrastructure Ireland, on the M11-N11 corridor.

TII has considered various possible interventions to reduce congestion on the corridor and cater for continued growth in the Wicklow area.

The welcome increase in employment has impacted on transport, not only through the beginning of a recovery in public transport numbers, but also through increased car usage and the re-emergence of peak period congestion.<\/p>  <p>  In recognition of this growing body of evidence, my Department's economic and financial evaluation unit has undertaken a research project to estimate the cost of congestion in the greater Dublin area.  As Deputy Ryan noted, the analysis estimates that the cost of time lost due to congestion in the area is &euro;350 million per annum and is forecasted to rise to &euro;2 billion per annum in 2033.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has worked closely with the National Transport Authority, NTA, in recent months to develop an approach to tackling congestion in Dublin.  Major road development is not the solution to our congestion issue.  Our best option in the short-to-medium term is to focus on sustainable modes.  This means increasing public transport usage supplemented by cycling and walking for shorter trips.<\/p>  <p>  I am pleased to inform Members that the NTA will launch an important initiative at the end of May that will seek to transform the bus system in the Dublin region.  The core elements of the initiative lie in the transformation of the bus system, but other elements, such as new cycling infrastructure, will help to improve mobility.  I did not intend to give Deputy Eamon Ryan this information until he pressed me so hard earlier.<\/p>  <p>  The NTA will progress the early stages of the initiative through public consultation on bus network design, engagement with local authorities concerning bus corridors and a major public consultation on proposals for individual corridors.  The implementation of this significant initiative will serve to transition Dublin to a city with a modern, efficient and effective bus system that provides a world-class transport service.  This work has been an important consideration in formulating my overall approach to tackling congestion in the short-to-medium term and forms a key part of the case for a step change in public transport investment as part of the mid-term review of the Government's capital plan.<\/p>  <p>  In the time available, I will use the additional information that I have to elaborate further on the initiative.  The proposal's aim is to overhaul the entire Dublin bus system and entails a suite of measures to transform the network of bus corridors with segregated cycling, a simpler fare structure, new bus branding, three bus rapid transit routes, a cashless payment system, new bus stops and shelters, a complete redesign of the bus network, a state-of-the-art ticketing system and the use of low-emission vehicles.  The next step is the launch of the programme by the end of May, with public consultation on the bus network redesign to begin in early June, a subsequent engagement with local authorities and strategic transport committee chairpersons to agree an approach to consultation on individual bus corridors and a major public consultation later this year giving details of the proposals on the individual corridors, including the bus rapid transit routes.  Key outcomes noted will be a transformation of the Dublin bus system, a fast and reliable bus service, journey times on many routes reducing by a third or more thanks to continued bus lanes, connecting more people to more places, a programme that delivers across the region, safe and largely segregated cycling facilities and providing Dublin with a world-class bus transport service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000030#CC01200","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1494428400,"counter":377,"content":"<p>That initiative will be welcome.

For this to be real, there has to be a budget allocation in 2018.  This has to be agreed over the summer as part of the budget process and it has to be substantial.<\/p> <p> I mentioned earlier the projects that are ready to go, such as the Liffey cycle route, the Sutton-to-Sandycove bike route, the Dodder greenway, the Tolka greenway and the Santry greenway.  These would all have a major effect in terms of making the city work, in addition to the bus measures the Minister mentioned.  However, when we talk to local authority officials to see if these projects can be advanced, they say they do not have a single penny to do it.  If this is to be real on both the bus and cycling front, yes, let us consult, but we have been doing that for 20 years.  More than anything else, the Minister's seriousness or otherwise will depend on whether the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform allocates him the funding and whether he allocates within his own budget the funding for 2018 to make this real.

For those who say we have no vision and no plans, here is a concrete and very constructive plan for relieving congestion in the Dublin region, which we in government acknowledge is a very serious problem.  That is why the NTA has already made several presentations on this matter.  My officials have seen the plans and they welcome them and believe they will make real progress in relieving congestion in the city, in moving people to efficient bus services and bus corridors, in improving cycling facilities and in being part of what has been the Government's policy and vision for a very long time.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy said, the proof of the pudding will be in the eating but the first step is now.

If the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Government are serious, let us do the consultation at the same time that we are doing the budget process - I am on the budgetary oversight committee, so I have oversight of this.  There needs to be a radical and fundamental shift in the Department's budget allocation for 2018, and not any further into the future, because that is when we need to start making amends.

Let us look at it with a very objective view.  People talk about a lack of vision and have been critical about that, perhaps rightly so.  However, this is part of a vision which I think we all share, which is to get people out of their cars and into buses, to get bus corridors working, to consequently reduce emissions and to resolve traffic congestion.  That is what we are looking to do and, while this is only part of it, buses will be a major aspect.

I am, however, informed by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann that the company has instituted some remote monitoring from Howth Junction covering all stations along the DART and commuter network.

One hundred years later, C&oacute;ras Iompair &Eacute;ireann closed and lifted the line.  There is only one functioning line into the middle of the county, that is, the Drogheda to Tara Mines line.  Tara Mines is one of the few freight lines operating in the country at present and it takes approximately 40 HGVs off the road every day.  The NTA has refused to transform that freight line back into a passenger line stating that due to the journey time from Navan to Dublin via Drogheda, it would not be used, but when one considers the figures I will cite later on, that is debatable.<\/p>  <p>  In 1946, the rail line functioned into County Meath while the population was only 60,000.  Now the population of County Meath is 200,000.  As a Dublin man, the Minister will be happy to hear that there will be 250,000 of us Meath people living in the country very shortly.<\/p>  <p>  Each morning, more Meath people leave the county to go to work than work in the county.  That is the only county in the country where that happens.  We have the notoriety of having the highest rate of commuting in the country.  Yet Navan is the largest town in the country without a rail line.  That has a massive cost on society.  It is a major cost on business, it is a major cost on enterprise and it also involves a major cost on families.<\/p>  <p>  For the average family who are commuting from Navan currently, the commute at rush hour takes roughly three hours a day.  If one takes that back and forth, it is roughly the equivalent to 90 days unpaid work for everybody who is commuting from Navan currently.  If one lives in places such as Oldcastle, Athboy or Trim, that daily commute often increases to four hours a day in rush hour - two hours in the morning and two hours back to those places - which is the equivalent of 120 days unpaid work on an annual basis.  There is certainly a major cost on business, but the Minister can imagine a mother or father undertaking 720 hours commuting on an annual basis from these towns and how their family life is negatively affected as a result.<\/p>  <p>  There are also major costs to the families themselves.  If one lives in Kells and works in south Dublin, one will pay two tolls a day.  This involves a cost of &euro;2,350 a year on tolls for anybody in Kells or Oldcastle working in south Dublin.  The average cost of running a car is &euro;4,500 on an annual basis.  Private transportation is a significant cost to individuals.<\/p>  <p>  There are also massive environmental costs.  This has been brought to the fore today, which is a good development.  Ireland faces approximately &euro;600 million worth of fines by 2020 if we do not meet our climate change targets.  By 2030, we could face &euro;5.5 billion worth of fines in this country if we do not meet our climate change obligations.  There is a trend within transportation, of which the Minister is in charge, of an increase of between 10% and 16% in the level of CO2 being emitted before 2020.  We are going completely in the wrong direction with regards CO2 emissions in transportation at present.  That is not only about polar bears.  We are talking about an increase in temperature of between 2.6&deg; to 4.8&deg; Celsius, which will lead to untold environmental damage and deaths.<\/p>  <p>  Industry, business, family, safety, environment and health are being radically damaged at present due to the lack of provision of projects such as the Navan-to-Dublin rail line.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000032#EE01000","speaker":"1235"},{"type":"speech","time":1494429600,"counter":401,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue in the House today.<\/p>  <p>  As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I have responsibility for policy and overall funding of public transport.  The National Transport Authority has responsibility for the development of public transport infrastructure in the greater Dublin area, which includes County Meath, and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is responsible for the maintenance and operation of the heavy rail network.<\/p>  <p>  The Navan rail link project was included under the Transport 21 initiative and was to be developed in two phases: Phase 1 comprised the Dunboyne rail line project.  This involved the reopening of 7.5 km of a railway line running off the Maynooth line, at Clonsilla, to the M3 interchange near Dunboyne.  This line opened in September 2010 with park-and-ride facilities with 1,200 car parking spaces available and at Dunboyne with 300 car parking spaces available.  Phase 1 was completed in 2013 with the opening of Hansfield Station.  The plan for phase 2 involved the extension of the Dunboyne line between Clonsilla and M3 Parkway station, onwards to north Navan.  This development, together with a number of other transport projects, was postponed in 2011 due to the economic and fiscal crisis.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that the NTA, which has statutory responsibility for development of public transport in the greater Dublin area, GDA, included an examination of the Navan to city centre rail corridor in the preparation of its transport strategy for the GDA for the period 2016-2035.  The NTA concluded that, based on current population and employment forecasts, the level of travel demand between Navan, Dunshaughlin and various stations to the city centre is insufficient to justify the development of a high-capacity rail link at this time.  Instead, the authority proposes to develop an enhanced bus service along the route and to develop a bus hub in Navan.  This position will be kept under review taking account of future developments in the catchment area and the NTA recommends that the corridor identified for a rail link to Navan should be protected from development intrusion.<\/p><p>Exchequer funding for public transport projects is set out in the Government's capital plan.  The transport element of the plan covers the period up to 2022.  I have previously outlined that my Department's first priority under the capital plan is to ensure the maintenance of our existing transport infrastructure at steady-state levels in order that it remains safe and fit for purpose.  Based on the funding allocations for public transport under the capital plan, we should achieve steady-state levels by 2020.  In view of the current constraints on availability of funding, the priority for the heavy rail network under the plan is to improve efficiency and maintain safety standards rather than expanding the network by opening new lines or stations.  A mid-term review of the capital plan is under way and I will seek to improve the funding available for public transport in that context.<\/p> <p> If additional funds were to be made available, there would be many competing demands within the public transport sector.  All projects would be subject to robust analysis and would require strong business cases to justify their value and demonstrate how they would significantly improve the public transport system.  The House will be aware that the role of heavy rail in Ireland's transport sector is under review.  A public consultation process on the rail review document prepared jointly by the National Transport Authority, NTA, and larnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann concluded on 18 January.  The NTA is preparing a report about the process which I intend to bring to Government in due course.  The public consultation process gave the public and all interested parties the opportunity to give their views and contribute to the debate on the future of heavy rail in Ireland.  No decisions on any changes to the rail network will be made until the outcome of the public consultation process has been evaluated and the NTA's report considered.

I welcome robust analysis.  No project should ever happen in the Department without robust analysis, but how is this for robust analysis?  Meath has roughly the same population as Kildare, a higher population than Wicklow and a higher population than Louth, yet both of those counties are well served by regular rail services into Dublin.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister said he is responsible for policy and that the NTA and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann are responsible for transport and heavy rail lines, but he is responsible for those two organisations as well.  It is not the case that he shares the Department with them.  He is in charge of all those organisations.  The NTA said the people of Meath should have buses, but the fact is there is no continuous bus route from the centre of County Meath into Dublin.  The bus lanes have massive pinch points along the way and traffic regularly gets snarled up.<\/p>  <p>  Not only is Navan the largest town in the country not to have a rail line but the bus service is the most expensive one in the country.  The cost works out at 26 cent per kilometre compared with the Dublin to Drogheda route which costs 16 cent per kilometre.  We are not talking about a massive distance.  We are only talking about 30 km on an alignment that already exists.<\/p>  <p>  There are two variables that will determine whether this project goes ahead.  The first is population.  As we discussed, Meath has roughly the same population as comparable counties.  The second variable is political will.

However, the Deputy makes a good case and provided he makes a good commercial case, the project will not be ruled out.<\/p>  <p>  As I pointed out in my initial contribution, \"This position will be kept under review taking account of future developments in the catchment area and the NTA recommends that the corridor identified for a rail link to Navan should be protected from development intrusion.\"  That should be taken by the Deputy as encouragement at a time when new railways are not being built, for good reasons, namely, because of the financial constraints upon us.  It is fully explained that the existing transport infrastructure is being kept \"at steady-state levels\" for the moment, and that is the absolute imperative for us.  It is all very well to say we are undercapitalised and we have the lowest capital investment of any country in Europe, but at the moment we do not have any capital.  That is the reason.  We do not have capital for such projects, but when the mid-term capital review is completed and when more capital is available, which will be 2019 to 2020, I would have thought the project in question would be one of the first to be considered.  As Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n so helpfully said, I am sure I will not be in office at that time, but someone else will and it is a project that would be looked at seriously.  The fact the NTA has said not to build or develop on that line indicates to me that it is one of the projects being considered for the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000033#FF00300","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Projects","time":1494430200,"counter":405,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000033#FF00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1494430200,"counter":406,"content":"<p>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this very important issue for discussion in the Topical Issue debate.  The upgrade of the N4 bypass to Roosky is very important to the Longford-Westmeath constituency.  The road is currently operating at 120% above capacity, which is a significant problem for infrastructure in the area.  It gives rise to a major safety issue in terms of traffic travelling on the road and there have been a significant number of accidents in the area.  I recently met the chief executive and the executive team of Longford County Council.  They made very clear to me that when the IDA is selling Longford abroad, it is very difficult because one of the main IDA sites in Longford, the Abbott site, is almost sterilised because of the corridor that is this road.  In other words, the compulsory purchase order, CPO, process has not yet been approved, and because of that, there is no certainty.  We need to provide clarity on the issue as soon as possible because to get it to the CPO process would not take much funding.  In capital terms it is approximately &euro;5 million.  In the context of the mid-term review of the capital budget and in terms of the major projects in the country, it is amazing that the only significant piece of motorway north of a line east to west from Drogheda is the M1.  We really need to invest in the bypass.<\/p>  <p>  My Fine Gael council colleagues in Longford are in touch with me day and night about the issue because they see how important it is to attract investment to Longford and to ensure the county gets its fair share.  When Dr. Brian McCann appeared before the Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport recently, he spoke about the national planning framework and said it is a key piece of infrastructure which we need to get across the line urgently to develop the north west as a region.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note we need accessibility in the midlands.  We need to ensure it is conducive to people going there and doing business.  The N4-N5 is a key artery which has been mentioned recently in terms of the mid-term capital review and the bypass is a key component of that.  I have been advocating the project to the office of the Minister, Deputy Ross, through parliamentary questions.  I have also been in touch with the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan.  I am trying to make the case for this very important issue and to get funding for it in the capital plan.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Griffin is chairperson of the Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport.  A number of chambers of commerce came together to present to the committee on the importance of this piece of infrastructure to the midlands as a region.  Anyone can tell the Minister connectivity is very important in modern Ireland.  It is very important that people can get to towns quickly to do business and that they are not subjected to the current infrastructure.<\/p>  <p>  The country is on course to break even in 2018.  More money is becoming available.  That means more tough decisions have to be taken because there are many competing projects, but drawing a line east to west from Drogheda, there is no project with as strong a case as this upgrade.  It is a key piece of infrastructure in terms of the national planning framework to 2040 that would open up the north west.  People are crying out for this vital piece of infrastructure.<\/p><p>If Sligo is to obtain city status in future, this is a key avenue for that to happen.  I appeal to the Minister to give this matter strong consideration.  I am hopeful that we can deliver it and get it to the CPO process, thus giving certainty to Longford, Westmeath and other counties in terms of the planning process.  After that, we will hopefully get the full operation to motorway status.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000033#FF00500","speaker":"1369","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1494430800,"counter":408,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Burke for raising this important issue.

Within its annual budget the planning, design and implementation of individual road projects, such as the N4, is a matter for Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TIl, under the Roads Acts 1993-2015 in conjunction with the local authorities concerned. <\/p><p>Ireland has just under 100,000 kilometres of road in its network and the maintenance and improvement of national, regional and local roads places a substantial financial burden on local authorities and on the Exchequer.

The Government&rsquo;s Capital Investment Plan entitled <i>Building on Recovery - Infrastructure and Capital Investment<\/i>, provides the strategic and financial framework for TII's national roads programme for the period from 2016 to 2022.  As Minister, I have to work within the capital budgets included in the plan and TII in turn has to prioritise works on the basis of the funding available to it.<\/p><p>Decisions on the transport elements of the capital plan 2016-2021 were framed by the conclusions reached in my Department&rsquo;s Strategic Investment Framework for Land Transport.  Based on the findings in that report it is envisaged that maintenance and renewal of the road network will continue to be the main priority over the next period and the bulk of the roads capital budget, approximately &euro;4.4 billion, is earmarked for such essential work, with a further &euro;600 million allocated for implementation of the PPP road programme which is already underway.<\/p><p>The transport element of the capital plan, <i>Building on Recovery<\/i>, makes provision for a limited number of development projects which are targeted at removing critical bottlenecks or upgrading inadequate sections of road, including the N4 Collooney to Castlebaldwin upgrade scheme.  It was not, however, possible to include a range of projects, including the N4 Mullingar to Longford section which incorporates Roosky.<\/p><p>As regards the N4 Collooney to Castlebaldwin project, I understand that land acquisition and advance works for that project are underway and Tll has provided an allocation of &euro;7.5 million to Sligo County Council this year to advance the process.  As regards the possibility of additional funding within the plan period for national road projects, the capital plan review process is underway and my Department is making a strong case for extra funding to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, including the development of a project pipeline for national road schemes.<\/p><p>The final decisions on allocations are, however, matters for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Government as a whole.

It is also important to give certainty to those who have land along the route, as well as State investments such as IDA parks.

Operating roads at 120% capacity is unsafe, so we need finance to improve that.<\/p>  <p>  If the Longford to Roosky N4 bypass could be included in the capital infrastructure plan it would provide a significant boost for the midlands.  We have learned from past mistakes in terms of how much investment went into the greater Dublin area where the economy took off.

We must therefore invest in infrastructural projects in order to achieve that.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the Minister for attending the House to deal with this Topical Issue.

I will advise Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, of this particular project which the Deputy has raised and will ask them to consider it as one of the areas to be targeted for safety.  The TII has been relieved of VAT on some of the money it collects in tolls, so that will now be targeted for road safety projects.  The TII has identified four such projects for this year and several for 2018.  While it is not certain, more funds might become available for the TII from a decision of the European Court on VAT.  I hope the TII will use those savings to remedy accident black spots, including the Longford to Roosky N4 bypass project referred to by Deputy Burke.

As he knows, substantial tracts of land have been destroyed by fire in County Sligo recently.  I am sure that Deputy Connolly will outline what is happening in County Galway.  Given the weather in recent weeks, some 4,000 acres in Sligo have been destroyed around Killery Mountain.  I appreciate that the Government may well be considering some compensatory package to deal with the damage caused and the loss of income for local communities.  One specific case in Sligo concerns the destruction of about 500 metres of the Sligo Way, which is a substantial 34 km walk from Dromahair in County Leitrim to Coolaney in County Sligo.<\/p>  <p>  The Sligo Camino is a significant walking event which takes place in July every year with substantial numbers of people already booked to participate.

As I stand here raising this matter the fire service, the Army, the Air Corps, Coillte staff and local people are out on the ground trying to bring a raging forest fire under control.  Already, more than 1,500 ha of forestry and 2,000 ha of bogland have been destroyed.  I understand from the local media that is an area five times the size of the Phoenix Park.

This fire is in the Cloosh Valley which is the biggest forest in Ireland as I understand it, covering more than 4,000 ha.  That means that, already, 25% of the forest has been destroyed.  These figures are difficult even for me to comprehend, but are even more difficult for the people on the ground where the fire is raging as we speak.  I was on the Aran Islands on Monday with the Joint Committee on the Irish Language, the Gaeltacht and the Islands, and we could see the smoke from there.  I have a number of questions to which I will return after the Minister of State's response, but the first is how could this have happened?  What fire assessment was carried out?  What risk assessment was done?  The biggest wind farm in Ireland is right in the middle of the forest.  How was it allowed to go in there?  When it was allowed to go in there, what assessments were carried out?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000035#HH00200","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speech","time":1494431400,"counter":415,"content":"<p>I thank Deputies MacSharry and Connolly for raising these matters.  Forest fires have a significant impact, as we are witnessing.  Deputy Connolly has set out the scene that is taking place at Cloosh Valley in Galway, a place I know well as I am from Galway myself.<\/p>  <p>  Responding to these fires and to public safety is key at this time.  Forest fires can destroy habitats, wildlife, farm land and farm structures and can threaten homes and lives.  They bear a huge cost not just to physical property, but also the cost of disruption to normal emergency services operations.  On behalf of the Government, I acknowledge and pay tribute to the tremendous work of the emergency services and the co-operation of other State agencies, including the Army, the Air Corps and Coillte in keeping these fires under control and attempting to extinguish them.  I take this opportunity to remind and urge the public to follow the advice of the emergency services and to stay away from any areas affected by the fires.  Any uncontrolled or unattended fires should be reported to emergency services.<\/p>  <p>  I understand the Sligo Camino follows the Sligo Way through some of the finest scenery in the west of Ireland.  The route is a challenging mixture of tracks, trails and forest paths.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has today informed my office that the part of the boardwalk on the Sligo Camino that was damaged by the gorse fires is not on Coillte land and is not afforested.  I am advised that the boardwalk damage is located on privately owned commonage, which was developed jointly by Sligo County Council and the Sligo Leader programme.<\/p>  <p>  In respect of my own office, under the minor flood mitigation works and coastal protection scheme, referred to by Deputy MacSharry, the Office of Public Works provides funding to local authorities to undertake minor flood mitigation measures costing less than &euro;500,000 each to address local flooding and coastal protection problems within their administrative areas.  Funding of up to 90% of the cost is available for approved projects with the balance being funded by the local authority concerned.  Local authorities submit funding applications in the prescribed format, which are then assessed by the OPW having regard to the specific technical, economic, social and environmental criteria of the scheme, including a cost benefit assessment.  With regard to the latter, proposals must meet a minimum benefit to cost ratio of 1.5:1 in order to qualify.  The scheme operates to fund works to mitigate flood risk.  Repairs to forest trails destroyed by forest fires do not quality under this scheme.<\/p>  <p>  While today we are seeing the Government's proactive response to forest fires when they occur, the Government is also very active in its management of the risk of fires, including through issuing fire danger notices.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has issued a number of fire danger notices to the forestry sector since the beginning of March, including elevating the risk to red on 2 May in advance of the recent spate of fires.  These fires are monitored through a combination of EU Copernicus and US NASA data streams which have detected over 50 illegal fire locations using satellite data up to 21 April of this year.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has also legislated to prohibit burning on land that is not cultivated.  It is an offence under section 40 of the Wildlife Act 1976, as amended by section 46 of the Wildlife Act 2000, for landowners or the public to burn any vegetation growing on any land not then cultivated from 1 March to 31 August in any year.  Individuals who are found to burn vegetation within that prohibited period are liable to prosecution by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or by the National Parks and Wildlife Service.<\/p>  <p>  I assure the Deputies that the Government will continue to work closely with the emergency services, local authorities, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the National Parks and Wildlife Service, as well as with farm organisations and the forestry industry to try to address the problem of uncontrolled fires and will act on any incidents cross-reported to it, as appropriate.<\/p>  <p>  I urge all forest owners, farmers, rural dwellers and other countryside users to be vigilant to the threat of fire, to report any suspicious activity to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and to report any uncontrolled or unattended fires immediately to the fire and emergency services via the 112 or 999 service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000035#HH00300","speaker":"1260"},{"type":"speech","time":1494431400,"counter":416,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

As he might know, 1,500 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails are on hunger strike.  The strike is in its 23rd day and has been named \"Freedom and Dignity\".  The prisoners are only accepting water and salt to sustain themselves.  The reason why the prisoners are on strike is the continuing brutalisation of Palestinian prisoners in Israel.  I include 300 children who are not on hunger strike but who are in the prison population.  I will read out the demands of the hunger strikers because they are crucial in terms of why the prisoners are on hunger strike.  They include an end to the denial of family visits, the right to pursue higher education while in prison, appropriate medical care and treatment and an end to solitary confinement and detention and imprisonment without charge or trial.  The prisoners are subjected to solitary confinement, torture, medical negligence, abuse, withdrawal of phone calls to their family members and violations of their basic human rights.<\/p>  <p>  Over the past 23 days, some of the prisoners have been moved to other jails by the Israeli authorities, which is highly suspect.  The Israeli Government has even stated that it is willing to force feed some of the prisoners, which I find unbelievable.  I thought this was probably an exaggerated statement but apparently it happened in the 1980s with other Palestinian prisoners on hunger strike in Israeli jails.  One of the prisoners' leaders, Marwan Barghouti, has been in solitary confinement for the past 23 days, which is quite outrageous.  The Israeli Government has refused to negotiate with the prisoners on their demands and refers to the prisoners are terrorists.  I would refer to them as political prisoners.<\/p>  <p>  There is growing international solidarity with and support for the prisoners.  In general, Ireland has a very good record of showing support for Palestinian rights and statehood.  We had a similar situation in the early 1980s with hunger strikers in Northern Ireland so we know what people have to do to demand their rights and the extremes to which they will go to highlight their issue.

This has included contacts both here in Ireland and in Israel as well as in our discussions at EU and UN level.  Our concerns have related to both the incidence and the conditions of detention.  This has included the increased use of administrative detention without trial and our concern that detention is in some cases being used to try to deter activists from engaging in peaceful and legitimate protests against the occupation and related policies.  Of course, we must also acknowledge that many Palestinian prisoners, including some now on hunger strike, have been convicted of very serious offences, including involvement in violent attacks.<\/p>  <p>  Issues raised under conditions of detention have included physical conditions, medical issues, legal processes and family visits.  It is only fair to recognise that we could express similar or stronger concerns about prisoners in many other jurisdictions in the region as well as in Israel.  Within those representations we have made to Israel, there has been a particular focus on detention of children and Ireland raised this question in our intervention at the universal periodic review of Israel at the UN Human Rights Council in 2013.

We are all aware here, of course, of the danger of a hunger strike leading to increased tensions and clashes on the streets as we have seen in the past.  For these reasons, I will not comment on the specific issues which the strikers have raised.  However, I would reiterate our essential position, which should be an obvious one, namely, that detained Palestinians should have the same protections and conditions that Israel affords its own citizens when detained.  I would also stress that since Palestinian prisoners should under international law be held within their own territory, when Palestinians are being held in Israel, special attention must be given to ensuring that family visits are realistically facilitated.<\/p>  <p>  My Department raised this issue with the Israeli ambassador on 9 May.  We also raised it yesterday with the Israeli mission to the EU in Brussels.  The EU missions in Palestine, including Ireland's mission, issued a public statement on Saturday concerning the hunger strikes and issues related to conditions of detention and calling on Israel to respect fully the rights of prisoners.  I am aware that previous hunger strikes have been resolved allowing a tragic outcome to be avoided.  I very much hope that this will also be the case on this occasion.  More generally, issues regarding prisoners will continue to be followed closely by my Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000036#JJ00400","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1494432000,"counter":425,"content":"<p>The Minister should take sides because these are not ordinary prisoners.  Most of them have been incarcerated against their will.  As the Minister stated, 300 children, who are not part of the hunger strike, are in Israeli prisons.  Palestinian prisoners are subjected to the most inhumane treatment Israel can mete out.  If it mirrors what Israel does on larger scale - how it treats Palestinians in the West Bank, Gaza and Israel - it is a terrible reflection on the state of Israel.  It is important for the Minister to contact the Israeli ambassador and state that he is extremely worried about the ongoing issue of political prisoners in Israel.  It is very important that he relays that message.  Only recently, it was reported in the news that Ireland bought military drones from the Israeli military.  I find it extraordinary that the Irish Government buys military hardware from a country with an appalling human rights record - a horrendous, obnoxious, racist state such as Israel.<\/p><p>The Minister says he is not going to take sides.  That is the problem.  He needs to take a side.  He needs to see that an oppressor is oppressing the Palestinian people.  These men are on hunger strike to highlight that they are being brutalised in Israeli jails.  I would do the same as them.  Out of solidarity not only with Palestinian prisoners but also the Palestinian people, we should tell the Israeli ambassador that this situation needs to be dealt with before people die.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000036#JJ00500","speaker":"1299","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1494432600,"counter":427,"content":"<p>I will not comment on specific issues which have been raised by the strikers as I do not regard it as appropriate.

that the population in the Greater Dublin Area is expected to grow by 22 per cent to 1.8 million by 2030 and by 26 per cent to 700,000 in the Mid-East Region alone including Kildare, Meath and Wicklow and increasing investment in rail services including the Dublin Area Rapid Transport (DART) expansion, as well as vital bus services including Bus Rapid Transit, is absolutely essential;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; that this Government lacks a comprehensive vision and strategic plan for how to cope with future public transport demand in the core Dublin City Area as well as the Greater Dublin Area; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash;

the lack of preparation and forward planning for the impact of the Luas Cross City, including the impact of its construction on city trade and mobility;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the urgent need to increase the numbers and frequency of buses, either public or private, from expanding suburban areas in order to tackle capacity issues, relieve traffic congestion and provide practical choices for commuters;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; that while expanding capacity on our motorway and primary road network is something we need to plan for in the future, recognises that traffic demand policies are essential to relieving congestion as will sustained increases in public transport investment;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; that transport bottlenecks and congestion are increasingly becoming a drag on growth and productivity in our cities as well as hindering wider regional development in large parts of the country;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; that despite the historically low cost of financing to deliver economically and socially critical infrastructure projects, this Government has produced no policy plans for how to mitigate transport infrastructure deficits;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; that now is the time to:<blockquote>&mdash; build critical transport infrastructure like the DART Underground and Metro North;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; make vital improvements such as bus lane completions and removing 'pinch points' for Dublin buses;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; ensure priority signalling at junctions;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; continue to invest in real time passenger information, which will increase capacity and service reliability on public transport, make it easier for commuters to get to work and relieve congestion in our cities; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; develop park and ride infrastructure in order to facilitate ease of use of various public transport modes;<\/blockquote>&mdash; that the Government has completely failed to mobilise additional investment in transport infrastructure available under the European Fund for Strategic Investment (EFSI), and of the EFSI transactions within the European Union, 6 per cent are in the transport sector, yet in Ireland there has not been a single transport project put forward by the Government to the European Investment Bank (EIB) under the &euro;500 billion funding stream; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; that the decision to cancel the DART Underground project, described by the National Transport Authority as 'the missing link' in Ireland&rsquo;s rail infrastructure, was short-sighted and a costly set-back for the liveability of the city, while the only large transport infrastructure contained in the Government&rsquo;s Capital Plan, 'the optimised Metro North' proposal, could be fundamentally lacking capacity as it was recommended on the basis of reduced employment growth and passenger demand projections in 2013, which are no longer accurate; and calls on the Government to:&mdash; commit to giving enhanced governance, democratic input and administration of transport in Dublin by enacting section 17 of the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008 which provides for the establishment of the Dublin Transport Authority Advisory Council;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; give a firm commitment to significantly increase annual investment in public transport, including funding to C&oacute;ras Iompair &Eacute;ireann (CI&Eacute;) companies to improve attractiveness, reliability and integration of public transport;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; establish a new, dedicated Cycle Way Fund for bike-lanes and cycle-friendly infrastructure, Dublin Bike extensions, the rolling out of secure bike lockers and parking throughout the city as well as funding for pedestrianised 'open streets' initiatives to encourage cycling;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; earmark a portion of the Local Government Fund to annual resurfacing, maintenance and quality improvements in bike lanes and road verges to enhance safety for cyclists;<br \/><br \/>and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; commit, as part of revisions to the Capital Plan, to bolster capital investment levels by securing funding agreements from the EIB and further Public Private Partnerships under the EFSI for critical transport investments like the DART Underground and Metro North.<\/blockquote><p>The context for this motion could not be simpler.  Dublin is growing and is going to grow even more in the next 30 years.  The greater Dublin area, taking in the commuter counties, is growing exponentially also.  Some 70% of workers in Wicklow travel to Dublin for their work and in Kildare the figure is 40%.  Dublin is growing and it is leading to traffic congestion that is only going to get worse.<\/p><p>The effect of this chronic congestion affects everything from competitiveness to quality of life to carbon emissions.  People are trying to get their kids to school, trying to get to work, trying to deliver goods and trying to get to college, and the traffic congestion is clogging up and impeding public transport.  As a consequence, economic growth in the greater Dublin area is being held back.<\/p><p>This motion is not just about the capital city.  Dublin is the gateway to the rest of the country.  When Dublin gets congested, it delays inward traffic and outward traffic, delaying goods, people, commerce and tourism to the rest of the country.<\/p><p>The major infrastructural projects that were intended to solve the growing traffic problems have not only been paused or cancelled in some cases, but we can reasonably say that a child born in Dublin today will not ride a metro to the airport or travel DART underground until they are about to enter post-primary school.<\/p><p>The previous Government cancelled the DART underground project, the missing link as the National Transport Authority, NTA, called it, and then sold off a critical piece of the land associated with delivering the project.  The DART underground would link Heuston Station, Connolly Station and the Docklands station.  It would open a gateway to the rest of Ireland from Dublin and a gateway to Dublin from the rest of Ireland.  Work on metro north and the DART underground will not commence - if it ever does commence - until the middle of the 2020s.<\/p><p>I acknowledge that the Luas cross city is going provide significant additional capacity for commuters.  I warmly and enthusiastically welcome it connecting and expanding the existing green and red Luas lines.  The impact of Luas cross city on other users of road space in Dublin remains to be seen.  In the meantime, we are told by successive Governments that public transport is the way forward.  For Dubliners this means buses, according to the Minister.  Recently, the NTA has added walking and cycling to this, which is fine and welcome.  Along with my colleagues I want to see public transport and other non-private car travel becoming the primary mode by which commuters travel to our city.<\/p><p>The problem is that the Minister has added only 20 buses to the bus fleet serving Dublin in 2017.  In the absence of the major infrastructure, which will take years to deliver, the public will have the choice of using buses or private cars, walking or cycling.  I acknowledge that Dublin Bus has made huge strides in recent times.  I also applaud the NTA and the local authorities for the work done on the provision of quality bus corridors.  In spite of the huge progress made over the years in the Dublin Bus service, there are still inconsistencies and large inadequacies in the service in particular areas.<\/p><p>Older people feel that the service neglects them at off-peak times.  Digital display timetables often change within seconds leaving passengers stranded.  A constituent from a part of my constituency that was once the Minister's constituency emails me regularly in exasperation at full buses passing her by or simply not turning up at the timetabled time.  She emailed me last night asking me to include the following words in my contribution: &quot;the urgent need to increase the numbers and frequency of buses, either public or private, from expanding urban areas in order to tackle capacity issues, relieve traffic congestion and provide practical choices for commuters&quot;.  Ballycullen in my constituency is one such expanding area and Dublin Bus cannot expand the number 15 service to the area because the company does not have the money.  In parts of Tallaght the low frequency of buses from 6.30 a.m. to 8 a.m. creates journey times of up to 90 minutes to the city.<\/p><p>The Minister has an awful lot of work to do to convince the public that buses are going to transport them on time every day from where they live to where they work.  This is why there must be a democratic input into the decisions that are going to be made.  The Minister is expecting people to choose public transport, cycling and walking over the private car in the absence of the infrastructure that was committed to by the previous Fine Gael-led government, in the absence of additional buses and additional routes, in the absence of radical changes that facilitate bus priority on major arteries into and out of the city, in the absence of real safety for cyclists on the main routes into the city, never mind safe places for them to store their bikes, and with only a few joined-up cycle links.<\/p><p>The Minister has stood by while the development of greenways into the city have been postponed.  He has shown no ambition for the city bikes scheme, which is now an essential component of public transport, although there has been a huge appetite for years for this scheme in the suburbs of Dublin.  How can the Minister expect private car drivers to abandon their cars in the absence of any strategy or investment in these key areas?<\/p> <p> The Minister could be investing in the bus fleet, in opening up more routes to tender, and designing regional and localised park and ride facilities for buses.  Localised park and ride facilities are going to have to become reality in order to make travel by bus a real option for people who live just that bit too far away from the nearest bus stop or who, worse still, have no regular and efficient bus service.  Ten years ago, a Government thought it was prudent to include the provision of a Dublin transport advisory council in legislation establishing the Dublin Transport Authority.  Its membership was to include transport experts, the CEOs of the four Dublin local authorities, a senior garda, members of the public and stakeholders such as those with disabilities.  Its chair was to be a person with expertise in transport administration, so that it could advise and respond to NTA proposals.  Quango it was not.  If the Minister is proposing that public transport is the way forward &ndash; despite having paused Metro north and probably cancelled the DART underground &ndash; then the public, business and every other stakeholder has a right to a say about their bus service and how it can be improved, about what type of cycle ways they want and input into where they ought to be.<\/p> <p> The Minister made a name for himself in the Seanad and in the D&aacute;il, representing a good chunk of what is my constituency, as being a champion of the underdog, the shareholder and the toll payer.  He possessed a bold, swashbuckling style.  As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, however, he has seemed uninterested, lacking in motivation and desire to make a difference and certainly lacking in any vision, passion or dynamism to create solutions to the problems that face us.  During Question Time today, the Minister said we do not have the capital.  He needs to fight for capital.  He needs to fight as hard for funding for the big projects this city needs as he is fighting for Stepaside Garda station.  Others have identified that this funding is undoubtedly out there.  The Minister needs to articulate a vision for the future of transport in Dublin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000038#OO00400","speaker":"1311","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1494433500,"counter":436,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputies Jack Chambers and Darragh O'Brien.  I have brought the increased traffic congestion we are facing daily to the Minister's attention by means of Topical Issue debates and numerous parliamentary questions.  This issue is particularly urgent in the western part of Dublin.  It does not just affect economic development and activity; it also impacts on our future housing needs.  We have a strategic development zone that is half built at Adamstown, and a second one in planning at Clonburris.  Transport infrastructure is delivered not only to ease the congestion of today but to provide the growth we need for the coming years.  The Minister is well aware that a very significant rate of increase is predicted for the population of the greater Dublin area over the next couple of decades.  We must plan, forecast and build our infrastructure to deal with that longer term issue.<\/p>  <p>  In that regard, I have some concerns.  When I compare the projected figures that Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII uses those used by South Dublin County Council, there are some divergences.  If they cannot agree now on projected growth, the delivery of transport in the future may not meet requirements.  While TII reckons that the population in South Dublin County Council's administrative area will grow by 10% by 2030, South Dublin County Council reckons it will grow by 19%.  In terms of jobs, TII suggests a 20% increase while South Dublin County Council is looking at something like 39%.  Those variances matter.  The transport we plan has to be future-proofed.  The traffic on the M50 between the junctions with the N4 and the N7 is now at the level predicted for 2023; hence the urgency of the problem.  This is not coming down the tracks at us; we are facing and meeting the problem today.<\/p>  <p>  I have asked the Minister many questions and he has said he would make a submission which, at this point, he has made, on the public transport review.  I am very critical of one point.  I have asked him time and again to conduct a public transport policy review in advance of the mid-term capital review.  He has answered time and again that it is coming up.  One of his more recent replies on the matter stated that the submission deadline for the mid-term review of the capital plan did not allow for the completion of the significant body of work and consultation required to undertake a comprehensive review of public transport policy.  The reason it did not is that the Minister did not start the review in time.  I am concerned that the capital review that is going on currently will not have the evidence that a public transport policy review would have provided.  I am disappointed in that regard, and the blame lies fully at the Minister's door.  Matters are now out of date, in the sense that we will do a public transport policy review with no option and no additional funding in the future.<\/p>  <p>  My colleagues have mentioned a number of issues.  We talked about Metro north.  Metro west has been taken off the map.  It was an orbital route for which South Dublin County Council had made significant provision through land banking and so forth.  The greater Dublin transport plan 2016-35 excludes the possibility completely until after 2035.  I acknowledge that the plan was made when funding was not available.  However, it did not look forward to the needs of a growing capital city.  An orbital route to link up Tallaght, Clondalkin, Lucan, Blanchardstown and on out to the Metro north route is simply gone with no alternative.  People from the western part of the city feel strongly that we need orbital routes.  I welcome the acknowledgement in the greater Dublin transport plan that there will be an extension of the Luas line to Lucan.  Again, the problem is that it is an immediate issue yet there is no prospect of funding until sometime after 2021.  That certainly is a concern.<\/p>  <p>  I also want to talk about buses.  The Minister has stated on numerous occasions that a bus-based solution will be used to deal with the issue in the short term.  I have asked him how many buses we will get and he has usually referred me to the National Transport Authority, NTA.  I find it contradictory that although he is the Minister responsible, the NTA is going to tell us how many buses.  Surely to God, in advance of the budget, the additional capacity should have been determined and that should have been the objective of the budget negotiations.  On budget day, the Minister announced that there would be 110 additional buses.  It took me months to find out from the NTA how many of those were replacements and how many were additional; it turned out 20 were additional.  The Minister has talked about the role Dublin Bus will play in the coming years.  I have asked him in a series of written questions how many additional buses there will be.  What is the demand for additional buses to meet public transport needs in the greater Dublin area?  The Minister has not answered.  He has said it will depend on what is available.  That is not dealing with transport.  It is saying that whatever money the Minister gets on budget day is what will deliver buses.  That is not how to do it.  The right way is to calculate the demand and look for the allocation to meet it.  If that is not done, we will fall behind time and again.<\/p>  <p>  I asked about park and ride facilities for traffic coming in to Dublin from west of the M50, perhaps on the N7 towards Rathcoole or the N4 towards the Spa Hotel.  The Minister, of course, passed me back to the National Transport Authority.  It responded that it is assessing a number of bus-based park and ride locations and expects to make a determination on whether to proceed with them in the coming months.  However, it also stated that the delivery of those facilities will also be contingent on funding being available and that the NTA awaits the outcome of the Government's capital plan review.  That is backwards.  Those facilities should have been the subject of a specific submission, rather than waiting to see what comes from the capital plan.  Every reply I get is like this.  The detail needed to meet current demand is not being given.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000039#PP00200","speaker":"1298"},{"type":"speech","time":1494433500,"counter":437,"content":"<p>I welcome the motion proposed by our Dublin spokesperson, Deputy John Lahart.  The public transport system in Dublin is at breaking point and is creaking at the seams.  There is no question about that.  Deputy Curran mentioned buses.  There is no provision for multi-annual funding, meaning that Dublin Bus cannot plan its routes.<\/p><p>Deputy Curran mentioned, rightly, how we have to wait until budget day to see how many buses are going to be purchased.  That is absolutely ridiculous.<\/p> <p> A total of 1.8 million people will live in the greater Dublin area by 2030.  That is 13 years away.  The more I look at the announcements by the Department, the more I am amazed.  Let us consider the cancellations by the previous Government.  I will not lay all the blame specifically at the door of the current Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, because that would be unfair.  However, the Minister is suffering from the severe lack of ambition shown by his Fine Gael and Labour Party colleagues in the last Government.  They slashed capital expenditure when they should have been spending and investing in metro north and DART underground.  That was at a time when we would have got good value for money.  Now, there are problems in Connolly Station following the opening of the Phoenix Park tunnel, although it was heralded and is good for commuters in that area.  Anyway, people cannot get through Connolly Station.  The northern rail commuter line and the DART line on the north side of the city and county are absolutely at capacity.  Without the DART interconnector we cannot increase capacity within the city.<\/p> <p> We need a government that has direction, leadership and ambition because we are living in the 21st century with an early 20th century public transport system.  Ambition, leadership and direction was shown to deliver Terminal 2, a motorway network and Luas.  However, all we have seen in the past seven years is Luas cross-city.  In itself, that is welcome but what about the growing areas in the greater Dublin area?  What about towns like Balbriggan, Skerries, Rush, Lusk, Donabate, Malahide, Portmarnock and every place along the northern line where commuters have to shove themselves onto the trains?  I am one of those commuters.<\/p> <p> The biggest problem arises when we see population growth rates.  Let us consider the census figures of 2016 and the associated projections.  There is no increased capacity.  Instead, we see reports by successive Ministers, such as the second capital review.  The former Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Donohoe, carried out a capital review.  The Minister, Deputy Ross, is now undertaking a capital review.  The great thing about capital reviews is that Ministers need do nothing else bar review them.  The Minister need only get his officials to go out and get more reports carried out, although we know what needs to be done.<\/p> <p> Metro north was ready to go, but we sent &euro;600 million back to the European Investment Bank.  We should have started the work.  The route was selected.  The land was available and purchased.  The railway procurement order was in place.  What did the Fine Gael and Labour Party Government do?  It went back to the drawing board.  A new route is required along with new planning permission and a new railway procurement order.  What did the Government say?  Those responsible said they would deliver it by 2027.  I do not believe that.<\/p> <p> What we need is something that will pull all this together.  That is why this motion is welcome.  I urge the Minister to make a start on this, because commuters in Dublin and the greater Dublin area deserve far better than what they are getting from this Government and from the previous Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000039#PP00300","speaker":"1228","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1494434100,"counter":439,"content":"<p>I thank my colleague, Deputy Lahart, for raising an important motion.  The net point from what my colleagues have said is that we need a vision and a plan.  We cannot keep hearing the excuses about reviews and the long term from the Department in respect of what the Minister is planning to do.<\/p>  <p>  Generally, we need to look at Dublin as it is growing.  We are seeing vast urban sprawl.  Dublin, as a city and county, will become a county of Leinster.  Effectively, Leinster is sprawling to the extent that Dublin will encompass its whole environs.  That is a big problem.<\/p>  <p>  We need to look at our local authorities.  In particular, Dublin City Council needs to examine increased intensity of development within the context of Dublin city, such that development is not all about a concentric building of transport infrastructure outside the city.  Within the city at present we need to meet the infrastructural deficit for the people living in suburban areas who have no infrastructure to get to work or to commute.<\/p>  <p>  This is a crisis around quality of life and the transport deficit.  Moreover, the cost of getting to work is excessive.  Cycling has been a major failure in recent years.  People who want to cycle and embrace healthy living are left with poorly-planned cycle lanes and are left to compete against the biggest road users, that is, the buses.  That is a major failure of planning.  We need to utilise our canal network to extend cycle lanes to all suburban areas.  It would not involve a major cost.<\/p>  <p>  We also need to examine the commuter line in my constituency of Dublin West.  I am referring to the Maynooth line.  Commuters are like sardines in the morning.  Irish Rail, the Department and whoever is responsible have failed to provide extra carriages at increased frequency despite a population equivalent to that of any city relative to Dublin.  In my area, people cannot get to work without being in complete congestion or moving in conditions that are beyond humane.<\/p>  <p>  We need to look at costs and the infrastructural kick-back that has to occur in the context of improving public finances.  Moreover, the Minister needs to work with his Government colleagues, including Deputy Coveney, if he is still in his current Department, to examine the planning infrastructure in Dublin.  It is not all about building concentric transport patterns within Leinster; it is about how we can have greater intensity of development within the city itself.  It should not all be about massive capital plans.  We need to deliver for those who have no transport because there is a deficit and it is affecting their ability to live and work within the city boundary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000040#QQ00200","speaker":"1255"},{"type":"speech","time":1494434100,"counter":440,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1:<\/p><blockquote>To delete all words after &ldquo;D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:<br \/><br \/>&ldquo;recognises that:<br \/><br \/>&mdash; there is clear and compelling evidence of increasing levels of traffic congestion across the Dublin Region;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; congestion is already presenting a significant cost to the economy of the Dublin Region and, if unaddressed, could adversely affect the competitiveness of the region and the health, well-being and quality of life of its commuters and inhabitants;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; major road development is not the solution to congestion issues in Dublin; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the core elements of the solution to congestion in the Dublin Region in the short to medium term lie, among other things, in an efficient public transport system, including a transformation of the bus system, alongside park and ride provision;<br \/><br \/>acknowledges:<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the important role of the Greater Dublin Area (GDA) Transport Strategy 2016-2035, which was adopted last year and which sets out a clear vision for transport planning in the Dublin Region;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; that there is already a significant number of projects and initiatives being implemented to improve the capacity and effectiveness of the public transport system in the Dublin Region, including Luas Cross City, which will be delivered this year, and other transformational rail projects such as the new Metro North, the DART Underground and the wider DART Expansion Programme that are being progressed;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government that the &euro;3.6 billion investment in the public transport system, provided for in the Capital Plan, will uphold the principles of Smarter Travel;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the important role of the Capital Plan and the Strategic Investment Framework for Land Transport in setting out a vision for public transport at national level; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the importance of a forthcoming National Transport Authority (NTA) initiative that will seek to transform the bus system in the Dublin Region; and<br \/><br \/>calls on the Government to:<br \/><br \/>&mdash; commit, while taking cognisance of the overall Budgetary parameters, to achieving a modern, efficient and effective public transport system for the GDA; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; request that the NTA continue to pursue strategies for alleviation of congestion in the GDA, including the implementation of a proposed transformation of the bus system in Dublin.&rdquo;<\/blockquote><p>Let me start by saying that I welcome this debate.  For many Deputies it is somewhat Dublin-centric, but it is nonetheless very important because the greatest problems of traffic and congestion in this country lie in Dublin.  No one is going to run away from the fact that we have a problem there.<\/p><p>The only issue I have with Fianna F&aacute;il is in respect of what we do about it, as well as some of the statements made by those in that party about the lack of ambition of the Government and the condemnation of our output.  Apart from that, I think we are probably on the same sheet.  I look forward to all Members who have spoken so eloquently making submissions to the many public consultations that we have held and that we will continue to hold on the issues they have raised.  I say as much in all sincerity because it is important that the Opposition, especially at this time of partnership Government and the agreement we have, co-operates in this area for the good of the people of Dublin, who certainly have suffered in recent years because of the congestion of traffic.  We are going to address this.<\/p><p>There are elements of common ground between the Government's views and the Fianna F&aacute;il motion.  I share the view that congestion, if unaddressed, can adversely impact on the health, well-being and quality of life for commuters and inhabitants.  I agree that, if unrestrained, congestion could affect the overall competitiveness of the Dublin region.  Most important, I am strongly in favour of a solution with public transport at its core.  Let there be no doubt about it: we recognise this problem.  We recognise that it is our problem and we recognise that it must be addressed urgently.<\/p><p>We have all heard the anecdotes of growing congestion in Dublin.  These anecdotes are borne out by compelling evidence that everyday journeys of people are becoming more and more difficult.  In recognition of this, my Department and the National Transport Authority have undertaken work to provide an evidence base to address travel demand growth in the Dublin region.<\/p><p>The motion calls on Government to improve the attractiveness, reliability and integration of public transport.  That is perfectly reasonable.  The Government is committed to a well-funded public transport system that achieves these objectives.  The capital plan allocation of &euro;3.6 billion will enable several major public transport projects to proceed and to fund additional capacity to meet existing and future commuter needs, including Luas cross-city and metro north.  Of course, I have made a strong case for increased public transport investment as part of the mid-term review of the capital plan.<\/p><p>Notwithstanding our common ground, there are elements of the Fianna F&aacute;il motion that Government simply cannot support.  That is why, on behalf of the Government, I have proposed amendment No. 1.  The Fianna F&aacute;il motion states that Government lacks vision and a plan to cope with future public transport demand in Dublin city and the wider region.  It also refers to a lack of ambition in the capital plan for public transport.  I hope to be able to answer those particular criticisms in the weeks ahead.  These assertions do not consider the substantial provision made in the capital plan for public transport projects, including Luas cross-city &ndash; a project welcomed by Deputy Lahart.  I do not want to claim the credit for it but it is coming.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000040#QQ00300","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1494434100,"counter":441,"content":"<p>Something for the north side would be good.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000040#QQ00400","speaker":"1228"},{"type":"speech","time":1494434100,"counter":442,"content":"<p>Other projects include metro north, elements of the DART expansion programme, bus, bus rapid transit, heavy rail, light rail and sustainable transport programmes.

It should not be a case, as proposed in the motion, of simply committing as part of the mid-term review of the capital plan to further public private partnerships and securing funding agreements from the European Investment Bank without any consideration for the long-term implications.  We must take a strategic view on the extent to which PPPs can play a useful role in delivering additional infrastructure without severely constraining future capital budgets.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, has established a senior level group to assess the affordability, sustainability and value for money of PPP procurement.  Let us consider the recommendations of the group before making any decisions that could reduce the funding available for transport investment in the future.<\/p>  <p>  As Deputies know, congestion is already presenting a significant cost to the economy in the Dublin region.  My Department's economic and financial evaluation unit estimates the cost of congestion is currently approximately &euro;352 million per annum.  This is forecast to rise to &euro;2 billion per annum by 2033.  Looking at transport patterns and levels of transport usage in recent years, it is easy to see why this is the case.  Towards the end of 2013 and the start of 2014, the welcome increase in employment manifested itself in growth in the numbers of people using public transport but also through increased car use and peak period congestion.  During 2014, users of the M50 began to experience significant increases in journey time for the first time since the M50 upgrade was completed.  In terms of traffic flows, average daily traffic at the tolling point on the motorway was almost 18% higher in 2016 than in 2014.  M50 users are experiencing slower speeds and longer journey times.  Elsewhere there is evidence of a substantial degree of congestion at many locations on the road network approaching the city centre.<\/p>  <p>  As I mentioned, there are projects under way that will go some way to adding capacity to our transport system.  Luas cross city, which is due to commence operations before the end of this year, will provide for an estimated 10 million additional passenger journeys per annum.  The recently completed Phoenix Park tunnel, additional bus fleet and bus lane infrastructure, and small-scale interventions on the M50 will go some way, although not the whole way, to addressing travel demand in the Dublin region.  Approximately &euro;800 million is allocated over the lifetime of the capital plan for bus measures covering Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann PSO fleets, bus infrastructure in the Dublin region and regional cities and bus rapid transit programmes in the Dublin region.<\/p>  <p>  Therefore, what is the answer to our congestion problem?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000041#RR00900","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1494434700,"counter":454,"content":"<p>Make a few decisions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000041#RR01000","nonspeaker":"A Deputy"},{"type":"speech","time":1494434700,"counter":455,"content":"<p>It certainly does not lie in major road development.

Congestion is not confined to a single corridor and it cannot be solved by focusing on just one or two corridors.  It needs an approach that addresses the whole region.  The bus network is undeniably the cornerstone of the public transport system.  I believe a priority in tackling congestion in the Dublin region in the short to medium term is to improve the bus system radically.<\/p>  <p>  As I stated in reply to a question this afternoon, I am pleased to inform the House that the NTA will be launching an important initiative at the end of this month that will transform the bus system in the Dublin region.  The transformation of the bus network will involve a package of measures, namely, a network of so-called next generation bus corridors with segregated cycling facilities; three bus rapid transit routes; a complete redesign of the network; simpler fare structures; implementing a cashless payment system and a state-of-the-art ticketing system; implementing new bus branding; integrating bus vehicles of different operators and types; new bus stops and shelters; and use of low emission vehicles.<\/p>  <p>  Cycling infrastructure is an important part of the package but the core elements of the response lie in the transformation of the bus system alongside park and ride provisions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000041#RR01100","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1494434700,"counter":456,"content":"<p>The Minister will need to conclude there because we are out of time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000041#RR01200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1494434700,"counter":457,"content":"<p>It is all right.

We continue to suffer to this day as a result of poor planning.  There has been a lack of joined-up thinking to ensure developments are correctly catered for, areas which are experiencing growth in population have sufficient transport links and road and rail infrastructure is properly planned to cater for the needs of people in the locality.  Over the past decade we suffered a huge setback when Fianna F&aacute;il's economics led to the bankruptcy of the State.  A large number of planned projects had to be shelved, postponed or curtailed.  We got away with this for some time when unemployment in Dublin plummeted and there were fewer commuters, but now we are reaping what was sowed.<\/p>  <p>  As the Fianna F&aacute;il motion details, the city suffers from dreadful congestion at peak times, the M50 and many rail routes are at capacity and we lack sufficient infrastructure to cater for buses, cyclists and other modes of transport that involve leaving the car at home.  These measures are vital both from a traffic management point of view and to achieve our emissions targets for 2020, which the Environmental Protection Agency has said will not happen under the current range of policy measures.  We have included measures regarding park and ride facilities to link in with existing infrastructural projects and areas to keep bicycles to facilitate commuters in order that they can use public transport easily and efficiently.<\/p>  <p>  This is not only a problem in Dublin.  Our cities are suffering as a result of this legacy too.  Galway has been mentioned in the media as being one of the worst cities suffering congestion.<\/p><p>Of course, the west has essentially been ignored when it comes to development, so this should come as no surprise.  Cork and other cities and towns such as Drogheda also suffer from this problem of congestion.  The movement of goods is also affected, further damaging industry.  This is why we propose in our amendment to have regional advisory authorities, rather than only one authority for the greater Dublin area.  This might be especially helpful as we prepare the national planning framework.<\/p> <p> Our amendment also calls on the Government to protect CIE companies.  We all know what these companies have gone through in the past few years.  We also know that the NTA is putting 10% of bus routes out to tender.  Protecting the national carriers is vitally important.  The motion outlines the crucial role public transport will play, particularly in Dublin city, if we are to manage our growing population and transport needs into the future.<\/p> <p> Sinn F&eacute;in would like to see future infrastructural projects being owned and run by the State.  The State should be willing to invest in these projects, with support from EU funding sources.

It will certainly come as a relief to the people of Dublin and to transport carriers and businesses that have been inconvenienced by the building works.  However, this project is yet another example of the lack of forward planning.  We are playing catch-up.  Projects such as metro north, Luas cross-city and the outer orbital route are coming decades too late.

Congestion is increasing, transport emissions are growing, economic competitiveness is suffering and the quality of life for commuters and inhabitants is declining.  To rent a house stretches most people financially and to own a house is beyond the means of most people.  On top of this, we are spending more and more time commuting, especially from the outskirts of Dublin.  Dublin is a city under severe pressure with no sign of a let-up.  It is also evident that this situation will adversely affect any new business looking to set up here, especially in the wake of Brexit.  This is a direct result of the lack of foresight of this Government and previous Fianna F&aacute;il Governments.  It highlights the lack of joined-up thinking when it comes to transport, especially when the capacity of the Dublin region as a destination for living, visiting, locating to and doing business is being seriously undermined.<\/p>  <p>  There is another threat to the development of the city that is probably the most significant.  This threat to the public transport service is the privatisation agenda being driven by the Government and previously by its Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues who put the process in train.  Dublin Bus, Bus &Eacute;ireann and the rail network should be retained in public ownership to allow the people of this country to benefit from increased and enhanced transport infrastructure over the coming years.<\/p>  <p>  Our amendment to this Private Members' motion aims to kick-start the process of planning a city that will match and exceed the projected rise in population in the greater Dublin area, which is expected to grow by 22% to 1.8 million by 2030 and by 26% to 700,000 in the mid-east region alone, including Kildare, Meath and Wicklow.  Now is the time to start this process and fast-track the many plans for an increase in infrastructure to provide for the future.  Projects such as DART underground, which was put on hold, and metro north should be reintroduced.  The consultation for metro north is supposed to start at the end of this year.  It should be brought forward.  In addition, the Dublin outer orbital route, which was kicked down the road to 2035, should be seriously reconsidered.<\/p>  <p>  In Dublin north west, two major projects would increase capacity: the metro north through Ballymun and the extension of the Luas to Finglas.  I also contend that these two lines should be joined up in the future.  The benefits for Dublin, our national airport and the surrounding areas are obvious.  Thousands of cars will essentially be removed from the roads, improving the environment of Dublin city.  Jobs will also be created both during and after construction.  The situation we face is we either build the capacity now or will suffer in the future.  It is imperative that the Government commitments to these services be fully implemented.  The alternative of an increased population and underdeveloped transport infrastructure will strangle the city both socially and economically.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister mentioned the three bus rapid transit routes, which the NTA is considering again, but I hope it will not be at the expense of many areas served by buses.

This is not just to alleviate the hardship of commuters, of whom I am one - the trains are rammed daily and it is difficult, if not impossible, to get some space, never mind a seat, when coming into town - but also to improve the chances of the town of Balbriggan and the surrounding areas in terms of tourism and development.  We want to see people visiting this beautiful city but we would like them to go to the north of the county as well to explore the many wonderful and beautiful things to do there.  However, it is extremely difficult to access areas such as Balbriggan, Skerries, Rush and Lusk.  We call on metro north to be fast-tracked because it is desperately needed.  The preliminary census figures that show that ours is the fastest-growing population of any constituency in the country support the claim we are making about the extension of metro north.  When one talks to people in north county Dublin about metro north, they throw their eyes up to heaven and say it is just like the draining of the Shannon: it gets wheeled out at election time and then gets put back with the mothballs.  This is no reflection on the Minister but rather the previous Government and the one before that headed by Fianna F&aacute;il.<\/p>  <p>  I sincerely hope we will see metro north.  It is essential not only that it be fast-tracked, but also that the Government give consideration to supporting the Sinn F&eacute;in motion.  I call on all parties and Independents in the House to support the Sinn F&eacute;in motion and consider the extension of metro north up to the north of the county where it is so badly needed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000042#SS00300","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speech","time":1494435300,"counter":474,"content":"<p>The greater Dublin area is being choked by a troika of policy failures.  First, we have lopsided, rudderless spatial development, which is over-concentrating economic and population activity in Dublin and at the same time gutting regional Ireland.  For example, more people leave County Meath every day to work than actually work in the county.  No other county in the country has that experience.  The M3 obviously goes both ways, but one direction is congested in the morning and the other side empty, and <i>vice versa<\/i>in the evening-time.  We have the shocking situation that there are farms within the M50 yet people travel from Cavan, Leitrim and Wexford to work in Dublin.  A big problem with the transport situation is the lopsided spatial plan we have in this country.<\/p><p>Divestment in public transport is forcing people into private transport.  The Minister's Government and the previous Government have taken hundreds of millions of euro out of public transport, leaving people only with the opportunity to use private transport.  I mentioned infrastructure to the Minister earlier.  We have a famine of infrastructural spend in this country, his Government being the second-lowest infrastructural spenders in the EU, second only to Romania.  If there is an accident on the M50, which there regularly is, that road and all the feeder motorways into it can be completely like a car park for about two hours.  That road is beyond capacity.

They are packed.  Like the Minister, I am a regular bus and Luas user.  At times, one would feel like fainting, such is the level of crowding now that people have returned to work.

We are debating transport in Dublin, but we cannot have such a debate without dealing with the question of the workers who provide that public transport, including those in Bus &Eacute;ireann who are based at Broadstone or drive buses in and out of Bus&aacute;ras in the capital as well as outside Dublin.  Currently, these workers are considering recommendations from the Labour Court.  I put it to the Minister that they are being asked to do so with a gun to their heads.  A couple of weeks ago, we read in <i>The Sunday Business Post<\/i>that the company's board had indicated that if workers chose to reject the recommendations, it would file for examinership within a matter of hours.  That is blackmail.  It is disgraceful and deserves to be exposed.  It is not industrial relations - it is thuggery, pure and simple.  I want to put that on the record.  Without such threats, is it likely that workers would accept what is a poor deal?  It means 200 jobs lost as well as pay cuts and a disimprovement in conditions for a not insignificant proportion of the workforce.  The powers that be were forced to make some improvements in pensions and to retreat on the scale of the pay cuts that were originally planned.  This change only happened because of the strike action waged by workers over the three weeks during which they were out.<\/p><p>The key question about the deal is whether it strengthens or weakens the company in the face of competition from private operators.  What happened in Cork last week can be indicative in that regard.  The diktat came down from the top that there should be no more than 48 hours worked in any given week.  Many people worked a longer week than that, but the change was to take immediate effect.  The result, which the workers and experienced union activists had warned about, was the company's inability to operate 17 of its daily services on the Friday of the May bank holiday weekend, including the Waterford route, the Goleen-west Cork route and the city and suburban routes.  The policy undermined the company's ability to deliver a service, increased its reliance on private operators and worsened the service to the general public.<\/p><p>This gives us a glimpse of where the deal is leading Bus &Eacute;ireann.  There can be no solutions to the problems at the company without a significant increase in public funding.  I am in favour of an investment of more than &euro;9 million, but the latter amount would solve the immediate problems.  This comes at a time when the political establishment is prepared to spend more than &euro;10 million on the trials of the Jobstown defendants in the Circuit Court as well as other trials that it has planned.<\/p><p>This is a poor deal from the point of view of the workers and there is blackmail involved.  Should the workers choose to vote &quot;No&quot; to the proposals, we will stand by them entirely in applying the necessary political pressure on the Minister, Deputy Ross, and the Government to give public transport the funds that it deserves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000043#UU00500","speaker":"1432"},{"type":"speech","time":1494435900,"counter":480,"content":"<p>There is a crisis in public transport in Dublin.  Mistakes were made time and again by various companies.  It is not that long ago that the NTA and Dublin Bus reconfigured their routes, yet the situation has not improved significantly.  That said, a number of the extended routes work very well.<\/p><p>Investment in CIE has decreased in recent years.  For example, investment in Dublin Bus fell from &euro;85.6 million in 2008 to &euro;57.7 million in 2015.  Although it increased slightly last year, it is nowhere near pre-2008 levels, which is where it should be going.  We are supposed to be in recovery.  Instead, investment is continually being undermined.  The Government's response is to use the NTA as a shield against responsibility.  The Minister stated that traffic congestion in Dublin cost the economy approximately &euro;350 million, which is almost six times the amount of subvention that he is prepared to give Dublin Bus.  It does not make sense.<\/p><p>I will remind the Minister of the feelings he expressed about CIE workers in an article back in the day.  Regarding cuts at CIE, he wrote:<\/p><blockquote>Not a bad idea as CIE has in recent years been exposed as a swamp of waste and skulduggery.  Quangos like CIE and its three subsidiaries - Dublin Bus, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann - are in dire need of efficiencies.  There is plenty of fat hidden in the darker corners of these bloated bodies.<\/blockquote><p>It is eloquent language, but it is clearly angry and directed at CIE's workers.<\/p><p>The NTA's actions have helped to shield the Minister from responsibility in the recent disputes.  The various justifications that he and agencies have trotted out have everything to do with EU regulation and competition and nothing to do with a serious attempt to provide a decent transport service in this city despite the fact that, as the Minister knows, Dublin has one of the lowest PSO levels among major European cities.  The Minister withdrew several million euro from Dublin Bus when it performed well a few years ago and the competition that the NTA facilitates produces lower pay levels and conditions for workers at every turn.<\/p><p>If the line was in operation, not only would people from County Meath get into the city quicker but approximately 15,000 cars would be removed from the capital's streets.  As well as studying the route, a new feasibility study must examine the knock-on effects that opening the Dublin to Navan line would have on the rest of the Dublin network.  The line will not open until 2045 at the earliest because the Government does not have a plan to do so. <\/p> <p> The lack of continuous bus lines on all the radial routes into the city is a major problem because it causes buses to get snarled up in city traffic.  I hope the Minister will address the absence of an orbital public transport service along the M50.  People travelling to destinations in the city must first travel to the city centre before taking another public transport service outwards to their destination in Dublin.  If I get to Blanchardstown off the M3 and need to go to Dunshaughlin or Swords, I should be able to take a bus to those destinations.  The Minister's predecessor indicated that this type of service would be provided.<\/p> <p> Cyclists are the poor relation in transport.  I cycle into work every day and I often see mothers and young children on bicycles fighting for space on the north quays with heavy goods vehicles and double-decker buses.  A cyclist's life is lost almost monthly on our roads.<\/p> <p> There does not appear to be any plan to introduce electric, hybrid or biogas-fuelled buses, local authority fleets or taxis in Dublin.  This is unlike cities such as Paris and Mexico, which are examining ways of removing diesel powered vehicles from the city.<\/p> <p> I am sick of horizon politics, by which I mean the attitude that everything will be okay some day in the sunny future.  I am sure the Minister is also sick of it.  We are living with real difficulties now.  Horizon politics is not new.  A former Fianna F&aacute;il Minister with responsibility for transport, Mr. Noel Dempsey, promised a train service to Navan by 2015 and we still do not have one.  I ask the Minister to move beyond horizon politics.  Rather than promise a shiny new future some day, he should ensure investment is made now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000043#UU00600","speaker":"1367","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1494436500,"counter":482,"content":"<p>The first line of the motion is spot on.  Transport and travel trends in the greater Dublin area are unsustainable.  Congestion is increasing and the quality of life for commuters diminishing.  One traffic incident on any of the main arteries into Dublin city or on the M50 can result in traffic chaos during rush hour.<\/p>  <p>  The motion is all motherhood and apple pie in so far as it features a little bit of everything that is good - some metro north here, a DART underground there, cycleways, pedestrianisation, park-and-ride projects, the removal of bottlenecks and synchronisation of traffic lights.  No one in the Chamber will disagree with any of these measures, all of which enjoy broad support, at least from representatives of the greater Dublin region.<\/p>  <p>  While there is nothing in the motion with which one could disagree, the text hides some classic Fianna F&aacute;il populism that needs to be interrogated a little.  Fianna F&aacute;il is positioning itself to be the Government after the next election.  For this reason, all the wonderful aims it has set for transport need to match up and be compatible.  There is some looseness in the motion regarding buses, however.  It calls for an increase in the number of buses \"either public or private\".  Does Fianna F&aacute;il care whether bus services are public or private or does it simply want more buses?  Does it seek further tendering of Dublin Bus routes as opposed to the current bare minimum of tendering to comply with European directives?  Does it want bus workers to have fair remuneration, pensions and good terms and conditions of employment or does it want the opposite, which is a feature of privatisation?<\/p>  <p>  We have all felt the effect of these Fianna F&aacute;il three-card tricks in the past.  It will argue it is in favour of increased and improved public transport, be it Bus &Eacute;ireann or Dublin Bus, but then includes in a motion a vague, seemingly innocuous call for an increase in all kinds of buses.  This call is made three sentences after an acknowledgement of a lack of vision and strategic plan.  What is Fianna F&aacute;il's strategic plan for buses?  Is it committed to public bus transport, ensuring the subvention to Dublin Bus is increased and investment made in new buses and the provision of more routes and improved real time passenger information?  Unfortunately, in the real world, increasing the frequency of both public and private bus services is not easily achieved and it is worth pointing out that increasing the number of private operators would have a definite negative impact on the sustainability of our public bus networks in Dublin.  The Labour Party fought tooth and nail in government to protect our bus services from the worst excesses of the troika programme.  Fianna Fail needs to pick a side because it cannot be everyone's friend on this issue.  It seems the era of responsible opposition is over and the party is moving back towards its natural position of irresponsible government.<\/p>  <p>  I take issue with the line which refers to a \"lack of forward planning for the impact of the Luas Cross City, including the impact of its construction on city trade and mobility\".  I cannot see any other way the Luas cross-city project could be constructed without causing disruption as it is major infrastructure that cuts through the busiest part of the capital.  I commend Luas cross-city on its communication with members of the public throughout the works.  The Luas cross city communications office is open and doing a good job in providing a fixed point for any individual or body to interface with Transport Infrastructure Ireland on the project.  The website for the project is also very informative and an excellent information campaign has been run on radio keeping us informed of progress and disruption.  Let us give credit where it is due.<\/p>  <p>  While Fianna F&aacute;il has introduced a motion that features many laudable aspects, it is lapsing into a regrettable and familiar pattern of pandering to certain stakeholders' bias.  In this case, the stakeholder is the chambers of commerce.  Large infrastructure projects cannot but have an impact during the construction phase.  However, the long-term benefits of this cross-city Luas project will be felt by commuters and traders alike for decades to come.  I predict similar noises from city traders when construction work on metro north begins in a few years.  This, too, is vital transport infrastructure and we must all be committed to its delivery.<\/p>  <p>   It is complete and utter nonsense for a Fianna F&aacute;il Deputy to suggest the previous Government could have proceeded with the original metro north plan given the state of the public finances when his party left government and given that a bailout programme was in place and the troika was in town.  I congratulate my constituency colleague, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, on having the hardest neck in Irish politics.<\/p>  <p>  The National Transport Authority and all other transport stakeholders are doing their best to improve transport in Dublin.  Pinch points are being tackled, quality bus corridors continue to improve and traffic lights are being synchronised.  I have more to say on this issue but as I am sharing time with my colleague, Deputy Joan Burton, I will conclude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000044#TT00200","speaker":"1301"},{"type":"speech","time":1494436500,"counter":483,"content":"<p>Dublin is a fabulous city but its transport infrastructure is something of a shambles.  It is a little like a recovering patient in that while there has been some progress, many things have simply not been done.  I will focus on a couple of issues which I raised with the Minister previously.  The Minister should not bury everything under the idea of having an underground DART because that project will not be completed for a long time.  What he could do is electrify the Sligo line as far as Maynooth to facilitate the DART.  Approximately 12,000 houses have been built in the Ongar, Clonee and Hansfield areas in recent years and a special development zone has been in place in the area for more than ten years, although it collapsed when Fianna F&aacute;il ruined the economy.  Some 3,000 houses are ready to go in a lovely area in which people will buy and happily settle.  However, the train service must be substantially upgraded.  A pregnant woman using the Maynooth line will probably be advised by her doctor and will most certainly be advised by her mother not to use the service because the trains have become extremely overcrowded again.  Extending the DART to Maynooth would be a fairly simple project.  It would add lustre to any Minister's legacy to focus on a relatively simple project that feeds in subsequently to the rest of the transport plan.  The return to work of large numbers of people has created a major capacity problem on the train service.  Almost every train needs two additional carriages to ease overcrowding.  This would be a relatively simple and cheap measure that would immeasurably improve commuters' lives. <\/p>  <p>  As I have stated many times, Dublin Bus has made significant improvements in its service in the past decade, despite the financial crisis.  The Minister should give up his mistaken policy of seeking to privatise buses.<\/p><p>This is what has been at the heart of the Bus &Eacute;ireann dispute and other disputes in Dublin Bus.  The Government is now about to rebrand the NTA and Dublin Bus by painting bus stops and bus shelters and painting buses.  Low emissions will be welcome but, on their own, they will not do the business unless we get cars off the road, and we will not get cars off the road until there is a major funding exercise in respect of public transport.<\/p> <p> The grand announcement by the NTA is really a cover.  It will be very expensive branding exercise and will certainly make the NTA look like it is providing the transport when in fact the three companies are providing it.  The NTA constantly says that the conditions and pay of workers are none of its concern but it has no problem awarding contracts to companies which drive down the pay and conditions of other workers.<\/p> <p> Those in Fianna F&aacute;il seem to have had another collective case of amnesia because it was their party and the Green Party that began the cuts which led to this chaos and congestion, taking 200 buses from the Dublin Bus fleet back in the day-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000044#TT00300","speaker":"1253","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1494437100,"counter":485,"content":"<p>We built the motorway system and the Luas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000045#VV00200","speaker":"1311"},{"type":"speech","time":1494437100,"counter":486,"content":"<p>-----and putting more cars on the road by building the motorway system and putting an emphasis on private instead of public transport.<\/p>  <p>  Our motion cuts through the nonsense of Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Minister, Deputy Ross.

We hear about a traffic management plan for Dublin but, unfortunately, we often see the absence of traffic management.  When there is a problem, I fail to understand why we cannot prevent it from worsening by diverting traffic when it is possible to do so instead of allowing that problem to be exacerbated.<\/p>  <p>  I note the term \"lack of vision\" but I do not think it is confined to this Government only as previous Governments have also shown a lack of vision.  I believe we see that in regard to the Luas.  We had all of the disruption with the first Luas and we then went into years of disruption with the second Luas.  Now, we are into more disruption while joining them up.  Forward thinking and a vision for the future would have prevented that.<\/p>  <p>  There have been a number of extensions, junction upgrades and widenings on the M50 over the years but there are times that this busiest road in the country is not fit for purpose.  What is happening is that motorists are avoiding the M50 instead of it being used for the purpose for which it was intended, namely, as a ring road to pass around Dublin.  Now, however, it is very much a commuter road linking the suburbs.  I have previously asked the Minister questions about the need for an outer ring road.<\/p>  <p>  Dublin Airport is the sixth busiest airport in Europe.  Many cities in Europe have rail links to the city centre.  I would make the point that we have excellent Aircoach cover and excellent bus services to the airport, as well as taxis, and I believe they are serving passengers very well.  I think an opportunity was lost when the port tunnel was being developed in that there could have been a rail link with it.  I want to acknowledge the service provided by Dublin Bus, particularly the cross-city service.<\/p>  <p>  I would also like to mention the plans for the pedestrian plaza.  I like pedestrian plazas but I am not too sure about this one around Trinity College, in particular when one wants to drive from the northside on O'Connell Street over to the southside.  There have been elements of an anti-car agenda.  What I saw in another city was that Sunday is traffic-free in the city centre and I would suggest that.<\/p>  <p>  While I am all for people slowing down, the 30 km\/h limit can be very difficult at times and, of course, it is not going to be of any use unless it is enforced.  What will happen is that some people will obey the 30 km\/h limit and they will be passed out by other motorists who are not obeying.  I also wonder if it applies to cyclists because I have been doing 30 km\/h and I have been overtaken by cyclists at times.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the commuter belt in neighbouring counties, there has to be realistic investment in rail and road transport.  When we visit other cities and see their public transport, we find it is efficient and regular so people know it is coming, and it is also not costly.  That is what encourages people to use it.<\/p>  <p>  I want to make one special plea regarding the canals.  We always talk about walking and cycling along the canals but we are not looking at actually using them as a method of transport.<\/p>  <p>  To conclude, while I am not being parochial, I think we need to look again at Dublin, where there is a need for a different advisory council for the city.  It is the capital and has the biggest population and I believe we have to look at it in a wider context, with more joined-up thinking.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000045#VV00500","speaker":"1291"},{"type":"speech","time":1494437100,"counter":489,"content":"<p>I think we had better look out for the cyclists in Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan's area.

It was that party and its current Fine Gael partners in government which starved the Dublin region of transport and other key infrastructure over the past five decades.  In the late 1980s and early 1990s, for example, the proposed light rail system included a northside Ballymun-Dublin Airport line but the Ahern Government scrapped the northside proposal and went ahead with the minimum red and green lines.  Now, three decades later, we are still talking about metro north and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, has again put it on the long finger until 2026 or whenever.  I want to commend Fingal County Council chief executive, Paul Reid, and his staff on highlighting the issue and protecting the metro north economic corridor up to Swords and Lissenhall.  With the huge population growth in the north fringe and Swords, and with the airport heading towards 30 million passengers <i>per annum<\/i>, it is not a question of whether metro north can be fast-tracked; it must be fast-tracked.  It is also disappointing that a completion date for the metro light rail could not have been targeted for, say, 2022, the anniversary of national independence and in time for the possibility of the Rugby World Cup being hosted here.  In fact, it could have been part of the package that Dick Spring and his committee were offering to the other rugby federations.  Instead, the NTA talks of yet more consultations whereas Spain and other EU partners have many examples of metro and light rail systems being built in three to five years.<\/p><p>At a meeting of the Committee on Budgetary Oversight yesterday, during our review of the capital programme, we again heard of the desperately low levels of investment in Ireland, this time from the Dublin Chamber of Commerce.  The austerity Governments since 2008 have allowed investment to fall below minimum depreciation levels and Ireland had the lowest gross fixed capital formation in the EU at less than 2% in 2015.  The current Government's programme down to 2021 is a feeble attempt to remedy this and the funding available needs to be doubled, especially in the areas of social housing and transport.  I thoroughly agree with the Dublin chamber that metro north and DART underground projects should be prioritised in the next five years.  The commuter train networks in the west of Dublin city should also be urgently transformed into DART services.  The subsuming of the Railway Procurement Agency into the NTA was a grave mistake by the last Government and I was very disappointed to learn from the railway procurement section of the NTA recently that none of the fixed rail projects to which I refer are shovel-ready despite the millions of euro - perhaps &euro;60 million - that have already been spent on planning metro north.<\/p><p>Obviously, the network direct system introduced by Dublin Bus in the past decade has transformed the structure of bus transport in the city and Dublin Bus staff must be complimented on the great efficiencies they have produced.  However, further massive investment is clearly necessary in the bus network, especially to facilitate orbital travel around the city region.  While a well-developed fixed line rail system for Dublin is critical, the bus network will continue to be the workhorse of public transport.<\/p><p>The number of people cycling to work at the end of 2016 was almost the same as the number carried by the Luas lines and, of course, many more commuters use the Dublin bikes scheme.  Nonetheless, I note the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has still not undertaken a formal review of the implementation of the national cycle policy framework and, hopefully, this will be carried out later in the year.  I and colleagues on Dublin City Council in the early 1990s promoted a city-wide cycling network but it has again taken decades to develop this and to expedite measures for pedestrian safety.  I also proposed Dutch-style home zones, with 25 mph speed limits for residential areas in the mid-1990s.<\/p><p>While I welcome the completion of the Sutton to Sandycove cycleway in my constituency, Dublin Bay North, I have received many complaints from constituents that the new James Larkin Road is dangerous on road safety grounds because it is so narrow and no lane has been provided for public transport and emergency vehicles.  Constituents believe the original 2008 plan should have been constructed with a public transport lane and the safe cycleway beside it.<\/p><p>Last year, I made a generally positive submission on the proposed College Green plaza.  However, many workers have complained that this and other current plans for the Dublin quays emanating from the traffic department of Dublin City Council do not recognise the need for well-structured north-south arteries across Dublin for necessary motor traffic.  Most of Dublin city lies north of the Liffey and the current city manager forgets that 65% to 70% of his administrative area is actually located on the northside.<\/p><p>City planners have continued to approve large-scale office and other workplace developments in Dublin 2 and Dublin 4.  That approach requires, alongside increased facilities for pedestrians and cyclists and greatly enhanced public transport, the maintenance of a core network of cross-city street linkages.  Indeed, the recent plans for the city quays also fall into that category because it would inevitably have deflected a lot of east-west traffic into the suburbs of Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan's constituency, which is unacceptable.<\/p> <p> Finally, last week Manchester, Liverpool, Birmingham and Bristol elected their first mayors and received some reasonable autonomy from London.  The Dublin region, more than ever, needs an elected mayor to fight for necessary transport and other infrastructure for our capital city.  In fact, it was the Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael parties on Fingal County Council which prevented us from having a referendum on the mayoralty of Dublin.  We need a mayor.  We need somebody to fight for Dublin.  Manchester and London have mayors.  We have seen the success of the London mayor, the Paris mayor, the New York mayor, etc.  We need a Dublin mayor as well to move forward on transport and not to be relying on Governments that are dominated by Members who do not really care about Dublin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000045#VV00700","speaker":"1361","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1494437700,"counter":492,"content":"<p>I compliment and thank Deputy Troy and the Fianna F&aacute;il Party on bringing this motion before Members this evening.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister and the Minister of State might ask why am I talking about issues in Dublin.  A pile of people from Kerry work in Dublin.  Kerry people, myself included, travel here on business and for different reasons.  I have seen a lot of changes over the past number of years when it comes to transport in Dublin city and in the short time that I have, I want to ask Deputy Troy and Fianna F&aacute;il to show an amount of interest in the rest of the country that is equal to their interest in Dublin.  They will do that because we have other transport-related problems.  For instance, in my native county, we have problems with access and different issues but I will talk about that in a moment.  I merely want to thank Deputy Troy for bringing this issue to a head here tonight because it is terribly important.<\/p>  <p>  I want to compliment a very important group of people, that is, those who provide our public transport service here in Dublin.  I refer to those who drive the buses, the trams and the DART.  All these different modes of access are terribly important.  The staff work really diligently, sometimes in difficult circumstances, and I compliment them on that.<\/p>  <p>  A short number of years ago, when coming from Kerry one did not get choked up until one hit the Red Cow roundabout but it has become so bad that now one is below in Naas when the traffic starts to get backed up.  Something has to be done, whether it is trying to encourage motorists to use public transport or trying to get them to take out the bicycle.  We all have our bikes which we use in the best way we can.  We have to really knuckle down to this problem because, if one reads the statistics, the population in the greater Dublin area is expected to grow by 22% to 1.8 million by 2030 and by 26% to 700,000 in the mid-east region alone, including Kildare, Meath and Wicklow.  This will lead to a chaotic situation.  I call on the Minister and the Minister of State, and on the Government, as Fianna F&aacute;il is doing, to put measures in place now that will act in a progressive and workmanlike way to deal with the problem because the Minister and Minister of State are in charge and it is up to them at this time to put measures in place to ensure we will be able to cater for this great amount of people.<\/p>  <p>  While I again thank Deputy Troy, coming back to the rest of the country I ask that it does not all happen inside the Red Cow roundabout.  I accept the population is increasing in Dublin but we want to see our part of the country, rural Ireland, and our areas progress and grow and be attractive for employers and to be attractive for those who want to invest.  That will not happen unless we have proper road networks and proper access and unless our towns are not choked, because that is the case at present where I am from.  We lack parking and bypasses and are looking for our share of the investment.  I do not want to see it all happen in Dublin.  Quite simply, the world does not revolve around Dublin.<\/p>  <p>  I very much support Deputy Troy in what he is doing here tonight and thank him for bringing the motion before the House.  I call on the Minister and Minister of State to ensure that they will act accordingly and ensure that the people will not be completely choked up in another couple of years' time.  It has changed so much in the past five or six years.  It has got so busy it is literally chaos trying to move around Dublin city at present.  I ask them to try to do something about it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000046#WW00200","speaker":"1319"},{"type":"speech","time":1494437700,"counter":493,"content":"<p>I, too, am happy to speak on this motion tonight.<\/p>  <p>  I note that the motion recognises that transport and travel needs within the greater Dublin area are unsustainable - we heard that a long time ago - and that \"congestion is increasing, transport emissions are growing, economic competitiveness is suffering and quality of life for commuters and inhabitants is declining\".  I had to look at the motion twice to ensure they were not talking about rural Ireland.  I note it also states \"the capacity of the Dublin region as a destination for living, visiting and for locating and doing business is being seriously undermined\", and \"that significant actions are required to increase capacity and usability of public transport\".  While I am completely supportive of the needs of the Dublin population and have no desire to engage in a game of rural versus urban Ireland, I have serious concerns about the overall thrust of this motion and will not be supporting it.  My fear is that we will end up compounding an already disproportionate focus on the capital.  We need a National Transport Authority that takes into account the dire needs of the regions to develop better transport infrastructure.  If we want to get another authority or, as I call such a body, a quango which prioritises Dublin, which so many already do in a de facto manner, then where will we be in ten years' time?  It is like a monster gobbling up all before it.  I simply do not believe that the capital and the transport infrastructure associated with it are in need of superior levels of support.  They have got all the support.  They have got all the investment including everything from the DART to the Luas, the buses and whatever.<\/p>  <p>  We need to develop the regions.  We need to stop the swallowing up of rural Ireland and the draining away of industry and employment from the regions.  I met the head man of the IDA in Washington on the eve of St. Patrick's Day and he told me that not only do companies coming to Ireland not want to go to Tipperary where we want jobs, they will not even go to Galway, Limerick or Waterford.  Everything is about Dublin and successive Governments have created that.  I certainly am not supporting the motion.  I am not begrudging anything that they have here, but I cannot walk home to night but I will be hounded by taxis to hop in.  If I ordered a taxi in Tipperary, I would not get one tonight - not a hope.  I would not get one in the towns.  Maybe one would get one at the weekends.  One will not get a taxi.  It is totally unfair and totally imbalanced.<\/p>  <p>  Quality of life, quite frankly, is not good in Dublin because of the pressure, the traffic, the emissions and everything else.  I honestly believe we need to achieve some progress.  There are too many authorities.  One would know Dublin Port authority, by its name, is there for years.  It is quango-land and they all are compounded in the public service commission, below where the Luas line is, where they control every appointment to every board, every club and nearly every dog race.  They want to keep control of it.  That is the way it is.  That is the way many officials in the Department are too.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the fact that the Minister's first visit outside of Dublin when he was appointed was to Tipperary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000046#WW00300","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1494437700,"counter":494,"content":"<p>He came to Kerry too.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000046#WW00400","speaker":"1319"},{"type":"speech","time":1494437700,"counter":495,"content":"<p>He did.

I was a member of one of several consultative panels.  The purpose of the DTI was to deal with traffic congestion in the capital and European funds were available for initiatives to deal with it.  The case was very strongly made by Ireland at the time because Dublin was underperforming due to congestion.  There were traffic delays, loss of productivity, increased accident rates, increased insurance costs and people's time wasted, among other issues.  If anything, that case has got more extreme and it will not improve until key projects are in place and more people live in the city centre itself.  The DTI reported in 1996 and set out what should be done.  Not only did the report identify projects such as the DART underground, the Luas, metro north, a doubling of the Maynooth rail line and many other initiatives but it tested those pieces of infrastructure against population scenarios.  The preferred scenario at the time was that there would be a population increase in the city centre and that was to be achieved through higher densities.  Other growth scenarios were tested, including the do-nothing scenario, or leave it to the markets.  The latter is pretty much what occurred.  Fianna F&aacute;il was in government for most of those years.  It was all very well having a plan but when the plan did not match the growth scenarios, it was a mismatch.  It is important to say that.<\/p>  <p>  The very big projects include the DART underground that would connect the main rail lines and which has been described as a game-changer with the potential to treble rail capacity in the greater Dublin area to 100 million journeys per annum.  All these years later, this project is still, largely, at the planning stage and the same is true of metro north.<\/p>  <p>  It is well worth looking at the population changes between 1996 and 2016 in percentage terms.  The Dublin Transportation Initiative had a 20-year horizon and it concluded in 1995 to 1996.  It showed in graphic terms why we face such significant congestion.  Over those 20 years Dublin city grew by just 13%; D&uacute;n Laoghaire grew by 13%; South Dublin grew by 22%; Fingal by 43%; Kildare by 39%; Meath by 44% and Wicklow by 28%.  More people now live in the three counties of Kildare, Meath and Wicklow than live in Dublin city centre.  That is what is called a doughnut.  It is a typical American city that is car-dependent.  We have created a perfect doughnut.  While the DTI linked land use and planning when testing scenarios, clearly the city must be an attractive place for people to live, and that includes for families as well as individuals.  One must look at apartment size, quality open spaces, good levels of security, investment in schools and good places to work.<\/p>  <p>  One could ask what is occurring now and whether anything has changed.  The growth experienced in the commuter counties is increasing.  For example, Kildare is currently working through local area plans that include the development of 32,000 housing units up to 2023.  If one assumes 2.5 people per housing unit, that is 80,000 extra people up to 2023.  We are reinforcing the doughnut, which is absolute madness.  The trend will add to the commuting demands and the national primary route will become a distributor route for the outer counties.  The same is occurring in Meath and Wicklow as is occurring in Kildare.  What occurs in doughnut-type cities is a demand for increased road capacity, calls for roads to be widened and new roads to be built.  In that way one copperfastens the problem.<\/p>  <p>  While we agree with Fianna F&aacute;il on the need for capital investment, we believe it is short-sighted not to invest in capital projects in order to pay down the debt where they make absolute sense, which is the case with some of the projects outlined.  In fact, we are convinced it will cost us more in the long run.  We have climate obligations that will result in us paying hard cash when we should be investing that money in this hard infrastructure at this stage.  We need to look at cities such as London that had the foresight in Victorian times to put in an underground, which has stood the test of time.  There are plenty of other such examples.<\/p>  <p>  Not only do we have a significant problem with congestion but we also have the climate obligations.  We need more houses and apartments.  However, let us not be so short-sighted that we resolve one problem and make another problem worse.  Where the housing units are located is critically important.  While an advisory council is useful it will not resolve the problem.  It will take time to deliver big projects such as the DART underground and metro north and in the meantime interim solutions must be found to deal with the problem.  We cannot separate land use from transportation planning.  What we are doing at the moment is making a bad situation worse in terms of what is going on with the regional guidelines and I caution against that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000047#XX00700","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1494438300,"counter":512,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion.  There is no doubt Dublin needs infrastructure but so does the rest of the country.  I heard an earlier speaker say the population of Dublin is growing and this and that is happening.  The reason the pressure exists is that more pressure will develop in one area when there is imbalanced regional development.  I am surprised at the lack of emphasis in the motion on rural Ireland.  I did not think Fianna F&aacute;il was concentrating on one part of the country.<\/p>  <p>  I remember when the M50 was built and the rest of the country got its potholes filled.  An outer ring road in Galway was objected to for planning reasons.  The N59 was also objected to for planning reasons.  The Cork to Mallow road was not done when the country was awash with money.  That has left a deficit of infrastructure around the country and that has caused major problems.<\/p>  <p>  Perhaps the Minister will find a map of Ireland on Google and see that when one crosses the Shannon, there is a place called the west of Ireland.  Money has not been invested in the N4 road.  The same is true of the N5.  We know the problems in Galway city, where the situation is worse than Dublin because of the rigmarole with regulations and rules.  We have seen what has happened in Cork, Limerick and Sligo.  Let us go around the country.  Those places count.  They matter but, unfortunately, 80% of the staff in the Department live and work around Dublin and they do not realise the rest of the country exists.  If the Minister does one thing I urge him to move the Department to a rural area because where one works and where one drives from is what will change one's mind about the various problems.<\/p>  <p>  In the programme for Government it is stated that the western rail corridor would be considered.  Has that been done?  No.  There is also a reference in the programme for Government that funding would be provided for the N4, N5 and other roads.  One year later no funding has been provided.  The issue that was considered the most urgent was to get TEN-T funding for the west, and that was taken out in 2011 by the previous Government.  I see the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, is in the Chamber.  I hope he will make an input and try to deliver for rural Ireland, for example, in terms of TEN-T funding, because it is crucial for the west to make sure there is balanced regional development.<\/p><p>When one looks at the rate of spending in Departments, rural Ireland needs to get &euro;2 out of every &euro;3 but that is not happening.

As a Wicklow Deputy, I want to put on record the fact that part of this congestion is because 70% of Wicklow's workers are leaving the county every day to work mostly in Dublin.  This situation is unsustainable, not just from a transport perspective but also from a social perspective and from the point of view of people's well-being.  The obvious answer that would be of benefit to Dublin's transport problem is more sustainable jobs based in County Wicklow.  No one in Wicklow or east Carlow would disagree that commuting to Dublin has increasingly become a nightmare.  This puts extra pressure on our residents.  Transport Infrastructure Ireland has confirmed that Wicklow has the worst traffic congestion in the commuter belt.  In north Wicklow large numbers of commuters are trying and failing to access rail services.  A lack of rail capacity is forcing people to use the N11 and this further contributes to gridlock.  It was disappointing that, under the most recent transport plan for the greater Dublin area, the Luas line was not extended to Bray.  That formerly proposed route needs to be put back in the plan.  Additional park-and-ride facilities would also be required in Bray, Greystones, Wicklow and Arklow.<\/p>  <p>  Traffic management on the N11 is often non-existent, thus creating gridlock every morning as commuters make their way to work.  The smallest drop of rain or a minor traffic accident can result in hours being lost as vehicles are backed up as far as Newtownmountkennedy.  A major upgrade of the N11 is vital for north Wicklow with improved access on all junctions that merge with the M50.  The N81 in west Wicklow is also a crucial arterial route into Dublin for many people in Wicklow, Carlow and Kildare.  It needs to be upgraded urgently to tackle notorious bottlenecks in Hollywood, Blessington, and Brittas.  The people of Wicklow and east Carlow need a transport plan, with specific timed actions that are managed with a view to regional growth and sustainability.  I urge the Minister and the Government to start resolving these problems rather than just observing them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000048#YY00200","speaker":"1357"},{"type":"speech","time":1494438900,"counter":515,"content":"<p>I am delighted to have a chance to participate in this debate and support my colleague Deputy Lahart's motion.

We need additional bus and train services, as well as extra park-and-ride facilities.  We also need to examine the inclusion of a rapid public transport service which is not currently there.  That would obviously assist greatly in getting people from A to B.  We should also look at improved infrastructure, such as a road linking the M4 to the M7.  Currently, 5% of vehicles that come onto the M50 after the M1 only follow it through to the airport interchange.  That is a significant statistic, so we also need to consider an outer ring road.<\/p><p>Traffic congestion is causing major problems for the environment and for public health, including stress.

The mixture of container freight is causing untold delays for those trying to get to work and school.  Dundalk to Dublin off-peak can be achieved in one hour, but at rush hour it can take two and a half hours.  That often means that people spend more time travelling than working.  This morning one of my staff said that the bus she was on reached Bachelors Walk at 9.20 a.m. but did not arrive in Nassau Street until 9.45 a.m.  That is a mere 750 m that could be walked in ten minutes, yet it took 25 minutes for the bus to travel the distance.<\/p><p>The level of gridlock that commuters to and from Dublin must endure daily is unacceptable.  I use the M1 every day and know that a number of simple, short-term solutions could be implemented straight away in order to alleviate traffic on the main arterial roads into the city.  For example, proper car-parking areas could be introduced to encourage more car pooling and park and ride facilities.  I am sure we have all seen lines of cars parked close to roundabouts at entry points, particularly to the M1.  Car parking should have been, and can be, included at the Apple Green stations that are readily placed at strategic locations along the motorway.  While the port tunnel works well by taking trucks off the road and straight to their destination, there are major back-ups of trucks on the M1 heading towards the port tunnel.  This is at rush hour and thus causes delays.  I suggest that sea ferries should operate outside rush hour times.  The current departure time of one ferry is 9.30 a.m. and this adds to our gridlock on our roads.  We need some form of incentive to get trucks to switch from off-peak times, perhaps allowing them to pass through the various tolls free prior to 6 a.m.  We could also stagger school opening times and introduce a range of other short-term measures.  I could go on <i>ad infinitum<\/i>about simple measures, rather than macro ones, but I will allow Deputy Donnelly to come in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000048#YY00500","speaker":"1332"},{"type":"speech","time":1494438900,"counter":518,"content":"<p>I welcome Deputy Lahart's motion and congratulate him on seeking action in respect of the increasing traffic congestion in Dublin and surrounding counties.  In Wicklow the situation is now extreme.  Some 70% of the working population leave the county to go to work.  As my colleague Deputy Casey said one solution to that is more local jobs.  In the meantime, however, something has to be done about the increase in congestion that we are witnessing.  The vast majority of those leaving County Wicklow are travelling to Dublin.  Whether they are travelling from the east or west of County Wicklow, they just see more and more congestion on a monthly basis.<\/p>  <p>  This is not primarily a planning issue, which is important, but rather it relates to a lack of implementation.  Despite numerous promises, Wicklow commuters see no relief on the horizon.  The new public transport links are strained to breaking point.<\/p><p>The long-promised extension to the Luas has been kicked so far down the line that is now probably decades off.  Increased capacity for rail is obviously not possible without serious capital investment.  The Bus &Eacute;ireann services, such as the 133, and the Dublin Bus services, such as the 84X, are now regularly filled beyond capacity so people have to use private transport.  This, as we know, is coming under huge pressure too.  A recent Transport Infrastructure Ireland report indicates that a third lane is needed for the M11 around the Greystones and Bray area, and yet, as the Minister pointed out to me a number of months ago, no funding has been allocated and no funding will be allocated without a review.  It is well known that the Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy Ross, work hand in glove together, so I ask him to relay to the Minister that the reviews have now been completed and we would like to see some serious action in terms of capital investment for commuters in Wicklow.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000048#YY00600","speaker":"1436","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1494439500,"counter":520,"content":"<p>I have a slight problem.

I particularly thank the rural Deputies who spoke.  This is not an either-or situation, as many of them pointed out.  It is both rural and urban.  As the Minister, Deputy Ross, said earlier, there is no magic bullet for congestion but there is a drive and a determination in Government to respond to the issue.  While there are differences of opinion across the House, what we have in common is a commitment to a quality public transport system for the greater Dublin region and a willingness to respond to the challenges posed by increasing congestion.<\/p>  <p>  Transport is an area that impacts on all our lives.  Therefore it is important to build consensus regarding how we approach the difficulty.  The first step in building consensus is to have a shared understanding politically of what the priorities and objectives should be in terms of tackling congestion in Dublin.  Today's discussion has been informative in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  From our perspective, there are a few key issues at the heart of this debate . We cannot discuss transport in Dublin without referring to the availability of funding.  While there is common ground, we must bring an element of political realism to the debate regarding the resources available from the Exchequer and how the public transport can be financed.  We must accept that the Exchequer does not have limitless resources to fund transport projects or indeed any other infrastructure projects.  That does not mean that we jump into public private partnership, PPP, arrangements without understanding the true implications for future capital budgets.  It means the projects and programmes we select must be the right ones at the right time.  PPPs may have a role in delivering additional transport infrastructure, but we have to be strategic about using them to ensure we properly understand their future implications.<\/p>  <p>  In the interests of moving towards a common consensus today, the House should acknowledge that significant investment has already been made in public transport in the greater Dublin region and that the range and quality of the public transport services has undoubtedly benefited from this investment.  Funding continues to be allocated to the National Transport Authority, NTA, to promote public transport use and to improve customer experiences through the use of smart technology.  Successful initiatives that have been introduced include the Leap card, real time passenger information and journey planning apps.  As regards infrastructure, the Minister, Deputy Ross, noted earlier the Luas cross city and the Phoenix Park tunnel are two important projects which will add capacity to the transport system in the greater Dublin region.<\/p>  <p>  A total of &euro;3.6 billion has been allocated in the capital plan for public transport projects.  This will enable a number of Dublin-based projects to be completed or to proceed, including Luas cross city and metro north.  There is &euro;800 million allocated in the capital plan for bus measures.  These include fleet replacement and enlargement programmes for Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann, bus network infrastructure development and bus rapid transit programmes in the greater Dublin area.  Projects funded under the capital plan will fund additional capacity to help meet existing and future commuter needs.<\/p>  <p>  I fully accept that projects funded under the capital plan will not solve the congestion problem facing Dublin in isolation. However, combined with quick win projects already funded such as the Phoenix Park tunnel, additional bus fleet and infrastructure and small-scale interventions on the M50, we can at least acknowledge that they will go some way in meeting the existing and future levels of transport demand in the region.  The delivery of these projects on the ground helps to create momentum and allows the travelling public to see the benefits of the correct types of investment and the correct approach.  I echo what the Minister, Deputy Ross, said earlier regarding the need for a step change in the public transport system across the greater Dublin region to tackle congestion and increasing levels of demand.  This requires a corresponding change in funding.<\/p>  <p>  Another issue at the heart of the debate is the long-term strategy and vision for public transport in the Dublin region.  I mentioned at the start of my speech that to build consensus, we should have a shared understanding of the priorities and objectives for transport in Dublin.  I assure the House that there is a long-term vision for transport in the Dublin region.  The NTA's transport strategy, which was adopted last year, sets out a clear vision and a statutory basis for transport planning in the region.  Given the planning and design requirements as well as the very significant capital investment requirements, it will not be possible to deliver many of the large-scale projects set out in the transport strategy in the short to medium term, notwithstanding the long-term merits of these projects.  We must be realistic, therefore, about how we can effectively tackle congestion in the near term.<\/p>  <p>  We must look to the bus network in the short to medium term to deliver the step change in the performance required of our public transport system to cater for growing demand.  The bus-centred initiative to be launched by the NTA at the end of this month will seek to transform the bus system in the Dublin region within the overall framework of the long-term transport strategy for the region. The initiative will capitalise on the role of the bus as the cornerstone of the public transport system in the Dublin region.  A shared understanding of what is proposed is as important for the public as it is for this House.  Like the Minister, I will be urging members of the public to get involved in the consultation process for the proposed transformation of the bus system in Dublin.  Fundamentally, the initiative will result in a revamped bus system that will deliver faster journeys, with more certainty of arrival times; deliver a high quality of service which is punctual and reliable; provide an attractive alternative to many existing car users; provide passengers with more journey options; and allow for the transition to use of low emission vehicles.<\/p>  <p>  This is the vision for Dublin that we should be working towards for the short to medium term.  The NTA's transport strategy sets out the priorities and objectives for the long term, but an incremental approach is needed to reach our long-term objectives.  A transformative programme of investment in the bus system in Dublin provides the best chance to tackle growing congestion now before it significantly impacts on the future economic recovery of the area.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the Deputies in the House for raising this important issue and contributing to our shared understanding of the issues around the Dublin region.  It has been a worthwhile debate that has brought a number of important issues to the fore, particularly in relation to the cost of congestion, growing evidence of increasing levels of congestion, funding availability, projects that have already been planned and those that are under way, and the imminent launch of the NTA's bus transformation initiative.  I will be following and supporting the roll-out of the bus transformation initiative with interest. There is potential to adopt a similar approach in other cities, especially the regional centres referred to earlier where the growth in travel demand is becoming an increasing problem.  We must start in Dublin where the need to address congestion is most acute.  The counter-motion is a fair statement of Government's position.  We have established a way forward to respond to the congestion issue.  It is now time to get on with the task in hand.<\/p>  <p>  Before I commend the counter-motion to the House I would like to say that many of the problems we are facing in terms of congestion are direct results of the economic recovery in the State, which is leading to problems.  As commuters, I and other Deputies coming from rural constituencies have experienced these problems.  None of us is saying the issues in Dublin do not need to be addressed.  What I am saying is along the lines of what Deputies McGrath and Healy-Rae have said, that this is not an either-or situation.  We have to take a whole-island approach to this.  While Dublin is the capital city, it is no less or more important than any of the other centres throughout the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000049#ZZ00700","speaker":"1267"},{"type":"speech","time":1494439500,"counter":526,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his co-operation.

Commuting impacts commuters' mental health, their family life, their social life and their economic well-being.  People are stuck in traffic when they should be at home with their families or in work.  I welcome the acknowledgment this week that a third lane is badly needed on the N11-M11 roadway to tackle increased traffic congestion, as reported by TII this week.  It was a long-awaited report.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is failing Wexford in its job strategy, leaving the county with one of the highest rates of unemployment and forcing people to commute to Dublin for work.  The Government is failing in its housing strategy in Dublin, forcing people to leave Dublin to come to counties like Wexford to seek housing, thus adding to the commuting problem.  The Government is failing in its transport policy by not having one.<\/p>  <p>  Some 80% of our goods are exported across the Continent of Europe via the UK land bridge.  These include perishable goods such as pharmaceuticals, agrifood and livestock.  These sectors are vital to our economic well-being.  When a hard Brexit happens, that land bridge will be gone.  We have to find another way to get our 80% of goods to the Continent, particularly those perishable goods.  The only suitable alternative route is through Rosslare Europort, yet the Minister continues to fail to publish the Indecon report and refuses to set out a pathway for Rosslare Europort.  Despite all these issues, the Minister is also prepared to stand by while CIE threatens to close the Dublin-Rosslare Europe service south of Gorey.<\/p><p>In the interests of commuters, regional balance relating to areas like Wexford and our economy post Brexit, I ask the Minister to bring forward a proper infrastructural plan.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000049#ZZ00900","speaker":"1354","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1494440100,"counter":529,"content":"<p>I represent north Kildare, which along with the rest of Kildare and counties Louth, Wicklow and Meath, is said to be the commuter belt.  Someone said that Naas in Kildare is the buckle on that belt.  It is pretty much the centre of the commuter belt with huge numbers from the county travelling to Dublin daily for work and most of the country passing through the N4 and N7 to get to Dublin so it is very much steeped in commuting and private and public transport.  It is estimated that between 60,000 to 80,000 vehicles travel the N7 daily along with commuters coming in from Sallins, Celbridge, Leixlip, Maynooth and Kilcock train stations and those travelling on buses from Prosperous, Clane and Naas along with private transport along the N4 and N7.<\/p>  <p>  As has been already said, what is lacking is a big picture - a vision.  We do not have a transport policy, as Deputy Browne noted.  A 30-year transport strategy was published as the Government took office.  There was barely a hint in it of any kind of connectivity in respect of projects like the interconnector, metro north, metro west or the outer orbital route for the M50.  There is no joining of the dots.  We have multiple routes.  If people want to get into the city centre and back out again, they can do it - albeit very tortuously and slowly - making their way through traffic jams.  If they need to go from A to B and up to C, it is far more difficult.  We need to put in place a basic transport infrastructure of the kind that every other capital city of its type in the world has.  We are lacking in it.  The Fianna F&aacute;il plan was mentioned earlier.  This plan, which was called Transport 21, was actually a fine plan.  If we could revisit it now, we would be well served.  I urge the Minister to take this motion seriously and I commend my colleague for tabling it.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000050#AAA00200","speaker":"1323"},{"type":"speech","time":1494440100,"counter":530,"content":"<p>I thank all Deputies who contributed to Private Members' business this evening.  We are all agreed that congestion in Dublin and indeed across many of our cities is having a detrimental impact on economic activity and the family life and mental health of so many commuters.  According to the Minister, this is costing our economy &euro;350 million per annum.  Can Members imagine how many infrastructural projects could be developed if that money was spent on infrastructure?  As a party that invested in Terminal 2 at Dublin Airport, expanded the M50 from four to six lanes, constructed the initial two Luas lines and invested in rail improvements, we are delighted to give Members across all parties the opportunity to speak to this motion this evening.<\/p>  <p>  This motion is not about pitting Dublin against the rest of Ireland.  It is about how Dublin needs to be addressed as a capital city.  Deputy Eamon Ryan criticised Fianna F&aacute;il because for some reason he thinks Dublin Chamber of Commerce should not be given a voice in this debate.  Dublin Chamber of Commerce represents retailers who generate employment for up 300,000 people.  If, as is suggested in this motion, the transport advisory group was adopted, it would give a voice to a range of stakeholders.  <\/p>  <p>  What is critically important is the lack of investment over the past number of years in public transport and road infrastructure.  The past number of years has seen Ireland fall down to the second lowest level of investment in this critical infrastructure in Europe.  Only Romania is behind us.  This Government has failed to make a case to the European Commission for greater flexibility in the fiscal rules when it comes to investing in critical transport projects.  The Juncker plan is there.  A total of &euro;500 billion can be availed of at unprecedented low interest rates.  A total of 10% of this plan has been already been drawn down for critical transport infrastructural projects but where is that 10% of the plan being drawn down?  It is being drawn down in every country other than Ireland.  We have not applied for one cent of this fund to invest in any infrastructural projects across this country.  If we applied for funding under this fund, we could invest in improving public transport, including DART and commuter rail expansion and increased capacity and reliability.  We could offer better access to well-serviced commuter and inter-regional rail for commuters because that would be central to reducing car dependency.  <\/p>  <p>  The Minister talks about the new bus policy that will appear at the end of this month.  I will welcome the publication of that and we will definitely engage in that just as we engaged in and made a comprehensive submission to the national rail review.  However, the worrying thing is, which was alluded to by one of the previous speakers, is that the Minister never saw fit to conduct a public transport policy review in advance of the review of the capital plan.  It is a case of seeing what crumbs from the table we will get from the capital plan and adjusting our transport policy accordingly.  We should publish an integrated national transport plan and the Minister should fight at Cabinet level to ensure the necessary funding is put in place to have a national integrated transport plan.  We should not devise a plan based on the level of funding that is available.  I call on Members to support this motion but, more importantly, I ask the Minister to ensure that he avails of the funding that is there at European level to invest in our public transport because without investment in public transport, it will not be fit for purpose.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000050#AAA00300","speaker":"1250"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1494440100,"counter":531,"content":"<p>Amendment put.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1494440100,"counter":532,"content":"<p>In accordance with Standing Order 70(2) and the report of the Business Committee dated 4 May 2017, the division is postponed until the weekly division time on Thursday, 18 May 2017.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000050#AAA00500","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Ireland and the Negotiations on the UK's Withdrawal from the EU: Statements (Resumed)","time":1494440100,"counter":533,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000050#AAA00600"},{"type":"speech","time":1494440100,"counter":534,"content":"<p>I welcome the draft guidelines published by the European Commission last week.  These reflect Ireland's position and take on board some additional concerns and issues that have been identified in the Government's document, which is currently under discussion.  As I have emphasised over the last year, the positions that are adopted by the UK in negotiations with the EU will be critical to achieving solutions to the issues that are raised on the island of Ireland and indeed between these islands.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland and our EU partners have explicitly prioritised these issues - the Border; the rights of Irish and, therefore, EU citizens in Northern Ireland; the gains of the peace process underpinned by the Good Friday Agreement; and the common travel area - and the UK must do the same.  I have also consistently stressed that the responsibility for political leadership in dealing with the challenges that Brexit raises for the island of Ireland is a shared one North and South.  While the talks process in Belfast has had to pause during the UK general election campaign, I remain available to engage bilaterally with the parties in the weeks ahead, particularly in respect of the unfolding Brexit negotiations.  I look forward to participating in the resumed talks process at Stormont after 8 June to support and facilitate the political parties there to reach agreement on a new power-sharing Executive.  I strongly urge all political parties to pursue through a new power-sharing Executive Northern Ireland's fundamental interest in dealing with the challenges posed by the withdrawal of the UK from the EU.  The importance of this for people's daily lives and for the future prospects in Northern Ireland cannot and must not be understated.  <\/p>  <p>  My focus at EU level and that of my Government colleagues will now be on working as part of the EU-27 team to advance our common goals within the complex and dynamic process of negotiation that lies ahead.  We have now reached a point where both the EU and the UK have set out their political objectives for the forthcoming Brexit process.  There are, of course, some differences of approach, which are inevitably receiving increased exposure against the backdrop of the election campaign in the UK, but I do not believe they are insurmountable.  I fully support the phased approach set out in the EU's guidelines, which will see an initial focus on the key withdrawal issues with a view to opening discussions on the future relationship when sufficient progress has been made.  This is fully in line with the Government's long-standing approach.  <\/p>  <p>  On the question of the rights of citizens, it is fair to say that the political will is clearly there on both the part of the UK and of the EU to provide clarity and legal certainty for the four million citizens concerned.  As set out in the comprehensive policy document, I believe that an agreement on the rights of citizens should be wide, ambitious and comprehensive.  Full account will also have to be taken of the fact that Irish citizens residing in Northern Ireland will continue to enjoy rights as EU citizens.<\/p><p>I acknowledge that this will be complicated.  However, early agreement on the principle is achievable.<\/p> <p> In the context of the UK's financial liabilities, I have consistently stressed that this is not about punishing the UK or issuing a bill for leaving.  Naturally, the European Union should expect the UK to honour any financial commitments into which it has already entered.<\/p> <p> We have a long and difficult road ahead of us.  The European Union has a positive and unified platform on which to advance its interests in the coming negotiations. The Government has established a clear and strategic approach that will enable it to pursue Ireland's goals and objectives as part of the EU team.  The European Union has agreed its position, the UK has set out its objectives and the Government has outlined its approach.  This is only the beginning of a long and difficult process, one in respect of which the Government is determined that the interests of Ireland and its people will be protected and advanced.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000050#AAA00700","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1494440700,"counter":536,"content":"<p>This debate concerns the Government&rsquo;s Brexit strategy, which was published a few days ago.  Brexit is widely acknowledged as the greatest economic threat Ireland has faced in decades.  The Taoiseach has said that the negotiations will be the most important in our history as an independent State.  Nearly half of exports from Irish-owned firms go to the UK.  Representatives from international airlines told us yesterday that without a transition agreement - the future conclusion of which is uncertain - planes in the UK could be grounded from March 2019 onwards.  That would in turn ground planes in Ireland because much of our air transport goes through the UK.  The Department of Finance and the Central Bank estimate that a hard Brexit, which we are now firmly in the throes of, could reduce trade to the UK by one third and result in 40,000 fewer jobs in Ireland.  Brexit threatens jobs in many sectors here, including retail, tourism and manufacturing.  It has the potential to wipe out Ireland&rsquo;s fishery sector and several parts of the agrifood sector.<\/p>  <p>  In his address yesterday, the Taoiseach stated that the Government has been planning for Brexit planning for two years.  Almost a year has passed since the Brexit vote.  Given that amount of time and the severity of the threat Brexit poses to Ireland, the Government&rsquo;s new Brexit strategy needed to be comprehensive, ambitious and strategic.  It is none of those things.  It contains no budgets, targets or timelines.  There is nothing tangible in it for the people throughout Ireland who are trying to figure out how they and their companies can prepare for Brexit.  It is a document bereft of political leadership, political direction or ambition in respect of how Ireland can and must respond to Brexit.  It is a well-written document created by the Civil Service, which is doing what it can in the vacuum created by Fine Gael&rsquo;s internal political considerations.  The first third of the document explains what Brexit is.  The second third lays out the Government&rsquo;s negotiating positions, which are already known.  The final third lists already published information and a speech the Taoiseach made in the Mansion House three months ago.  The document describes itself in its introduction as a position paper.  Irish businesses and farmers need a plan, not a position paper.  They need to know that the Government has their back, they need to know how it is going to help them and they need to know when that will happen.<\/p>  <p>  There has been much debate this evening on Northern Ireland and its strategic importance and rightly so.  The issue has been addressed by the Government and my colleagues.  I will focus on jobs and trade.  The Government position paper states that adaptive sectoral Brexit response plans will be developed by all Departments under the direction of the Department of the Taoiseach to mitigate emerging sectoral challenges.  It states that work is under way to develop options for improving the level of business planning advice available to SMEs.  For Irish businesses trading with the UK, Brexit is not something that is going to be agreed in March 2019, it is already happening and they need support now.<\/p>  <p>  How seriously is the Government taking Brexit in terms of supporting industry and protecting jobs?  The numbers tell a very interesting story.  The 2017 Action Plan for Jobs tells us that in order to mitigate against the impact of the UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU we have allocated additional resources in a number of areas, including an additional &euro;3 million to Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland.  Bord Bia got &euro;1.6 million.  That is &euro;4.6 million for three of the most important State agencies helping react and respond to Brexit.  In 2016, the D&aacute;il voted through Supplementary Estimates for health care.  This was money which no one had anticipated would be spent on health care until the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, said he needed it.  Almost &euro;800 million was voted through.  The Government allocated 171 times more money to health care than it has to the three agencies tasked mainly with dealing with Brexit and it tells us with a straight face that it is taking Brexit seriously.<\/p>  <p>  Irish companies, farmers and food processors need support now.  They need to know how to hedge currency, expand into new markets and create new products and services for those markets.  Brexit may result in risks to their supply chains, access to credit, cost of credit, the enforceability of contracts and the rights of employees.  They need to know how to address these risks and start planning for them today.<\/p>  <p>  The most recent data strongly suggests that while some Irish companies know what to do, many do not.  Last week, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation published a report on how Irish SMEs are reacting to Brexit.  One thousand SMEs were surveyed.  Fifteen out of every 20 Irish SMEs believe they will be harmed by Brexit.  However, only five companies in 20 intend taking action and only three companies in 20 have done so to date.  This suggests that half of Irish SMEs believe they will be damaged by Brexit but do not intend to do anything about that.  Why is that?  Many do not know what to do or they do not know how to do it.  For example, even if they know they should be hedging currency, they have no idea how to do so.  Some companies do not have the contacts, experience or resources to act.  The State needs to tell Irish companies that there is much they can and should do and that the State will help them do it.  While companies may need to consider reducing their exposure to Brexit, they might also be able to turn it into an opportunity.<\/p>  <p>  A Wicklow company in the building sector used to trade in the UK and Ireland.  It experienced rapid growth and was very successful.  After the Brexit referendum, its orders from the UK fell as builders there started to source UK-based products. The company carried out a feasibility study of various EU member states.  It discovered that its product fit perfectly into the market in the Netherlands.  The company worked with Enterprise Ireland, went to the Netherlands and conducted marketing there.  It is now selling its product in the Netherlands.  Due to this success, it has revised its growth projections upwards beyond what they would have been if there had been no Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  Companies are sourcing new supply chains and beginning to work with Enterprise Ireland.  They are learning how hedge sterling and are revising their UK pricing strategies.  However, many more companies need to take such action.<\/p>  <p>  I recently met diplomats from several EU member states, a number of whom told me the same thing, namely, that to date there has been little direct trade between Ireland and their countries, they have struggled to get high-level access to Ireland&rsquo;s State agencies and much of the trade between Ireland and their countries has been facilitated by UK companies.  However, their governments and industrial sectors are open for business and looking for trading partners.  They want to do business with Ireland.  We must use Brexit as the push it seems we need to forge these new alliances.<\/p>  <p>  We must remember that Brexit is not the only material threat to Irish jobs and trade.  There is also the erosion of our tax competitiveness.  President Macron of France has indicated that he will push for tax harmonisation among eurozone states.  The common consolidated corporate tax base, which could wipe billions off Ireland&rsquo;s corporate tax receipts, was being pushed by the European Commission within 48 hours of last year&rsquo;s Brexit referendum.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051000051#BBB00200","speaker":"1436"}]
