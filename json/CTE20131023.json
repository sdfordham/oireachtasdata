However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  They are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I advise witnesses that the opening statements they have submitted to the committee will be published on the committee website following this meeting.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or any official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p><p>  The matter we are discussing today is the general scheme of the Gender Recognition Bill 2013.  The general scheme was published last July by the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, following Cabinet approval.  It was referred to the committee for its consideration.  In order to assist the committee in considering the proposed legislation, members sought the views of interested individuals and organisations.  Ten written submissions were received.  To enable the committee to develop its understanding of the key issues identified in the process, it decided to hear evidence from key individuals and groups on the matter.  We could not invite everybody, but invited organisations and individuals with long-standing expertise in the area.  In the first of the hearings, which is today, we will hear from the Department of Social Protection, Transgender Equality Network Ireland, TransParenCI, BeLong To, LGBT Noise and Professor Donal O'Shea.<\/p><p>  Tomorrow we will have a similar arrangement.  We will have six witnesses and the meeting will start at 10 a.m.  We will not be able to do all our business today and will have to continue it tomorrow.  We must be fair to the witnesses who appear tomorrow.  I aim to finish the meeting at 3.30 p.m. because the room is booked only until then.  I ask everyone to keep to the time limits.  At 2 p.m. Senators may have to leave because the Taoiseach is addressing the Seanad today.  Over the two hearings, however, we will hear from the Senators.  I invite Ms Simonetta Ryan to contribute on behalf of the Department of Social Protection.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013102300003#C00200","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1382529600,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to attend to brief members on the general scheme of the Gender Recognition Bill 2013.  This is a very important Bill to provide for the solemn recognition by the State of a person's acquired gender for all purposes.  As members will note from my presentation, the provisions in the Bill contain some very significant advances on previous proposals, particularly in regard to the validation process.  In summary, the provisions in the Bill seek to be respectful to all concerned, to be prudent, to be practical and to preserve the integrity of State records.  This presentation will set out the background to the preparation of the legislation, outline the purpose of the Bill and summarise its provisions.<\/p><p>  With regard to the background, the lack of legal recognition for transgender persons is a significant and long-standing issue.  The High Court declared in 2008 that the State was in breach of its obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights because it did not have a process to legally recognise the acquired gender of transgender persons.  The interdepartmental gender recognition advisory group, GRAG, was established in 2010 to advise on the legislation required to give legal recognition to the acquired gender of transgender  persons.  There is a commitment in the programme for Government that transgender people will be provided with legal recognition.  In July 2011, the report of GRAG was published and the Government decided legislation would be drafted in line with its recommendations.  Since then, and building on this report, the Department of Social Protection engaged in a significant amount of consultation and research during the preparation of the legislation.  We have sought and considered the views of a range of organisations and individuals with experience and expertise in this area.  These include transgender persons and their representative organisations.<\/p><p>  While the Bill is in keeping with the general structure of the GRAG recommendations, it differs in a number of key aspects, which I will explain.<\/p><p>  Following Government approval, the general scheme of the Bill was published in 17 July 2013.  This legislation will give legal recognition to the acquired gender of transgender persons.  Formal legal recognition, through the issuing of a gender recognition certificate by the Department of Social Protection, will mean that the person's acquired gender will be fully recognised by the State for all purposes, including the right to marry or to enter a civil partnership in the acquired gender and the right to a new birth certificate.  The legislation will allow for applications from people with intersex conditions should they wish to apply.<\/p><p>  I will outline the main effects of the legislation for those wishing to have their gender recognised.  The Bill will provide for persons aged 18 and over and who are not married or in a civil partnership.  The person will be officially legally recognised by the State as being of the acquired gender from the date of the decision to issue the gender-recognition certificate.  The recognition will be for all purposes, including dealings with the State, public bodies and civil and commercial society.  The person whose acquired gender is recognised will be entitled to marry a person of the opposite gender or enter a civil partnership with a person of the same gender.  The decision will entitle persons whose births are registered in Ireland to a new birth certificate that shows the acquired gender and new names, if names are also changed.  Similarly, for those whose births are registered in the foreign birth register maintained by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the decision will entitle them to a new foreign birth registration certificate that shows the new gender and new names, if names are also changed.  All rights, responsibilities and consequences of actions by the person in their original gender prior to the date of recognition will remain unaffected.<\/p><p>  I will now summarise the main provisions of the Bill.  Heads 1 to 3 are standard provisions dealing with the Short Title of the Act, commencement orders, definitions of terms used in the Act and the power of the Minister to make regulations and to give effect to the Act.  Head 4 provides that the Minister for Social Protection shall be the decision-making authority in regard to granting approval for gender recognition certificates.  The Minister shall issue the certificate once the application meets all the qualification requirements.<\/p><p>  Head 5 sets out the conditions that a person is required to meet in order to qualify for a gender recognition certificate.  The person must meet one of three criteria: the birth must be registered in Ireland; one must have become an Irish citizen by having one's birth registered in the foreign births register maintained by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade; and one must be ordinarily resident in the State.  One must also be at least 18 years of age on the date of the application and must not be in an existing marriage or civil partnership.  In addition, one must meet the evidential requirements set out in head 6.<\/p><p>  In respect of the age limit, the Government, following consideration, decided that a minimum age of 18 should apply.  This is based on the recommendations made in the GRAG report.  The requirement that applicants for gender recognition must not be in an existing marriage or civil partnership was also considered by the Government.<\/p> <p>The requirement that applicants for gender recognition must not be in an existing marriage or civil partnership was also considered by Government and it was decided that due to the constitutional context, this current legislation could apply only to persons not in an existing marriage or civil partnership.<\/p><p> Head 6 addresses the evidence which must be supplied by the applicant to demonstrate that he or she meets the qualification requirements.  This includes a certificate from the register of births or from the foreign births register, proof of ordinary residence in Ireland and proof of identity in a form to be prescribed by the Minister.  The GRAG report had proposed that the person seeking recognition of his or her required gender would be required to make an application to a specially established expert panel, or gender recognition panel, which would examine the evidence and make a decision on each application.  Even in the couple of years since that report was published, thinking has developed, as have health care and related supports.  Real concerns were expressed by transgender people and others about the role of an expert panel in validating applications.  The Government has now decided that a panel will not be required.  Instead, there will be a declaration and validation process administered by the Department of Social Protection.  The aim is for a more progressive and dignified process which protects all concerned and ensures that the registration process will be robust.  It will be based on a statutory declaration to the Department by the person that he or she intends to live permanently in the acquired gender and this must be accompanied by a supporting letter of validation from a medical practitioner who is treating the person.  This letter will be short, in a standard format and will simply certify that the person is transitioning or has transitioned to the new gender.  The legislation will specify the type of medical practitioner providing the supporting letter.  He or she will be required to be registered on a specialist register maintained by the Medical Council and I envisage that the specialties specified will be endocrinologists, psychiatrists and paediatricians.  The legislation will also require that the medical practitioner is practising in the field of care and treatment of transgender and intersex people.  Under this new approach the application process will not require details of a person's care, including medical history or confirmation of a diagnosis.  Nor will it require that the person has lived in the acquired gender for a specific period of time after transition.  These are both significant changes to the original recommendations.<\/p><p> The GRAG report stated that the position of intersex people needed more research and was beyond the scope of the medical expertise available to it.  Therefore, it did not make any recommendation on the inclusion of intersex persons in this legislation.  The initial intention of the process, to include a panel and a medical diagnosis of gender identity disorder, known as GID, which no longer applies, would not have facilitated the inclusion of intersex persons.  However, the new model proposed in the general scheme of self declaration plus validation by a medical practitioner practising in the field would facilitate intersex persons being included under the scope of the legislation and allow them, if they wish, to apply to be recognised in the appropriate gender.  <\/p><p> Head 7 deals with applications from persons who have already had their acquired gender recognised in another jurisdiction.  Head 8 provides for the issuing of a gender recognition certificate by the Minister for Social Protection once the applicant has met the qualifying conditions.  Head 9 deals with the effects of gender recognition and provides for the fundamental principle of the legislation, which is that once a gender recognition certificate is issued to a person, the person's acquired gender is recognised.  Heads 10 to 16 deal with the establishment of the gender recognition register and the role of the registrar general in the process.  The register's purpose is to facilitate new birth registrations of persons who have been issued with a gender recognition certificate.  The register will not be open to public inspection or search.  It is envisaged that the process will operate as follows: the applicant applies for a gender recognition certificate and, if successful, will be notified accordingly by the Department of Social Protection.  The person will also be advised that the general register office will be in contact regarding the registration in the gender recognition register and the issuing of a new birth certificate.  In order to facilitate this, a copy of the gender recognition certificate and the required particulars for the registration shall be sent to the registrar general.  As part of the process of the registration in the gender recognition register, a link will be made between that entry and the corresponding original entry in the register of births or adopted children.  This link shall be maintained in a confidential manner.  Copies, certified copies or certified extracts of entries in the gender recognition register shall not be identifiable as being from that register as opposed to being from the register of births or adopted children.  However, it should be noted that absolute confidentiality in relation to the register is not feasible as birth certificates are public records.  While it would be possible to have some system for blocking the issuing of the original birth or adoption certificates, and this is provided for in the heads of the Bill --- <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013102300003#C00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Simonetta Ryan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382530200,"counter":10,"content":"<p>If I can just stop Ms Ryan for a moment.

Head 20 makes it an offence to knowingly provide false information.  As I said earlier, formal recognition is for all State purposes.  A number of these heads could be described as fail-safe heads, to provide for contingencies that may arise.  Head 21 deals with parenthood and provides that a change in a person's recognised gender shall not change the responsibilities of that person as a parent.

I will start by thanking the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, for progressing this issue with the publication of the draft heads of a Bill and for referring it to this committee for consideration.  I would also like to thank Deputy Tuffy for inviting us to speak here today.  I thank the committee members for their careful consideration of the issues that will be raised over the coming days.<\/p><p>  In May of this year, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, addressed a conference entitled A Europe of Equal Citizens hosted as part of the Irish EU Presidency.  The Minister's speech dealt with the ways in which legislation affects the everyday lives of communities.  He spoke of how legislation, justice bodies and society as a whole must work effectively and responsibly to meet the needs and the rights of citizens.  In the past, successive Irish Governments have failed to provide true equality, often having to be dragged through the courts to do the right thing.  The Minister's speech was a true reflection on this history.  In fact, Dr. Lydia Foy first asked for her birth certificate in 1993, 20 years ago and it has been six years since Ireland was found in breach of its positive obligations under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.<\/p><p>  Legislating for gender recognition is an opportunity to do the right thing.  Transgender people in Ireland experience a significant level of marginalisation and stigmatisation.  Our community faces some of the highest levels of discrimination in employment, education and health care, which relegates many of us to the fringes of society.  This Government has an opportunity to significantly improve the everyday lives of the transgender community with the immediate introduction of inclusive, progressive gender recognition legislation that is based on human rights principles.  This will also send a clear message that Government sees transgender people as valuable, contributing members of Irish society.  During the course of these two days we implore the committee to seriously consider the needs of the community this legislation proposes to serve, the Irish transgender community.  It is imperative that this committee and those legislating listen to these voices and suggest amendments to the legislation that reflect our real lives.<\/p><p>  The draft heads of Bill is a significant step forward from the GRAG report from 2011 and we commend the Department of Social Protection on all of its work in this area.<\/p> <p>However, while it provides some improvements, there are still significant challenges with the proposed legislation that will infringe on the rights, privacy and dignity of the trans community.  In consultation with the trans community and their families, we have a summary of key issues we ask the committee to consider.<\/p><p> First, on a physician's statement attesting to identity, the proposed requirement that a primary treating physician shall confirm the person has transitioned or is transitioning to their acquired gender will be onerous for many members of the trans community.  However, the physician's statement model means that access to a gender recognition certificate is still based on interventions by medical professionals.  There are not many experts in this area in Ireland which puts this process in the hands of a few practitioners and, hence, creates a panel.  The use of the term &quot;transition&quot; excludes intersex persons whose bodies simply develop naturally.  The same language also infers medical treatment of hormones or surgery, and thus may be even more restrictive than a criteria of diagnosis, which would not require any physical intervention.  Some trans people may not be able to undergo a medical transition due to age or an existing medical condition that prevents treatment.<\/p><p> Appearing before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children in July 2013, Dr. Philip Crowley, Health Service Executive, national director of quality and patient safety, stated:<blockquote>The HSE endorses a gender recognition process which places the responsibility for self-declaration on the applicant rather than on the details of a medical certificate\/diagnosis.  In doing so the emphasis is placed on the process of legal recognition of that self-declaration as opposed to the legal recognition of the medical certificate and\/or diagnosis.  The HSE considers this process to be simpler, fairer, pragmatic and may be easier to legislate for as it takes account of both transgender and intersex people with differing backgrounds and contexts.<\/blockquote> The uncoupling of health and legal rights is being called for in human rights discourse in Europe and beyond.  The Department of Social Protection has received letters from trans health experts across the world.  They state unanimously that appropriate trans health care is vital and that legal gender recognition is a human right and should have nothing to do with medical care pathways.<\/p><p> I sit before the committee as a proud Irish woman with a transgender history.  In all aspects of my life, I am female.  I am an active member of my family, my community.  I am a taxpayer, employed as a consultant in the construction industry.  Legal recognition of my gender identity should not be bound to proof by a third party.  We, as individuals, are all arbiters of our own gender identities.  TENI, Transgender Equality Network Ireland, recommends that each person's self-defined gender identity should be fully respected and legally recognised by the State.  TENI recommends adopting the existing and robust model of declaration as utilised in the deed poll process.<\/p><p> Only people who are at least 18 years of age will be entitled to apply for gender recognition.  TENI recommends setting the age for applying independently at 16 years or older and allowing parents and guardians to apply for legal recognition on behalf of people under the age of 16 years.<\/p><p> Only people who are single will be eligible to apply for gender recognition.  Both at the international and European level, human rights discourse affirms that divorce should not play a role in the legal recognition of gender identity.  In Ireland, there are families that exist where one spouse has transitioned.  Despite adversity, these individuals have stayed together and will now be forced to choose between their families and the legal recognition of their true identities.  Article 41 of Constitution is supposed to guard against this.<\/p><p> Trans people are vibrant members of society.  We belong to families.  We are parents, children and siblings.  We are active members of our communities.  We work and go to school, we pay taxes and we are proud of our country.  We agree with the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, that it is time legislation speaks to the needs of the community it serves.  Now is the time to introduce legislation that provides the trans community with the possibility of leading private, dignified and respectful lives as active members of society.  It is time the trans community was allowed to step out from the shadows.  We ask the committee to carefully consider the issues we raised and take an active part in suggesting amendments to the heads of the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013102300004#D00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Sara Phillips","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1382530800,"counter":17,"content":"<p>TransParenCI is a support group for families and parents of transgender people.  I am the mother of a transgender child aged 16 who is currently in fifth year at secondary school.  He faces all of the normal challenges of being a teenager which are compounded by being transgender.  While my son is doing well at school and is accepted by his peers, this is due in part to the fact he is of strong character and, partly, because the school he attends has been very understanding of his situation.  The school, however, is in no way obliged to acknowledge his preferred gender.  He is totally at the mercy of their discretion and of their personal feelings and beliefs.<\/p><p>  I understand other transgender children have not been so lucky.  Many transgender children feel the need to hide who they are in school.  Others cannot hide and, due to lack of acceptance, become isolated and, therefore, leave school early.<\/p><p>  My son recently completed transition year in which he had to partake in many gender-based activities such as discussions on personal hygiene and contraception advice given to groups separated by their gender.  He found this awkward and opted not to partake of them at all.  He was facilitated by the school but again it was at its discretion.<\/p><p>  His female name still continues to be called on the roll which is a constant reminder not only to him but to his peers that he is different.  He will of course be applying for courses shortly through the Central Applications Office and registering for his leaving certificate examination, all of which will be applied for in his female gender.  This will, unfortunately, follow him through to college where he will have to explain his situation to a new set of people.<\/p><p>  The formal education system plays an important role in determining what life chances are available to us.  It is important everyone gets the opportunity, or more importantly the equality of opportunity, to engage with the education system.  Education is an accurate predictor of future incomes and quality of life.  The longer people remain in the education system, the more education and qualifications we obtain.  It is therefore imperative that everyone has an equal opportunity to access the system.  If a transgender child applies to an all-boys school, he may be refused entry because the birth certificate states he is in fact female.  Similarly, schools are not obliged to provide suitable changing facilities for our transgender students.  They often simply do not know what to do about it.  Without proper legislation in this area, schools have no guidelines.  Very often personal beliefs and prejudices become the school&rsquo;s path of action.  Through amending this legislation, to include those under 18, the Oireachtas can remedy this situation.  Accordingly, the education system and service providers can educate themselves and put clear guidelines in place.<\/p><p>  It has been accepted by the HSE that transgender children between 12 and 18 years will be able to access health care on the basis of need.  Without accompanying gender legislation, they will carry conflicting documents and will, therefore, be incorrectly identified and subject to further discrimination.  The Ombudsman for Children clearly advises the current proposals will not operate in children&rsquo;s or young people&rsquo;s interest nor vindicate their rights.<\/p><p>  I understand the need to safeguard young people under 18.  This is possibly the thinking behind excluding them from this legislation.  However, this is grossly underestimating the parents of these young people and their ability to safeguard their interests at all times.  I cannot imagine that any parent would consider changing the gender of their child&rsquo;s birth certificate without having explored every other avenue first.  The Argentinian and Maltese Governments have already acknowledged this and included their children in their recent gender legislation.  Does that imply they are better suited to safeguard the interests of their children than we are?<\/p> <p>This legislation has the ability to enhance and make a real difference in the life of my son.  It will allow him to participate in society feeling valued and allow his many other attributes to shine through.  Transgender is part of who he is, but it is not what defines him.  Please allow him to transition to adulthood with a little more dignity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013102300005#E00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Catherine Cross","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1382531400,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I am a young transgender man and peer educator with BeLonG To youth services, which is the national youth organisation for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender young people.

As well as direct youth services, we are also engaged in national policy, training and awareness-raising, especially related to tackling homophobic and transphobic bullying in schools.<\/p><p>  We very much appreciate this opportunity to speak to the committee.  Our comments today are based on our work over the past ten years with the growing numbers of transgender young people.  In 2012, BeLonG To&rsquo;s national network of LGBT youth services provided individual and group support to 47 transgender young people throughout Ireland, including 28 in Dublin.  So far in 2013, we have provided support to 42 transgender young people in Dublin alone.<\/p><p>  BeLonG To strongly welcomes the Government&rsquo;s introduction of legislation to legally recognise the preferred gender of transgender people.  Although we agree with TENI&rsquo;s broader recommendations, BeLonG To&rsquo;s comments are focused on one topic, namely, the age criteria for gender recognition.  BeLonG To is very concerned the blanket exclusion of those under 18 from the gender recognition Bill contravenes the spirit of Irish commitments to the rights of children.  It will also expose transgender young people to an increased risk of mental health difficulties and bullying and reduced educational attainment and school completion.  Transgender young people have told BeLonG To it would be too painful to wait until they are 18 to apply for gender recognition.  Significantly, they fear it would set in stone the very unwelcome climate they face in schools.  For example, transgender youth are told to hide their identities, are not allowed to use their preferred pronouns or names, and are not allowed to wear the uniforms or use the toilets or changing rooms which reflect their preferred gender.<\/p><p>  Further to the recommendations in our submission to the committee, BeLonG To strongly welcomes the advice of the Ombudsman for Children on the gender recognition Bill.  The Office of the Ombudsman for Children completed a thorough review of international and domestic law and concluded the exclusion of those under 18 would not be in keeping with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, the European Convention on Human Rights or the Irish Constitution.  In paragraph 1.6 of its advice, the Office of the Ombudsman for Children states the gender recognition Bill as drafted is unlikely to safeguard children.  We also concur with its advice the age criterion be removed from the Bill; parents or guardians be enabled to apply for gender recognition certificates on behalf of their children; and young people over the age of 16 be enabled to apply for gender recognition certificates on their own behalf.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013102300006#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Andy Mannion"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1382531400,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I am a transgender ally, activist and educator with LGBT Noise, which is a non-party political, voluntary, independent group, and we thank the committee for this opportunity.

We are all assigned a sex at birth, and we all have a gender identity, which is an internal sense of gender which may or may not correspond with our anatomy.  Our gender identities are individual and personal and we all have one.  Each one of us is the most qualified expert on our own gender identity.  <\/p><p>  This legislation is about gender identities.  It is a way to legally reflect a person's internal sense of gender when it does not fit the norm.  Simply put, anyone who has ever questioned the sex he or she was assigned at birth might look to avail of this legislation.  Individuals hold all the knowledge of their gender.  Gay and lesbian people do not need a doctor to confirm their identity when entering civil partnership.  Marriages, drivers licences, passports or any legal function do not require medical confirmation.  We are the experts on our own identities.<\/p><p>  With all due respect to the medical profession and all it undoubtedly does for transgender and intersex people, requiring a physician's statement to confirm a transition is stigmatising and degrading.  It implies individuals are not experts on their experiences and unnecessarily involves the medical profession in what is solely a legal issue.  What is more, the concept of transitioning does not apply to all, and in particular intersex people do not transition.  Many will be unfit for hormones or surgery due to medical or age contraindications, while others simply do not want a medical intervention.  Their bodily integrity and right to determine their own identity needs to be upheld.<\/p><p>  The specialty group of medical expertise on this issue in Ireland is tiny and undoubtedly has a vested interest in arguing for the involvement of the medical profession.  Surgeries and hormones do not determine a person's identity.  If someone does not medically transition or does not wish to engage in medical procedures his or her gender identity is still valid.  Gender recognition is about legal rights and self-determined identities.  It has nothing to do with medicine.  Other jurisdictions have made moves to delink the medical from the legal and this has been recommended by the former Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights and by the world professional association for transgender health.<\/p><p>  Gender recognition is a process with regard to birth certificates.  It should be as simple and straightforward as any birth, death or marriage registry.  The heads of the Bill propose the Minister for Social Protection as a decision-making authority.  This will create an unnecessary layer of bureaucracy and contribute to the sentiment that transgender people are not the experts on their own identities.  We recommend the entire process be put under the Registrar General who, it is envisaged, would maintain the gender recognition register.  This would be the least expensive, most simple and most humane option.<\/p><p>  The heads of the Bill completely ignore people under the age of 18.  Transgender youth face bullying and discrimination constantly.  Is it right to legislate to put these vulnerable young people in a situation which increases their marginalisation?  Ms Ryan stated intersex people are included in the heads, but the language is unclear and it excludes by the language of transition.  Many people enter marriage before realising their transgender identity.  Despite the odds, some of these marriages remain loving and supportive.  The requirement that an applicant is single effectively forces divorce and puts people in the impossible situation of choosing between their family and their gender identity.  Our Constitution's special protection of marriage seems not to be extended to one of society's most marginalised groups.<\/p><p>  The heads propose prohibiting transgender people from sport.  Regulation of sport is not a Government responsibility and this will create a new discrimination which did not exist previously.  Legislation should protect people and promote inclusion, not legalise discrimination.  It is imperative to protect the people of Ireland with this legislation and to do so with respect.<\/p> <p>Respect means seeing transgender and intersex people as human beings, diverse people with real lives and families and as the experts in their own experiences.<\/p><p> Lydia Foy first requested an amendment to her birth certificate 20 years ago and still she waits.  Ireland is one of the last countries in Europe to enact this legislation.  It is important that we grasp this opportunity to listen to transgender people, to learn from our neighbours and to get this right the first time.  If we do not, there will be court cases, further work and additional cost to the State.   I urge the committee to make strong recommendations to the Minister for a process that is simple, speedy and respectful.  Members should not take it from me; they should listen to transgender people, as they are the experts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013102300006#F00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Leslie Sherlock","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382532000,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I would like to clarify who has been invited to appear.

I have listened with great interest to all the presentations, which have been informative to me and, I hope, to the process.  I am an adult endocrinologist and, therefore, I deal with adults who have gender dysphoria.  I have liaised with our faculty of paediatrics and with one of the UK experts in the paediatric management of gender dysphoria as part of my ongoing work.  Numbers were alluded to earlier and the group is not capturing everyone.  It needs to capture all because there are 50 new cases in the paediatric age group in Ireland every year.  Gender dysphoria has replaced the term \"gender identity disorder\" in the recently revised American Psychiatric Association's classification of disorders.  \"Disorder\" has been removed from the terminology and there was talk that the entire condition would be removed from the classification of diseases, which would have been seen as a positive step by many but which might have left it without a medical management framework.  A great deal of medical input is required for many of these individuals.<\/p><p>  In Ireland the diagnosis is confirmed by a mental health professional - a psychiatrist or psychologist - and then there is a referral for hormonal therapy which is available here.  Medical services are not wide enough in this country yet but they are improving.  After approximately two years on hormonal therapy and-or living in role, the individuals are referred for surgery.  Some surgery is available in Ireland - breast and uterine surgery - but full complex surgical reassignment is carried out either in the UK or Belgium through the HSE treatment abroad scheme.  The waiting time is approximately two years from referral.  We have had 246 patients through our adult service in Loughlinstown hospital over the past ten years, of whom 25% are or have been married.<\/p><p>  The learning in our unit from the past ten years that might inform the proposed legislation is that it is in the best interests of this overall group of patients that a medical supporting statement form a part of the validation process.  It would have to be minimally intrusive and from a recognised, regulated specialist in the area.  This would protect a minority of patients within the overall group who think they have the condition but who do not.  Self-declaration alone would support this minority in what is a personality disorder and potentially worsen their outcome.  Legislating for any minority is difficult.  In legislating for gender dysphoria, we need to be aware of the potential impact on a minority within that cohort that I have seen over the past ten years have bad outcomes.  Many of the patients with gender dysphoria who attend our clinic do not have contact with other transgender patients or support groups because they want to move forward exclusively in their preferred gender.  The issue of age in this legislation is important from a constitutional point of view but the most important age from a medical point of view is puberty, which obviously cannot be legislated for.  Before puberty, there is a reported 20% desist rate, which is change of mind after the process moves forward.  Following puberty this falls rate to less than 5%.<\/p><p>  Transitioning and the diagnosis of gender dysphoria does not require hormones or surgery and any letter of support would not have to include that stage or concept.  My reading of the current heads is that the intersex group, which is extraordinarily complex, would be comfortably catered for within the legislation, as drafted.  I am grateful for the opportunity to comment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013102300007#G00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Donal O'Shea"},{"type":"speech","time":1382532000,"counter":24,"content":"<p>Before proceeding to questions, I pointed out earlier that these proceedings are being broadcast on channel 207 on UPC.

The Bill is welcome and, hopefully, this process will inform the Department and the Minister to make the changes required in order that we can have the best legislation at the end of this.  This is a new legislative process, which has only been followed on a number of occasions and, therefore, it is welcome that both departmental officials and stakeholders are present.<\/p><p>  I have a number of questions for the Department, the first of which I presume will be asked by a number of members.

I welcome the Bill.  I commend the Minister, Deputy Burton, on being the first Minister to introduce legislation in this area.  It is important to acknowledge that before we begin to critique the Bill.<\/p><p>  I concur with the concern expressed by Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh about a number of provisions in the Bill.  All transgender people should be entitled to legal protection regardless of their age or marital status or whether they are in a civil partnership.  We are coming to the issue at a late stage compared to other European countries and we have an opportunity to learn from their experiences and get it right.  We can start with best practice rather than starting where countries were ten years or 20 years ago.  The witnesses have eloquently outlined that the lack of protection for young people has a huge impact.  This committee is responsible for both social protection and education.  It is difficult to hear about the day-to-day obstacles young people have experienced in schools, which must have an impact on their education.  That is something we as a committee cannot ignore.  For me, it is a strong argument for adopting the changes that have been proposed by the Ombudsman for Children.<\/p><p>  The main area about which I wish to ask questions is the forced divorce requirement.  I will put them to the Department as its representatives are only present for this initial session.  Some couples perhaps do not survive the gender transition and go their separate ways, but many others stay together.  Other countries have taken a different route.  Challenges have resulted in cases being heard by the European Court of Human Rights and in some countries forced divorce requirements have been struck down.  Two main issues arise.  As TENI pointed out in some of its correspondence, there is a very good chance legally that if a couple has survived the process of transition and both parties are happy to stay together, a court might decide that they do not satisfy the criteria for divorce because they could not be considered to be totally irreconcilable if they want to stay together and keep their family together.  Therefore, there is a risk in that regard.  If divorce does apply and people are able to get one, it is problematic to force a family to split up.  The Department&rsquo;s spokesperson, Simonetta Ryan, referred briefly to the constitutional context as the reason for the requirement.  I would welcome more details on that.  If anything, there is a constitutional context for protecting the family, which is strongly protected in the Constitution, as is marriage.  The proposed approach could be constitutionally problematic.  I have read persuasive legal opinion that to force a family to break up would be tantamount to an external group imposing divorce on a family.<\/p><p>  Based on the work that has been done by Fergus Ryan in particular, who wrote a very good article on the matter, such a provision could be legally unnecessary because in Irish family law in general the validity of a marriage is based on the status of the people at the time they enter into it.  The issue is whether one was capable of entering at that time into a valid marriage.  It is arguable on that basis that it is legally unnecessary to force people to divorce many years later if at the time they got married they were capable of contracting a marriage.  Putting aside the issue of marriage equality, which I hope will be dealt with in the near future, even before any of that is examined it is unnecessary if the marriage was valid at the time it was contracted.<\/p><p>  Will the Department share its legal advice with us?  It is not good enough to say there is a constitutional context.  We really need to see the meat of the advice because all of us as Members want to do the right thing legally in the sense that when we pass legislation we want it to be able to stand up to scrutiny in the courts.  We must have the information in order to judge the issue properly.  Contrasting opinions have been put forward by Fergus Ryan and FLAC.  There is a letter from the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights to the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, on the ECHR context of all of this.  It is a big legal issue and for us to discuss it meaningfully as a committee we should all be working off the same information.  I therefore make that request to the Department in particular.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013102300008#H00300","speaker":"1154"},{"type":"speech","time":1382532600,"counter":29,"content":"<p>I will not take long because most questions have been asked about the legal issues and there is no point in my repeating them.  I thank the witnesses for attending.  I work off my gut instinct and when something is right, I know it is right.  From recent meetings and from talking to people I am aware of the reality of the situation and it is for society to address the reality rather than trying to find barriers to prevent it.<\/p><p>  I thank the witnesses from the Department of Social Protection for attending.  The Ombudsman for Children has clearly said that the vindication of young people&rsquo;s rights is at issue.  It is the responsibility of society to protect all children, including those between the age of 16 and 18.  It has been said that in this instance the legislation could have the opposite effect.  I agree with the Ombudsman for Children's statement that one cannot just put a blanket ban on gender recognition for 16 to 18 year olds.  Provision must be made for them in the best possible way by working with the community of transgender and inter-sex people on how to proceed.  The Ombudsman for Children and others present have made positive proposals about how to deal with the issue.<\/p><p>  I have a question for Professor Donal O&rsquo;Shea.  I argued strongly, even on the abortion legislation, about the impact of involving people in the mental health service in order to assess their situation and whether they have a right to access a service.  The same should hold true in this area.  One could ask why we are putting people from the transgender and inter-sex community into the mental health services.  Surely as soon as a person indicates that he or she is not in the correct body then he or she should be in contact with the medical service or his or her parents should be in contact with a GP or other medical expert.  The situation develops over a period but it can start at a very young age.  It is clear that a person is moving in a certain direction and that certain changes take place in their bodies, which can culminate when a person reaches the age of 16 years to 18 years.  I will be guided by what the experts say but I ask why there is not a specialist area to assist young people who are going through such an experience.  It will be clear from the parents, the young person and those involved in the medical profession that the situation has evolved without requiring a report from a mental health expert or psychologist.  That does not fit well with me.  I would welcome the view of witnesses in that regard.  It is also a question for the HSE in terms of linking in with the specialists, parents and children who are affected.<\/p> <p>I do not think it is the right policy as it goes against what I believe is the right approach, from listening to the experiences of people in the transgender community.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013102300008#H00400","speaker":"1032","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382533200,"counter":31,"content":"<p>I will invite the Department officials to respond first.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013102300009#J00200","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1382533200,"counter":32,"content":"<p>The Bill has not yet been drafted by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.

Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh also mentioned the question of age, as have a number of other people.  The recommendations in the scheme of this Bill are based on the recommendations of the GRAG report, with additional changes for which the Minister has received Cabinet approval, particularly with regard to validation.  The position on age is the recommendation in the GRAG report and it is based on a kind of prudent approach.  Professor O'Shea has also talked about the difficulties for young people and the fact that in some cases people may change their minds.  I accept this is a difficult area.

In such circumstances, if there is a change of mind, puberty has still begun.  In 20% of cases in which there is a diagnosis before puberty there is a change of mind.  One needs access to paediatric treatment for this condition, but that is rudimentary in this country.  The service we provide for adults is inadequate but the service for children is really minimal.  Other people here today are agitating for such a service to be developed.  The definition used would be the definition in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, or DSM-5, by the American Psychiatric Association, which is newly revised as of August of this year.  This definition separates adults from children and adolescents for the first time.  That needs to happen so that treatment pathways can be put in place for both.<\/p><p>  On the issue of forced divorce, we have very happily married couples who are expecting children or who have young children and who are very committed to each other.  This will force change, because one cannot force divorce.  The Constitution will have to be changed to reflect that.<\/p><p>  The labelling of the condition as a mental health issue is significant and contentious.  The fact that homosexuality was only removed from the DSM in the 1970s is a very good yardstick of how offensive that whole area is and can be.  The situation with gender dysphoria is that a lot of medical input is required and that needs to be facilitative rather than a barrier.  For a medical condition to access treatment it has to exist as a medical condition.  If the condition is taken out of the medical arena completely and one asks the HSE to please treat this thing that does not exist as a condition, the treatment will not be given.  The only way we will get traction with the health service is if it is a condition with an internationally recognised treatment pathway which is not adequately provided in this country for adults and is barely being provided at paediatric level.  Therefore, we need to do better in the medical sphere.  I believe that in 20 years' time we will be talking about the removal of gender from the DSM-5 classification, because it very nearly came out this time.  It is in the classification, however, and we will have to work within that system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013102300009#J00600","nonspeaker":"Professor Donal O'Shea"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1382533200,"counter":36,"content":"<p>I would like to respond.  To be clear, we are talking about two things here.  This is a legal right, and the medical discussion, while very relevant and pertinent, is actually a separate issue.  Beyond that, the psychiatric debate is again a separate issue.  It seems as though we are all in agreement that the psychiatric diagnosis is not perhaps the most respectful or relevant.  It is a mental condition and I think there is a distinction to be made between mental conditions and medical conditions.  For example, pregnancy can be diagnosed and can be treated as medical but it does not have to be a mental condition.  I agree with that.  I also think the statistics on regret are irrelevant.  Marriage has also a rate of regret; people go for divorce because they regret having married or they change their minds.  The same argument can be made for this in that it is a legal right.  I agree there will be a percentage of people who regret their decision, but instead we should look at the percentage of people who do not regret it.  Seventy-six percent of young trans people in the UK knew of their trans identity by the time they left primary school.  The vast majority of trans people are aware and certain of their trans identity by the age of three.  I think that is where we need to concentrate.  We cannot legislate for the few outliers; we need to legislate for the majority of people who will be very certain of their gender identity at a very young age.  We have a responsibility to protect them from the harm that results from not being able to have that identity confirmed.

I echo Ms Sherlock's comments on the medical and legal pathways, as we must be very careful and separate those.  We are not saying within the transgender community that the medical system does not need mental health support with regard to these issues and we clearly need to have that sort of support in order to provide a medical pathway.  It is also crucial to remember that many of us transgender people, when we get to the point of deciding or realising that we are \"trans\", are three, five or six years old.  There are those who deal with other issues, and that is what the medical health system is for.  Nevertheless, providing us with legal recognition should not be predicated on that.  With all due respect, men or women seeking medical assistance do not have to prove they are male or female; they just get medical assistance and we must be careful in realising that.<\/p><p>  There was a point about marriage and I echo the comments of Senator Power.  The marriage issue concerns the point of contract, and at that point two people are legally recognised as male and female.  For the State to tell the people they must break that contract is a travesty.  There is no provision within the Bill for those people who cannot therefore access gender recognition because they decide that they need to keep a family together if they are happily married.  There is no provision for the possibility after a person has transitioned, having had surgery and mental intervention.  They cannot continue to keep their passport or driving licence in the female gender, as it was in my case, for example.  They are left in limbo.<\/p><p>  We all look forward to the day we can see same-sex marriage introduced but the most recent referendum indicates we need to await a referendum, and who is to say it will be passed?  Are we therefore asking married couples to wait for what could be another 20 years for same-sex marriage to be allowed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013102300010#K00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Sara Phillips"},{"type":"speech","time":1382533800,"counter":43,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for the presentation, and much of what I was going to say has already been ably put forward by colleagues on the committee.  It is great to see such a uniformity of views around the issues at hand.<\/p><p>  I welcome the general scheme of the Bill and there is much to recommend it.  Much of it is broadly welcome but it comes around to the same issues, and I may reiterate what has already been said.  The age issue will be a problem but this Bill needs surgery and not butchery.  Nevertheless, if the Bill remains as it is, it will open many legalistic and constitutional minefields, and it could spend much time in the courts.  We can view this as a rolling process and work with the Bill as it goes along rather than viewing it as an end product that must be accepted or rejected.  It would be better if we worked in that manner.<\/p><p>  The divorce issue is constitutionally questionable.  As others have stated, the family is at the heart of the Irish Constitution and suggesting that the State would force a family to break up and divorce is questionable.  I can see a case being taken at the High Court or Supreme Court and being won easily in that respect, although I am not a constitutional lawyer.  That is taking into account the way the Constitution is written and the interpretation of the Constitution through the years.  As Ms Phillips has correctly stated, a referendum can be accepted or rejected so it is a constitutional nonsense to wait for same-sex marriage to be accepted.  The idea that the State would force a couple to dissolve marriage against their will would not have constitutional standing.  Every piece of legislation going through these Houses must adhere to the Constitution.<\/p><p>  I am taken with the presentations from TENI, LGBT Noise and other groups with regard to children's issues.  I am also mindful of the advice from the Ombudsman for Children.  There is a legalistic problem with the age provision, and many would advocate that there should not be an age barrier at all.  The recommendations for the group between 16 and 18 are highly questionable.  Are we really advocating a difference of opinion between somebody's gender identity and what somebody else says?  That could give rise to much legal and constitutional argument.<\/p><p>  Perhaps the next point is minor in the legislation but the piece regarding sport borders on bizarre.  Who are we, as a legislative body, to recommend to sporting organisations who can play a sport.  That is a strange, odd, unnecessary and slightly offensive provision.  We are still trying to amend legislation from 12 years ago that was introduced in good faith to allow certain bodies the right to \"discriminate\" on the basis of religious ethos in employment law.<\/p> <p>We are changing this because the context has changed.  Such provisions are unnecessary, bizarre and offensive.  In as much as it is very strange for the State to require a couple who are very committed to each other to divorce in these circumstances, for it to specify what sport a person can or cannot play is objectionable.  I am interested in hearing the reaction of delegates to what my colleagues and I have said because we are very much in agreement.  The broad point I want to make is that my hope is that we have started a process and that we do not have a <i>fait accompli.  <\/i>I hope we have a rolling process in order that the Bill can evolve and be amended and changed.  Instead of the Government making a definitive decision on the statutory age, I hope there is leeway for it to be altered.  If the Bill remains as is, without the surgery we can do here, it will be butchered when a case is taken in a constitutional court.  We should prevent such butchery from happening by amending it here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013102300010#K00500","speaker":"1018","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382534400,"counter":45,"content":"<p>I thank the delegates for their presentations.  This is a welcome process as it is a healthy way of shaping the legislation.  I hope we will see this process used more in the future.  I concur with most of what has been said.<\/p><p>  On the issue of age, I agree with the points made.  If a person makes a mistake or decides later that he or she has made a mistake, is it possible to change this under the provisions of the Bill?  Would this be a safety net for those under 18 years?  Would such a provision assist in that regard?  We should consider setting the age at 16 years.  However, in respect of the other proposal in relation to parents and guardians, would providing for an opportunity to undo the gender change at a later stage not be a safety net to address that problem?<\/p><p>  The divorce requirement is analogous to being in Dublin and going east to get to Galway.  One will eventually arrive but what state will one be in when one gets there?  It is the long way around.  It is glaringly obvious that this will open up the Bill to constitutional challenge and will undermine it from the start.  It seems extraordinary to force people to take that path.

While it is progress, there are still lots of problems.  To return to a point I made in my opening statement, many issues speak to the everyday lives we have to live.  The issues with the proposed legislation would still continue to cause day-to-day problems for transgender individuals and also transgender children.<\/p><p>  On the question of age, we need to remember that at the age of 16 years an individual can actually access medical treatment of his or her own volition without parental consent.  If a person accesses this medical treatment, he or she is left in limbo, in which the person's body has changed physically but this physical change is not recognised.  I facilitate the transgender sports group in Dublin to which many young people come regularly.  I reported a story previously in which the Passport Office refused a new passport for a young man because it was not considered he was in transition long enough, yet he was clearly masculine.   If I stood him in front of members today, nobody would recognise that he was a transgender individual.  The hormone treatments may act quickly and the individual's appearance may change very quickly.  When such individuals go to school with the changed physical attributes of male or female and that is not recognised in the education system, it causes a major problem.  From the point of view of being progressive, the legislation is definitely the next step.  I echo the comments of members, including Deputies Brendan Griffin and<b><\/b>Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, that it needs to be a process.  This needs to be fixed and adjusted.  It is crucial that age is identified as an issue because I knew my gender when I was five years old.

Since we as a family have accepted his gender, it has made a difference in his demeanour.  He is confident and doing well at school.  Imagine if the State could recognise and value him, that would make a difference to the career choices he makes.  If one does not feel valued, one will not do well.  The choices one makes between the ages of 16 and 18 years have consequences for the rest of one's life and one's name and gender go on documents that follow one for the rest of one's life.

I do not think anyone would believe that the introduction of legislation is not progressive, as Ireland is one of the very last countries in Europe to introduce such legislation.  What is being proposed in the heads of the Bill is more in line with legislation enacted in Europe in the 1970s and 1980s.  Do we really want to introduce legislation that we know from the experience in other countries is outdated?  The heads of the Bill are certainly more progressive than the proposals from the gender recognition advisory group.  The difficulty is that the views of the medical profession have equal if not greater weight than those of transgender people.  Let me reiterate this is a legal not a medical process.  The HSE treatment pathway for transgender people needs to be looked at.  That is probably an entirely separate process and is a job for a new committee.  I do not think we are disputing that it needs some attention.<\/p><p>  The question I put to members is to consider what harm is caused by lowering the age of acquired gender from 18 years to 16 years so that young people can have their gender recognised and be protected.  What harm is caused by allowing what is realistically a tiny minority within a minority to remain in their marriages?  It will not hurt anyone else to allow these families to stay as a family unit and simultaneously to recognise the gender identity of the transgender partner.  What is the harm of allowing a person to self determine his or her identity without the need of a stamp of approval from the Department of Social Protection or a letter from a doctor?  Getting married, or getting a passport is a legal process, and it should be afforded to anyone regardless of mental health, marital status and age.  It is a basic human right. <\/p><p>  It is great the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton has brought the process of acquired gender recognition forward.  It was not instigated in Ireland but came from Europe.  We are one of the last countries to implement such legislation.<\/p><p>  We have to consider what harm results from introducing legislation to recognise transgender people in a more inclusive and respectful way that protects them in contrast to what harm results if we do not do it.  We have seen evidence of the harm that can be done to young people if they are not enabled to get their gender recognised, to married parents if they are forced to divorce and to anybody who is forced to go through a medical process that he or she may not wish to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013102300012#M00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Leslie Sherlock"},{"type":"speech","time":1382535000,"counter":51,"content":"<p>Does Mr. Mannion want to comment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013102300012#M00300","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1382535000,"counter":52,"content":"<p>I think it is ridiculous to ask young transgender people to wait to reach 18 years before their gender is recognised.

It should be a simple process for pupils to request the board of management of the school to be allowed to wear the uniform of their legal gender.  That is one reason that the acquired gender of young people needs to be recognised in the legislation.<\/p><p>  I dropped out of school as have some close friends as a result of the difficulties that result from not being able to have one's legal gender recognised.  Having the correct foundation in life is just as important as other elements of life.  If one cannot start off properly what is the quality of the rest of one's life?  That is the reason it is so important to include young people.

The 16 to 18 age cohort is a facile constitutional argument and as to its inclusion, opinion would suggest it be changed.  That is unanimous from those who have contributed and I presume that is part of the process that will feed back into the heads of the Bill.  I do not particularly want to get involved in the issue of age.<\/p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in who raised the question on sporting organisations is no longer present.  All sporting organisations must take a position on this.  I have been involved in the International Rugby Board committee on gender dysphoria in the year running up to the women's rugby world cup.  There were significant concerns about individuals of 6 ft. 10 in. who had transitioned from the male to female role running out as second rows on international teams.  The sporting organisations are agitated because they need to have a position on the intersex conditions as well as gender dysphoria.  The heads of the Bill is addressing whether that should be a constitutional entitlement for the sporting boards or just left up to the sporting boards.  It is a real issue.<\/p><p>  The constitutional point of view on validation is another area that must be addressed.  The validation process really should not be a process, but should be a supporting statement from the practitioner who is, or has been involved in looking after the individual through some point of their journey.  We have 254 patients.  Some 246 patients attended the services in Loughlinstown.  We would have been asked to see a certain number more than that who do not have gender dysphoria but may have been down and depressed.  A personality disorder, which is totally different from gender dysphoria can have a focus on gender as an issue.  An individual with a personality disorder could chose to change his or her gender by simply self declaration.  The issue for the committee is the minority risk this poses in terms of the constitutionality of the birth certificate.  The rate of regret among those with gender dysphoria who go through transition is very low, and there is the capacity in the legislation to change back.  I would not imagine a person having to go through the process of an examination, and sitting in front of a board for acquired gender validation.  <\/p><p>  The enactment of the legislation would represent progress, but there is a clear appetite for change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013102300012#M00700","nonspeaker":"Professor Donal O'Shea"},{"type":"speech","time":1382535000,"counter":56,"content":"<p>I thank Professor O'Shea.

It is important that the State knows who is who, for example, with regard to criminal activity.  This is a practical issue which we cannot ignore.  It is not quite the same as a marriage certificate.<\/p><p> With regard to the constitutional issue on marriage, as I stated, I cannot discuss our legal advice on this issue and will not do so.  There are differing views on the impact on the Constitution and whether a same sex marriage is inadvertently created.  I can state quite clearly that there is certainly no agreement on this issue, which will not come as a surprise to anybody.  This is the horns of the dilemma we face in drafting the legislation.  The broader issues are matters for the Department of Justice and Equality.<\/p><p> As I stated, a number of elements of the legislation are, to some extent, fail-safe provisions and have been imported from other legislation.

There are issues for sports bodies, but the Minister will listen closely to everything the committee has to say and its recommendations, including on this issue.<\/p><p> Deputy Brendan Griffin asked whether it was possible to revoke a decision.  Under the legislation, this will be possible.  It is also important to state we will not force people to divorce.  We will require them to be single and there is a subtle distinction.

Will it be immediate once all of the three or four criteria mentioned in the heads of the Bill are satisfied or will there be delays to allow the Department examine the matter?

The marriage contract and the marital legal right provide a very useful comparison.  In the context of the medical assertion made, I return to the fact that a very small number of medical people in this field have a vested interest in keeping this in the legislation in order to protect their own businesses and incomes.  The issue of personality disorders or mental illnesses is irrelevant.  Any crazy old individual can enter into a marriage and any person should be able to enter into a recognition of his or her gender identity.  It should not matter what mental state the person is in.  It is also a useful comparison in terms of the reversal and the fact that we can have divorce which was introduced in Ireland quite late but with good reason.  As Deputy Brendan Griffin stated, including this provision in the legislation is not reckless, rather it reflects reality.  What is the problem with this?<\/p><p>  Sport is probably an subject in respect of which this issue will need to be addressed but probably not by this committee.  However, I urge members to consider this matter from the perspective of protecting transgender people, as opposed to further stigmatising and oppressing them.<\/p><p>  In the context of the constitutional issues and comparisons with Austria and Germany, I imagine it would be quite difficult for any member of the committee and for us, as activists, to make comparisons with these countries in the absence of both a firm legal opinion and an interpretation of the Constitution.

I have included the following exclusions in the definition.  Subsection (1)(<i>a<\/i>) aims to exclude interbank lending, the majority of which is extremely short term, including durations of less than one week.  A significant proportion of this lending takes place overnight and its purpose is to manage liquidity flows.  It is not true lending in the sense of creating an exposure that is repaid over a period.  It is considered highly liquid for reporting purposes and is captured through existing regulatory reporting.  Attempting to capture this form of lending would create a significant operational burden for credit information providers, given the frequency of mandatory checks, associated costs and the delays caused by the need for such checks.  Delays are particularly problematic when the lending is for short-term liquidity purposes.  <\/p><p>  Subsection (1)(<i>b<\/i>) aims to exclude from the register State borrowings or lending to international organisations defined in section 186B of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005. <\/p><p>  Subsection (1)(<i>c<\/i>) aims to exclude intra-group lending, for example, a parent company in a group lending money to a subsidiary.  The register is unlikely to benefit from information of this kind.  Many large firms will have a finance arm that handles most of the financial dealings for a company.  The finance arm will be the arm that takes on all borrowings and lends the money internally to other branches of the firm.  Trying to deal with these complex set-ups within the register would involve significant cost for the parent and subsidiary companies concerned for a minimal gain of information.  <\/p><p>  Subsection (1)(<i>d<\/i>) is intended to exclude any financial accommodation offered by an employer such as a wage advance from being captured for the register.  Although this information could be useful, the cost and resources required to monitor every firm that offers any financial accommodation to its employees and mandate reporting from such firms would be highly significant.  On balance, the information would not be sufficiently valuable to warrant this.  Where credit providers cannot rely on this exclusion, they must report on all loans of more than &euro;2,000 they provide for employees. <\/p><p>  Subsection (1)(<i>e<\/i>) aims to exclude utilities from the register.  The possibility of including utilities in the register was examined by the inter-agency working group and not considered necessary at this point.  The group recommended that the inclusion of additional sources be considered by the Central Bank of Ireland after the initial implementation of the register in consultation with the stakeholders, including the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner.<\/p> <p>Section 1(f) is intended to exclude trade credit where financial accommodation is being extended for a short period from one business to another.  This is distinct from financing arrangements where credit is extended in exchange for repayment with interest over a period of time.  Late payments are likely to be short-term and are most likely to take place with ongoing customers over a period of time.  For example, manufacturers of goods will have trade credit accounts for retainers of those goods, which will be part of the business model in a way that one-off credit or financing is not.  Section 1(g) aims to cover <i>ad hoc<\/i>interest-free arrangements.  If credit is offered without interest or charges, it is likely to be less formal and for a shorter term.  This section should also mean that informal loans between friends and families are excluded if no interest is applied.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013102300002#A00600","speaker":"958","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382533200,"counter":85,"content":"<p>With regard to amendment No. 1 and section 1(f), regarding goods and services, is it tight enough so that the provision does not apply to a service from a financial institution?

The reason for the deletion is that the providers of hire purchase agreements are regulated financial services providers and are already captured in subsection (a).  The inclusion of subsection (d) widens the scope of the Bill by extending the definition of credit information providers to any person - other than a regulated financial service provider, local authority or NAMA - who provides credit.  The amendment also proposes the exemption of pawnbrokers, the Central Bank of Ireland, the central bank of any other country or territory from the definition of credit information provider.<\/p><p>  Amendment No. 3 provides a definition for a credit institution, which is taken from the capital requirements directive as it is now being referred to in the Bill.

I thank the Deputy for his input.  The reason we cannot accept the amendment is because it is important from the perspective of developing the credit risk or credit profile of the borrower that all information on the register is subject to the same retention period.  If information related to the original terms for restructured mortgages on primary residences were to be deleted from the register, it would place any new credit information provider at a disadvantage relative to peers who were aware of the original terms to which the credit information subject was subject.<\/p><p>  It is also important to highlight the situation whereby a customer may struggle with a mortgage, including, for example, missed payments, but may not seek to restructure the loan and keep to the original terms.  All of this detail would be kept on the register for a period of five years, thus placing him or her in an unfair position <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i> those who chose the restructuring option.<\/p><p>  Finally, it is also important to recognise that the original terms of the loan up to the restructure represent a significant piece of credit intelligence and should be retained on the register for the same period of time as any other information.  I note that it is important to make a distinction between the content of the register and the content of credit reports, which is not specified in the legislation.  For example, the Irish Credit Bureau currently holds data for five years, but only two years' worth of data is included in its reports.  The contents of reports will be set out in regulations following consultation with credit information providers and the Data Protection Commissioner and will be subject to the Minister's consent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013102300005#D03500","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1382534400,"counter":196,"content":"<p>I am disappointed that the Minister is not open to accepting amendment No. 31.  We all realise that the situation with individuals who have mortgages and simply cannot pay them back is not a small one.  I am not talking about a number of individuals who borrowed recklessly.  It is a large section of society who have found themselves with mortgages that are way beyond their means at this point in time.  We all acknowledge, as the Minister of Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, did in the Personal Insolvency Act 2012, that the large number of applications that may go through that service, not to mention the banks themselves, and the targets that have been laid down by the Central Bank for arrangements reached at the end of each quarter, demonstrate that this is not a normal situation with regard to restructured mortgages.<\/p><p>  This Bill should reflect the reality that there is a certain section of borrowers who are in this position and who should not be subject to the same rigors of this legislation.  I am not trying to decrease the strength of the legislation, because it is important to protect future borrowers, the State and the institutions.  I wish to provide that the register can be amended to reflect that borrowers have concluded successful restructuring arrangements, either with a bank or through the mechanisms in the Personal Insolvency Act 2012, where such arrangements have been in place and working for a 12-month period.<\/p> <p>It is a sensible amendment and I am open to changing it.  If a person fell back into arrears the situation could revert to the original.  If we are talking about having a clean break, however -  drawing a line in the sand for families and trying to get the banks to arrange restructuring for them so they can move on with their lives - we should reflect that in this legislation.  A 12-month period would suffice in this instance, where a restructured arrangement is in place and is working.  As stated in the amendment, it would then be subject to an application to be amended by the individual, rather than something that would happen automatically.  I would be open to the idea that this information could be retained in some way for intelligence, as it was termed, but we need to move to give people a clean break.  The five-year period for this cadre of people, who number 140,000, is onerous.

There could be a situation where a family member stands guarantor for a son or daughter who sets up a business.

We pointed to such areas on Second Stage.  Amendment No. 30 seeks to re-establish something that was in the heads of the Bill.  It reads, &quot;The Bank [the Central Bank] may provide for an independent adjudication of disputes between a credit information subject and a credit information provider as to the content of the register.  The Bank may rely on such adjudication and amend the Register as recommended by the adjudicator&quot;.  It would allow for an independent mechanism if the bank so decided, as provided for in the original wording of the heads of the Bill.  However, it was removed, which makes the legislation weaker.  I do not understand why the Minister of State will not allow for this.

It is not necessary to have an adjudicator as the relevant provisions of the data protection legislation of 1988 and 2003 will apply to the Bill.  When a credit information subject seeks an amendment to correct information held on the register as it relates to him or her, he or she must inform the Central Bank.  The Central Bank is the data controller for the information held on the register.  If the bank is satisfied that the information held on the register on the credit information subject is accurate but the credit information subject still wishes to seek an amendment to the register, the credit information subject has recourse to the Data Protection Commissioner.  Therefore, a procedure has been provided for in the Bill that provides the credit information subject with an avenue to follow in the event of a dispute about the content of the register.  The amendment, as proposed, is, therefore, not necessary, largely because the overriding issue is with the Data Protection Commissioner, not the Central Bank.  It would be an extra layer.  It is the Data Protection Commissioner's job to deal with the matter, not that of the Central Bank.  Applications can be made to the commissioner for that reason.<\/p><p>  With regard to amendment No. 56, the Office of the Attorney General consdiered it was appropriate to move the material that formerly featured in section 11 to this new section as it relates not only to the amendment dealt with in sections 9 and 10 but also to the issue of access, dealt with in section 16.  The proposed amendments apply the appropriate provisions of the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003 to this Act and provide clarity regarding the role of the Data Protection Commissioner and the Central Bank in respect of the systemic problems identified by the bank.  The Data Protection Commissioner has been consulted on the proposed amendments to this section.  No protection for credit information subjects will be lost through these proposed changes.  The amendments will simply apply only the provisions that are applicable.

During the consultation process on the Bill, stakeholders advocated higher and lower thresholds on the reporting requirements under the Bill.  The threshold level chosen is based largely on the detail of the interagency group report and the consultative process.  The imposition of such a low threshold as set out in his amendment may place a significant burden in terms of cost and resources on smaller credit information providers in particular.  If one lowers the threshold, it could have an impact on credit unions and small sums of money which may not be in the interest of the consumer.  In addition, amendments Nos. 34, 35 and 38 will allow greater flexibility for changing the thresholds if required.  This does not preclude the Minister from amending the thresholds in the future.<\/p><p>  The capacity of the Minister to amend the level of thresholds after a period of practical operation of the register may be some comfort to the Deputy.  This has also occurred in other jurisdictions as after a period of operation.  It will be clearer what thresholds will best meet the purposes of the register.

That is one of the reasons their APRs are so high and why they are allowed to have collection charges built in.  If I have a &euro;200 loan with a moneylender, I will probably pay him or her before I pay the bank or the credit card company because the moneylender will call to me at a certain time every week.

For example, the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator regulate the industry by sector and, therefore, there are separate rules for moneylenders, credit unions and banks.

These amendments are in many ways consequential and directly linked with the amendments proposed for section 16.  Section 16 gives credit information providers the option or the obligation of accessing a number of scenarios, including considering a new applicant, considering a request by the credit information subject to change the terms and conditions, or restructuring, or considering the impact of a breach of terms and conditions by a credit information subject.  The amendments proposed in section 16 afford credit information providers access where changes to terms and conditions or a breach of terms and conditions occur with credit information providers.<\/p><p>  Section 17 sets the boundary for proper use of central credit register information obtained by a credit information provider under section 16.  This section needs to be amended to reflect the changes made to section 16.  In summary, if one provides for the gateway in section 16, one must also provide the associated appropriate legislative boundary and permitted use in section 17.<\/p><p>  The proposed amendment No. 50 to section 17(<i>d<\/i>) is in order to standardise the language in section 17 to more directly reflect the provisions of section 16 and make it clear that what is being referred to is the common meaning of default, specifically a breach of obligations under a credit agreement rather than any other meaning of default, such as any regulatory concept of default.  The inclusion of amendment No. 51, relating to section 17(<i>f<\/i>), again allows for portfolio analysis of a credit information provider's own submissions to the register to be included as a legitimate purpose for accessing information.<\/p><p>  I am not accepting Deputy Doherty's proposed amendment No. 49.  This amendment would impact on the effectiveness of the register by limiting the access of credit information providers to the register by not allowing them to evaluate the risk of affording or extending credit to, or taking a guarantee or indemnity from, a credit information subject unless the credit information subject has consented to the evaluation.  In effect, this amendment goes against the stated aim of the legislation in promoting responsible lending by possibly resulting in pertinent information being withheld from the credit information provider.  On this basis, unfortunately I am unable to accept the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013102300013#M00100","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1382539200,"counter":412,"content":"<p>I take the Minister's point about the amendment.

There will be two other amendments to the Bill, consequential to this amendment, one to the Long Title of the Bill and another to exclude this amendment from the requirements in respect of commencement orders.  These transfers are an amount equivalent to the income on the SMP portfolio accruing to the national Central Bank as and from budget year 2013.  The member states under a full financial assistance programme are not required to participate in this scheme for the period in which they receive financial assistance.  As this provision currently falls outside the scope of the Credit Reporting Bill an instruction to a committee motion will be required under Standing Order 131(2).  Standing Order 131(2) provides that the D&aacute;il may, following debate of not less than 60 minutes, give an instruction to a committee empowering it to make amendments.  <\/p><p> The net issue is that under the second bailout for Greece, a new fund was provided which all member states of the eurozone commit to.  We must have this up and running in legislation because, as we come out of the bailout programme ourselves, we are liable.  The next payment is due on 1 July 2014.  With the agreement of the House, we propose to use the provisions of this Bill to provide a mechanism through which this can be paid.  Essentially, it is our portion of the funds made available to Greece.  An agreement was put in place whereby the amount of interest owed that a member state would obtain through the fund would be given back to the Greek authorities.  We did not have to pay this because we were in a bailout programme ourselves but when we come out of the programme, we will have to pay it.  The sum for next year is approximately &euro;31 million, which Ireland will pay to the Greek authorities, as will our eurozone partners.  This is totally accounted for in terms of the budgetary position, notwithstanding the commitment we must make.  Effectively, we are adding this into this legislation because this is probably the last chance we will have to do so between now and July.  If we do not do it this way, there will be no legal basis for us paying it.  That is the intention of the exercise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013102300015#O04600","speaker":"958","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382541000,"counter":535,"content":"<p>I do not have an issue with the substantive issue of the agreement brokered by Greece, whereby the interest on loans extended to Greece by member states would be reimbursed to the Greek authorities.

This is not the appropriate place to underpin a payment to the ESM and via the ESM to the Greek authorities.  It should also not be put forward on Report Stage.

I am very grateful for the opportunity to speak to the committee today.  I am greatly honoured to be nominated to the position of Ombudsman and Information Commissioner.  I wish to pay tribute to the outgoing, former Ombudsman, now European Ombudsman, Emily O'Reilly, who led the office with distinction for a number of years.  She has made it easy for the next incumbent to take on the role.<\/p><p>  The role itself is a vitally important one.<\/p> <p>It is one of the independent offices of the State which gives citizens and other users of public services the sense there is someone there who can deal with their complaints objectively and independently or who can deal with their requests for information in a way that is fair, transparent and open.  The role has been significant in the context of the State and will continue to have that importance.  The work of the Office of the Ombudsman is well known in Ireland but the office also has a strong international reputation, providing the next Ombudsman with a great platform from which to develop an even better service in the future.<\/p><p> I should provide some information about myself.  Unusually, I am not a journalist.  I come to the post as a public service ombudsman and believe I will bring a particular perspective to the role of Ombudsman.  I am used to managing and leading a public service ombudsman's service which is well regarded and which has dealt with a much increased demand for its services, a demonstration of the confidence of the people who use the service.  In dealing with the greater demand for services, my office also managed to improve its performance.  For example, there are no complaints more than a year old to be dealt with in the office.  Some 90% of complainants are told within 28 days, and often within two or three days, whether their complaint will be investigated.<\/p><p> This focus on the balance between giving people proper, well thought through objective responses to their questions while at the same time doing so in a way that reflects the scarcity of resources ensures that what resources are deployed are deployed efficiently and effectively.  This is part of what I would bring with me to the role of Ombudsman.  What I bring to the role also is the fact that although I have a knowledge of public services in Ireland, I have not had any personal engagement in those services.  From that point of view, I would bring an objectivity and clarity to the role which I believe would be of considerable assistance.<\/p><p> A large part of my career has been about developing services for people with intellectual disabilities, but also for people from a variety of backgrounds where support is required.  This work informs my view of issues.  We all use public services to some extent.  We pay tax, though we may not think of that as a public service, but we use public services constantly.  However, people with support requirements, disabilities and so on rely on public services.  Consequently, ensuring there is good, independent, objective scrutiny of any failures of public service is important.  This is an important part of my motivation for wanting to take on the role of Ombudsman.  <\/p><p> This is an exciting time to take on the role of Ombudsman.  The Office of the Ombudsman is well established, but the recent extension of jurisdiction is important because it means the Ombudsman can provide greater coverage.  The impending freedom of information legislation will also give greater scope to the role through the widening of the number of bodies included within the jurisdiction and by improving access to information more generally.  I relish the opportunity to see those changes through.  It is important that the new bodies covered by the legislation understand the role of the office but I believe there will be some trepidation in that regard.  People will be concerned in terms of both the Ombudsman Act and freedom of information legislation.  It is important people have a good understanding of what the changes will mean and the implications for them.  I intend to work with them to help develop that understanding.<\/p><p> One of the fundamental issues for me is that by and large most complaints that come to an ombudsman or information commissioner should not be there.  If public bodies handled complaints better, people would not feel the need of the office.  Some people, even when they have received a reasonable response, are not satisfied with the outcome.  That is fine, but there should be somewhere for them to take their complaints further.  The demand for an ombudsman's office will grow significantly in times such as those we are living through currently.  Therefore, finding ways of helping public bodies to manage complaints better is important.<\/p><p> One of the areas I would like to explore is the introduction of a standardised, streamlined approach to complaint handling by public bodies, which would give citizens and service users much greater clarity and certainty about what to expect when they make complaints.  This would bring complaints to the Ombudsman's office more quickly and the issues would be fresher and more capable of being resolved.  This would also reduce the number of complaints.  Any ombudsman would say that sometimes when one finds that the subject of the complaint has not been upheld, the complaint handling has been so dreadful that one has to uphold the complaint on that basis alone.  This is a particular area I would like to address.  <\/p><p> I would also work to improve the performance of the office, the way it deals with people who approach it, provide a prompt, effective and courteous service, ensure people feel they are getting there complaints considered objectively and ensure their requests for information are dealt with properly, efficiently and speedily.  There are issues in regard to these issues and I will, therefore,need to look at the issue of performance.  This is something I have looked hard at in my current position, making maximum use of information technology to make it easier for people to access the service and to make it easier to manage complaints so that the burden of the office in terms of processing is undertaken, as much as possible, by the IT to enable the investigators spend their time investigating and dealing with members of the public.  There are ways of improving processing and performance but I do not see a likely reduction in the volume of complaints or requests for information.<\/p><p> Turning over work quickly is not in itself a measure of performance of an ombudsman's service if the quality of that work is not of a suitable standard.  From that perspective, I am anxious to ensure there are arrangements in place to ensure quality.  I think there is scope for improving performance and I would like to focus on that.  Ultimately, the quality of the examinations, the investigations and the reports produced is what will determine whether people have faith in the service.  People may be happy for it to take a little while for them to receive an answer, provided that answer is thorough, deals with all the points raised, is objective and gives them an answer they can understand in terms of the question they asked.<\/p><p> I want to say a little about the core work - about health and social care complaints.  I have made it clear that the Ombudsman has two distinct roles as an agenda.  The first is the consideration of complaints and the provision of redress for individuals who approach the office or the provision of the information they require.  The second role is equally important and it is to ensure that the same mistakes are not constantly repeated and to consider how to get that learning into the system.  In my current role, I have made a significant investment in improving public service delivery.  Regular case books set out the learning from the office and I know these are used by public bodies as learning materials.  These provide regular guidance on handling complaints.<\/p><p> In the case of the larger public bodies, those which generate the greatest volume of complaints, generally health bodies in my case, we have annual meetings and letters which set out the cases that arose during the year, what can be learned from them and try to get assurance this learning is being carried through.  When we propose changes and agree an action plan with a body that it will implement in order to avoid a repeat of mistakes, it is essential we follow up on that and get evidence action has been taken and that the action taken has achieved the desired outcome.  My fundamental principle is that it is not sufficient to say the consideration of complaints improved services.  The improvement of services must be a focus of the work of the office.<\/p> <p>That is something I want to bring to the position, as I have done in my current role.  I will speak about the relationship with the health service, the HSE and the Department of Health.  It seems this has been an area of particular concern and I am sure the committee has had occasion to consider it.  I would very much want to make a personal investment in efforts to improve what has become, in my view, a very entrenched relationship.  These things are difficult and there is a lot of history attached.  I am not that naive to think that all that history can be set aside.  On the other hand, a new incumbent in the post marks a fresh start and it should be possible to start to rebuild that relationship so that it is more constructive and so that the findings of the office and its reports are more likely to be accepted and implemented in a spirit of organisational learning which they should be, in my view.  Complaints are a source of learning for organisations and provide a way for improvement.  That is the way I would like to see it done.<\/p><p> The new FOI provisions will also pose challenges for the new bodies under jurisdiction.  Some way of setting out the implications and how the provisions will work will be needed.  There is currently a means of communication but much of the engagement between the office and the bodies in jurisdiction focuses on individual requests for information and individual complaints.  There needs to be much more generic engagement with the bodies so that there is an opportunity for them, if possible, to prevent the complaints and the requests for review coming to the office in the first instance.<\/p><p> One of the issues of greatest concern both to me and to the committee is that issues will arise when individuals are entitled to a service or to fair treatment and an investigation reveals that they have not received same.  It is essential that any ombudsman should be authoritative and that decisions should be on the basis of a very detailed consideration of the evidence and that the recommendation should be seen to put right any wrong that has occurred.  I imagine and hope that the relationship with this committee will be fundamental in ensuring that any unresolved issues are taken forward.  I would hope to avoid the situation where recommendations are not being upheld.  In my current position all my recommendations have been implemented.  I realise this is making me a hostage to fortune because that day will come but it is important to emphasise that I come to this position with prior experience and knowledge.<\/p><p> The Office of the Ombudsman in Ireland has a very high profile.  People understand that they can bring their complaints but that, in itself, is not sufficient.  In my view when people make a first complaint to public bodies or request information it is essential that they are informed of their right to come to the Office of the Ombudsman.  For preference, the body in jurisdiction needs an opportunity to be able to respond to the request but the best way of ensuring that people know about access to the services of the Office of the Ombudsman is that they are informed about it when they most need to know, at the point at which they are dissatisfied with either the service or the information provided by a body.  I place great importance on ensuring this will happen.<\/p><p> There is a plethora of ways to complain about services.  There has been some movement in the piece of work which led to the health complaints website.  People should be able to complain in whatever form they wish.  For many people that will still be a letter, the completion of a form or by speaking to an official.  Equally important, people who want to complain by phone or by website should be able to get access to someone who can tell them how to present a complaint.  That should be an accessible and reliable service which will provide information about any body or agency in the State about which a complaint may arise.  In my view, the information should be available on bodies both inside and outside jurisdiction.  The Office of the Ombudsman should be the source of information for making a complaint and this should be available to everyone using any method of contact.  I refer to the Complaints Wales service which is a telephone and web-based service and in my view it is one of the most innovative methods of access anywhere.  As more public services are provided by bodies which are not themselves public bodies, it becomes more difficult for people to seek access to justice.  The Office of the Ombudsman has a critical role in making it easier for people to do that.<\/p><p> This is a vital role and I would very much relish the opportunity to exercise it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2013102300003#B00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Tyndall","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382541300,"counter":554,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Tyndall agus gabhaim comhghairdeachas leis as a ainmni&uacute;ch&aacute;in don phost seo.  I congratulate him on his nomination to this position.  This is a relatively new committee but we have had a very good engagement with the current Ombudsman.  Mr. Tyndall is probably very well aware that he has some big boots to fill because she did a fantastic job.  I am sure Mr. Tyndall will be an able successor, even though his approach, perspective and experiences are different.  I agree that the interaction with this committee will be key.  My own sense is that the previous Ombudsman encountered a sense of belligerence from certain Departments and agencies in their reactions to some of her reports.  Hers was not an easy task.  However, following meetings with this committee, some of the issues were moved forward and resolved and that is a very positive development.  Mr. Tyndall will work closely with other ombudsmen in the State who are doing very good work.  I have two areas of particular interest.  I am interested that Mr. Tyndall was based in Wales and the Welsh language is a very important and integral part of the fabric of the community there.  I am an Irish speaker and we have a Language Commissioner.  There are proposals for the amalgamation of the Office of the Language Commissioner and the Office of the Ombudsman.  I ask Mr. Tyndall to give his opinion on this proposal and also to talk about any issues he may have encountered in dealing with bilingual issues in Wales which might be useful in the context of his new role.<\/p><p>  He referred to the extension of the remit of the office.  His predecessor, Ms Emily O'Reilly, was very strong in her opinion.  She asked that particular sectors should be included in the amended legislation, such as groups of people who do not have recourse to a complaints system.  I refer specifically to those living in direct provision.  I acknowledge Mr. Tyndall is new and he faces a task of work which includes an extended remit.  I ask Mr. Tyndall not to let that ball drop.  The extension of the remit is badly needed.  I wish him well.  This committee is here to support him.

My Irish is rusty.  I worked closely with the Welsh language commissioner.  In Wales, the children's commissioner and older people's commissioner and myself worked closely together.  As chair of the Ombudsman Association of Britain and Ireland, I facilitated meetings of the Irish ombudsmen and I know my colleague ombudsmen in Ireland.  Obviously, I would welcome the opportunity to work with them.<\/p><p>  Wales is a fully bilingual country, particularly in terms of public administration.  I am very familiar with it.  When a complaint arrives in Welsh, it is investigated in Welsh, the report is in Welsh, etc.  My Welsh is good enough for me to stay on top of it.  I would need some help with some of the more technical language, but there we are.  I have to say my Irish is incredibly rusty, but it was reasonably good.  My difficulty is that when I attempt a sentence in Irish, a sentence in Welsh comes to mind, but that will change.<\/p><p>  It is important that people should be able to use the language of their choice.  I have noticed that there are particular issues when it comes to matters such as speech therapy or services for persons with mental health problems, where having access to services in one's first language becomes very significant.  I understand these issues well.<\/p><p>  I do not know where progress is on the issue of the combination of the offices but I understand that when the arrangements were proposed it would not mean that the commissioner's role would disappear but that it would be in a sense within a wider office dealing with other issues and complaints.  Obviously, if that continues, I would want to look very closely at it.  However, having worked in a bilingual country, I am fully committed to and supportive of the principle of enabling people to continue to use both of their languages and will look forward to working with An Comisin&eacute;ir Teanga.<\/p><p>  The issue of remits is a more complex one because I am conscious there has been a lengthy and detailed debate about it.  Sitting in a context where one looks internationally, Ireland falls towards the middle of the spectrum of where the remit falls.  Some of the more traditional ombudsmen from countries like those, for instance, in Scandinavia, have a broader remit that includes matters such as the courts, etc.  I do not think there ever will be any suggestion of moving to that end of the spectrum.  However, issues about remit are always important.<\/p><p>  I have been looking at where many people in Wales fund their own social care and, therefore, have an entirely private contractual arrangement.  I have got agreement from government to extend the jurisdiction to include people in those entirely private settings because those in the room next door who are being publicly funded are within remit, and it is just nonsense.  Keeping remit under review is one of the tasks of an Ombudsman and there will be issues always.<\/p><p>  There are other redress mechanisms.  Whatever happens in areas that are very important to people's lives, there should be independent and objective consideration and access to redress.  I do not think there is ever a time when the question of remit is settled.  Public services change, people's problems change and one needs to be aware of what the opportunities are and where the gaps are.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2013102300006#E00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Tyndall"},{"type":"speech","time":1382541900,"counter":558,"content":"<p>I join Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh in extending a welcome to Mr. Tyndall to the committee.  We were advised in private session before Mr. Tyndall came in that we are not an interview panel and that we were not to regard the meeting as such. We always take the advice of the Cathaoirleach in these and other matters.  That notwithstanding, I note that Mr. Tyndall is on the public record on the matter of recruitment and the selection process and the role of committees such as this.  It is an exciting time in the public service here in Ireland because of the recently extended remit of the office, the recent changes to the freedom of information legislation which will have a direct impact upon his office and the existence of this committee which, as a previous speaker stated, is relatively new.  I wonder whether Mr. Tyndall has any thoughts at this stage as to how best an Ombudsman might relate to this committee to the mutual benefit of improving public service and has he given any thought to the role that this committee might play.<\/p><p>  Similarly, Mr. Tyndall's office, the Office of the Ombudsman, is now dealing with a large number of public bodies and agencies for the first time and that presents a significant challenge.  I wonder whether he has any thoughts on a nationwide information and education campaign.  Having regard to the fact that, when ratified, he will be the fourth Ombudsman, nevertheless, as a public representative, I formed the view that there are bodies of opinion in Ireland that are not specifically aware of the role and function of the Ombudsman.  In the context of the increased powers and increased remit, that presents a significant challenge.  Has Mr. Tyndall any thoughts on that?<\/p><p>  With specific reference to public bodies that do not have adequately resourced FOI units, Mr. Tyndall mentioned timeframe and the importance of deadlines in his addressed.  There may well be an element of frustration having regard to the fact that he will be dealing with agencies that do not have the units set up.  How best might that be met?<\/p><p>  Would it be out of order for me to ask Mr. Tyndall for his thoughts on the recruitment and selection process having regard to the situation in Wales where this committee's counterpart in the Welsh Assembly is the recruiting body where as here he is presented to us as something of a <i>fait accompli<\/i>?  We have had a debate in recent weeks on reform of our institutions.  The proposed abolition of the Seanad engaged the people for the first time in terms of political reform.  Has Mr. Tyndall any views, have his views changed or is he prepared to speak to this committee on the matter of the recruitment selection process of public officers such as the position of Ombudsman?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2013102300006#E00200","speaker":"1055"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1382541900,"counter":559,"content":"<p>I see the role of the committee and its relationship with the Ombudsman as being twofold.  One role is that the committee will want to hold the Ombudsman to account to ensure that the office is doing what the Oireachtas thinks it should be doing.  It is that formal role where the committee considers the annual report, etc.  The second role, which is of equal importance, comes as the committee members' role as public representatives in holding public services to account.  From that point of view, the Ombudsman provides the committee with valuable knowledge and information to enable the committee to undertake that role more effectively.  Achieving the balance between those two roles will be important.<\/p><p>  The linkage between the committee and the Office of the Ombudsman should be close.  I have seen that there have been a good number of occasions when evidence has been given.  There have been lively discussions with the previous Ombudsman.  The model is there and in place and is developing well.<\/p><p>  The reality is that although the Ombudsman has a relationship with the Oireachtas as a whole, in practice, to make that relationship work one needs something that is rather more like this where there is a smaller number of people and it is possible to have proper debate, engagement and discussion.<\/p> <p>I hope that will continue to prove as effective as it has been in the recent past since the committee took on its new role.<\/p><p> There is a strong role for an information campaign with new bodies coming into jurisdiction.  There is a misunderstanding of the role of the Office of the Ombudsman.  It is really important to get bodies to understand that using compliance mechanisms to improve services is an important adjunct to their role as leaders and managers of services.  They should not regard it necessarily as threatening and disadvantageous.  Greater transparency, as brought about through freedom of information, improved complaint handling and improved service delivery, as brought about through engagement with the Ombudsman, are phenomena that bodies should be able to embrace.  However, they will not do so unless there is information.  There needs to be some targeted briefing material for bodies in order that the engagement can be set out in more practical terms.  I have developed fact sheets principally for users of the Ombudsman's service.  They set out succinctly and briefly how things work, what happens and what is possible.  An equivalent simple, straightforward, punchy message will help to get across the point.  I want bodies to embrace the opportunity, although I can understand it may take a little time to get them to feel enthusiastic about the engagement.  However, there are opportunities.  There are organisations the leadership of which engages properly with the process of improvement and uses compliance mechanisms for that purpose.  I hope we can work very carefully with them.<\/p><p> In the midst of austerity, the point on freedom of information is very well made.  There is often a hierarchy of issues that are lost as budgets are cut.  Training is cut early in the day and resourcing freedom of information is not much further along the road.  A delay in dealing with requests exacerbates the problem.  Often, when a person asking for information to which he or she is entitled does not receive a prompt response, he or she assumes the reason is not necessarily the Department is struggling to find someone to do the work but that the Department does not want to release the information.  The latter is often not true.  The same applies to the responses to complaints.  People believe they are being denied justice, simply because of the delay in obtaining sensible answers.  In some ways, that is a very difficult conundrum.  Setting targets for bodies to respond is the issue.<\/p><p> Publishing the statistics without delay, as I do now, is a very helpful way of highlighting where the problems are.  The annual letters I publish, about which I talked, include information not just on what complaints have been dealt with and the outcomes but also on the performance of the bodies in jurisdiction in responding to requests for information from my office.  These are the areas in which one can actually help to highlight where the problems are in the hope of persuading people to improve performance.<\/p><p> Engaging with the new bodies to discuss the requirements with them and getting some kind of information campaign going must be considered.  I understand that is principally a departmental responsibility, but I want the Office of the Ombudsman to work alongside the Department in that regard.  The Department needs to get the information across on the overall FOI regime, but it is for the office to ensure an understanding of the role of the Information Commissioner, what is required and how engagement will operate.<\/p><p> On the question about the recruitment process, members might understand that it might well be folly for somebody to comment on it before it is entirely completed.  Perhaps I might say this is the first time the committee has had the opportunity to speak to a candidate for the office, which is a welcome step forward.  The new Ombudsman and Information Commissioner will have to be elected by both Houses of the Oireachtas and appointed by the President.  That and the ongoing relationship with the committee mark an evolution, which I can welcome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2013102300006#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Tyndall","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382542500,"counter":561,"content":"<p>That was an expertly handled response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2013102300007#F00200","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speech","time":1382542500,"counter":562,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Tyndall and wish him every success in his new post of responsibility.  His submission and speech were very interesting.  We look forward to engaging with him.<\/p><p>  I wish to pursue the question by Deputy Terence Flanagan on the recruitment process, but I take Mr. Tyndall&rsquo;s deflected answer concerning the process in Dublin.  It is a matter I raised in the Seanad some months ago, which is why I am interested in it.  While I accept that Mr. Tyndall may not be free to talk about the process, perhaps he would be willing to let us know the recruitment process for his position in Wales.  Was it advertised?  Was there an interview process?  Was the procedure different from ours?<\/p><p>  My second question relates to a statement Mr. Tyndall made.  He has pointed out, correctly, that an equally core duty of the office is ensuring bodies in jurisdiction implement the recommendations arising from investigations.  We agree 100%, particularly where the body in jurisdiction is the Government as a whole.  Having read the work of his predecessor, Ms Emily O'Reilly, Mr. Tyndall is possibly aware of a special report of the Ombudsman.  A special report is laid before the Oireachtas where a matter is deemed to be exceptionally serious.  There is such a report before the office and the Government, the lost at sea report.   That the Government and its predecessors failed absolutely to respond to the recommendations made is absolutely disgraceful.  The matter may have come before the Office of the European Ombudsman.  The current coalition which includes my party and some people in this room, gave the most solemn commitment to implement the recommendations of Ms Emily O'Reilly.  That has now been dismissed on so-called legal grounds.  The previous Government did likewise.<\/p><p>  The committee must make a statement that when the Ombudsman lays not just any report but a special report before the Houses of the Oireachtas, its recommendations should surely be implemented.  I hope Mr. Tyndall will confirm that he will pursue the matter with vigour.  There is a widow in Donegal affected.  I never met her, but I know one or two of the family who have suffered.  The special report was laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas not just for consideration but for a response.  It is not good enough that we suddenly do political and legal somersaults and say we cannot now do what we absolutely and solemnly promised to do.  That excuse is simply not good enough.  I am not expecting miracles from Mr. Tyndall today, but I am asking for his strong commitment to continue the work of his predecessor to secure justice for a family who lost not only financially but also family members in a fishing accident.  When the Ombudsman says it is a core duty to ensure bodies in jurisdiction implement recommendations, this must be borne in mind.  I am not a member of the committee, but I came along to ask the Ombudsman to ensure our word is our bond, that we will respond and implement the recommendation of Mr. Tyndall's predecessor.  The special report was probably the most serious produced by the Ombudsman in the past decade.  It is not good enough that it is simply gathering dust on some Government shelf.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2013102300007#F00300","speaker":"1121"},{"type":"speech","time":1382542500,"counter":563,"content":"<p>Before I allow Deputy Seamus Kirk to contribute, let me clarify some matters on the lost at sea scheme.<\/p> <p>The recommendations of the then Ombudsman, Ms Emily O&rsquo;Reilly, were rejected by the committee.

I am familiar with the lost at sea report and heard Emily O&rsquo;Reilly speak eloquently about it.  She spoke at the same time as Ann Abraham, the former UK parliamentary ombudsman, who compiled the Equitable Life report which looked at lost pensions and another that was not implemented in full.  Fundamentally, there is a question about the powers of the office.  Within a democracy, the ombudsman normally has the power of recommendation on public service complaints.  In dealing with private sector complaints, for example, a financial services ombudsman will have binding powers because there is no political process to back up his or her recommendations.  Fundamentally, it falls to the Legislature to see these recommendations through.  When the issue arises, parliamentary committees consider it.  This is the process for most ombudsman offices across the world.<\/p><p>  I do not want to comment in detail on the lost at sea report because I do not know where the process is at.

The Irish role includes the role of Information Commissioner which I do not hold in Wales as that role is not devolved to the Welsh Assembly.

That makes for a sustainably different and extended remit.<\/p><p>  One of the great joys of my life is that I get to investigate allegations against members of local authorities, including parish and community councils, who may have broken their codes of conduct.

It is one of the perennial difficulties, on which one needs to have a clear policy.  Repeat complainants actually may have had a grain of reason at the start of the process.  People can start out reasonably, but they turn into Victor Meldrew after repeated failures to obtain sensible and proper responses to their complaints.

It will certainly be challenge in the context of the significant extension of the office&rsquo;s remit.<\/p> <p>Mr. Tyndall has indicated that the role of information commissioner was not delegated to him as Welsh Public Services Ombudsman.  Our recent legislation extension in this jurisdiction makes it challenging.  Mr. Tyndall is unflinchingly committed to the maximum openness and transparency and one would anticipate and expect that.  He makes proposals about vulnerable individuals, which are understandable.  Recently I read that he proposed that there would be some restrictive interpretation of what could be published and that might relate to what he has said here about not disclosing information about vulnerable individuals.  This may have to be addressed by his successor.  I saw some possibly adverse comment on that.  Like us, something Mr. Tyndall says may be interpreted in different ways.  Could he clarify his position on that?<\/p><p> I am particularly interested that in his current post Mr. Tyndall has developed an Ombudsman's casebook.  This is extremely important and I hope to see it here.  It is a significant reference source which, if set out in comprehensive detail, could be a significant help to individuals, organisations, statutory bodies or public representatives in achieving a resolution of the bigger issue at stake without having recourse to the full ambit of the Ombudsman.  If a precedent has been set it can be interpreted and this could lessen the Ombudsman's load.  This is just a suggestion.  The casebook of the Ombudsman should be documented in a very accessible form.  The last thing we want is a does of legalese, which would probably create more problems for the Ombudsman and everybody else.  One of the major problems we have with our legislation is the antiquity of legal-speak which often deters people from achieving their rights rather than helping them.  We may have reports, but I look forward to that quarterly casebook model being implemented.  It could be very instrumental, innovative and helpful.<\/p><p> Would the model complaint policy which Mr. Tyndall spoke about apply right across the bodies or would it be a common complaints outline?

The Central Bank plays a key role in Irish society.  Should it be subject to freedom of information legislation?  The citizens trusted those institutions, which let them down.

Having come from another jurisdiction where it is probably a little more lax, does Mr. Tyndall have a view on that?  Maybe he does not want to pass comment on it.<\/p><p>  There is a conflict between the roles of the Ombudsman and the Data Protection Commissioner.  Much Irish politics is very localised, as it is in most countries.  If a constituent comes to me who has been on a housing list but does not receive a house to which he or she feels entitled when somebody else does, I, as a public representative cannot ascertain the information.  Before our Data Protection Act was passed I could have got some information but now I cannot find out anything.  If I made a representation for an individual I am told whether he or she received it but I cannot find out anything more.  In Mr. Tyndall's role as Ombudsman could he examine the Data Protection Act and its implementation?

The issue of confidentiality sometimes arises in the work of an ombudsman because one is dealing with people in particularly difficult situations and the cases I had in mind were issues of child and adult protection where, for instance, foster parents might want to make a complaint but it is important that information damaging to the vulnerable people at the heart of the complaint should not come into the public domain, as it would not under any other circumstances, and it should not when an ombudsman is dealing with it.  It arose in a context such as this in a discussion with a committee considering the issues around social care legislation that was going before the Welsh Assembly.  I was concerned that protections should not be eroded and that was the purpose of my remarks.  The particular matter that had been at the forefront of my mind was one of a failure in child protection and although the names of the individuals cannot be mentioned when trying to write a sensible report, people who know the family's circumstances can identify them even if it is child X and parent Y.  It still becomes possible from the circumstance to identify the individuals and that is what had happened.  This had to be to the detriment of vulnerable individuals and that was what informed a discussion with the committee.  There was a formal request.  It was a discussion with the committee about my concerns about protecting vulnerable individuals.<\/p><p>  I was asked whether I would ask for this here.

That is one of the dilemmas that these jobs pose and one has to be able to deal with them.<\/p><p>  We are particularly proud of the case book.  We believe we were the first to introduce such a comprehensive, regular description of cases.  It helps to get the message across.  People can learn from other people's mistakes and that saves complaints to the office.  One can also get generalised messages across about complaint handling, for example, where one sees the same complaint occurring in several places.  One can say people need to be careful and watch out for this.  By doing this in such a way that cases are divided into clear categories, people can look at the ones of concern to them and that makes the case book accessible.  Although it is quite a chunky read, people can focus on the bits that matter to them.  Every member of the Welsh Assembly gets a link to the latest quarter's copy and many of them find it quite useful in both their general work and constituency work.  I hope something similar here would have a similar benefit.<\/p><p>  I say to the investigators that they must tell the story.  To make a complaint accessible, they should not be repetitive and they should use plain language, tell the story from beginning to end, say what are their conclusions and make the recommendations clear.  The impact of reports that are much too lengthy and complex is greatly reduced.  The other thing I have done consistently is to put summaries in every report and, increasingly, in settlements where cases are settled without an investigation report.  Nonetheless, I produce a summary of it because there is learning to be found there too and that makes life easier.<\/p><p>  The model complaints policy was promoted rather than imposed.  It has been adopted by the Welsh Government and its departments.  It is, therefore, used by government and local government.

One of the issues we had many complaints about was neighbour nuisance in housing provided by housing associations or local authorities where the landlords would not take action.  We had a series of high profile cases but we were concerned that we were continuing to see the same cases reappearing and, therefore, we worked carefully with the local authorities in areas in which we were having the biggest problems.  Some of them restructured their departments to change the way they dealt with the issue.  We felt they needed to take early, prompt action because once matters had been allowed to deteriorate, it was always difficult to recover and they needed to use all the legal powers available to them and to engage with other bodies such as the police.  That led to a major reduction in complaints in this area to my office.  That reflects a genuine improvement in the way bodies deal with neighbour nuisance.  That is a practical example and I could give others.<\/p><p>  I refer to the issue of extending freedom of information legislation to financial bodies.  That is within the political domain at the moment and I need to reflect on that in answering the question but the extension of the legislation into the financial sector has to be a welcome development.  It will be important to see how that works over time and whether further extension is desirable.  I can well understand the importance of the issue for individuals who feel let down.<\/p><p>  Public confidence in services is always higher if it is seen that there are ways of holding them to account and that is a vital role of the office.<\/p><p>  I was asked about the difference in cases between Ireland and Wales.  There are fewer differences than one might think.  There are differences in jurisdiction but fundamentally complaints to ombudsmen tend to be at their core about somebody not receiving something to which they were entitled or complaints that what happened was not fair and complainants were not dealt with properly and, though the subject matter can change, the fundamentals of investigating the complaint is often at its heart similar.  The reality is there are differences in jurisdiction as some of the subject matters are different but although I was not information commissioner, I am familiar with the FOI regime.  Clearly, that is different but I will have a capable and knowledgeable staff and I will work closely with them to make sure I am fully across the issues in Ireland as well as in Wales.<\/p> <p>The issues of the parliamentary Whip and Parliament holding Executive to account arise in many legislatures throughout the world.

An Ombudsman cannot regulate the operation of the Oireachtas.<\/p><p> I am used to seeing freedom of information and data protection legislation alongside each other operating as a single system.  It is very different in Ireland.  I was not aware of concerns of the type expressed about the data protection regime and I must confess I concentrated most of my efforts on understanding the freedom of information regime.

The Commission and member states have been working for a number of years to achieve a digital single market, reducing barriers to cross-border trade and activities and aiming to make cross-border transactions as seamless as possible.  A number of regulatory packages have been agreed as part of this ambition, including the most recent regulatory reform measures which were transposed into Irish law in 2011.  It is also in this context that the digital agenda for Europe, DAE, is framed.  This is one of the flagship initiatives under Europe 2020.<\/p><p>  The Commission's connected continent initiative has been proposed as a further measure to achieve a move towards a single market for electronic communications.  The ambition of this measure, as with other initiatives, is to achieve a market in which citizens and businesses can access electronic communications services wherever they are provided in the European Union without cross-border restrictions or unjustified additional costs and a market in which companies can provide electronic communications networks and services wherever they are established and wherever their customers are situated in the Union.  The aim of the proposed regulation is to complete the single telecommunications market through action on a number of fronts.  We have identified three aspects of the regulation: first, to enable operators to provide services across borders using networks in other member states through a single authorisation regime - this measure aims to ensure greater consistency and predictability in the content and implementation of the regulatory regime across the European Union; second, to co-ordinate the use of radio spectrum in the European Union, with a view to enabling better cross-border provision of wireless broadband communications; and, third, to harmonise rules on consumer protection. These include rules on non-discrimination, contractual conditions, switching and number portability, access to online content and traffic management, which is net neutrality.  In addition, the proposal provides for further reforms on roaming charges.<\/p><p>  The proposal has provoked a widespread and strong reaction across the full range of players in the EU telecommunications market.  There appears to be a common consensus on the Commission's diagnosis of the challenges facing us in implementing the digital single market and the debate this has provoked is helpful.  The policy, regulatory and technical issues that need to be addressed to achieve a seamless European market for digital products and services are, however, complex and challenging.  For this reason, we need to proceed carefully with any new initiative and Ireland will press the Commission and the Council for detailed consideration and debate on the Commission's proposals.  The Commission has acknowledged that this proposal represents \"the most ambitious legislative measure in the sector for the past 26 years\".  We concur with this view and feel such a proposal requires a thorough and comprehensive analysis of all its various elements before the European Council and the Parliament can sign off on its various component parts.<\/p><p>  In the past few weeks, since the Commission&rsquo;s proposal was published in September, officials in the Department have met a number of stakeholders, including ComReg which is represented at this meeting and a number of telecommunications operators in the Irish market.  We have also facilitated a meeting between the European Commission, the Department, ComReg, the Telecommunications Industry Federation and ALTO, the alternative operators in the communications market.  A number of concerns have been raised by operators and regulators about the proposals. They include the appropriateness or need for some of the measures, their impact on the current regulatory framework and the implications, intended or otherwise, of implementing them.  Ireland, in common with most other member states, will press for significant time to be given to this dossier to facilitate a more thorough scrutiny of the detail of the proposed regulation.<\/p><p>  I refer to some of the more specific issues from Ireland&rsquo;s perspective.  With regard to spectrum, the Commission&rsquo;s objective regarding this element of the proposal is to ensure co-ordinated and timely availability of new wireless technologies, to boost interoperability and to ensure economies of scale across Europe.  To achieve this, the Commission proposes common principles for rights of use of harmonised spectrum for wireless broadband, synchronisation of spectrum availability, timing and duration of rights of use and new Commission powers to adopt implementing Acts setting criteria such as expiry, renewal, timing of assignments, duration and fees.  It is, therefore, a one-size-fits-all approach.<\/p><p>  Ireland, together with most other member states, sees the merit in closer harmonisation and we have experienced how harmonisation has been effective in the market, but we have expressed caution about the significant shift proposed in the balance of power between the Commission and national regulatory authorities and governments.  The Commission has assured member states that the principle of subsidiarity is respected as EU intervention will be limited to the extent necessary to remove specified internal market barriers.  However, there are provisions for increased powers for the Commission in matters which have up to this point been the responsibility of the national regulator.  This is a significant change in the management of an area which is a valuable national strategic asset and, like other member states, Ireland feels the full implications of this proposal must be critically examined before proceeding further.<\/p><p> On the issue of net neutrality, the Commission&rsquo;s proposal aims to ensure open access to the Internet for end-users.  This is to be achieved by banning any blocking or throttling of services and-or applications, except in limited, objectively justified circumstances.  It sets out clear rules for traffic management which has to be non-discriminatory, proportionate and transparent.  Supervision will be by national regulators which may impose minimum quality requirements, under Commission co-ordination.   Reaction from industry has been negative thus far and ComReg has also expressed concerns.  From a Government viewpoint, we need to consider this matter in more detail.  The provisions of the current regulatory framework provide a flexible and workable means of dealing with this matter and we need to ensure new measures are proportionate and workable, while respecting the fundamental principle of net neutrality. <\/p><p>  Roaming is an issue of interest to all citizens and we can all identify with it.  The draft regulation contains radical proposals in terms of abolishing roaming charges.  These charges have been one of the more visible manifestations of a fragmented European market and the European Union has made much progress to reduce them.  The Commission wants to accelerate this process with a view to abolishing roaming altogether.  We can all support this initiative, but we do need to exercise caution in implementing new measures.  Specifically, we have asked the Commission to consider a potential conflict between the proposed new measure and the existing roaming regulation which requires industry to reduce roaming charges further by next July.  That regulation requires industry to make significant investments to meet the decoupling obligations by next July.  At the same time, the new draft proposal may make these investments redundant.<\/p> <p>At a time when we are pushing operators to invest in improved connectivity, we need to be careful about conflicting investment signals.  The Commission&rsquo;s proposals on consumer protection are designed to ensure the right to plain-language contracts and greater rights to switch provider, among other measures.  We believe that these proposals are welcome, although national regulators may question the proportionality of some proposals.  It will be important to clarify the relationship between some of the measures proposed and existing measures applicable to universal service providers.<\/p><p> The Commission is proposing to upgrade the minimum harmonisation provisions adopted in 2009, which were implemented by Ireland in 2011, to a &ldquo;fully harmonised&rdquo; mandatory framework.  This will, in effect, prohibit national governments and national regulatory authorities, NRAs, from maintaining or introducing any additional consumer protection provisions beyond what is in this proposal.  While there are obvious merits to the one-size-fits-all approach, we need to be careful that member states and NRAs are not deprived of the ability to respond to the changing needs of their respective markets and national consumers.  Importantly, we may need to avoid having to step back from measures already in force, thereby reducing rather than enhancing consumer protection.<\/p><p> On the single authorisation mechanism, the Commission is proposing that service providers operating in more than one member state will benefit from a single EU authorisation requiring only one notification - that would be in its home member state.  The Commission argues that this will simplify regulation and improve convergence of regulatory conditions.  It introduces the concepts of home and host member states.  It is unclear precisely what problem the Commission is seeking to address here.  The industry is lukewarm on the proposal and national regulators, including the European regulatory umbrella body, BEREC - Body of European Regulators of Electronic Communications - are very strongly opposed.  ComReg can perhaps provide more detail about its concerns for the Irish market.<\/p><p> Ireland remains strongly supportive of the principle and objective of a digital single market.  While radical, the proposal up for discussion this morning is only a small part of the overall Single Market objective.  Issues such as cyber-security, electronic signatures and trust services, copyright and data protection are still being negotiated at Council.  Ireland continues to play a constructive role in helping progress these important files.  While we welcome the longer-term vision that the single telecommunications market, STM, regulation seeks to achieve, we will be seeking to ensure that this radical proposal is afforded the requisite time to allow for a detailed and comprehensive analysis of the consequences and impacts of its implementation.  It is a regulation which of course means direct applicability and also contains provisions for the Commission to adopt implementing Acts.  This will allow it to introduce legally enforceable measures in the future in areas that were heretofore within our national competence.  There is therefore a very significant shift in power in some policy areas from member states' NRAs to the Commission, and we need to examine this carefully.<\/p><p> We are also concerned about ensuring that the proposal does not lead to unnecessary regulatory uncertainty.  We share the Commission&rsquo;s view that lack of investment is a key challenge facing Europe&rsquo;s telecommunications market, but we need to ensure that any new measures boost investment and provide the requisite regulatory certainty for market operators.<\/p><p> Finally, we will be asking our Commission and member state colleagues to consider the market implications of this proposal.  Member states have expressed some concern that the proposed legislation will lead to market consolidation, with a small number of powerful players dominating the European market.  While this undoubtedly has some benefits, we need to ensure that small peripheral countries such as Ireland are not disadvantaged as a consequence.  It is often the case that the smaller players provide niche services in markets that are not served by bigger players, and bring important competitive tension into the market.  The long-term interest of consumers continues to be the development of cost-effective, transparent and high-quality services.  In our negotiations on this proposal we will continue to stress this important goal, with a view to ensuring a balanced and progressive outcome.

I am accompanied today by my colleague Mr. Bobby Hannon, international manager at ComReg.<\/p><p>  European and Irish consumers and end-users have benefited greatly from the advances in electronic communications services and the networks on which they and other services depend.  Innovative services have been developed and prices reduced due, among other elements, to a practical, evidence-based approach to regulation.  Regulation of the sector has been defined at European level through a series of related directives, the practical implementation of which has been entrusted to decisions at national level - that is, giving effect to the principles of subsidiarity.  The Commission is now proposing a radical departure from that approach.  ComReg, in our own right, and as a member of BEREC, has concerns about the potential impact of the set of proposals on the future effectiveness of regulation, particularly at national level.  In proposing a regulation instead of a directive, the Commission is removing the possibility of national governments or NRAs tailoring the rules to meet the unique needs of local markets.  Our specific concerns relate to the practicality of what is being proposed and whether changes will bring about the desired outcome.  More particularly, will the needs of the Irish marketplace be met by a one-size-fits-all approach, as advocated by the Commission?<\/p><p>  I reiterate the concerns which BEREC identified in its initial statement following publication of the proposals.  I have provided copies of the BEREC statement to members.  The proposals would represent a fundamental shift of decision-making away from national level and centralise competencies at Community level with increased powers for the European Commission.  In doing so there is a risk to the ability of national regulators, whether acting individually or collectively through BEREC, to take appropriate and proportionate regulatory action in all the relevant markets.  Finally, by proposing such a radical departure from the current framework, the Commission risks undermining legal certainty, in contrast to its own stated objectives of creating a predictable regulatory environment, which is essential to the promotion of efficient investment and effective competition.<\/p><p>  I do not wish to portray all of what is proposed by the European Commission as negative.  There are aspects which we consider to be progressive and, with further development, would be of benefit to Irish consumers.  Commissioner Kroes in recent days described the proposals as &ldquo;sweet and sour&rdquo; and as a package that cannot be taken apart.  Staying with the Commissioner's analogy, there are features of what is proposed that, while we could not give them an unqualified endorsement, are certainly more sweet than sour.  I include in this category the measures proposed on end-users' rights.  For the most part, these amount to an upgrading of existing provisions in the directive from enabling measures to mandatory provisions.  In Ireland we have chosen to have such rules in place, but other countries have not done so or have not done so to the same extent.  There are some aspects that we think are disproportionate, but we would expect them to be addressed when the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament consider the proposals.<\/p><p>  There are also new provisions - for instance, on switching service providers and on the treatment of bundles - which, again, subject to some further work, we think would benefit consumers, particularly as services are being increasingly subscribed to through bundles.  The provisions on net neutrality are also generally positive but we are not convinced that this can represent the final word on the issue.  We are acutely aware that the debate surrounding assured service quality and traffic management can raise issues about discriminatory preference being given to certain applications or, indeed, to certain categories of user.  We would expect this aspect of the proposals to generate a lot of debate.<\/p><p>  Overall, we have our doubts that the end-user provision, including net neutrality, should be addressed by way of full harmonisation - that is, by way of a regulation rather than an amending directive.  While this should result in end-users having the same experience anywhere in the EU, we are concerned at the prospect, over time, of our being unable to react at national level to consumer protection issues which may be unique to Ireland.  In fact, we have specific concerns that consumer protection measures which ComReg has introduced, such as requirements on the format of bills and on advance notice by operators exiting the market, would no longer be permitted.  Our preference would be for the EU legislation to specify a minimum, not a maximum, set of harmonised consumer rules and for member states to supplement these where necessary and where proportionate.<\/p> <p> The proposal also amends the roaming regulation, the most important aspect being a mechanism for operators to offer a roam-like-at-home facility as an alternative to the requirement due to come into effect next July of a facility to allow customers take roaming services from a different operator.  We will support any mechanism that drives down the cost of roaming for Irish users but the practicality of the particular mechanism needs to be carefully considered, along with the implications for mobile providers who are not part of a pan-European alliance.<\/p><p> There is a proposal that would place a cap on the cost of a call from Ireland to anywhere in the Union.  Again we support reductions in unjustified costs incurred by end users but the mechanism proposed by the Commission proposes very different approaches for mobile and fixed networks.<\/p><p> Let me turn to the aspects of the proposals that we would definitely consider sour.  The first is the single EU authorisation.  This is stated to reduce barriers to entry and simplify matters for operators that are active in more than one member state.  The proposal introduces the concept of a home member state, which is where the operator is headquartered, and a host member state, where the operator, subsidiaries and affiliates provide services.  There is no simplification of procedures for operators.  One would still be required to notify details of each operating entity in each of the official languages in each of the territories in which one operates.  The only difference is that a single notification would be made to the regulator in the home member state, who would then have to forward the information to each regulator in each other member state where the operator is active.  Far from being a simplification, it would create unnecessary bureaucracy for operators and also for regulators while making the procedures more cumbersome and regulatory responses subject to delay.<\/p><p> By creating the concept of a European provider, the proposal would create a two-tier regulatory regime with the capacity for national regulators to regulate European providers in their national markets subject to veto by the EU Commission.  Furthermore, it would make regulation of national markets subject to the views of the home regulator, thereby creating quite a different regulatory regime.  Eircom and Vodafone, for instance, would be under a very different type of regulatory framework.  Since 2011, there has been a procedure in place for the consistent application of remedies &ndash; the Article 7 procedure.  This has worked well over the past 2.5 years since its introduction, yet the Commission is proposing to discard this and introduce an unproven and unjustified alternative procedure for European providers only.<\/p><p> The final and perhaps most important issue I want to address is that of spectrum.  Essentially, decision-making in respect of assignment of spectrum would be vested in the Commission, and member states would have far less control.  This is a fundamental shift in responsibility and I am confident in stating that we in ComReg would not have been able to conduct our recent spectrum auction, which has provided 4G services to the Irish public and has raised in excess of &euro;850 million for the State, within the timescale in which we operated, nor would we have realised such a financial benefit for the Exchequer had these proposed measures been in place.  There is a fundamental issue of subsidiarity and proportionality involved. Ireland&rsquo;s national objectives and our intentions regarding spectrum use will inevitably be a low priority for the Commission, and a country of our size and population would probably be marginalised in any pan-European award process.  The implications for future revenues of the allocation of what is a national resource cannot be overlooked.  In ComReg&rsquo;s view, the Commission should concentrate on implementing existing arrangements for co-ordination among member states which have more balance between national interests and Europe-wide concerns.<\/p><p> There are other aspects of the proposal - European virtual access products and institutional changes to BEREC - that I will not address now.  They are covered in the background notes I have provided.<\/p><p> I referred earlier to BEREC's concerns, which are set out in the BEREC statements I have provided.  The statement identifies alternatives to each of the broad themes contained in the Commission&rsquo;s proposals.  ComReg and BEREC are also mindful of the views of the European Parliament, as contained in the report by Catherine Trautmann MEP, which will be voted on during plenary session tomorrow.  That report essentially calls for the Commission to conduct a proper integrated review of the framework instead of a having a disjointed piecemeal approach.  Above all, appropriate time must be afforded to the legislator to properly consider and examine all aspects of what has been proposed and, perhaps, aspects of the regulatory framework that have not been addressed in the Commission&rsquo;s proposals.<\/p><p> ComReg is available should the committee want a more detailed briefing on any aspect of the proposals as they have been presented or as they evolve.  We will be happy to take any questions that arise today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013102300004#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382518200,"counter":608,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Brien.

Two words ring in my mind, one of which is \"marginalised\".  It is believed that Ireland will be further marginalised.  This sets alarm bells ringing straight away.  Ms Licken spoke about the networks.  As it is, there are issues with the networks and there are rural areas where a network has been switched off for two or three days.  An issue arises over networks, not to mind the issue of our being further marginalised.  We must proceed with extreme caution because networks are fundamental.  If there is any attempt at centralisation to the detriment of various states, and if the word \"marginalised\" is being used cautiously by ComReg, it reflects greater concern over how marginalised we will be.  The Irish economy and society must be protected at all costs.  From the briefing, it seems the proposals are not for the betterment of Irish society.  Therefore, we must proceed with caution.<\/p><p>  The other phrase that I noted was \"plain-language contracts\".  ComReg has appeared before us many times.  The word \"gobbledegook\" was used in regard to contracts and documentation being sent to the ordinary punter.  From both briefings today, the concept of plain-language contracts was the only item I could salvage that was any way positive to Irish society.  Perhaps the delegates could elaborate on how Ireland could be marginalised and the context in which the word \"marginalised\" is being used.  Is it being used cautiously?

We need to devote a lot of time and effort to our discussions with the Commission, the Council of Europe, other member states, ComReg and BEREC on the implications to ensure we get it right.  There are many aspects that would be very good if we got it right, one of which would be the elimination of roaming.  Better consumer protection is good.  If the aim is furthering spectrum and service provision, that, too, will be good.  The net neutrality provisions are good.  All the aims are good; it is a question of ensuring the medicine is right and will achieve what is desired.<\/p><p>  When we say \"marginalised\", all we are really saying is that we just need to be careful to ensure that marginalisation is not an unintended impact of the proposal.<\/p> <p>I would have no hesitation in saying that it would not be an intended impact, but we must ensure it is not an unintended impact of the proposal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013102300005#G00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Katherine Licken","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1382518800,"counter":612,"content":"<p>I used the term \"marginalised\" in my opening presentation, and that is particularly relevant to the issue of spectrum.

On the issue of spectrum, what is proposed here, for instance, with regard to the scheduling of auctions and the duration of licences that would be granted through auctions or similar competitive processes is quite dramatic in terms of moving powers in this area to the European Commission.  There are five or six very large mobile operators in Europe, four of whom together account for approximately 60% of the European mobile market.  If the European Commission is to decide on the awarding of spectrum and when to schedule the process for Germany, France, Italy, Spain or Ireland, we would question whether Ireland would be to the forefront of the Commission's mind in the same way as it would be to the forefront of ComReg's.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013102300006#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1382518800,"counter":613,"content":"<p>Before I go to Deputy Coffey, the witnesses referred to the need for much more discussion on this, but I understand that April has been set as the deadline for concluding it.

Is this connected to companies in Ireland that are experiencing changes to their banking arrangements to bring them into line with EU practices?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013102300007#J00700","speaker":"1180"},{"type":"speech","time":1382519400,"counter":634,"content":"<p>I thank the delegation for its presentation.  I very much welcome any measures that will improve service and value for money offered to consumers.  However, we need to look at the logistical workings of how it can be achieved.  My main concern about this measure is that we are on the periphery.  In Ireland, rural areas often have to fight for service provision.  One can imagine that Ireland would be in a similar position in a single European market.  Rural areas would then find themselves down to a third tier, rather than the second tier they are currently in.<\/p><p>  I am also concerned about the timing of this measure, which is far from ideal.  In the new year, many MEPs will be more focused on their re-election campaigns.  Will this measure get the scrutiny it deserves at the European Parliament?  How much public consultation with consumers and other players in this area was conducted?  Was it entered into in any meaningful way?  Have the unintended consequences of this measure been analysed?<\/p><p>  I would be very slow to endorse any further erosion of control of our own matters.  This is an important area.  The revenue-raising potential of auctioning the spectrum for the State was referred to earlier and a figure of &euro;850 million was mentioned.

Obviously, Ireland is a country with rurally dispersed population, so this is also relevant to Deputy Griffin&rsquo;s questions.<\/p> <p>I will give some examples.  The universal service obligation means everybody is guaranteed the right to a network connection at a fixed point.  We guarantee the price for this will be the same throughout the country.  Seven or eight years ago ComReg licensed spectrum to be used to provide broadband in a way which had not been done in most of Europe.  Broadband was provided in rural areas which did not have access to it at the time and there was a big take-up of fixed wireless services.  The fixed networks are catching up with this and replacing it.  We are now working on how Eircom prices its wholesale broadband and bitstream products.  Much of what we are doing is examining the incentives for Eircom to invest outside urban areas and how we will ensure it does not overcharge or cut other operators out of the market.<\/p><p> These are three quickfire examples which are all undertaken more or less under existing Irish and European legislative frameworks.  We can do them because of the European Commission's proposals, not despite them.  The European Commission is our friend in giving these powers to regulators throughout Europe.  To date, it has given them in a way which allows for a degree of choice and flexibility at local level because they are directives which are transposed.

I will start by introducing my colleagues and saying a little about their backgrounds and why we consider ourselves competent to talk about nuclear power.  Dr. Tom O'Flaherty is a former chief executive of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, RPII; Mr. Denis Duff is a retired ESB mechanical engineer, while Professor Philip Walton is a professor emeritus from University College Galway.  I am a marine, mechanical and nuclear engineer and a former assistant to Dr. O'Flaherty at the RPII.  We are probably the most experienced and qualified group to advise on the use of nuclear power in this country.  Our collective experience covers reactor design, construction, commissioning, operation and maintenance.  It is important to point out that we have no vested interests in the nuclear power industry.  We are here to explain why many respected semi-State and other bodies have called for the use of nuclear energy to be considered in Ireland.  These include the Commission for Energy Regulation, EirGrid, the ESB, Airtricity, Engineers Ireland, the Irish Academy of Engineering, IBEC, the ICTU and Forf&aacute;s, as well as Senator Feargal Quinn.  In addition, a previous Oireachtas committee reported in June 2006 that \"it is imperative that there should be informed debate on nuclear-generated electricity\".  Sadly, however, all of these calls have been disregarded for some reason or other.  Mr.Duff will expand on and outline the actions we would like the committee to recommend to correct this sad and dangerous situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013102300009#M00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Turvey"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1382520300,"counter":643,"content":"<p>I thank the joint committee for inviting us.  I will briefly go through the presentation and outline some of the issues that may have led to the calls from all of the groups mentioned by Mr. Turvey for the consideration of the use of nuclear power in Ireland.  Our sources of energy are increasingly an important issue for Ireland and globally.  It is an interesting topic, one which is no less contentious as a result.  I will explain why we must act, outline a specific problem and briefly consider how nuclear energy can help.  I will finish with three recommendations for the committee to consider.  <\/p><p>  With regard to the reasons we must act, members are aware of the fifth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change which was issued last month.  There is up to a 99% certainty about the contribution of humans to the increase in global CO<sub>2<\/sub> levels.  The limit we want to achieve is 450 parts per million of CO<sub>2<\/sub>, thereby limiting global temperature increases to approximately 2 degrees Celsius.  We are the first <i>homo sapiens<\/i> to be breathing CO<sub>2<\/sub> at levels of 400 parts per million; the last time there were those levels of CO<sub>2<\/sub> on Earth <i>homo sapiens<\/i> had not yet evolved.  The implication of rising levels of CO<sub>2<\/sub> beyond 450 parts per million is that the global average temperature could rise to in excess of 22 degrees Fahrenheit, leading to massive uninhabitable areas such as those around the equator and in the tropics because of high temperatures, as well as increasing desertification.  It would also lead to rising sea levels.  It may take hundreds or thousands of years, but if all of the ice on the Earth melted, sea levels would increase by over 200 feet, affecting most of the constituencies represented by members, including counties Mayo, Sligo and Wexford, which would be under water.  London, the Netherlands and Belgium, as well as the eastern seaboard of the United States, would disappear.  I am trying to illustrate how this serious issue has a global impact and it will not go away.  There will be an impact in Ireland because we are part of the global community.  <\/p><p>  There are increasing costs associated with the mitigation of the increase in CO<sub>2<\/sub> levels.<\/p> <p> The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland and the ESRI estimate that by 2026 the cost of carbon will be &euro;27 per tonne.  The EPA has estimated that we will miss a minor target for 2020 by up to 25 million tonnes even if we do everything that we say we are going to do.  As Members can see, the cost could be well in excess by &euro;500 million by 2020.  <\/p><p> We are faced with a specific problem.  The Moneypoint coal generating station built instead of a nuclear generating station at Carnsore in the mid-1980s will come to its natural end of life, after 40 years, circa 2025 but there is no obvious replacement that we can see.  For instance, hydro power in Ireland is effectively fully utilised.  There is no more regular hydro power.  <\/p><p> Wind energy, while it is useful and will be necessary in the future, is not suitable for base load energy as it is intermittent.  For instance, when the wind does not blow no energy can be created.  Therefore, wind energy cannot be used to replace Moneypoint.<\/p><p> Wave and tidal power will also be very useful but is intermittent and likely to be extremely expensive.  The progress made in developing wave and tidal energy has been very disappointing.  In our 2006 energy policy we estimated that we would have 500 MW by 2020 but it looks extremely unlikely that we will reach anything near that amount.<\/p><p> Gas, while it would be suitable as a baseline replacement for Moneypoint, is not as clean as a lot of people think with emissions from a gas-fired station between 40% and 60% as high in carbon as a coal-fired station.  Gas would fit the bill technically and be able to supply the energy it would do so sufficiently cleanly to meet our needs post-2020.<\/p><p> One solution that is available at the moment is nuclear energy.  This week the UK has proposed that it will build at least one station and will, more than likely, develop the plan by building eight nuclear stations over the next decade or so.  Nuclear energy is acknowledged as being a low carbon option and is as clean as wind, solar and hydro energy.  Nuclear power is also competitive.  That is the reason the UK has opted for it and why stations are being built in the UK, China and India.  There are many stations being built.  In fact there are more nuclear stations being built, proposed and planned now than there were three years ago.  They are also suitable in terms of size and low change.  <\/p><p> I shall move on to talk about the reactions that my organisation is specifically interested in and thinks are game changers when it comes to nuclear power for Ireland.  The committee will be aware that nuclear submarines are powered by small power plants which have an extraordinarily good record in terms of safety and reliability.  People in the United State, China and India are developing power packs to make them suitable for power generation.  They will be built in factory with no reactor component larger than 13 ft. in order that it can fit on a railcar or on the back of a track and be easily transported.  Power packs will be built in factory, tested in factory and merely assembled on site and thereby reducing the overall site unit construction time, increased project certainty and dramatically reduced project risk and finance.  Such a development will have a great impact on the final cost of its electricity.  BENE has conducted a study on the matter.  We believe that we can easily undercut the cost that was announced this week for the UK's new nuclear programme due to the reactor's small size and the ease of construction.  A small reactor of approximately 200 MW is a suitable size for the Irish grid and is about the size of some units already operating here and smaller than some.  It is capable of load following which means that it can reduce load at night, which is very important for Ireland, and can also facilitate intermittent energy.  For instance, when wind energy rapidly increases the nuclear energy, if so wished, could ramp down. <\/p><p> We expect that the first small reactors will be built in 2019 and that they will become commercially available in 2021 or 2022.  The timing is perfect in order for us to consider a replacement for Moneypoint in 2025.   <\/p><p> In conclusion, I shall outline three recommended actions that I would like the committee to consider.  First, we recommend that Ireland's energy policy includes an objective consideration of nuclear energy.  Second, we hope that the committee will recommend an official study into the impact of small modular reactors as a replacement for Moneypoint.  Third, we hope that the committee recommends the repeal of section 18(6) of the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 which disallows the consideration or implementation of nuclear power in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013102300009#M00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Denis Duff","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382520900,"counter":645,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Duff for his presentation.

I have considered the option and examined the matter.  Let us say a coal-fired station with carbon capture and storage was proposed.  I imagine there would still be massive opposition to such a proposal.  There was massive opposition to benign generators such as wind turbines.  Ireland has become a nation of objectors but perhaps we are a globe of objectors.  I have formed the opinion that there would still be massive opposition even if we set aside a 20 acre bank of land and told people that we would do nothing with the land.<\/p><p>  Nuclear power has one benefit over distributed energy systems such as wind.  However, I am not trying to knock wind power but use it for comparative purposes.  Wind turbines would be pervasive so, therefore, the protest will be pervasive.  A nuclear power station on the site of Moneypoint, an existing power station site, would concentrate the objections on the technology and one location.  We already have electricity pylons to bring energy from Moneypoint as far as Dublin and Meath so there would no longer be pervasive objections.<\/p><p>  A number of unofficial opinion polls in the likes of <i>www.thejournal.ie<\/i> and various academic research suggests a different response to certain questions.  I shall read one opinion poll from <i>www.thejournal.ie <\/i>that has been handed to me which stated that 57% of participants were in favour of considering nuclear power.  BENE has travelled around the country and conducted many debates with the public and academic organisations.

It is my estimation that if a scientific poll was conducted now a significant group of people would oppose nuclear energy.  Many people are greatly concerned about nuclear power and concern has been generated by global accidents and global issues that have erupted around the use of nuclear power.  The benefits have been well made by the organisation.  However, the 1999 Act was the result of a lot of public opinion.  The main players, such as EirGrid and the energy people, have said that nuclear energy should be considered but have not gone beyond that point.  <\/p> <p>I would make the point in regard to Moneypoint.  To be quite frank, I do not think the people are in a position to consider it.  Judging by the reaction around the country to the erection of pylons and windmills either 500 m or a kilometre from houses, if one were to go down the road of nuclear plants there would be huge opposition.  There are concerns about international disasters and the spin-offs from those disasters that have lasted for lifetimes.

Nuclear power has been a very controversial issue in Germany over the years.  It has been on again and off again.  Germany's latest decision was a knee-jerk reaction, and I would not be surprised if it changed its mind again.  Because of its decision, it is importing about 8,000 MW of electricity - the equivalent of the power produced by eight generating stations.  Most of that is coming from the surrounding countries of France and the Czech Republic and is largely from nuclear sources.  Thus, Germany is shutting down its own plants but is bringing in energy from other nuclear power plants.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013102300011#O01200","nonspeaker":"Professor Philip Walton"},{"type":"speech","time":1382521500,"counter":666,"content":"<p>Is it the trend that developing countries are going with nuclear energy whereas developed countries are taking the opposite view?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013102300011#O01300","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1382521500,"counter":667,"content":"<p>No; Germany stands alone.

Twenty-eight countries have nuclear power and 18 new countries are planning or proposing to go nuclear.  Pre-Fukushima, the number was 17.  Therefore, the accident has not put people off.  Currently there are 70 plants under construction; before the Fukushima accident there were 62.  It is interesting to look at some countries.  For example, Belarus, which is right beside Ukraine, where the Chernobyl accident took place, has not had nuclear power but is planning two reactors and a further two are proposed.  Ukraine, where the accident happened, has 15 and is planning two and proposing a further 11.  In the oil-rich countries of the Middle East, the United Arab Emirates is currently building two nuclear power plants, planning two and proposing ten, and Saudi Arabia is planning 16.

It is important to be aware that with regular fossil fuel power stations, waste is emitted into the atmosphere.  For example, a coal fired station in Moneypoint would release 5 million tonnes of CO2 per annum, plus other gases.  However, the waste or spent fuel from an equivalent sized nuclear power station would only extend to about 5 cu. m per annum.  Also, we would know where that waste was, as it would be stored.  It would be cooled for a number of years and then stored and we would know exactly where it was and could manage it.<\/p><p>  Technically, there are a number of storage solutions.  One would be to store the waste underground in safe geological areas.  There is such a safe area being built in Finland.  A similar solution has been proposed in the United States, while Sweden is also on the cusp of announcing where its geological storage areas will be.  If we decide we do not want to put the waste in geological storage areas, it could be reprocessed and turned into new nuclear fuel.  Another breed of reactors which may be ten or 15 years away will use this used nuclear fuel that we call waste today.  They are called breeder reactors and will produce 60 times more energy from the fuel used first time around.  Technically, therefore, there is a solution to the issue of waste.<\/p><p>  Waste is not an issue that has been hugely problematic for the industry to date, although I accept it has caused huge public concern.  The civil nuclear industry is probably 50 or 60 years old and, in general, no attempt is made to store spent fuel until approximately 50 years after its use.  Therefore, waste is not a major issue because the quantities are small and manageable.<\/p><p>  On the Chairman's question about advanced and emerging nations, there are a number of reactors in emerging nations.  However, there are not so many in advanced nations.  The United Kingdom has just announced that it is to build a reactor.  Finland is building a reactor, as is France.

If we were to have a small modular reactor, SMR, at Moneypoint, would Ireland need a parallel alternative power station in case something happened to the modular reactor?  <\/p><p>  The group has recommended that we consider the issue of nuclear energy objectively and an official study of the impact of an SMR as a replacement for the Moneypoint power station.

It is important that we continue to discuss all energy options regarding the country's future needs.  We should not dismiss any source of energy, including nuclear energy.  It is important that any modern economy or society debate the issues publicly and consider all options.  Unfortunately for the nuclear sector, there is significant negativity surrounding it.  Its positive aspects are its competitiveness, the use of clean technology and its capacity.  However, the public's perception is that there is significant negativity surrounding safety issues owing to what has happened in the past, including explosions in places such as Fukushima and Chernobyl.  These disasters are in the minds of members of the public in Ireland and globally and we must acknowledge that they form a huge barrier for the sector to overcome.  Deputy Moynihan has mentioned that the appetite of the people for nuclear energy is questionable at this time, but that does not mean we should not debate the issue.  For this reason it is important that BENE put its proposals before us in order that we can debate them and inform ourselves.  That is welcome.  We should not dismiss proposals out of hand because technology has moved on.  The climate change debate will provide huge challenges for this country and the rest of the world.<\/p><p>  There is an ongoing debate in Ireland on the issue of renewable energy, with objections being raised to wind farm proposals and so on.  Some people who are totally opposed to the use of nuclear energy are also opposed to wind farms.  I see this as the great dilemma for Irish society.  We need to ask ourselves from where will we get the energy we need to sustain us into the future.  Some suggest we will become a net exporter of renewable energy supplies, but I do not see how that will happen if we continue to have so many objections.  It seems nobody wants to have anything in his or her area.  We can expect a significant energy demand in the future, but where will we source that energy?<\/p><p>  Given that interconnectors have already been developed between the North of Ireland and Scotland and the east of Ireland and Wales and it is proposed to develop an interconnector between the south of Ireland and France, we are probably already importing nuclear generated energy supplies.  Will the delegates clarify whether that is the case?  Are people happy to do this?  Obviously, they are if we are already doing so.  <\/p><p>  Is there a need for another nuclear power station, given that there be such significant interconnectivity?

The group states it will reach end of life in 2025.  I am not sure what proposals exist in that regard.  The group states that a conversion to nuclear energy would be an option.  I am from Waterford and I am aware that in Great Island, in Wexford in the south east, they are already quite advanced in a project to convert from oil to gas and increase the capacity of generation, from 240 MW to 460 MW.  Would something similar at Moneypoint be a solution rather than taking the nuclear option?  Those are merely some points of debate and questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013102300012#P00800","speaker":"1092","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1382522700,"counter":675,"content":"<p>Deputy Coffey made some very good comments.  There is a real problem which must be recognised that Moneypoint has to be replaced.  It is very big, much bigger than Great Island.  Coal must be discontinued and there is no solution clearly decided at this point for what will replace Moneypoint.<\/p><p>  Interconnection, which was raised by Deputy Colreavy, is there in the background.  Whether there is interconnection or not, there are issues about how much generation we must have in this country in any case.<\/p><p>  I recognise completely the elephant in the room, as mentioned by the Chairman and as emphasised by Deputy Moynihan, is that public acceptance would be enormously difficult to achieve.  There is a strong element of burying one's head in the sand in stating that, because public acceptance would be a problem ten years from now, we will not even think about it and we will rule nuclear energy out and hope that something will turn up to solve our problem when on the face of it, technically, and, we are fairly confident, economically, nuclear energy would be a valid solution.  Our plea is to recommend that nuclear energy be considered as part of the planning of energy.<\/p><p>  The problem of section 18(6) of the 1999 Act is, I would say to Deputy Colreavy, a chicken-and-egg situation.  One could say we can do all this looking at it and leave that provision there, and that could happen.  The reality is that there has been no official agency because of that provision, which considers it to be within its responsibility to look at whether nuclear energy could be a good idea.  That is why it is left to a purely voluntary group such as ourselves to bring the subject forward at all.  This is a real deficiency in public planning.  That is why we believe it is important that the committee recommend at least that nuclear energy be included on its merits as part of the consideration of energy planning and, ideally, that the section of the 1999 Act to which I refer would be repealed, in the short term rather than in the long term.<\/p><p>  There were one or two other points.  I mentioned the interconnector.  On the backup that Deputy Colreavy raised, there always has to be in the generation system enough back-up so that if any station is lost, either for a short time or even for many months, the system can carry on.  Obviously, there would be a cost penalty in losing a big station but there must be provision to keep the lights on.<\/p><p>  As to who would meet the cost, it would have to be a commercial proposition funded, we believe, by the private sector, by a nuclear supplier from abroad or by a consortium of that kind as in the case of the UK currently.

We do not have enough of that in this country.  Too often, it is five-year programmes for Government or budgets that might look 12 or 14 months in advance.  We do not have enough of long-term planning.  It is encouraging that the group is raising something here that will be an issue, in particular, from 2025, but that relates to much further in the future as well.  I understand it is something that we need to address much sooner but it is important.<\/p><p>  I welcome an objective debate on this.  We need to be looking at every option when we talk about future energy generation and because we do not necessarily agree with something, it does not mean that we should not have a discussion on it.  In terms of discussing future energy, we need to consider all of our options, including nuclear energy, and check both the viability and pros and cons of it.  My personal view is it is not a suitable option for Ireland.  That said, I am open to hearing the arguments and the views.<\/p><p>  There are a couple of points I picked up on earlier.  There was a list of countries mentioned as expanding in nuclear energy and none of them hopped out at me as being great bastions of democracy.  China, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Belarus and the Ukraine were all listed.  Maybe at that point there were a few alarm bells ringing.<\/p> <p>I hope nobody in those countries is watching the committee meeting on the live stream.  France was mentioned.  When we discuss this issue we need to focus on the alternatives.  There is massive potential in this country in terms of tidal wave energy and one hopes that with improved technology this might be a more realistic option by 2025.  There is further potential in hydroelectric energy and micro-generation.<\/p><p> The event at Fukushima was referred to as an accident.  It certainly was a disaster.  What happened at Chernobyl was an accident in that man-made errors brought it about.  At Fukushima, however, although more provisions might have been put in place to prevent what happened, a natural disaster was the main contributing factor.  In the overall discussion about nuclear energy, no matter how much safety provision is put in place one cannot allow for such events as massive seismic activity.  With regard to Moneypoint, for example, if at some stage in the future there were to be a huge seismic event in the north Atlantic - or near the Canary Islands, an area often cited as requiring only time for such an event to occur - I can imagine the disaster that would ensue if a massive tsunami hit the west coast of the country.  Such possibilities must be factored in.  Another point is that countries such as France, which has major nuclear power generation, also has considerable military security, which we do not.  In the post 9-11 world that is a consideration that must be included.  <\/p><p> Could we get some more information on the small modular reactors, SMRs?  What is their capacity, the associated costs and the timescale involved, and how do these differ from those of conventional stations we are used to, such as Chernobyl and Sellafield, or from some of the newer stations being built in the UK?  I refer to the 1999 Act and the repeal of the section in question.  I take on board what was said about the chicken and the egg.

I would like to see more studies done and have much more detail on how the equation of nuclear energy could solve our climate change problems.

I am glad Deputy Griffin mentioned long-term planning, which is what we want.  We are asking for long-term consideration of this point.  The Deputy asked for examples of democratic countries with nuclear power.  There are two very good ones in Scandinavia.  Finland has had plebiscites about whether to go for nuclear energy and has decided to go ahead.  It also had a plebiscite on a waste repository, which is being built at the same time.  Sweden gets about 30% of its electricity from ten plants.  It had a plebiscite and was considering shutting down the plants.  The unions were up in arms and in the end the decision was reversed, with Sweden continuing to use nuclear power.<\/p><p>  Deputy Colreavy spoke about SMRs and asked whether back-up would be required.  This is exactly what is required for wind energy.  Wind energy across Ireland can fail totally and there must be back-up, which must be costed in when considering the price of wind energy.  A group of SMRs would be involved and not all of them would fail.  There might be six of them, but the chances of all six failing at once would be negligible.  Each one provides approximately 200 megawatts.

Suppose we find that, as today, gas energy is not clean enough.  Suppose we find that hydroelectric energy is fully utilised in this country.  Where will we go?  There is a long lead time in developing any technology.  There are very few technologies and we can see none available at this time.  Potentially there is pump storage, such as the offshore Spirit of Ireland schemes that people would have heard about, but there has been very little progress since these were first mooted five years ago.  We could have carbon capture and storage plants - coal-fired or gas-fired stations with carbon capture and storage.  That is in design, but there is no guarantee it will become an available technology by 2025 because it is not looking very healthy.  We do not know what its costs would be.<\/p><p>  It is a very difficult issue.  We can see no alternative at present.  It will be a difficult fight but this is something we should really start to work on now.  Let us examine the facts and see what our options are and what we need to do.  Do we need to educate ourselves in the first place and then the public?  Are we going to go down an entirely different road, take our chances and see what happens?  I do not think it would cost too much money to have an independent group looking at the option of an SMR to replace Moneypoint.

We would love to give the committee a presentation on them at some stage, or perhaps the environment committee, an excellent suggestion from Deputy Phelan.   Members could see that these reactors would be built where they are seismically insulated, perhaps in a large tub of water.  In the event that all power was lost to these reactors, they can cool themselves naturally, without any external power, because of their size and design.  Therefore, the type of accident that happened at Fukushima has been taken into account.<\/p> <p>The reactor at Chernobyl where another accident occurred was of a completely different design, one which would not be allowed in Ireland or anywhere else in the West.  It would be physically impossible for such an accident to occur at one of the reactors to which we are referring.<\/p><p> On the question of small modular reactors, SMRs, versus nuclear power stations, Deputy Griffin has inquired how long construction takes.  The United Kingdom is building what is called a European pressurised reactor, EPR, and hopes to complete the project in eight years.  The projects involving these reactors have always extended beyond their design-construction periods.  The one in Finland is wandering on and on, while the one in France is going to be late.  I have no doubt that the reactor project in the United Kingdom will also be late.  That is one of the benefits of SMRs.  These reactors are built and tested in factories and then assembled on site.  The estimated construction time is between 18 months to three years and depends on the manufacture and size.  Those involved are much more confident that they will be able to achieve these build times.

The first involves the cost per megawatt or per megawatt hour.  In the United Kingdom they have reached a contract price of &pound;92.50 per megawatt hour.  This equates to 9.25 pence per unit.  Estimating the cost in Ireland is difficult because we are only an amateur group.  From our estimations, however, the cost would depend on the level of support from the Government and the people.  That support would influence the project in terms of the level of certainty with regard to it proceeding.  Other issues which must be factored in are the likelihood of protests during the construction phase, whether construction would be delayed and whether there would be Government support while construction was taking place.  These all impact on the cost of finance and have a knock-on effect in terms of the cost of electricity.  We have estimated that if everything went really well - we do not expect that it will - we could generate energy for 5 cent per unit.

If we were to change the balance to such an extent that energy would be cheaper here than in the United Kingdom, we could export energy supplies via the interconnector.  Rather than Ireland being obliged to pay another &euro;500 million, perhaps the United Kingdom will pay for the next interconnector built.  We are also liable for a transmission charge and there are losses across the interconnector.  Instead of taking power supplies at cost from the United Kingdom and absorbing transmission losses and the cost of the interconnector, we could be supplying that jurisdiction with energy supplies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013102300015#S00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Denis Duff"},{"type":"speech","time":1382523900,"counter":690,"content":"<p>What would be the cost of constructing an SMR?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013102300015#S00400","speaker":"1051"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1382523900,"counter":691,"content":"<p>We did not carry out a study of a single SMR.
