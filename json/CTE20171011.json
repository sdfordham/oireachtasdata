I welcome members and viewers watching these proceedings on Oireachtas TV.  Before we commence our formal proceedings today, I wish to point out that the Honourable Ms Justice Mary Laffoy, Chairperson of the Citizen's Assembly, has written to me to provide clarification in relation to a recommendation of the assembly in respect of reason 13 regarding no restriction as to reason.  Members will recall that this matter was discussed at last week's meeting when it was raised by Deputies Rabbitte and Coppinger.  In order to clarify the matter I will now read the letter from Ms Justice Laffoy, dated 11 October 2017, into the record.<\/p><blockquote>Dear Senator Noone,<br \/><br \/>I refer to an exchange that occurred during the committee hearing last Wednesday, 4 October, about the specific recommendation made by the Assembly in Reason 13 on Ballot 48 on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution.<br \/><br \/>I am aware you read the exact percentages of that vote into the record subsequently for clarity.  However I am aware that some recent media reports may have engendered some confusion on this issue also.  As such, I think it would be of assistance if I reiterated the recommendation of the Assembly in regard to Reason 13.<br \/><br \/>  The precise wording of Reason 13 was &lsquo;no restriction as to reasons&rsquo;.  The recommendation of the Assembly (by a majority of 64%) was that termination of pregnancy with no restriction as to reasons should be lawful here, but this was further qualified by the Members views on gestational limitations or none.  In relation to gestational limits, those Members had further expressed their view on the Ballot as to whether termination of pregnancy should be permitted up to 12 weeks gestation only, up to 22 weeks gestation only, or with no restriction as to gestational age.  The option which achieved the highest number of votes here was<i>up to 12 weeks gestation only<\/i>with 48% voting for this option.  Accordingly the recommendation of the Assembly for Reason 13 is that termination of pregnancy should be permitted with no restriction as to reasons, but up to 12 weeks gestation only.<br \/><br \/>  According to the resolution approving establishment of the Assembly: &quot;all matters before the Assembly will be determined by a majority of votes of members present and voting, other than the Chairperson who will have a casting vote in the case of an equality of votes&quot;.<br \/><br \/>  Full details on the voting arrangements and procedure are provided on pages e825 to e828 of the Report, and the Members of the Committee may wish to familiarise themselves with this note, which was provided to the Members of the Assembly in advance of the meeting in April.<br \/><br \/>  I hope this provides full clarification on the matter.<br \/><br \/>Yours sincerely,<br \/><br \/>The Hon. Mary Laffoy<br \/><br \/>Chairperson<br \/><br \/>The Citizens' Assembly.<\/blockquote> <p>That was for clarification purposes. <\/p><p>Before I introduce our witnesses today, at the request of the broadcasting and recording services, members and visitors are asked to ensure that for the duration of the meeting their mobile phones are turned off completely or switched to aeroplane mode.  The gentlemen in our technical department have advised that some phones have been left on, which has caused interference.  On behalf of the committee I extend a warm welcome to our witnesses today, who will be addressing international developments in the provision of health care services in the area of termination of pregnancies.  We are joined by Dr. Abigail Aiken, assistant professor at the Lyndon B. Johnson, LBJ, School of Public Affairs, Texas, USA and by Dr. Ronald Johnson and Dr. Bela Ganatra, both of whom are from the department of reproductive health and research at the World Health Organization, WHO.  They are all very welcome to this afternoon's meeting and I thank them for their attendance.<\/p><p>Before we commence formal proceedings I must advise our witnesses of the situation regarding privilege.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p><p>I now invite Dr. Aiken to make her presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017101100002#J00200","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507723200,"counter":7,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for inviting me here today to testify.  My name is Abigail Aiken and I am assistant professor at the LBJ School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas at Austin.  I have been asked to address the committee on international developments in the provision of health care services in the area of termination of pregnancy.  I will focus specifically on how these developments have affected the ways in which Irish women access abortion.<\/p> <p>  Most abortions in Europe take place in clinical settings and are divided into &ldquo;surgical&rdquo; abortions and &ldquo;medical&rdquo; or &ldquo;medication&rdquo; abortions.  In Ireland, however, women do not have access to these clinical services and between 1970 and 2016, at least 184,000 Irish women have travelled to England and Wales to access abortion in a clinic.  Since 2006 however, a non-profit, online tele-medicine service called Women on Web has provided early medication abortion in countries where safe, legal services are not available.  Under this model, a woman fills out an online consultation form, including information about her gestational age, co-morbidities and contraindications.  A medical doctor reviews the consultation form and, if appropriate, approves the request and prescribes the medications mifepristone and misoprostol which are used in medication abortion.  Both medications are on the WHO's list of essential medicines and Women on Web prescribes them in the dose regimen for medication abortion recommended by WHO.<\/p> <p>  After the woman makes a donation of between &euro;70 and &euro;90, or however much she can afford, a partner organisation dispatches the medications and they reach her by mail.  Once the woman receives the medications, she takes them at home using the clear, simple instructions provided to her by email from Women on Web.  Information, advice, and support are provided in close-to-real-time via an online help desk, again through email.  All women receive information about the signs of potential complications and instructions for seeking in-person medical attention. Three weeks later, women are asked to fill out an online evaluation reporting the clinical outcome of the abortion and their experiences using the service.<\/p><p>Women in Ireland have been accessing early medication abortion through this online telemedicine model since 2007.  Exhibit 1 shows that since 2010, the first year for which data are available, the number of Irish women requesting early medication abortion through Women on Web has more than tripled, from 548 in 2010 to 1,748 in 2016.  These numbers include women in both Ireland and Northern Ireland because it is often very difficult to distinguish between the two.  Since 2014, other telemedicine services have also been available, so the numbers for 2015 and 2016 are lower bounds.<br\/><br\/>By contrast, exhibit 2 shows the number of Irish and Northern Irish women travelling abroad to England and Wales.  It shows that between 2002 and 2016, the number has fallen by almost 50%, from 7,913 in 2002 to 3,992 in 2016.  The number accessing telemedicine has increased and the number travelling to England and Wales has declined.<br\/><br\/>Who are the Irish women who access abortion through online telemedicine?  Exhibit 3A shows the age distribution and 3B shows the parity of women in Ireland who accessed this early medication abortion through Women on Web between 2010 and 2015.  This is a sample size of 5,650 women.  Members can see that women of all reproductive ages are represented, with the most common age groups being between 30 and 34 years, representing 26% of all requests, and between 25 and 29 years, representing 24% of all requests.  Exhibit 3B shows that the majority, 63%, are mothers.<br\/><br\/>The pregnancy circumstances of the same 5,650 women are displayed in exhibit 4.  What members can see is that the majority of women, 54%, were using contraception when they first became pregnant and thus experienced a contraceptive failure.  Some 44% of them reported that they were not using contraception when they became pregnant.  To put this figure in context, consider that the unmet need for contraception is twice as high in Ireland compared to Great Britain, at 11.2% compared to 5.1%.  Finally, only 2% reported requesting early medication abortion due to rape.  We know that in Ireland, rape is an under-reported crime.  Less than 32% of survivors in 2015 reported that incident to the Garda.<br\/><br\/>Why do Irish women request abortions?  Irish women&rsquo;s reasons for requesting them through online telemedicine are shown in exhibit 5.  We can see that by far the most common reason, cited by 62% of women, is being unable to bring up a child at this time in their lives.  We did some in-depth interviews with a sample of these women and they revealed that this category included, but was not limited to, being in a physically or emotionally abusive relationship, being unable to provide for existing children with the addition of another child, and being physically or emotionally unequipped for a pregnancy.  These statistics mirror the reasons for abortion among Irish women who travel to clinics in England and Wales.  Some 96% of abortions to women who travel to England and Wales are performed under ground C of the 1967 Abortion Act, which allows for abortion when the continuation of the pregnancy would involve risk, greater than if the pregnancy were terminated, of injury to the physical or mental health of the woman.  The remaining 4% of those abortions to women who travel are performed under ground E, for severe foetal anomaly.<br\/><br\/>In light of the recommendations of the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly with respect to the allowable grounds for abortion up to 12 weeks of gestation, it is worth noting that the Irish women who are accessing online telemedicine are under ten weeks of gestation at the time of their request.  Similarly, 85% of abortions to Irish women who travel to England and Wales occur at under ten weeks of gestation, and almost all, 92%, at under 13 weeks.<br\/><br\/>How do Irish women make the decision about whether to travel offshore to England and Wales or access abortion through online telemedicine?  Section A, which I will not put up on members' screens but which they have in their packets, shows data from in-depth interviews with Irish women who have used online telemedicine and illustrates some of the reasons women choose this option.  Reasons include the significant expense and logistical difficulties of travel, the increased privacy, comfort, and dignity of managing medication abortion at home, and a preference for conducting the abortion at the earliest possible gestational age.  Travel is often associated with delays in seeking care; people want to do this early.  I cannot give the members all the examples but I will read one given by Mairead, who is 32 years old:  She stated:<\/p><blockquote>I really didn't want to travel at all.  The whole thing was just so stressful and the idea of having to go to a foreign country on my own and go through it on my own was just horrendous.  So, if I'm able to get hold of abortion pills and do it at home that's a better and a much cheaper option.  The idea of having to go do it in some random clinic in England is just awful.  At home, my friend was able to support me through it all and it made an absolutely massive difference.  The idea of having to travel alone and go through that on my own in a foreign country is just unthinkable.<\/blockquote><p>When Irish women choose this online telemedicine model, what are their experiences?  Exhibit 6 shows the feelings reported by 1,000 women who went through the early medication abortion with Women on Web between 2010 and 2012.  Members should note that these do not add up to 100 because most people chose more than one feeling.  By far the most commonly reported feeling was relief - that was about 70% of women - followed by satisfaction at about 36%.  Many reported a mix of emotions, for example, feeling both sad and relieved or feeling both loss and empowerment.  Among the sample, 98% felt they had made the right choice and would recommend the at-home telemedicine model to another woman in Ireland in a similar situation.<br\/><br\/>Sections B and C in the qualitative packets show data from in-depth interviews with Irish women documenting their experiences both with online telemedicine and with travel.  Women who travelled often struggled to cover the financial cost, which can be over &euro;1,000.  They had difficulty finding child care and getting time off work and therefore losing more money that they could not afford, and they experienced stigma and shame, as well as the trauma of managing side effects from an abortion on their way home.  One could be bleeding sitting in a plane.  To give an example, Emma, who is 24 years old, stated:<\/p><blockquote>So basically when you get to the airport and you get on that flight, it&rsquo;s kind of known, that this very early flight is the flight people take.  You&rsquo;re waiting to board the plane and you can see the other women and you all know you&rsquo;re there for the same reason and to be honest, there&rsquo;s this horrible immediate sense of shame that comes with it and it&rsquo;s very overwhelming.  But the very worst part was when I got back to the airport afterwards and had to wait five hours to get a plane home, sitting there feeling I&rsquo;d just committed a crime.  I was so traumatised by that travel experience I still can&rsquo;t wrap my head around it.<\/blockquote><p>Women who used online telemedicine instead of travelling commonly describe a contrast between the acceptability of the abortion itself and the anxiety of being found out and potentially prosecuted.  I will give members an example from Stacey, who is a 27 year old mother of two.  She stated:<\/p><blockquote>The procedure was very straightforward and it did feel very safe with all the information they gave.  I had some anxiety that if something had gone wrong, as can happen with any safe medication, it&rsquo;s hard to know who can I trust - would I incriminate myself?  All these things are going through your head because I wasn&rsquo;t able to do this legally.  So, I had all of that extra anxiety.<\/blockquote><p>At-home use of abortion medications obtained using online telemedicine has been demonstrated to be both highly effective and safe.  Exhibit 7 is a table showing the clinical outcomes of abortion for 1,000 Irish women who accessed Women on Web between 2010 and 2012.  Members can see in the first column that, overall, 99% of women were able to end their pregnancy, and 95% were able to do that without a surgical intervention to help them complete the abortion.  These outcomes compare favourably to those for medication abortion, the same type of abortion performed in a clinical setting, up to the same gestational age.<br\/><br\/>In exhibit 8 members can see the treatment for post-abortion complications among the same group of 1,000 women who used online telemedicine.  Overall, 3% received treatment for any adverse event, 2.6% were given antibiotics, less than 1% required a blood transfusion for very heavy bleeding, and no deaths were reported.  These complication rates, while still very low, are slightly higher than in the clinical setting.  However, since outcomes are self-reported, there is no way to judge whether the appropriate treatment was given to someone or whether unnecessary treatments were given just in case.<br\/><br\/>Although early medication abortion provided through online telemedicine can be shown to be safe and effective in terms of a clinical outcome, the current Irish abortion law limits the information and support that Irish health care professionals can provide to women.  Section D illustrates a variety of experiences that Irish women seeking abortion or seeking follow-up care after abortion have had with health care professionals in Ireland.  These range from encountering hostile attitudes, to being provided with inadequate information, to being too afraid to speak to a health care professional for fear of a negative reaction or being reported to the authorities.  An example of that is from Adele, who is 29 and a mother of four.  She stated:<\/p><blockquote>God no, I couldn&rsquo;t talk to any doctors about it, definitely not, because I was just so scared.  You hear these horror stories of women getting arrested and imprisoned.  So, I was completely alone.  I did go in when I found at first I was pregnant when I didn't know what I was going to do and I went in and said, &ldquo;okay, I'm pregnant&rdquo;, but I obviously never told them any of my intentions.  And their reaction was just like, &ldquo;great, you're pregnant, we'll put you in for your 12-week scan&rdquo;.  But I couldn&rsquo;t say anything because you don't know how they're going to react.<\/blockquote><p>She could not talk about her thinking or her feelings to anybody because she did not know the reaction she would get.<br\/><br\/>Some Irish women may be unable to avail of either travel or online telemedicine.  Moreover, even those who do manage to access one of them are often in precarious positions in that it is touch and go as to whether they can do it.<br\/><br\/>Section E in the qualitative packet makes plain the consequences of this lack of access to safe abortion care.  Through in-depth interviews, Irish women described the methods they would have had to resort to or which others sometimes would have made them resort to through coercion had online telemedicine or travel not been accessible.<\/p><p>Very unfortunately, these include coat hangers, starvation, high doses of vitamin C, strenuous exercise, large quantities of alcohol, scalding water, drinking bleach, throwing themselves downstairs or running into traffic.  Rebecca, who is one example of cases given in a package of information members will have received, is 39 years old and has two children.  She explains:<\/p><blockquote>I was walking up to 20 km every day.  I was doing sit ups, I was doing squats.  I was doing anything I could possibly do to make this happen.  I don't think I ate for several days because I had read that if you have an extremely low calorie count and ... [you take] vitamin C that can cause a miscarriage.  I was actually reading pregnancy sites that warn you not to do things and everything they were warning you not to do was exactly what I was doing; roasting hot baths to the point that I almost scalded myself, and when I think about it I'm an educated woman, do you know, I'm a grown woman.  It's just so sad.<\/blockquote><p>The lack of abortion services within the formal health care system in Ireland means that to access safe and effective care, Irish women must rely either on travel to a clinic offshore or on online telemedicine.  Travel carries a significant cost in terms of financial, social, physical, and emotional resources and is out of reach for many.  Online telemedicine circumvents many of these costs and is safe and effective, but carries considerable legal risk, which also limits the supporting role Irish health care professionals can play for women when they are faced with these pregnancies.  Irish women who need abortions are not restricted to any one demographic group or reason for needing care.  Some need later abortions because of foetal anomaly or serious health risks that develop during pregnancy, but the vast majority fall under the broad category where the risks posed to their physical and mental health of continuing the pregnancy outweigh the equivalent risks of ending the pregnancy, and almost all are under 13 weeks pregnant by the time of their abortion. Medically, the gold standard of care would be to legislate for safe, legal, accessible abortion care services throughout Ireland that will meet the needs of the women who need to rely on them.  I thank the members for their time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017101100002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Abigail Aiken","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507723200,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Aiken for her opening statement.

We thank the committee for its invitation to the World Health Organization, WHO, to present our guidance on health system requirements for safe abortion and potential barriers for women wishing to access services.<\/p> <p>  My colleague, Dr. Ganatra, and I are staff members from the department of reproductive health and research and the special programme of research, development and research training in human reproduction.  The department and the special programme provide leadership on matters critical to sexual and reproductive health and rights through shaping the global research agenda, co-ordinating research, setting norms and standards, articulating an evidence and human rights-based approach, and providing technical support to WHO member states on sexual and reproductive health and rights.<\/p> <p>  The Department&rsquo;s vision is the attainment by all peoples of the highest possible level of sexual and reproductive health.  It strives for a world where all women's and men's rights to enjoy sexual and reproductive health are promoted and protected and all people, including the most vulnerable, have access to sexual and reproductive health information and services.  The briefing today falls under our technical support role and through the organization&rsquo;s aim to support member states to implement the Global Strategy for Women&rsquo;s, Children's and Adolescents' Health 2016-2030, the strategy on women's health and well-being in the WHO European region, and the Action plan on sexual and reproductive health: towards achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in Europe, which was adopted by European governments last September.<\/p> <p>  Today&rsquo;s briefing is about the provision of safe abortion services in the event that some or all of the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly become national policy.  While legal, regulatory, policy and service delivery contexts may vary from country to country, the recommendations and best practices described in WHO guidelines aim to enable evidence-based decision-making with respect to safe abortion care.  Today, briefly, we will cover the following points, as described in the WHO guidelines: integration of abortion services into the health system; national standards and guidelines; the equitable distribution and availability of facilities and health care providers; preparation and equipping of health facilities; financing and costs to women; and potential barriers to women accessing services.<\/p> <p>  Abortion services should be integrated into the health system to acknowledge their status as legitimate health services and to protect against stigmatisation and discrimination of women and health care providers.  At a minimum, abortion services should always include medically accurate information and, if requested by the woman, non-directive counselling, to facilitate informed decision-making; abortion services delivered without delay; timely treatment for abortion complications; and contraceptive information, services and referrals.<\/p> <p>  National evidence-based standards and guidelines for safe abortion should be developed and regularly updated to ensure that health services and standards ensure good access and quality of care.  They should cover types of abortion service and where and by whom they can be provided; essential equipment, instruments, medications, supplies and facility capabilities; referral mechanisms; respect for women's informed decision-making, autonomy, confidentiality and privacy; attention to the special needs of adolescents; special provisions for women who have suffered rape; and conscientious objection by health care facilities and health care personnel.<\/p> <p>  Ensuring access to safe abortion requires the availability of facilities and trained providers within reach of the entire population.  Regulation of providers and facilities should be based on evidence of best practices and be aimed at ensuring safety and good quality without compromising accessibility to services.  First trimester abortion care can be provided using a simple procedure, vacuum aspiration, or through the use of medical abortion drugs, mifepristone and misoprostol.  These interventions can be provided at primary care level and through outpatient services.  Such care can also be provided by generalist physicians as well as primary care providers like clinical officers and nurses.  In early pregnancy, after the initial assessment by a provider, women can manage the medical abortion process without direct supervision and outside of a facility setting.  For abortions beyond 12 weeks of pregnancy, higher level services may be needed, although a surgical abortion can still be provided as outpatient care.  Facilities for inpatient care are required for medical abortion beyond 12 weeks of pregnancy.  In addition, referral hospitals should have the staff and capacity to perform abortions in all circumstances permitted by the law and to manage all abortion complications.<\/p> <p>  Abortion facilities and providers must be well prepared and equipped to provide safe care.  Most of the equipment, medications, and supplies needed to provide vacuum aspiration are the same as those needed for other gynaecological services.  In addition, medical abortion requires registration, procurement and distribution of mifepristone and misoprostol.  Supportive services, such as commodity procurement, supply chain functioning and financing mechanisms, are as important as training providers for introducing new services.  Where services already exist, infrastructural upgrades can facilitate more efficient patient flow and increase privacy and user satisfaction.  Quality approved abortion instruments and medications should be routinely included in the planning, budgeting, procurement, distribution and management systems.  In addition to skills training, participating in values clarification exercises can help all health care personnel differentiate their personal beliefs and attitudes from the needs of women seeking abortion services.  Values clarification is an exercise in articulating how personal values influence the way in which health care personnel interact with women seeking abortion.  Despite health workers&rsquo; attempts at objectivity, negative and predefined beliefs about abortion and the women who have them often influence professional judgment and quality of care.<\/p> <p>  In terms of financing and costs to women, health budgets should include sufficient funds for the following types of costs related to safe abortion: equipment, medications and supplies required to provide care; staff time; training programmes and supervision; infrastructure upgrades; record-keeping; and monitoring and evaluation.  The respect, protection and fulfilment of human rights require that women can access legal abortion services regardless of their ability to pay.  Financing mechanisms should ensure equitable access to good quality services.  Where user fees are charged for abortion, such fees should be matched to women&rsquo;s ability to pay, and procedures should be developed for exempting the poor and adolescents from paying for services.  As far as possible, abortion services should be mandated for coverage under health insurance plans.  Abortion should never be denied or delayed because of a woman&rsquo;s inability to pay.<\/p><p> What are the critical barriers to accessing safe abortion services?  Access to safe abortion depends not only on the availability of services but also on the manner in which they are delivered and the treatment of women within the service-delivery context.  Services should be delivered in a way that respects a woman&rsquo;s dignity, guarantees her right to privacy and is sensitive to her needs and perspectives.  Attention should be given to the special needs of women of lower socioeconomic status, adolescents, and other vulnerable and marginalised women.  Barriers to accessing safe abortion services, even when legal, include the following: restrictive interpretation of legal grounds, including the conditions that fall under health; failure to provide public information on the legal status and availability of abortion; excluding coverage for abortion services under health insurance, or failing to eliminate or reduce service fees for poor women and adolescents; requirements for third-party authorisations from one or more health-care providers, or from a hospital committee, from a court or police, from a parent or guardian, or from a woman&rsquo;s partner or spouse; restricting the range of health-care providers and facilities, which may result in poor availability of services, especially in rural areas; conscientious objection by health-care facilities and by health-care personnel; requiring mandatory waiting periods; censoring, withholding or intentionally misrepresenting health-related information, in the context of abortion; failure to guarantee confidentiality and privacy; and requirements for medically unnecessary screening tests such as requirements for women to view ultrasound images or listen to the foetal heartbeat.  Any of these barriers can deter women from seeking care and providers from delivering services within the formal health system; they cause delays in access to services, which may result in denial of services due to gestational limits on the legal grounds; they create complex and burdensome administrative procedures; they increase the costs of accessing abortion services; and they limit the availability of services and their equitable geographic distribution. <\/p><p>  I will conclude by saying that health systems should aim to respect, protect and fulfil the human rights of women, including women&rsquo;s dignity, autonomy and equality; promote and protect the health of women as a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being; minimise the rate of unintended pregnancy by providing good-quality contraceptive information and services, including a broad range of contraceptive methods, emergency contraception and comprehensive sexuality education; prevent and address stigma and discrimination against women who seek abortion services or treatment for abortion complications; and reduce maternal mortality and morbidity due to unsafe abortion, by ensuring that every woman entitled to legal abortion care can access safe and timely services including post-abortion contraception; and meet the particular needs of women belonging to vulnerable and disadvantaged groups, such as women of lower socioeconomic status, adolescents, single women, refugees and displaced women, women living with HIV, and survivors of rape. <\/p><p> We have provided copies of several documents for every member of the committee.  These include the policy brief on law and policy considerations and part of a policy on health worker roles in the health system.  We encourage all members to familiarise themselves with the guidelines as well as with our newly-launched global abortion policies database, which has the abortion laws, policies, health standards and guidelines for all UN and WHO member states.  One can go into this database to do comparisons and to see the laws and policies in each country.  The concluding observations of all of the treaty monitoring bodies are also included in this database and are linked to the countries in question, so one can click on these and go straight to the concluding observations.  Country penalties are included, as is a range of sexual and reproductive rights indicators for all countries.  One can really get a picture of whichever country one wants in the context of the global community.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017101100002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ronald Johnson","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507723200,"counter":13,"content":"<p>There are four lead questioners today and they have ten minutes each.

The chart also showed groups of women who felt guilty, sad, had feelings of loss, felt low, or felt disappointed.  To what extent what counselling and support available for that group of women?  What was the extent of the follow-up care and what were the findings over the course of that care, if known?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017101100002#M00300","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507723200,"counter":15,"content":"<p>That is a very good question.  When it comes to this graph, it was by no means the case that every woman was completely happy about the abortion.  There is often a great mix of emotions and most women, as we can see on the graph, recorded more than one.  In response to the question about the counselling made available, the Women on Web service itself has an online email support where women mostly ask questions about, for example, whether what they are seeing is normal and whether they need to get care.  They also sometimes ask questions about how they are feeling and whether it is normal to feel the way they do.  Women on Web does not, however, provide a full-on and comprehensive counselling service for women.  One of the important issues raised here by Deputy Durkan is the fact that women rely on Irish health care professionals for this kind of counselling and I do not know if it is always readily available to them.  We can see that many women are scared to talk about this, particularly if they have gone down the online telemedicine route, because of the fear of being prosecuted, reported, or even just stigmatised.  What this illustrates to us is that it is very difficult under the law at present to know how to provide those services for the women who are struggling with their feelings after an abortion, even if they are in the minority.  My answer then, is that these women do not have full-on counselling through the online telemedicine service and have to go to find it elsewhere.  It is not at all clear that the majority are able to do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017101100002#M00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Abigail Aiken"},{"type":"speech","time":1507723200,"counter":16,"content":"<p>Has Dr. Aiken done any research into the countries with readily accessible abortion services as compared to those, like Ireland, that do not?

The mission of Women on Web is to provide to countries where safe legal services are unavailable.  In a country with readily available abortion service, in Great Britain, for example, most women are accessing abortion in a clinical setting.  Some still write to Women on Web, however, because they are in a specific situation where getting to a clinic is very difficult.  This may be because of an abusive or controlling partner or perhaps because of a physical disability that makes it hard for them to reach a clinic.  The provision of a readily available service, then, does not completely eliminate the barriers to access that some women might experience.  It is to the countries where abortion is not legally available through the formal health care system, however, that Women on Web and another online telemedicine service provide.  This is where the demand is coming from.  There is a correlation between the absence of service in a country and women writing to Women on Web for help.  Counselling services are not mandatory in countries like Britain, where very few people need to contact telemedicine services because they have access to clinics.  Where such counselling is required or desired by a woman, however, it is fully integrated according to best practice into the abortion care provided.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017101100002#M00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Abigail Aiken"},{"type":"speech","time":1507723200,"counter":18,"content":"<p>Deputy Durkan is coming up on five minutes, should he wish to save some time for the second round of questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017101100002#M00700","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507723200,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I support what the Deputy said about the recent global estimates released by the WHO last week with which he might be familiar.  They referred to safe, less safe and least safe abortions and their distribution globally.  We have found that, by medical standards and WHO guidelines, the self-management of medicated abortion, as described by Women on Web, does fall within the safety criteria and would be considered safe.  In Latin America, in particular, where access to clinic services is not available, a number of women are accessing abortion pills online, not specifically from Women on Web which is only one service which cannot reach the majority of women who need a service.  They do so through a wide variety of often unregulated services which are of unknown quality.  We call such abortions less safe simply because women do not necessarily have access to counselling, adequate information or follow-up care.  It is still paradoxical that the mortality rate and the number of deaths in seeking this type of care are much lower than for the dangerous methods mentioned by Dr. Aiken such as the use of coat hangers and bleach.  It might hide a situation where women are not receiving appropriate and adequate care, but we do not see it as a public health problem because deaths are not happening.

When we consider online tele-medicine services and travelling, although clearly they are providing abortion services which stop women from having to use coat hangers, bleach and other very dangerous methods, they do not and cannot address all of their needs.  Even though online tele-medicine services are very safe and effective, as members will have seen in the charts we have shown, and although women have satisfied feelings afterwards, they still have to avail of such services illegally.  The climate of anxiety which hangs over the women to whom we have talked and researched would not be described as quality medical care, given that it is cloak and dagger and there is the threat of prosecution hanging over one's head.  They are entitled to better.<\/p> <p>  Women who travel access services within clinics, but they will still have to manage the symptoms and side effects of the procedure in public as they travel home.  Those who live close to services can manage their symptoms quickly at home.  There is a disparate level of care between the two systems.<\/p> <p>  As my colleague pointed out, there should be best practice in abortion services which should be accessible to everybody, regardless of cost and ability to pay, the reason or who someone is.  There is a system in place under which women who have the resources and money can travel, although they may not have a great experience.  We have heard from many women who had to travel back home while managing symptoms, who had to leave children at home and so forth.  It is very difficult to integrate continuity of care when one cannot go to a health care professional, make the decision to have the procedure carried out and receive follow-up care within a continuum in the same health care service.  When things are broken up, as is the case for women here, it is very difficult to have a cohesive service which meets everybody's needs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017101100002#N00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Abigail Aiken"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507723200,"counter":27,"content":"<p>From the perspective of the WHO, self-use is a safe option as an active extension of the health system when it is a choice women can make and where they have access to backup care services, if they want and should they need them.  When they have to do this because of a lack of options or alternatives, it would not meet the criteria of what the WHO regards as safe.  Although one can have a perfectly safe and medically safe abortion by travelling, it still does not reflect an active choice but a lack of safe options and alternatives.  It creates inequalities because there are women who cannot afford to travel or who might be too advanced in the pregnancy to travel.  It creates inequalities in terms of cost and, most importantly, delays.

Durkan.  The research I have read suggests the highest proportions of safe abortions are in certain sub-regions which also show the lowest incidences of abortion.

The issues specifically related to travelling do not show up in the sub-regional estimates.<\/p> <p>  On high incidences and safety levels, our information shows that rates of abortion do not vary owing to the degree of restrictiveness of the law.  They are similar across the world and regions, despite how strict abortion laws are.  The statistics also show that the level of safety changes as the restrictiveness of the law increases.  Abortions move from being less safe, in terms of the option of using medication without appropriate information under certain conditions, in particular within the developing world, to the least safe.  I would not say Ireland is immune from this based on the data from Dr. Aiken which suggested methods we considered to be the least safe were being used here.<\/p> <p>  The contrast in this picture is that in countries which have facilitative abortion laws there is often good access to contraception, overall good levels of development and gender equality, thus creating a climate within which women can access good contraception.

If we look at the graph, exhibit 2, we could not put all of the years on the axis, so 2002 is the first year in the graph, which is the first year of the decline.  This decline has been quite steady to 2016.  Committee members will notice there is some compression on the axis between 2002 and 2009 so it looks steeper than it should be in the first part.  The first years on the graph were prior to Women on Web becoming available in 2007.  Of course, it took a little while for the service to get known and for people to start using it.<\/p> <p>  What we can say is there was a decline in people travelling even before Women on Web came along, but we see from the graph, exhibit 1, there was a tripling over the past six years.  It could certainly be that some women are making a decision that it is better for them to use the online service than to travel.  What could also be happening is there is a group of women for whom travel was never a possibility, that it was simply out of reach because it was too expensive or they could not get away from home or tell anyone.  For these women it is possible the online service has allowed them a way to access abortion that was not there for them before, if that makes sense.  Although the decline could be linked, we cannot attribute it to one replacing the other.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy's next question was on contraceptive access in Ireland.  It is the case, no matter whether one is privately or publicly insured in Ireland, that one will have a co-pay for prescription medication, and this includes contraception.  If we look at the figures released by the Irish Family Planning Association, someone could be looking at &euro;30 a packet of contraceptive pills times 12 times however many years they will be used for, so there are co-pay problems with access to contraception for most people.  People looking to get an intrauterine device, IUD, such as Mirena, could be looking at an upfront payment of &euro;350 to &euro;400.  There are still some access problems, and this is reflected in the unmet needs statistic, where the unmet need for contraception in Ireland is double that of Great Britain where those medications are free of cost to everyone.<\/p> <p>  As my colleague pointed out, even with better contraceptive services, and absolutely that is something to focus on, the need for abortion still does not completely go away.  It can certainly help with reducing abortion rates, but the two things really are hand-in-hand services that both need to be encompassed.<\/p><p> The Deputy's final question was about criminalisation and safety.  We do see from the exhibits that the outcomes in terms of safety from Women on Web and other online services are good.  One thing that is not in the charts is that among the about 9% of women who experience the symptom of what could have been a complication that was serious, 95% of those women did report going to a hospital and seeking care.  Those who did not, which was about two people, were okay; nothing bad happened to them so from the data we have, people do go when it is necessary.  However, this does not mean that it is easy for them to go and it does not mean that they might go when something is not an absolute emergency but they still might need some care.  They might need some follow up, they might need to talk to someone, they might need counselling or they might need to go for something that is not necessary going to cause mortality but could cause morbidity so criminalisation still stops people from talking to health care professionals, interrupts that doctor-patient relationship that should be happening and stigmatises even if it is does not always stop people seeking emergency care.

In Ireland, there is the criminal law but it is maybe not as enforced as often as it is in other countries.  Even when one does not have enforcement, criminalisation creates a chilling effect on women seeking services because they are never quite sure if they might go to prison for it.  It also creates a chilling effect on providers providing services, again because they are unsure of what might happen.  It can be worse if the laws are actually applied.  I am sure members are all familiar with the situation in Romania back in the 1990s.  Abortion was legal up until 1966.  When it was criminalised in 1966, it was not just a policy matter.  Many measures were put in place to enforce it.  The importation of contraceptives was prohibited and people were sent to high schools to do gynaecological checks of young girls every month and if girls were found to be pregnant, they would follow them up, so it was seriously criminalised.  Members can see the graphs.  Abortion-related mortality skyrocketed to some of the high levels we have ever documented.  In 1991, the law was liberalised overnight.  Ceauescu was executed and the first thing the Romanian Government did was liberalise the law because it recognised the problem of unsafe abortions.  Members can see that overnight, the mortality rate dropped considerably.  The number of abortions went up because they had not been reported before and all of a sudden, women had access to safe abortion, but members can see that the number came down as contraception use went up because they started increasing contraceptive access.  In addition to contraception, we also need comprehensive sexuality education.  That, coupled with access to affordable contraception, is the best way to prevent unintended pregnancy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017101100002#P00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ronald Johnson"},{"type":"speech","time":1507723200,"counter":52,"content":"<p>I thank all three witnesses for very their interesting presentations.

Dr. Sheldon reckons that there were 3,000 requests from people in Ireland to those sites alone every year.  If we break that down in figures, which is really important for an accurate abortion rate in this country, let us say 70% of them came from the Republic of Ireland which would mean that 2,100 requests for abortion were made through these two sites in the South.  If we divide that by 52 weeks, that is roughly 40 requests per week.  Let us say only 35 of those people actually carry it out because not everybody who orders the pills goes through with it - some people change their mind - that would be 35 women every week, which would be five per day in the Republic of Ireland\/  That is a much higher figure than anybody would ever have contended.

We spoke a little here about the importance of contraception and how it should be integrated in terms of abortion care as well.

I turn to their claim, without producing evidence in front of us, although admittedly they did not have time to do so, that there is no evidence that a restriction in the law causes a lower incidence of abortion.  Is it not strange that Britain which has a population roughly 15 times the size of Ireland's - 60 million compared to 4 million - nonetheless has an abortion rate at least 30 times the rate for Ireland?  In Britain there is something short of 200,000 abortions a year.  Borrowing Deputy Ruth Coppinger's figures for the likely incidence of abortions induced by medical pills, Ireland might have a figure of 6,000 a year.  I find it difficult to understand how in their presentation the delegates did not address that glaring statistic.<\/p> <p>  I draw the delegates' attention to something that came up last week on which I was challenged, but I was correct.  It is that in Northern Ireland which has a smaller population than the Republic the Advertising Standards Authority upheld a billboard campaign that claimed that there was a reasonable probability that approximately 100,000 people were alive in Northern Ireland who would otherwise have been aborted had it been legal to do so.  It stated, \"On balance, we concluded that the evidence indicated that there was a reasonable probability\" and \"Because we considered that readers would understand the figure to represent an estimate, we concluded that the claim was unlikely to materially mislead readers\".

The delegates have given us evidence that it is safe and cheaper.  Has any analysis been made against the backdrop of criminalisation, the threat of arrest and prosecution in Northern Ireland, for example, or here, to show that people are because of this prospect putting off this more convenient or easier to access option and instead travelling at greater expense and inconvenience?<\/p><p>Is it the view of the witnesses that for us as a committee to look at this issue and not to take on board decriminalisation we would be only doing half the job?  Related to that is the fact that we have a module for dealing with ancillary recommendations.  It strikes me, based on what the witnesses are saying, that we would be doing an incomplete job if we did not look at the whole area of contraception.  It is utterly shocking to think that 44% of people are not using contraception.  We have a huge problem in this country in not supporting people and dealing with the issue of unplanned pregnancy.

Dr. Aiken has said that when women leave clinics, they are helped with contraceptives.  I believe in life and living.

What can we do in Ireland to try to educate people?  To me, abortion should definitely be the last option for anybody.  When people are looking for help, they have many means of communication.  If a woman who does not want to be pregnant is looking for help, the first thing she will do is google and this will be pushed in her face.  What can we do to give such people a far better option?

I will say a couple of things in response to him.  <\/p> <p>  Maternal mortality rates are very low in Ireland.  The Deputy is right when he says Ireland has extremely good obstetric and maternity services.  However, this presumes that people want to go through with pregnancies and end up giving birth to babies.  That is great and there are excellent obstetric services here.  The problem we are discussing involves people who are not in that position.  The figures for them are not factored into the maternal mortality rate because they are able to go to England or use the Women on Web website.  Ireland has a low maternal mortality rate which is great, but it really does not offer many options to those who are deciding what to do about their pregnancies.<\/p> <p>  One of the problems is that although there are many opinions in this room and Ireland on this issue, it is very difficult to legislate for opinions.  Everyone has a different opinion.  We came to present evidence to the committee in order that its members would learn more about the people who were relying on us to do something.  It is not so much about our individual opinions but more about those who need help from the committee as it decides what to do.  Although pregnancy is nice and joyful for many, it carries many physical and anatomical risks.  It is an awful lot to expect a woman to do with her body, especially if it is something she does not want to do and would choose not to do.  While pregnancy has been made very safe by the excellent obstetric services available in Ireland, it has to be recognised that it is not inherently very safe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017101100002#V00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Abigail Aiken"},{"type":"speech","time":1507723200,"counter":169,"content":"<p>That concludes our questions.

I am a practising consultant obstetrician and a sub-specialist in maternal-foetal medicine.  My particular area of expertise is prenatal diagnosis and the treatment of foetal abnormalities.  The Rotunda Hospital is the largest provider of prenatal screening and diagnostic services in the State.  Patients are referred to the hospital from all other maternity hospitals in the country.  Therefore, I may be in a position to assist the committee in providing a factual context in the prenatal management of foetal abnormalities and considering the potential options for change.<\/p> <p>  I want to clarify that I am not here as an advocate for either a pro-choice or pro-life agenda.  As a practising specialist, I understand it is absolutely crucial that patients trust their doctors to be completely objective in their professional medical advice and that they are not perceived in any way to have a political agenda.  For this reason, I have always been cautious to keep my personal views out of the public realm.  I am here to answer questions of a factual nature that the committee may have on foetal abnormalities and to discuss potential options for change in this area.<\/p><p> In the interests of brevity, I will not provide an overview of foetal abnormalities or prenatal diagnosis in Ireland.  In addition, I will keep my descriptions of the care pathways followed by patients in this situation as short as possible.  However, these matters are covered in detail in the written position paper I provided for the committee.  <\/p><p> Currently, when a patient at the Rotunda Hospital is given a prenatal diagnosis of a fatal foetal abnormality, all options for management are discussed in a non-judgmental manner.  The specific diagnosis is explained, together with what exactly is meant by the term \"fatal\".  It includes quoting statistics for the chances of survival to birth and thereafter.  There are two options for pregnancy management, the first of which is to continue with the pregnancy and provide perinatal hospice care.  This care journey involves regular support from a multidisciplinary team.  When the mother delivers, the parents generally hold their baby until such time as he or she passes away.  This care journey is very well organised at the Rotunda Hospital and works in a tremendously supportive manner for families in terribly tragic situations.<\/p><p> The alternative option for pregnancy management in this situation is not to continue with the pregnancy, which means undergoing a pregnancy termination.  This involves travelling outside the jurisdiction, most often to the United Kingdom.  Patients who select this course of action are supported to the extent that is permissible by our legislation.  We do not make direct referrals for a pregnancy termination, nor do we advocate for one management option over another.  Parents must make their own appointments and travel arrangements.  This particular journey is clearly associated with significant additional challenges for patients, including travelling for health care to an unfamiliar city and without family support.  There is a significant financial cost of, typically, &euro;800 to &euro;1,500, not including travel costs.  Limited autopsy or genetic testing is performed, as the cost of such testing must be paid for separately by the parents.  In addition, there is significant distress for parents associated with leaving their baby's remains in a foreign country.  In 2016, 55 patients from the Rotunda Hospital travelled to the United Kingdom to undergo a pregnancy termination following a prenatal diagnosis of foetal abnormalities.<\/p><p> The current legislative status of termination of pregnancy in Ireland poses significant practical challenges for obstetricians when faced with a prenatal diagnosis of fatal or complex foetal abnormalities.  They include an inability to directly refer patients for care.  The Regulation of Information (Services Outside the State for Termination of Pregnancies) Act 1995 prohibits our staff from directly making an appointment for a mother at a hospital outside the jurisdiction.  We cannot contact staff in such hospitals directly on behalf of a particular patient but must rely instead on patients relaying potentially complex medical information.<\/p><p> Another challenge is the inability to access care in a timely manner.  Recently we have been faced with a number of patients with fatal or complex foetal abnormalities who were unable to secure a timely appointment with a centre in the United Kingdom for a pregnancy termination because that centre had been too busy.  <\/p><p> Another challenge is the lack of continuity of care associated with travelling to another jurisdiction.  There is a distinct lack of fairness in that patients with complex foetal abnormalities who chose to continue with their pregnancy have prompt access to continuous care within a single health care team, while those who choose not to continue with their pregnancy are forced to endure split care across two jurisdictions, completely undermining the ability to provide for continuity of care.  One of the main concerns in splitting care across two jurisdictions is the potential risks to the mother's physical health when travelling.  Risks associated with pregnancy termination include infection and haemorrhage which has, tragically, already resulted in the death of one of our patients while travelling to the United Kingdom.<\/p><p> Another challenge is the threat of imprisonment for staff.  As prescribed under section 22 of the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013, a term of imprisonment of up to 14 years may be applied if a doctor is convicted for participation in a procedure to \"intentionally destroy unborn human life\".  There is a lack of clarity among some doctors on whether they may have a vulnerability to such a conviction if they are involved in any way in the management of a patient who has a pregnancy termination in another jurisdiction.<\/p><p> Given these practical challenges facing obstetricians and maternity hospitals in Ireland, I suggest the committee might consider supporting the decriminalisation of pregnancy termination in the setting of foetal abnormalities.  Obstetricians and maternity hospitals in Ireland should be able to provide complete health care services for their patients without the threat of a criminal conviction.  When faced with the practical reality of caring for mothers with complex foetal abnormalities, it is difficult to justify retaining a threat of criminal conviction for doctors or hospitals providing appropriate health care.  Obstetricians and maternity hospitals in Ireland should be able to provide for a legal termination of pregnancy in the setting of fatal or complex foetal abnormalities if a patient chooses to follow that course of action.  This would allow both pathways of care to be provided equally to all patients when faced with the traumatic situation of a prenatal diagnosis of complex foetal abnormalities.<\/p><p> With any proposed legislative change, it would not be appropriate to provide a list of specific foetal diagnoses that should be considered \"eligible\" for a pregnancy termination.  Lists of foetal diagnoses are not static over time, just as any list of \"eligible\" diagnoses today would likely to be outdated in a number of years.  Similarly, combinations of foetal abnormalities are commonly seen such that while, individually, a particular abnormality might not be considered \"lethal\", in combination with multiple complex abnormalities, the overall prognosis would effectively be fatal.  It is recommended instead that the individuals best placed to make such a decision are the patient and her doctor, without the direct involvement of external agencies.<\/p><p> We do not consider it appropriate to specify a precise gestational age limit in weeks beyond which a pregnancy termination would be illegal.  This is because the definition of foetal viability is not precise and is likely to change.  Additionally, foetal size and foetal health are independent predictors of foetal viability, separate from defining viability based solely on gestational age in weeks.  Again, it is recommended that the individuals best placed to make such a decision are the patient and her doctor, without an arbitrary legal cut-off. <\/p><p>I endorse the ancillary recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly which call for equal access for all patients to early pregnancy scanning and testing, improved counselling and support services for patients and detailed consideration of how a pregnancy termination should be resourced.  Maternity services in Ireland remain significantly under-resourced.  If we are to take on board the provision of pregnancy termination services, this will require a significant improvement in resources, both in terms of personnel and physical infrastructure.<\/p><p> I hope my observations, together with the more complete position given to the committee yesterday on the current status of the diagnosis of foetal abnormalities, are of assistance to the committee.  I hope, too, that my observations on the practical challenges and options for change will be informative for the committee's future deliberations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017101100002#W00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Fergal Malone","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507723200,"counter":175,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Malone.

I hope my contribution will be helpful in its deliberations.  <\/p> <p>  I am the master of the National Maternity Hospital which is one of Europe's largest maternity hospitals and in which 9,000 babies are delivered every year.  It is a major Irish tertiary referral centre which provides advanced obstetric, neonatal and gynaecological care.  I am a specialist in maternal and foetal medicine and an honorary clinical professor with the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland.  My submission is based on my clinical experience as both an obstetrician and a master practising in the Republic of Ireland under the terms of the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013 and Article 40.3.3&deg; of the Constitution, commonly referred to as the eighth amendment.  These legal instruments govern the circumstances in which a termination of pregnancy can be lawfully performed in this country.<\/p> <p>  Termination of pregnancy is defined as the intentional procurement of a miscarriage.  In other words, it occurs when a pregnancy is interrupted prior to foetal viability and neonatal intensive care is not provided.  At present, 24 weeks of completed gestation represents the threshold of viability, whereby the provision of sophisticated neonatal intensive care is associated with approximately a 50% survival rate of the foetus.  This is not an absolute cut-off point and some babies will survive at 23 weeks, while others will not be viable at 25 owing to complications of extreme prematurity.  When a baby is delivered, in whom viability has been reached and for whom intensive care has been provided, we refer to this as a delivery, not a termination of pregnancy.<\/p><p>The subject of termination of pregnancy is deeply complex and, not surprisingly, it provokes strong views and many differences of opinion.  We know approximately 3,000 women travel to the UK every year from this country to obtain termination of pregnancy.  Our Constitution protects women travelling abroad for termination of pregnancy in circumstances that would be a criminal offence in their own country.  In effect, this means that women in Ireland have similar access to termination of pregnancy as women in the UK, with the exception of children and women of limited means who do not have the ability to travel.  It is impossible not to be affected by the personal testaments of individual women and their partners and, although every case is unique, it is evident that with the current position in Ireland, women will continue to travel to the UK or access unknown medication from potentially unregulated sources using the Internet with all the attendant clinical risk.<br\/><br\/>Somewhere in the midst of public opinion is the need to ensure that women in Ireland have access to sound clinical care, and I would like to address the following clinical issues.  In Ireland, a woman qualifies for a termination of pregnancy if there is a real and substantial risk to her life that may be removed only by termination of pregnancy.  The process that determines this qualification is cumbersome and complicated, and despite the fact that it relies on clinical judgment delivered in good faith to save a woman's life, it is framed in a criminal context.  An error in clinical judgement is potentially punishable by a custodial sentence of 14 years for both the mother and her clinician in the event that an identified risk is deemed not substantial enough.  Equally, waiting for a woman to be sufficiently ill in order that she is perceived to be at risk of dying is potentially dangerous.  It assumes we can accurately predict the risk of dying.  Haemorrhage, infection, heart disease, liver disease and a host of other disorders can make one very ill but they can also kill a person.  It is not always possible to predict clinical course with precision.  In medicine we deal with probability informed by available clinical evidence and experience.<br\/><br\/>In women with underlying morbidity, such as cystic fibrosis, portal hypertension, corrected congenital heart disease, renal disease and other conditions, the additional physiological burden of pregnancy can create significant maternal risk.  The question arises as to how a substantial risk of mortality is defined.  As I have asked, is it a 10% risk of death, an 80% risk of death or a 50% risk of death?  A woman would also have a view as to what constitutes a substantial risk to her life and her view deserves consideration.  It is not considered currently.  This is real-life medicine.  We frequently counsel patients about a range of risks and potential outcomes.  We arrive at a decision with our patient's input, which we believe is in the best interest of our patient, but I cannot think of any other circumstances in medicine where risks to life are balanced in the shadow of a custodial sentence for both the clinician and the woman.<br\/><br\/>In my experience, one of the most challenging conditions we experience clinically is the development of chorioamnionitis prior to foetal viability.  For example, if the waters around a baby break at around 14 weeks of gestation, there is really little chance the baby would be born alive and survive.  We must wait until a woman develops infection or chorioamnionitis before we can intervene in the pregnancy.  When the woman is at significant risk of developing such infection, we are tasked with ensuring we can terminate the pregnancy, which has become the source of the infection, before she becomes so ill that she dies.<br\/><br\/>In pregnancy we deal with two lives inextricably linked by a complex physiology.  This is dealt with in the Constitution by a balance of rights.  There is the equal right to life of the mother and the foetus.  From a medical perspective, this provision creates difficulty in its presumption that the implications of a range of complex medical disorders can be reduced to a matter of individual right.  If the legal world explores the balance of rights, the medical world explores the balance of risk.  In a pregnancy complicated by serious disease, it is not a question of right but rather a question of risk.  Once foetal viability is achieved, we have the option of delivering the baby and attempting to save both lives.  We do this all the time in clinical practice and over 2% of babies in Ireland are born before term because of medical indication in the context of foetal or maternal disease.  However, prior to foetal viability, we do not have the option of delivering a foetus because the foetus cannot survive, and if a pregnant mother dies, her baby dies too.  Therefore, prior to foetal viability, this constitutional provision makes no clinical sense.  Its presence facilitates a real possibility that clinical decision-making may be delayed or distorted as clinicians ponder the law rather than medicine.<br\/><br\/>Unfortunately, there is evidence of this.  I will never forget the High Court case that dominated Christmas 2015 when somatic function was maintained in a dead woman so that her foetus could be incubated in what was described as a &quot;macabre experiment&quot;.  The woman in question was approximately 14 weeks' gestation when she died, which is weeks away from foetal viability.  Her father had to apply to the High Court in order to switch off the machines and let his daughter be laid to rest with dignity.  The overwhelming clinical judgment in the High Court attested that this foetus would not survive. It was a &quot;futile exercise&quot;, according to the High Court, but it happened because of a medico-legal interpretation of the eighth amendment and it could happen again.<br\/><br\/>In addition to being an obstetrician, I am a specialist in foetal and maternal medicine.  The National Maternity Hospital, NMH, is a large tertiary centre for foetal medicine and we are fortunate to have a large multidisciplinary team, including neonatal, midwifery, bereavement, radiology, paediatric, obstetric, genetic, social work and pathology experts to provide guidance and expertise required in the context of complex foetal anomaly.  A care pathway has been developed that adopts a multidisciplinary approach to provide individualised care to families.  We see women from all over Ireland and we know it is very difficult for families who have to travel long distances for care in the context of foetal anomaly.  In 2016, 195 women with a foetal anomaly were referred to our hospital from units around the country.<br\/><br\/>The specialty of foetal medicine is increasing in complexity, and our ability to identify genetic and structural anomalies in the foetus <i>in utero<\/i>is increasing.  New techniques include the ability to detect chromosomal abnormalities by testing free foetal DNA carried in a mother's bloodstream from as early as ten weeks of gestation.  This is done using a simple but expensive maternal blood test.  Micro-array technology allows us to examine the chromosomes and see genetic material more clearly and foetal imaging has improved, including enhanced ultrasound and, more recently, magnetic resonance imaging provided at NMH.  Interestingly, a third of units in Ireland do not provide routine anomaly scanning, which is hard to justify in 2017.  In 2016 at NMH, we identified 400 significant structural anomalies and more than 60 chromosomal anomalies.  The diagnosis of a major foetal anomaly and particularly a foetal anomaly in which survival is unlikely after birth is a really difficult part of my job.  I know when giving such devastating news that I change a family's life irrevocably.  Counselling is always non-directive but includes the variety of options available in each individual case.  Even where there is a strong likelihood a foetus will not survive, women wish to continue their pregnancy knowing what will be but they tell me that whether their baby survives for a minute, an hour, a day or a week, the time is of infinite importance.  The foetal medicine team and multidisciplinary neonatal teams, in conjunction with our bereavement team, support parents in this context as best we can in each individual circumstance.  We now have national standards of bereavement care that address anticipatory bereavement.  Strategies include individualised care, memory-making, support and advice for family members, as well as bereavement counselling.  Some people call this concept perinatal hospice care.<br\/><br\/>For some women the decision to continue with a pregnancy can be associated with increased maternal risk.  For example, in a case of conjoined twins where separation is not possible because of organ sharing, there are significant technical difficulties in delivering the conjoined babies requiring high-risk caesarean surgery.  In the context of a really severe lethal anomaly in which a baby is unlikely to survive, some women will not wish to continue their pregnancy.  They will choose to navigate these tragic circumstances in different ways.  I understand people will make different choices when faced with really difficult personal circumstances.<br\/><br\/>Sixty women attending our service travelled to the UK for termination of pregnancy in the context of foetal anomaly in 2016, and to date this year at Holles Street, 43 women have travelled in this context.  The majority of women had pregnancies complicated by chromosomal or genetic anomaly, multiple anomalies, anencephaly and ventriculomegaly.  UK data indicate that in 2015, 135 women travelled from Ireland to the UK in the context of foetal anomaly where they terminated their pregnancy under clause E, &quot;substantial risk of physical or mental handicap as to be severely handicapped&quot;.  Women who chose this option must travel to a different jurisdiction.  The Constitution protects women who decide to travel but a termination in this country in this context would be a criminal offence.<br\/><br\/>As an obstetrician I can give limited practical support in this decision.  This includes contact details of foetal medicine centres in the UK.  We do not make direct referral for pregnancy termination and we certainly do not advocate for one management option over another.  Parents must make their own appointments and make their own travel arrangements.  Families must find this especially cruel.  Parents also bear the cost of treatment in the UK, which can run to more than &euro;1,000, including medical treatment, flights, accommodation, laboratory bills and the cost of bringing their baby's remains home.<\/p><p>In this context, parents frequently report feeling abandoned and the tragedy of their loss is exacerbated by the practical difficulties of bringing their baby home, navigating a different city and jurisdiction, being separated from their families at such a difficult time and the shame and stigma associated with travelling to England for a termination of pregnancy.<\/p><p> From a clinical perspective, care between two different jurisdictions is inevitably disjointed and clinical risk is increased.  I am struck by the findings of the UN Human Rights Committee which on several occasions has found that the current criminalisation and restrictive abortion provision in Ireland today violate women's human rights, including the right to freedom from cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, the right to privacy and the right to freedom from discrimination.<\/p><p> I have raised a number of difficult issues which I have encountered in my medical career.  No law will ever adequately address the reality of the ethical dilemmas generated by human reproduction but we have to acknowledge the real risks that women face in clinically complicated pregnancies.  I believe there are two main domains that need to be addressed from a clinical perspective.  We must address the criminalisation of medical care in Ireland.  At present a woman must have a substantial risk of dying before she can qualify for a termination of pregnancy to save her life.  Failure to adhere to this is punishable by a 14-year custodial sentence for both the woman and her doctor.  I believe this has the capacity to create clinical risk by distorting clinical decision-making.<\/p><p> In September 2017, the council of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists voted strongly in favour of supporting the removal of criminal sanctions associated with abortion in the UK.  They said: \"We believe that the procedure should be subject to regulatory and professional standards, in line with other medical procedures, rather than criminal sanctions.\"  It is also very difficult that our Constitution protects women to travel in the context of a baby that has a foetal anomaly that is unlikely to survive and yet to terminate a pregnancy at home in this country in this context is a criminal offence.<\/p><p> Second, we must address access to safe clinical care.  Women require safe health care and sound clinical decision-making in the context of pregnancy complicated by severe maternal disease.  A women herself should have an input into her care management and both she and her doctor must have the flexibility to make sound clinical decisions in good faith.  It should not be a requirement that she is dying prior to these decisions being made.  Timely appropriate clinical decision-making in pregnancies associated with significant maternal risk will make women safer.  Children require special consideration in relation to risk.<\/p><p> In the context of severe foetal abnormality, in terms of access, women are travelling to jurisdictions outside Ireland to access complex medical care.  While doctors provide non-directive counselling and can provide information on termination of pregnancy, doctors cannot make appropriate clinical referral.  Care delivered between jurisdictions raises all kinds of risk, including lack of continuity of care, inability to access timely care, incomplete evaluation and confirmation of prenatal diagnosis, and incomplete analysis of the implications for future pregnancies.  Patients would much prefer to have the option to access this care at home close to their families and friends.<\/p><p> The presence of the eighth amendment in our Constitution creates unacceptable clinical risk and it should be removed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017101100002#X00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Rhona Mahony","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507723200,"counter":179,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Mahony for her presentation.

It costs about &euro;350 and it is an opt-in test, so women who do not have the means to pay for that will not access that test.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the reference to one third of hospitals, I was referring to ultrasound scanning.  It is a standard of care obstetrics in 2017 that women would have anomaly scanning.  The primary reason for anomaly scanning is that if there is a difference or a challenge picked up for a baby, it is really important that we identify that in order that we can provide the best possible care to a mother and her baby.  For example, if we diagnose that a baby has a congenital heart problem, we can connect the mum and the baby with the services that will be required after the baby's delivery with the surgeons and all the multidisciplinary care because we know that there is a problem.  That is the most important reason for providing ultrasound scanning.

That legislation was around legislating for what is in the Constitution - the equal right to life.<\/p> <p>  I would like to move on and ask about the right to health, which is deemed by international human rights organisations as a right, but it is very difficult to see how the right to health can be provided for in the context of the eighth amendment.

Some women come into pregnancy with conditions of cystic fibrosis or portal hypertension and there may be a significant risk of that woman dying because of the additional physiological burden of pregnancy.  Similarly, women can become ill during pregnancy and we need to interrupt the pregnancy prior to foetal viability.  Once foetal viability is achieved, we can deliver a baby because of either maternal or foetal disease, and as I said, we do that all the time.  A total of 2% of deliveries in this country occur early before term because a woman or baby is ill and we can deliver before term.  It is prior to viability that the problem arises when we do not have the option of delivering a woman's baby.  In those cases, we have to look at the risks to that woman and that is where clinicians need flexibility.  I do not think it is appropriate that we somehow have to wait until a woman is at a substantial risk of dying because how does one define that?   As I said, what is a substantial risk?  Is it 5%, 10% or 50%?  What of the woman's view?  If I say to a women that she has a 10% chance of dying but I am okay with that, she might disagree with that and say: \"Well, doctor, I am not okay with that.\"  This is real-life medicine.  We cannot predict the clinical course all the time with exact precision.  We have clinical evidence, likelihoods and probabilities.

One could have a baby with severe growth restriction at 25 weeks who is 300 g and has no prospect of survival, yet one could have a 23-week foetus who is 600 g and has a prospect of survival.  One could have a 25-week foetus with a very severe heart defect that has no prospect of survival if that foetus was born, yet a 23-week foetus that is completely healthy might have a chance of survival.  To focus our definition of viability on some arbitrary gestational age week is just one piece of the equation.  It is not possible to define viability in the total context of health.

As regards women who decided not to travel, for example, Down's syndrome, in 2016, we had 26 cases in which we diagnosed prenatally Down's syndrome.  Some 57% of patients chose to travel to the United Kingdom and 43% chose to stay and continue with their pregnancy.  There were 24 cases of trisomy 18, known as Edwards' syndrome, a fatal foetal abnormality, diagnosed in 2016.  Twelve chose to travel to the United Kingdom and 12 chose to continue on with their pregnancy.  In general, it depends on each abnormality, approximately 50:50 is how it splits out.  That reflects the balanced counselling that is done.  It reflects the fact that when we make a diagnosis, we give patients the full facts as to what it means.  They meet various support organisations, as needed, and they make their own individual family-based decision.  Those were the numbers in 2016.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Durkan asked on fatal foetal abnormalities and how often maybe the mother was in danger.  There are some conditions, such as trisomy 13, or Patau syndrome.  Patau syndrome is strongly associated with severe preeclampsia and the foetal condition can actually make the mother sick.  There is another condition called Mirror syndrome where the fetus gets heart failure called hydrops and that could have the same effect on the mother, and the mother goes into heart failure.  There are definitely cases in which the foetal condition can have a tremendously negative effect directly on the mother.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked are we concerned that there may be reluctance on the part of some medical personnel to participate in procedures should there be a change in legislation.  We have never had a survey done of doctors in Ireland to see where would they personally stand on this issue.<\/p> <p>  The issue of conscientious objection is a valid one and we would generally always accept that.  In large hospitals, such as the Rotunda, the Coombe and the National Maternity Hospital, I would be confident that we would always have sufficient numbers of personnel available that, even if an individual doctor chose for personal reasons not to participate in a case, we would be able to provide care for the patient.  I would perhaps be a little bit more concerned, if one were in some of the smaller hospitals where one had more limited personnel, would the conscientious objection clause prevent a patient accessing appropriate care.  That remains to be seen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017101100002#AA00600","nonspeaker":"Professor Fergal Malone"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507723200,"counter":194,"content":"<p>Similarly, in regard to fatal foetal abnormality and danger for women, there are the medical disorders, such as preeclampsia, as discussed, but there can also be significant surgical complication.  I cited the example of a case of conjoined twins where, if this pregnancy goes to term and significant organs are shared, there is no prospect of survival for the conjoined twins but in order to deliver them, there is great technical difficulty and very complicated surgery which can create a high risk indeed for a patient.<\/p> <p>  In terms of travelling, we diagnose approximately 400 foetal anomalies a year in the National Maternity Hospital and approximately 60 women travel.  A lot of women would choose not to travel.  Among those 400, there will be anomalies that are less severe, for example, a number of heart issues, that are amenable to treatment and to surgery.  That is why we work so hard to pick up an anomaly so that we can offer the best possible care to babies when they are born because that can really improve outcome.<\/p> <p>  Of the 60 women who travel, they tended to be chromosomal and genetic anomalies.  They tended to be neural tube defects, cranial abnormalities and complex heart abnormalities.  They tended to have abnormalities that were at the very severe end of the spectrum indeed.<\/p> <p>  In regard to criminalisation and reluctance of clinicians to participate, women should be very much reassured in the first instance that when it comes to a risk to a woman's life we will do all that we can to save her life.<\/p><p>That is normal obstetric practice.  We will always endeavour to save a woman's life, and that is really important.  There are underlying maternal conditions that do create a very high risk in pregnancy, for example, portal hypertension, very advanced cystic fibrosis where there is very reduced lung function, some congenital heart disease, some cancers and some very complex haematological disorders.  There will be very rare disorders as well of which we have limited experience but there is no doubt that there are underlying maternal diseases, and when the physiological burden of pregnancy is added to them, it creates substantial risk for women.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017101100002#AA00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Rhona Mahony","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507723200,"counter":196,"content":"<p>Very quickly-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017101100002#BB00200","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1507723200,"counter":197,"content":"<p>Unless it is a clarification.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017101100002#BB00300","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speech","time":1507723200,"counter":198,"content":"<p>I will be a very good boy and be very quick.

Genetic diagnoses are black and white.  Some people mistake screening tests for diagnostic tests.  It is possible that a screening test that assesses a patient's risk for having a baby with Edwards' syndrome or trisomy 21 may say there is a high risk.  That does not mean the foetus has the condition.  We would never suggest that a woman travel or see a woman travelling for pregnancy termination for a risk of a condition.  We would always recommend in 100% of cases that a patient would have a formal diagnostic test done such as amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling, CVS, so that does not get the diagnosis wrong.  It does not happen in that situation.  In terms of structural abnormalities diagnosed by an ultrasound, we are very careful in our counselling with parents as to the accuracy of what we see and the limitations of what we see.  Commonly, I will say to a patient that there is an abnormality with the heart, or that there is a hole in the heart and the blood vessels are lined up in such a way but that is what it looks like to the best of our knowledge, or that there is an abnormality of the brain but I cannot tell the patient exactly what effect that will have on brain function.  We always express the limitations of the diagnostic test.  If it is 100% certain, we will say that.  If it is just a set of findings and we do not know what it means, we will also say that so there is no question of people having pregnancy terminations for a wrong diagnosis.<\/p> <p>  It is very difficult to specify the impact on parents travelling because it would be very useful to have longer-term follow-up questionnaires and studies of depression scores and anxiety scores afterwards.  My gut feeling is that there are significant long-term effects from the trauma of travelling.  It is very hard to distinguish between how much of the subsequent anguish was due to the original diagnosis, which is understandable, and how much was added to it by the subsequent practical challenges.  We do not have any data on that so I cannot give the Deputy a direct answer as to how often that happens.  My gut feeling is that it is common.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017101100002#BB01600","nonspeaker":"Professor Fergal Malone"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507723200,"counter":211,"content":"<p>The risk of dying is covered in sections 7 and 8 of the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013.

In the context of an emergency like a haemorrhage, a doctor can make a decision on his or her own and interrupt the pregnancy to save a woman's life.  They do not need a second opinion but can go straight ahead.  In respect of a substantial risk to life, it requires two doctors to come to that opinion, one must be an obstetrician, one can be another relevant practitioner and preferably a general practitioner would be involved as well in the decision-making.  Again, it comes down to the determination of what is a substantial risk to life.  We will have patients presenting who may have a disease like advanced cystic fibrosis or portal hypertension.  They may not have planned to get pregnant but now they are.  When the question arises, we are not quite sure what the clinical course will be.  We know there are risks but is there really a risk of the woman dying or will she just become ill?  How do we factor that in and what is our opinion?  What is really required in these situations is the ability for the doctors and patients to look not just at the risk of dying but at the risk of a serious impact on a woman's health in order that they can make a sensible and timely decision.

If it is combined with a foetus that has severe growth restriction and a major intracranial abnormality, the combination would create a case where there is no meaningful prospect for survival.

There is another group of patients for whom it is just not possible for them to continue with their pregnancy when they see the case as being futile.

There is the question of what is health and what is dying.  As I keep coming back to it, clinical courses are very difficult to predict with precision.  An illness in a woman can very quickly kill her.  It is our difficulty in exactly predicting a clinical course, so we should therefore err on the side of ensuring women are safe and appropriate and timely decisions can be made.  It is not appropriate that a woman must be dying before she qualifies for a termination of pregnancy.<\/p> <p>  When we look at maternal deaths, a significant proportion are related to women with other diseases during pregnancy, like cystic fibrosis and bleeding disorders.  We must acknowledge that when we consider risks to women.  What is required is sound clinical judgment.  There must be trust in society that doctors and women will come to make a good decision that will keep women safe.<\/p> <p>  In most cases of pregnancy women really want to be pregnant and I have seen women risk their lives in order to have a baby.  It is not really the risk of dying that makes women suddenly want to terminate a pregnancy.  These are often babies that are really wanted but the women become too ill or are at risk of dying.  As clinicians, we are charged with getting complex clinical diagnoses right in what can be a very narrow therapeutic window.<\/p> <p>  I will bring the committee back to the example of ruptured membranes at 14 weeks.  There is very little chance a baby in that scenario will survive but there is a significant risk for that woman that she will develop an infection called chorioamnionitis.  This is where the pregnancy itself becomes the infection and the woman would be at a substantial risk of dying.  The only way to treat the infection is to terminate the pregnancy and give an antibiotic.  When we have a clinical suspicion of chorioamnionitis, we might not get microbiology results as confirmation for 48 hours and we must make a clinical decision.  Therefore, doctors are concerned that if they intervene too early, it might not really be chorioamnionitis and they might have got it wrong.  They might be at risk of a custodial sentence.  They may wait too long.  Women and young women in particular often decompensate very suddenly and can appear much better than they are.  They can appear quite well and have very advanced infection.  If they decompensate, the clinician would be in a position where he or she must conduct a termination of pregnancy in a woman who would be very ill.  It can be a very narrow therapeutic window and doctors are charged with getting it right.

There may be some placental tissue, for example, left inside.  I assure committee members and patients at large that when patients present in such cases, they will never be judged and will always get absolute top-quality care immediately.  There is no question of patients being quizzed as to what their motives were or adding to their difficulty.  They will always get appropriate care.  Unfortunately, we have significant experience of patients coming to the accident and emergency room having taken medication and perhaps not doing so in the appropriate way.  The other problem, as I noted in my position paper, is that when one sources medication like that on the Internet, one would have absolutely no idea what is received.  It can be a very challenging issue.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the personnel needed should there be legislative change such that pregnancy termination would occur in Ireland.  In general, there is no significant difference I foresee in terms of skill set.  Medical termination of pregnancy is very similar to what we do now when patients present at 12, 14 or 16 weeks with the unfortunate situation where a baby's heartbeat has stopped.<\/p><p>The same medical process occurs.  Surgical pregnancy termination earlier in pregnancy, meaning at less than 14 weeks, is, technically, the same procedure we do at present when patients present with what is called a missed miscarriage.  I do not foresee any significant difference in the need for qualifications of personnel.  I do, however, foresee a significant increase in resources needed.  Last year, 55 women went from the Rotunda to the UK for pregnancy termination for severe complex foetal abnormalities, which is one case a week.  I am reasonably confident the Rotunda would be able to absorb that workload into our current situation.  If many more patients who terminate for other reasons were to have those procedures performed in Ireland, there would be a significant resource implication for us.  By \"resources\" I mean personnel numbers and a physical environment in which to care for patients such as these in an appropriate manner.  The Rotunda is a wonderful place and a wonderful building, but it was built in 1757.

We appreciate how busy they are and we are very grateful for their time and expertise in this matter because we are politicians and they are the experts.  It has been very informative so far.  Professor Malone referred to the need to provide complete health care services for women.  For the avoidance of any doubt, and I want to keep this brief, that includes the provision of access to abortion and the after-care that goes with it.  I am not trying to put words into Professor Malone's mouth, but I want to clear that up first.<\/p> <p>  Foetal anomaly scanning is very hit and miss, and this is something I have spoken about on numerous occasions.  Dr. Mahony is nodding.  It is unfortunate that a woman may find out very late in her pregnancy that the foetus has a fatal or lethal anomaly.  Does having to travel on top of this add to the complications?  Clearly, it will increase the stress, but does it add to the complications?  Were the woman able to access abortion services here in Ireland it would considerably decrease the stress and, as Professor Malone outlined, the potential for physical harm, as happened in one very unfortunate case.<\/p> <p>  My final question relates to a reference in Professor Malone's evidence to post-termination autopsy and genetic testing.  Will he speak to us briefly about how important this is and what we can potentially learn from it?  Is that information completely unavailable because the procedure is carried out in another jurisdiction or is some of it available?  I ask Professor Malone to tease out how it works.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017101100002#DD00300","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507723200,"counter":224,"content":"<p>The Deputy is absolutely correct in her initial characterisation of my comments.  When I call for access to complete health care I do indeed mean the pregnancy termination procedure in Irish hospitals followed by the after-care, because that is the only appropriate way to perform any medical care.  I do not know of any other aspect of medicine where we suggest that people would go to another country to have part of their care but we will look after them afterwards.  As a general theme this is what we mean.<\/p> <p>  As regards a late diagnosis of the foetal abnormality and a patient travelling then, I absolutely agree it is true there will be more potential complications if the patient travels then.  The uterus is much bigger.  There is much more blood supply to the uterus later in pregnancy.  There is much greater chance of significant bleeding.  A patient travelling later in pregnancy is absolutely associated with much more risk.  We would never like to see that happening but, unfortunately, it does.<\/p> <p>  As regards a perinatal autopsy, this is an absolutely crucial point.  At present, since patients have to pay for everything themselves when they to go to the United Kingdom for termination of pregnancy they are often in a dreadful situation, having a certain amount of money to spend on the flights, hotel and basic procedure, and they just cannot afford an autopsy and special genetic testing.  Unfortunately, they will decide they cannot do it.  If the procedure was done in Ireland, public or private would make no difference as complete testing is done as part of the public health service.  Patients in Ireland would have a total diagnosis.<\/p> <p>  Having a total diagnosis is crucial.  Some genetic conditions have as much as a 25% or 50% chance of coming back again, whereas other conditions may have less than a 1% chance.  I would think most families would want to know if the condition they have just gone through had a 25% or 1% chance of recurring.  Additionally, the advent of preimplantation genetic diagnosis means that after certain types of genetic diagnoses are made, if a patient undergoes IVF, on the next pregnancy before the embryos are reimplanted it is possible to biopsy those embryos and find the ones that have the genetic condition and, crucially, the ones that do not, and then only replace an embryo that has been proven not to have the genetic condition.  When a patient does not have this information as she cannot afford it because she is forced to undergo a procedure in a different jurisdiction, it has profound implications for her future fertility.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017101100002#DD00400","nonspeaker":"Professor Fergal Malone"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507723200,"counter":225,"content":"<p>As a supplementary, and coming back to the last two questions on after-care, particularly on the taking of abortion pills, I re-emphasise to patients that if they present our primary consideration is to provide care for them.  It is not just the physical consequences.  There are also psychological consequences, and the circumstances in which a young person might choose to obtain tablets from a source she does not know and take them with all that risk, and why she is doing that on her own without accessing good medical care.  I am referring to children, women of limited means who cannot travel and the other components and complexities that can exist for women who find themselves in a position where they do not want to be pregnant.<\/p> <p>  I re-emphasise the primary reason for foetal anomaly scanning is to identify treatable conditions in foetuses so when the babies are born we can optimise the care we give them.  We know this can have a significant impact on survival.  The classic example is congenital heart abnormality, where we are ready for the baby, we can institute the correct therapy, and the surgeons meet the mother in advance of delivery when plans can be made.  It makes a big difference with regard to diaphragmatic hernia and gastroschisis for us to know the conditions are there so we can plan for the baby and enhance survival.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy is right that anomaly scanning is performed at 18 to 22 weeks.  There is a cut-off limit in the UK at 24 weeks in general for termination of pregnancy.  This can mean patients suddenly have to grapple with a diagnosis in which we say to them our experience tells us the baby will not survive.  If they choose to make the decision to travel to the UK for termination of pregnancy they must make the phone calls, find the appointment and organise their travel, their children, their jobs and other elements of their lives.  Unfortunately, there are big resource issues not just in Ireland but in the UK, and increasingly women face delays in the UK in areas such as Liverpool, which have provided a great deal of service to women in this context.<\/p> <p>  With regard to post mortems, we do not have very good perinatal services in Ireland.  We have a very limited number of perinatal pathologists.  It is a very specialised area.  We are lucky in Holles Street and the Rotunda to have such specialised doctors and laboratory technicians, but this is not the case throughout the country.  In many hospitals in Ireland there is a real difficulty at present in accessing post mortems.  As Professor Malone said, this can make a big difference because some diseases have a significant recurrence rate and parents need to know this if they are going to embark on another pregnancy.  The same goes for genetic services.  We have very few perinatal clinical geneticists in this country, but if we look at how the technology is progressing, there is microarray and the ability to look at chromosomes and genetic material.  We can now characterise the entire human genome.  All of this technology is coming down the track, including the ability to edit the human genome, and we have very limited genetic services in this country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017101100002#DD00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Rhona Mahony"},{"type":"speech","time":1507723200,"counter":226,"content":"<p>I call Senator Ruane, who has six minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017101100002#DD00600","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speech","time":1507723200,"counter":227,"content":"<p>I thank the delegates for their presentations.  My first question does not arise because I consider it to be in any way attached to the issues concerning women who do not want to continue their pregnancy.  However, as it has been a recurring theme in recent weeks, I am interested in the delegates' views on it.  We often hear that Ireland is one of the safest countries in the world in which to be pregnant and give birth.  Will the witnesses indicate how safety is assessed in Irish maternity care and whether we measure maternal morbidity as well as mortality?  To reiterate, I see this as a separate issue, but the delegates are probably the best people to address the matter so that we do not have to hear it every week.<\/p> <p>  In his presentation, Professor Malone said that the Rotunda Hospital provides 10,000 20-week to 24-week scans for foetal anomaly and noted that many hospitals do not have the resources for such scanning.  If all pregnant women are not undergoing such scanning due to inadequate resources, what are the factors determining which women are offered it and which are not?<\/p> <p>  In regard to conscientious objection, reference was made to how this might become a problem in smaller hospitals.  What role do the delegates see for integrated services, including a role for GPs, in the future provision of termination of pregnancy services?  Apart from cases of foetal anomaly and in a scenario where we are looking at an earlier stage in pregnancy - say, up to 12 weeks - and cases where termination of pregnancy is being entered into willingly, might there be a role for GPs in the provision of medications?  How do the witnesses envisage the handling of conscious disagreement or objection in cases where a patient might be facing waiting lists to access a different GP?  What types of issues might arise in such circumstances?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017101100002#EE00100","speaker":"1404"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507723200,"counter":228,"content":"<p>On the question of maternal mortality and morbidity, we monitor those issues very closely.  Indeed, the three Dublin maternity hospitals have been producing annual clinical reports for decades.  In the case of the Rotunda, in fact, it probably has been done for more than 100 years or even 200 years.  In addition to the year-to-year information, we can also plot the trends.  At the moment, the maternal mortality rate is somewhere between eight and ten per 100,000, which compares very favourably with statistics internationally.  In the United States, for example, where a much larger proportion of GDP is spent on the health budget, the maternal mortality rate is 17 per 100,000.  In the United Kingdom, the rate is ten to 12 per 100,000, with similar rates in France and throughout Europe.  In the Scandinavian countries, the rate is six to eight.  We have, therefore, very low maternal mortality, although there are small differences there.  Some 99% of maternal deaths occur in the developing world where mortality rates can be as high as 350 per 100,000 in any one country, which is a staggering figure.<\/p> <p>  In terms of maternal morbidity, approximately two women in every 1,000 pregnancies will have a very severe morbidity issue.  These include massive obstetric haemorrhages, clots, venous thromboembolic disease, uterine rupture, etc.  We have a list of very severe morbidities and we keep a record of their incidence nationally in conjunction with the National Perinatal Epidemiology Centre, NPEC, at University College Cork.  Again, we can see certain trends from these data.  If I were to comment on one such trend, it would be the rise in cases of haemorrhage.  That is what worries me most as Master of the National Maternity Hospital, in particular the increasing incidence of postpartum haemorrhage.  The other striking trend in terms of maternal morbidity is the increase in maternal age and maternal obesity, both of which have a significant impact on delivery and risk.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017101100002#EE00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Rhona Mahony"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507723200,"counter":229,"content":"<p>The Senator referred to the prospect of more integrated services, perhaps at the primary care level and earlier in pregnancy.  We are strong supporters of that concept.  We want normal obstetrics to be delivered in the community as much as possible, by midwives and GPs, with the involvement of hospital obstetricians occurring only on an as-needed basis.  That is the more efficient way to do things.  However, that does leave open the potential, as the Senator observed, for situations where the local GP has a conscientious objection.  The Medical Council is clear on this in that while doctors are entitled and allowed to have their own personal viewpoints and conscientious objections, there is an obligation on a doctor to ensure a patient is not disadvantaged as a consequence of any such view or objection.  In such cases, there is an obligation to refer the patient to another doctor.  I hope that would be done as efficiently as possible.<\/p> <p>  On the factors which dictate which patients receive scans, a crucial concept with foetal anomaly scanning is that it needs to be provided to all patients.  Only a minority of foetal abnormalities occur in the setting of a previously affected pregnancy or a patient who has a strong family history.  The vast majority of foetal abnormalities occur on a once-off basis where the couple in question had no previous idea such a problem might arise.  We will only find those abnormalities if the scan is made available equally to everyone.  It is not appropriate and not efficient to take just a certain age group or a certain disease category and provide a scan for those patients.  That is one of the challenges we have in our health care system at the moment.  In the RCSI hospital group, for example, of which the Rotunda is part, a new programme has been rolling out over the past month to resource foetal anomaly scans for Cavan General Hospital and Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital by way of the provision of a certain number of contract hours by newly appointed hospital group staff at those locations.  We will see some improvements in that regard but it is a major deficit of the Irish health care system at this time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017101100002#EE00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Fergal Malone"},{"type":"speech","time":1507723200,"counter":230,"content":"<p>The observation that services in the United Kingdom are under strain was made several times.

I am not saying the witnesses were suggesting otherwise, but we do need some clarity on the necessity of having adequate resources in place to provide best care for women in that context.

Yet we have the lowest number of obstetricians in the OECD, comprising some 140,000 to 150,000 whole-time equivalent posts.  By any reasonable international standard, that number should be at least twice if not three times as large.  In terms of midwifery services, last year we conducted a national study called Birthrate Plus which identified that Ireland's complement of midwives is 140 short, including a shortfall of 25 in my own hospital.  That is a very serious deficit.  The problem, however, is not confined to a shortfall in staffing provision.  We also have a huge problem recruiting and retaining staff, which is a major issue, particularly outside Dublin.  In fact, it is a global problem which exists across a range of countries and represents a real risk over the next ten to 20 years.  We have just done a survey of doctors in training which found that very few of them want to work outside Dublin.  Already, there are units outside the capital with very high locum dependency and experiencing great difficulties in attracting obstetricians.  On the midwifery side, we have a particular problem recruiting midwives who are trained to scan and midwives or nurses qualified to work in theatre and in neonatal units.  Again, these are very specialised areas and one cannot just go to market.  These are people who trained for a long time and have very good skill levels.<\/p> <p>  On the one hand, then, there are these difficulties with resources and the fact the units are all very busy.  Professor Malone and I each work in units delivering almost 9,000 babies per year.  Arising out of that resourcing issue is a related problem.<\/p><p>Last year, the State paid &euro;1.6 billion settling medical negligence claims.  Some 60% of that was in obstetrics although internationally our outcomes compare favourably.  Our health budget is approximately &euro;13 billion.  We do not have a direct budget for obstetrics but I estimate that it is not more than &euro;1 billion.  It is likely that we are now paying more money to settle medical negligence claims than we are using, despite the deficit, to resource our service in the first place.  <\/p><p> I believe there is a need to decriminalise.  A complex medical decision is being made and I am not aware of any other area of medicine where people are charged with making complex medical decisions under the shadow of a custodial sentence of 14 years.  We had an opportunity in the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act to decriminalise but we did not take that opportunity, which is a pity.  I support the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland's statement that medical procedures pertaining to women in pregnancy should be treated with the same regulation as any medical procedure and not in a criminal context. <\/p><p> On training, first we have a problem recruiting trainees to do obstetrics because it is such a high-risk area.  It is a punitive area in Ireland in which to practise.  People are becoming increasingly fearful of practising obstetrics in this country, which does not make women safer.  We need to support the clinicians at the coal face who are delivering difficult care.  Our primary aim when training young doctors and midwives is that they will be good clinicians and that their primary objective will be to provide good, sound clinical care.  <\/p><p> On the strain in the UK, this year on International Women's Day, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists held a meeting dealing with issues surrounding termination of pregnancy.

I think it was Professor Kenny from Cork who said one a week cannot be triaged so there are random instances of foetal abnormalities which one would not imagine would happen.

Why do doctors advise women not to announce their pregnancies until after the 12-week scan or the 12-week stage?  What percentage of pregnancies end in miscarriage?  How is a miscarriage recorded on a woman's medical chart in a hospital?  It may be of value to the committee to know that, as a pharmacist, I have dispensed plenty of Misoprostol in my time for people who have diagnosed miscarriages.  It has been nailed down by medical professionals such as the witnesses.  Therefore, on the idea that Misoprostol is a drug that is not available, it is cheap and it is readily available.

When does a foetus become sentient?  We have spoken about the earliest point at which a child has survived.  Was it 24 weeks?

From the witnesses' evidence today, it could involve a multiple of factors coming together.  All of that can be helped by proper scanning as well as the maternal blood tests that are now available at eight weeks.

In paediatric care, when an unfortunate baby in the neo-natal intensive care unit is dying from prematurity, the paediatrician, the neonatologist and the family speak to each other, rationalise what is going on and together make a decision on when to withdraw care.  That does not involve external agencies or any legal impediment.  It is a common sense doctor-patient relationship and we want to do whatever we can to preserve it.  Yet, in this aspect of foetal care there is an external force or cloud hanging over what can or cannot be done.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the terms \"miscarriage\" and \"stillbirth\".  Traditionally, miscarriage is the loss of a pregnancy before viability at 24 weeks or 500 g.  Stillbirth is the term beyond that.  It is for that reason many obstetricians say and families decide not to tell other people that they are pregnant until after 12 weeks.  It is because most spontaneous miscarriages will reveal themselves by then.<\/p><p> The Deputy asked for a percentage.  About 30% to 40% of all human conceptions will end in a miscarriage.

About two years ago, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists convened a working group, bringing together various neurologists and physiologists, to specifically examine that.  It was about the sense of pain and when a foetus might feel pain and it was clear from the consensus among a wide range of disciplines that that does not occur before 24 weeks and is probably closer to 30 weeks.  It is a mistake to assume that just because an ex-25 week foetus in the neonatal intensive care unit can show signs of feeling pain that the same 25-week foetus <i>in utero<\/i>will feel pain.

Miscarriage is much less common in the second trimester, which is between 14 weeks and 24 weeks, but we can have issues like antiphospholipid syndrome or sticky blood syndromes, infection and cervical incompetence, but it is much rarer.  Stillbirth after 24 weeks is very rare.  We are looking at instances of about two to three per 1,000.  The 12 week issue comes from the fact that at least one in five pregnancies will end in miscarriage in the first trimester.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017101100002#GG00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Rhona Mahony"},{"type":"speech","time":1507723200,"counter":243,"content":"<p>Could one of the witnesses clarify the position about the heart or the heartbeat?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017101100002#GG00500","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507723200,"counter":244,"content":"<p>The heart begins to develop as a tube very early on in pregnancy but then it must develop into the chambers.

Dr. Mahony spoke a lot about the criminal law but I think she would accept that even in Britain there is a criminal law restricting abortion, that doctors are subject to the criminal law in Britain and that, in general terms, the criminal law is part of helping society distinguish between rogue and good doctors.  Would she accept that the fact that there is no case law in Ireland showing that doctors have been found wanting or have been subjected to the criminal law suggests that the balance has been got fairly right and that, in general, there is a reluctance to second-guess a judgment made by a doctor, particularly given that the risk to life does not have to be imminent?  The balance seems to be well struck if the witnesses are not able to cite case law about how doctors found themselves in trouble in this area.<\/p> <p>  This is an issue about balancing risk, and the witnesses are experts in that, but it is also a question about values and it seems to me that how they view abortion generally will impact on their views about how to manage risk in this area.  Are there aspects of the British abortion law that they find unethical or that shock the witnesses?  I may have misunderstood Dr. Mahony to say that 24 weeks was the cut-off point where there was a question of a disability and that that was exercising pressure.  My understanding is that the relevant ground in the British law, and please correct me if I am wrong, does not specify a time limit and that is why there have been cases of children with disabilities as minor as cleft palate being aborted very late term in Britain.  I would like the witnesses to tell us where they are coming from because it is not just about medical expertise.  There is an interaction with values, particularly as it seems that it is only in recent years we hear expert doctors in Ireland talking about all of these matters.  Ten years ago when, presumably, we knew less in medicine, and I am asking both witnesses to address these questions.  Doctors seemed to be happy that there was this balance in our law that allowed them to care for two patients.  I have not heard that kind of narrative in what the witnesses have said today.<\/p> <p>  On the question of foetal abnormality, and I think Professor Malone excludes the term \"fatal\" from what he is seeking to be lawful - please correct me if I am wrong - do the witnesses accept the testimony of families who believe that where their child was diagnosed with what has been called fatal foetal abnormality, it was not just a matter of their choice as parents being respected in terms of whichever road they took but that they felt that their child had a right to be respected until their natural end?  Do the witnesses accept that there is nothing they can say to convince those people because they see it as a right their little child had, particularly when we think that what might happen to that child in the context of a termination would be the injection of potassium chloride into the child's heart preparatory to the termination?  Please correct me if I am mistaken about that.  Would they accept that they find that impossible to relate to any notion of respect for that child?<\/p> <p>  Regarding choreoamnionitis, I am a little confused.  I would like to know first whether Professor Malone is completely of one view with Dr. Mahony on this issue.  I have spoken with some midwives, and the witnesses might tell me who is wrong on this, who have been surprised by Dr. Mahony's claim that doctors must simply wait until an infection occurs.  They cite, for example, the Health Service Executive's 2015 guidelines on chorioamnionitis, which state that women with clinical signs of chorioamneonitis should be commenced on broad spectrum intravenous antibiotics and that delivery should be undertaken.  Given that this is not an issue, and the witnesses can correct me if I am wrong, where I imagine a person would have to go abroad - they would be too sick - it appears to be the case that the current legal architecture is allowing doctors to do what they have to do.<\/p> <p>  Do the witnesses believe that 48 hours is reasonable in terms of blood culture results?  Is that reasonable or a sign of an inadequacy in terms of resources?  Could that period be shortened?  Is it desirable that it be shortened?  Would that be a help?  However, the main question is whether there is a problem here if the witnesses appear to be dealing with this situation very well.  We have not heard of sad cases.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017101100002#GG00900","speaker":"1401"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507723200,"counter":248,"content":"<p>The Senator asked a lot of questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017101100002#GG01000","nonspeaker":"Dr. Rhona Mahony"},{"type":"speech","time":1507723200,"counter":249,"content":"<p>We have very little time left for answers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017101100002#GG01100","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507723200,"counter":250,"content":"<p>Very briefly, in regard to the UK, the Senator is right.

Patients often do not show they have a temperature or tachychardia, fast heart rate, foul-smelling fluid or a tender abdomen until much later in the course.  If a patient has ruptured membranes for 14, 15 or 16 weeks, she could well be developing it.

When one looks at the methodology in that paper, one can see that many of the patients who were recruited came from social media campaigns or were tracked down or recruited through social media.  As a clinician scientist, and I carry out and have published a lot of research studies, how one recruits patients into a study is crucial to the outcome.  If one recruits patients who might have a certain viewpoint already and go to social media to recruit them into the study, it is not all surprising if the results are in a particular direction.  The unbiased recruitment of patients is crucial to any science in any speciality.  That would be my concern about the Cope paper cited by the Deputy.<br\/><br\/>I believe all of our patients have rights to health, well-being and dignity and that is what we strive to do day in and day out with our patients.

We are all aware of the costs of travelling and the fact that they are prohibitive for some women.  If I understood Professor Malone correctly, he said that in some cases where there was a fatal foetal abnormality, the cost factor in terms of autopsies and further testing might deter a woman from having testing done that might have facilitated her to have a successful pregnancy thereafter and a baby that could be delivered and would live.  Could he clarify that because that is something I certainly had thought about before?<\/p> <p>  My second question is a follow-up to Deputy Daly's question about training.  Both witnesses are both Masters and senior clinicians but in terms of people not wanting to go into the profession partly because of the criminalisation issue and also having to make those decisions around when it is a risk to health and when it becomes a risk to life, does that also deter people coming from other jurisdictions who would not have grown up under the eighth amendment from taking the risk of taking a job in obstetrics and gynaecology in Ireland because of the issues around the eighth amendment?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017101100002#JJ01200","speaker":"1325"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507723200,"counter":283,"content":"<p>The Deputy's initial question is a very real concern and we have had experience with it.  A patient goes to the UK, has a pregnancy termination and we do not have a clear diagnosis when she leaves.  What would have happened in Ireland is an autopsy with some extensive genetic testing.  In respect of some of the newer genetic tests, an individual genetic test can cost &euro;500, &euro;600 or &euro;800 for one test so that would be done here and in many cases, we get an answer.  However, if the patient is in the UK and is not entitled to free care on the NHS because she is not registered as an NHS patient - she is an Irish patient - and she wants that testing, she will have to pay for it.  Some parents will pay for it because it is medically crucial information but we know some patients already struggle to reach the &euro;800 to &euro;1,500 a termination in the UK costs and now also have to find another &euro;500, &euro;1,000 or &euro;1,500.  We have had parents who have decided not to have the relevant testing done and are then left with an incomplete diagnosis - \"my baby died because of a brain abnormality but we are not exactly sure what kind of brain abnormality\" - and they have no idea what the chances of it coming back again are so it is a real issue and would be one that would not be there if we could undertake the complete care for our patients here.<\/p> <p>  As regards training, it is important to differentiate between doctors in training and a senior consultant of 60 or 65 years of age who has been around the block for 20 or 30 years.  The self-confidence that comes with being a clinician who is 60 years of age and who can make a stand and say, \"This is what I am going to do\" is very different to a 24 or 25-year-old intern or SHO.  It is expecting a young inexperienced doctor to have such a spine as to say, \"You know what, I don't care what the criminal code says.  This is the right thing to do and I'm going to do it\".  I can see a 60 or 65-year-old experienced clinician saying, \"That is what I am going to do\" and the legislation not having a chilling effect on them but it is very different for a doctor in training, so I do think it has an impact.  One of the earlier questions suggested that other doctors have come into the committee and said that they do not see that as a problem.  That is great and that comes with 20, 30 or 40 years of practice but these are not necessarily the doctors at the coal-face at 2 a.m.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017101100002#JJ01300","nonspeaker":"Professor Fergal Malone"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507723200,"counter":284,"content":"<p>It is important to note that we generally work as a team and if there is a complex medical issue, consultants and trainees work together and, generally, consultants have a really big input when a patient is unwell or where there are complex clinical issues, so I would like to think that it is very rare that a trainee would find themselves on their own in this context.  We generally work very hard to work as teams but there is a broader issue regarding training.  It is not just the chilling effect of the eighth amendment.  There are broader issues relating to obstetrics, recruitment into training and attrition rates.<\/p><p>That is because obstetrics is very high risk.  We have long hours.  It is a surgical specialty.  Complications can arise, not necessarily due to somebody's fault, but they can arise unpredictably and they can be very profound.<\/p><p> In terms of adverse outcome, our specialty experiences maternal death, the death of baby or a baby who is very damaged and has cerebral palsy.  These are very high-risk stakes.  For some young people, these kinds of outcomes will make them wish not to practise in obstetric medicine.  On top of that, it is quite punitive to practice in Ireland.  We have a good deal of regulation, which is a good thing but, at the same time, if there is an adverse outcome, one can face into a High Court litigation, a civil litigation, or a Medical Council hearing.  Perhaps one of the most difficult aspects is the fact that Medical Council hearings or other cases are covered in the media, and that is very difficult when one lives in a country with a population of 4.7 million and one sees one's name regarding a case or very intimate details of cases being published.<\/p><p> Ireland is a little different with respect to women and women's health regarding the intimate details about women, particularly in the area of termination of pregnancy, that find their way into the newspapers.  At times I have been quite shocked at the level of the detail because it makes women readily identifiable.  Also, we do not tend to see similar reporting with respect to men, for example, having prostate surgery.  There is a bias there.  That can frighten young doctors.  Certainly when we see cases like the Y case or other very high-profile cases, no doctor wants to find himself or herself as part of the next media sensation.  We never want to be part of an adverse outcome, but they will happen because our specialty is very high risk, and even though we do our very best, we will have complications and adverse outcomes.

Apart from the fact that one does not know what one is taking when one gets tablets over the Internet, which is a very important public health message because people get all kinds of tablets over the Internet, on top of that, there is not the support for women to navigate those circumstances.

Obviously, they are used for 80% of abortions in Finland and are medically extremely safe, but I am sure the witnesses would agree it would be much better if women in Ireland could go to their GP, have a discussion and be prescribed them, as they can be prescribed to women in practically every other country in Europe.  We might be sending out the message that they are quite safe.  According to the research that we heard about earlier, about 4% of women had to seek help because they were not sure if they had completed an abortion.<\/p> <p>  My questions relate to the hospital system.  Why do the witnesses think the level of testing in Ireland is so poor?  Obviously, cost must be a huge factor, but is the position of the Catholic Church a factor as well in the sense that pregnant women getting tested for abnormalities of any kind has been definitely discouraged.  That certainly was my experience.  Different hospitals have different positions on it.  Given the level of such testing is very poor and many women do not get access to the system until 23 or 24 weeks, would the witnesses agree that there cannot be a time limit if abortion is legalised for a fatal foetal abnormality?  Otherwise, we would be excluding those people who have been disadvantaged through an accident of where they happen to be situated.<\/p> <p>  Professor Malone said in his presentation that it is now possible to detect to 95% to 99% of foetal chromosomal abnormalities as early as nine to ten weeks of pregnancy.  Therefore, we could be detecting these issues much earlier and making the whole trauma for a pregnant woman completely different.  What would be the cost involved in testing?  As it involves just a blood test, it is hard to understand why it costs so much.<\/p> <p>  Have either of the witnesses encountered women who were not able to access a termination because they could not afford to go to England, and what has happened to those women who were so diagnosed?  Would they have encountered women in their clinics who are pregnant and where there is not a fatal foetal abnormality but who would like to have an abortion because, as in the case of the 62% of the women who have used abortion pills, they are mothers already, they have children and they know what it is like to be pregnant, to give birth and to bring up a child?  Would they have encountered such women or are they just too afraid to talk to the witnesses about that?<\/p> <p>  On the issue which has been raised of the chilling effect on doctors, I was struck by Professor Malone saying in his presentation that doctors cannot even pick up a phone and make a referral.  That says it all to me.  The procedure is perfectly legal in Britain but yet he is not allowed to ring another doctor in Britain and make a referral.  Is that not going beyond the bounds of the eighth amendment, or is it just that doctors are too afraid to challenge it in any way?<\/p> <p>  On the issue of maternal deaths, we regularly hear that Ireland is the safest place in the world in which to have a baby, but generally it is not people who have had a baby in Ireland who say that.  There has been an increase in maternal deaths.  Dr. Mahony gave some of the reasons for that in terms of women being older, obesity being a factor, etc.  Are the witnesses very concerned that migrant women and non-Irish women are showing up disproportionately in those deaths?  Does that not say something about perhaps their having less access to health care or getting it later?  Are the witnesses happy that those women are being listened to?  Are there cultural issues involved as well?  Even in the case of Savita or other women, perhaps their wishes are being listened to and they are being told this is the Irish situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017101100002#KK00500","speaker":"1434"},{"type":"speech","time":1507723200,"counter":290,"content":"<p>The Deputy might need to let the witnesses respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017101100002#KK00600","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speech","time":1507723200,"counter":291,"content":"<p>I wish to ask one last question about Down's syndrome, because it is something which is constantly raised in the committee.

That is business.<\/p> <p>  If we could have a genetic sequencer and the required laboratory technology here, I am confident that the test could be performed at as low a cost of &euro;150 or &euro;100.  The cost could be reduced considerably if we developed an appropriate genetic laboratory here.  At the moment, patients have to pay about &euro;350 because a sample is sent to commercial laboratories in the United States or London.<\/p> <p>  On the comment that doctors cannot even lift a telephone to make a referral, that is true.  There is a ridiculous situation now whereby some doctors are using euphemisms.  They will write a letter to another doctor in the United Kingdom and ask him or her to see a patient with anencephaly for a second opinion.  It is a euphemism for saying that he or she is not sending a patient over for a termination of pregnancy because that would be a referral, but is instead asking for a second opinion.

There is a safety record when the correct tablets are taken correctly.  However, when medication is obtained over the Internet, its source is not known, which is a risk.<br\/><br\/>In addition, occasionally people have ectopic pregnancies, where a pregnancy has occurred in the tube and not the womb.  That can cause significant risk in terms of misdiagnosis.  It is much better that care is offered with a degree of expertise and women are not completely going it alone in terms of care during pregnancy.<br\/><br\/>On perinatal testing, first trimester screening looks at chromosomal anomalies, specifically trisomy 21 or Down's syndrome, Edward's syndrome and Patau syndrome.  The test is currently about &euro;350.  The number of women accessing it in Holles Street has increased.  When the test was first introduced three years ago, two or three women requested it and now more than 1,000 do so.  There is a significant cost which means that women of limited means are not able to afford the test.<br\/><br\/>The commonest prenatal diagnostic test is ultrasound.  In my experience, most women will opt to have a foetal ultrasound.  Very few women refuse or decline ultrasound during pregnancy.  The reason we have ultrasound is to be able to give the best possible care to a baby where an anomaly has been identified and we can prepare for birth.  It is an important reason we look for foetal anomaly.<br\/><br\/>In terms of maternal mortality and morbidity, we looked at morbidity and I agree with Professor Malone that people of different ethnicities have different outcomes.  There is no doubt that it is not enough to look at maternal mortality because those numbers are small and have been relatively stable over recent triennials.<br\/><br\/>Women of different ethnicities are disproportionately represented in terms of morbidity for all of the reasons outlined by Professor Malone.  These include access to care and perhaps not coming for antenatal care.  Some women, by virtue of their ethnicity, naturally have an increased risk of pre-eclampsia or fibroid uterus which poses attendant risk.<br\/><br\/>On the idea that Ireland is the safest place in which to give birth, I do not think people would say it and it is not a sensible approach.  The point is that we monitor the data and check outcomes constantly.  One should not practise clinical medicine unless one is looking at outcomes.  We are trying to identify trends.  I referred earlier to my concern about the trend of increasing haemorrhage, for example.  We are trying to monitor such trends in order that we can safeguard women in the future and plan our services to provide the best possible care given the current challenges faced by any health service.<br\/><br\/>I wish to make a brief comment on Down's syndrome.  It is not one condition.  There is a spectrum of disorder in Down's syndrome.  Some children with Down's syndrome will be born very healthy.  Others have very serious cardiac or other defects which mean they will not survive <i>in utero<\/i>or will die very soon after birth.  We have to take that into account.  It is very likely that it comes into account when women are making decisions regarding termination of pregnancy.  It is not simply one disorder.  Infants with Down's syndrome can have a broad spectrum of challenges.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017101100002#LL01300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Rhona Mahony"},{"type":"speech","time":1507723200,"counter":304,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Mahony.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017101100002#LL01400","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speech","time":1507723200,"counter":305,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their contributions.

We have not just Medical Council guidelines but also HSE and national guidelines to help and assist us to provide optimum care to our patients.  We cannot be negligent: we have to provide good, sound clinical care and there is good regulation in this country to ensure that doctors practise appropriately.  The issue with obstetric medicine is that not a lot of other areas of medicine have an insert in the Constitution that has such an effect on clinical practice.  Going back to the 1983 referendum, there was difficulty in choosing that wording and trying to determine its consequences.  The number of subsequent referenda that have taken place - on the right to information, for example, or the right to travel - shows that we have done more or less everything to circumnavigate this issue without actually dealing with the effect of the eighth amendment on clinical care.  This is something that Ireland really needs to deal with because I believe that the presence of the eighth amendment in the Constitution creates substantial clinical risk.<\/p> <p>  There are other options.  There are many different examples all over Europe of countries choosing to legislate in different ways, from highly restrictive legislation in countries like Malta; fairly restrictive legislation in Germany; to more open legislation in other countries.

We must start at the beginning.  If we are going to equip young men and women for adulthood then we really need to provide them with good sex education.  This should begin in school and continue throughout their lives.  Sometimes the programmes in our schools can be quite limited, however.  It is not just a matter of learning the biology of how a woman gets pregnant but also all of the other issues surrounding that, such as alcohol and drug use, for example.  That is very important.  It is also important that we have supports there for young women who do find themselves pregnant.  There needs to be good support and good counselling and they need to be able to get access to care.  In our hospitals, for example, we have adolescent clinics in order that young girls can, first of all, meet one other, and second, not go through a system with much older women causing them to feel even more excluded.  Nor is this just a matter for women.  We also need to equip men to deal with human sexuality.  I think Senator Buttimer has asked a great question and that as a society, we need to work really hard with young boys and girls in order that they can have respectful, healthy and responsible intimate relationships.  This means that if people do not want to get pregnant in the first place they do not become pregnant, and that if they eventually do become pregnant they are healthy and able to deal with the pregnancy.

I thank the committee very much for the invitation to attend this hearing to discuss the subject of adult safeguarding.  I am joined today by my colleague, Mr. Niall Redmond, principal officer, services for older people.<\/p> <p>  The safety and protection of vulnerable people is a key objective of Government and society.  We already have a range of legislation and policy-based measures to that end but it is acknowledged that there are gaps in legislation and also that promoting awareness and cultural change is key to effective safeguarding.<\/p> <p>  The opportunity to consider this topic is welcome and timely for the Department of Health, which is considering, subject to Government approval, the development of a comprehensive national safeguarding policy for the health sector underpinned with appropriate legislation.  This is a very broad and complex piece of work involving an extensive scoping exercise to determine the precise nature of the policy and the legislative framework that may be required to support it.  It includes reviewing current practice and legislation, researching best practice internationally and wideranging consultation.  <\/p> <p>  In terms of existing measures, we have seen in recent decades, within and beyond the health sector, the strengthening of policies, procedures, professional codes of practice, primary and secondary legislation to protect and safeguard our most vulnerable citizens.  Health sector safeguarding of adults at risk relies both on broader legislation and codes, including the criminal justice system and health sector specific provisions.  <\/p> <p>  The range of protections for adults at risk in existing legislation include: the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012; the Protected Disclosures Act 2014; the Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences Against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012; financial and consumer protection legislation; domestic violence and family law legislation; Irish criminal law, including specified sexual offences in respect of protected persons; and a number of Acts relating to equality, anti-discrimination and social inclusion such as the Equal Status and Equality Acts and the Disability Act 2005.<\/p> <p>  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 is a very important Act in terms of protecting vulnerable adults.  It provides a detailed statutory framework for individuals to be assisted and supported in making decisions about their welfare and their property and affairs.<\/p><p>The Act is a game-changer in terms of safeguarding, both by maximising individuals' control over their own lives and through a range of robust provisions to protect vulnerable people against exploitation and abuse.  <\/p><p> Within the health sector, a number of important steps have been taken in recent years to strengthen the protection of recipients of health services, including vulnerable adults.  Relevant legislation in the health sector includes: the Mental Health Act 2001; the statutory complaints provisions in Part 9 of the Health Act 2004 and related regulations; by-laws on codes of professional conduct and ethics for a wide range of regulated health professions, which require relevant professionals to prioritise the safeguarding of children or other vulnerable people; the Health Act 2007, which established the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, and regulations made under that Act setting standards in residential centres for older people and for children and adults with disabilities.<\/p><p> The HSE published its national safeguarding policy and procedures in December 2014.  The HSE has established a number of structures to implement this policy, including a national safeguarding office, a national safeguarding committee, safeguarding teams, the appointment of designated officers across disability and older persons' services, and the training of over 30,000 staff.  A detailed review of the operation of the HSE&rsquo;s safeguarding policy to date is at an advanced stage, and is expected to be completed by early 2018.  The findings of the review, when completed, will be of particular value in informing the development of appropriate policy approaches, and in the preparation of safeguarding legislation by the Department of Health.<\/p><p> As members are aware, Senator Colette Kelleher brought forward the Adult Safeguarding Bill 2017 during Private Members' time in the Seanad on 5 April and the Bill has passed Second Stage.  The Bill includes the establishment of an independent national adult safeguarding authority, provision of independent advocates, and mandatory reporting by a wide range of persons of abuse or risk of abuse to vulnerable adults.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, broadly welcomed the intentions behind the proposed legislation during the Seanad debate, but noted that significant work would be required to bring forward appropriate legislation in the area.<\/p><p> The development, subject to Government approval, of a comprehensive health policy on safeguarding adults at risk and associated legislation, informed by the forthcoming HSE review and consultation with stakeholders and the public at large, would be a major step forward.  To that end, the Department of Health is currently researching best practice including international models, together with the HSE.  We are also consulting with colleagues in the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, as we can learn a lot from their experience in the development of policy and legislation on child protection services.  We want to work directly with the national safeguarding committee and HIQA to develop our proposals.  In addition, we are in the process of identifying gaps in current legislation, with a view to commissioning research from the Law Reform Commission to assist in informing the process.<\/p><p> Of necessity, the preparation of detailed legislative proposals will take some time, and it is important that such proposals are built on the foundations of a clear, carefully considered, coherent and actionable policy.  However, we are aiming to submit preliminary proposals to Government outlining our high-level approach in November.  We are also exploring a suitable approach to engage the public and the views and inputs of citizens regarding improvements to the current system.  The Department would also welcome continued engagement with Senator Kelleher in the development of national policy and legislation in this context.  Thank you, Chairman.  We are happy to answer any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017101100002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Frances Spillane","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507708800,"counter":338,"content":"<p>Thank you very much, Ms Spillane.

In June of this year, Senator Colette Kelleher commissioned the Institute of Public Administration, IPA, to prepare a research paper looking at the organisational and governance options in respect of the establishment of the national adult safeguarding authority.  I will confine my comments to the substantive issue of how Cos&aacute;int, which is the working title for the national adult safeguarding authority, could be established.<br\/><br\/>The paper I wrote for Senator Kelleher provides a short background to the approach in Ireland to the need for new public functions or services, and then reviews the most likely options in respect of Cos&aacute;int.  There has been criticism of the proliferation of agencies across Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ,OECD, countries in the past, and many countries have engaged in agency rationalisation.  However, in its review of the Irish public service, the OECD comments that agencies are not good or bad <i>per se<\/i>.  What matters is why they were created and how they are governed.<\/p><p>In recent years the number of Irish agencies has declined.  Where new agencies are created, it is in a more regulated environment which includes the use of performance frameworks between agencies and their parent Department.  International experience indicates that there is no one way which is best in carrying out new public service functions, rather there is a need to review the proposed services in the light of a range of objective criteria.<\/p><p> My report assesses the advantages and disadvantages of four possible arrangements for establishing the new adult safeguarding authority.  Of the four, the incorporation of the authority into the HSE would be problematic.  From a governance perspective, difficulties arise where an organisation is both a provider and the regulator of services.  It is important that Cos&aacute;int be perceived by users of services to be impartial and independent.  <\/p><p> The second option, establishing Cos&aacute;int as an executive office of the Department of Health, has some merit.  Executive offices allow for independent branding of a service, facilitate interdepartmental working and have a degree of independence, for example, in staffing.  It is probable that an executive office could fulfil admirably the education, training and public awareness functions of the proposed authority.  However, the issue of independence would arise again.  The proposed authority will be required to investigate reports of abuse or harm and direct the HSE and others to act.  Questions remain as to how an executive office would be independent if it was not legally separate from the Civil Service and if its chief executive would report to the Secretary General of the Department.<\/p><p> The two remaining options are establishing Cos&aacute;int as a completely new agency or amalgamating its functions with those of an existing agency, the most realistic options being the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, or the Mental Health Commission, both of which operate in the same regulatory space.  Notwithstanding the Government's general policy to rationalise agency numbers, research conducted by the IPA shows that 11 completely new agencies have been established since 2010.  This reflects the fact, as my colleague Dr. Richard Boyle put it, that \"agencies are often established for good reasons\" and \"focusing the debate simply on the number of agencies is unhelpful.\"  It is more pertinent to have objective criteria for agency creation and systematic policy on performance management.  In 2011 the Government agreed to a series of guiding principles for agency rationalisation and reform.  The full list of principles which reflect good practice internationally is included in my report.  However, it is important to highlight that the guidelines acknowledge that a separate body may be required if specialist skills are needed or where independence in the performance of functions requires functional separation from Departments.  <\/p><p> Amalgamation with another agency is also a possibility.  In the case of the Mental Health Commission, it has already been determined that it will have responsibility for the assisted decision-making support service, which might preclude further expansion.  It is possible that Cos&aacute;int could be incorporated into HIQA.  There are parallels between the proposed authority and HIQA in that both have statutory responsibilities for the protection of vulnerable citizens and both have a role in promoting standards and providing information.  The Government's guidelines for agency rationalisation indicate that the merging and restructuring of bodies should have a clear and demonstrable benefit in delivering greater democratic control, providing for improved service delivery and-or financial savings.  In other words, there should be a strategic imperative for a merger, rather than simply a desire to reduce agency numbers.  <\/p><p> My paper sets out the advantages and disadvantages of the most likely institutional and governance options for Cos&aacute;int.  All of the options will require more detailed consideration and assessment before coming to a final decision.  Regardless of the option chosen, there will be a cost and a period of very intensive work for those involved.  Acceptance of the cost is a political decision that will have to be set against the benefits of the proposed authority and its work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017101100002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Joanna O'Riordan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507708800,"counter":341,"content":"<p>I thank Ms O'Riordan.

In a session last week we heard from the National Safeguarding Committee, the Support and Advocacy Service and the HSE.  It is important to capture the reason we are discussing the legislation.  Almost 8,000 cases of suspected adult abuse were reported to the HSE in 2016.<\/p><p>The National Centre for the Protection of Older People at UCD estimates that 32,000 people over the age of 65 were mistreated last year, so it is important to always remember why we are looking at this area.  According to a RED C poll, a third of people think abuse of vulnerable adults is widespread, and I think the numbers reported to the HSE are probably the tip of an iceberg.  There was strong consensus among the witnesses last week on the need not only for adult safeguarding policy, but for legislation, with the gap in the legislative framework universally highlighted.  For example, in his opening statement, Mr. Pat Healy<b><\/b>of the HSE noted that &quot;there is now a strong expectation on legislators, policy makers and service providers to take adequate measures to combat abuse.&quot;.  He pointed out that the current constraints to the HSE, such as the inability to enter nursing homes as being a clear gap, and he went on to say that a statutory framework is needed.  Ms Patricia Rickard-Clarke noted the urgent requirement for adult safeguarding to be placed on a statutory footing.  Mr. Mervyn Taylor, representing the citizens, talked about the need for law, particularly the importance of independence in any safeguarding mechanisms, and emphasised the importance of the independent advocates.<br\/><br\/>We now have a Bill that is progressing through the Seanad.  It was interesting to note that the HSE highlighted the need for an easy-to-understand definition, which I believe we have in the Adult Safeguarding Bill 2017.  Sage highlighted the need for an independent national safeguarding service, which is also in the Bill, and the independent advocates and the national safeguarding committee highlighted the need for mandatory reporting, which is another feature of it.  The national safeguarding committee also stated that the responsibility for the legislation should lie with the Department of Health, but there was a strong interest from other Departments, including the Department of Justice and Equality.<br\/><br\/>I will now ask a few questions of the Department of Health.  Is the Department of the view that there is a need for legal framework?  Would witnesses from the Department concur with those from last week that there are gaps in the legislation?  Moreover, do the witnesses view the Department of Health as being the lead Department on this issue and how do they propose to work with other interested Departments?  Assuming that the witnesses are in agreement with the enactment of such legislation, how do they envisage their responsibilities?  The witnesses mentioned proposals coming to Government in November.  Could they give us an outline of those?<br\/><br\/>I now address the witnesses from the Institute of Public Administration.  The key issue in any mechanism is independence.  From the work that the witnesses have done, how can that be ensured in any mechanisms that are put in place for the citizen?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017101100002#J00300","speaker":"1430","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507708800,"counter":344,"content":"<p>Thank you very much, Senator Kelleher.

Senator Kelleher asked if the Department agrees that there is a need for a legal framework.  Yes, that would be the case.  In my opening statement, I explained that we accept that this is a very complex area, so our preference would be to pursue legislation for the health sector initially, as distinct from legislation for all areas.  We have consulted with other Departments on members' proposals in the Bill, and we can expand on the comments we have got from other Departments.<\/p> <p>  The Senator mentioned proposals being brought to Government.  We have had an initial discussion with the Minister about this, but we will need to talk to him again in more detail.  Expanding on our current thinking, we see the possibility of providing legislation setting out that safeguarding is very much a part of good corporate governance.<\/p><p>In this way we would build on the HSE's adult safeguarding policy, and equally its review of this policy.<\/p><p> We would also build on the experience in the area of children.  We have looked at the Children First Act 2015 because we felt there were aspects of that which were very relevant.  It provides for some very positive measures, including the preparation of guidelines by the Minister and the requirement that providers ensure that children are safe from harm while availing of the service; in other words, a statutory duty to safeguard.  We see a lot of advantages, in terms of changing the culture and raising awareness, to a statutory duty to safeguard vulnerable adults, something that is not there at the moment.  The Children First Act provides for risk assessment by each service provider, and the preparation of child safeguarding statements.  Again, we feel that these are measures that could translate to legislation for safeguarding adults.<\/p><p> There have been discussions on monitoring compliance.  Our view is that if a governance obligation on entities is introduced, HIQA could monitor it as part of the inspection and quality assurance work it does in visiting facilities regularly.  We also consider it important to distinguish between vulnerable adults in residential care, and vulnerable adults in their own homes or living with relatives.  HIQA is already inspecting both public and private nursing homes for older people and disability centres for children and adults.  That is already in place on a statutory basis.<\/p><p> The Government has already committed to introducing a new funding scheme for, and regulation of, both private and statutory home care services.  A public consultation was launched in early July, and we received over 2,600 submissions to that consultation by the deadline of 2 October.  <\/p><p> We also feel that health professionals, including GPs and public health nurses, are a resource in identifying potential abuse of vulnerable adults living in the community.  When I talk about regulation of home care, I am talking about home care services provided by either the HSE or private providers.  This would be undertaken with a view to protecting vulnerable adults in their own home.<\/p><p> The question of reporting arrangements is particularly complex.  In the area of children, mandatory reporting of child abuse was first recommended in the Kilkenny incest case report in 1993.  This was followed by a discussion document on mandatory reporting of child abuse in 1996.  The Children First National Guidelines for the Protection and Welfare of Children were issued in 1999, providing detailed guidance on definitions of abuse and reporting arrangements.  The guidelines effectively provided for administrative mandatory reporting, so that all health professionals, for example, were under an obligation to report any cases of child abuse that they came across in their work.  This extended across the health services, including in respect of people in hospitals and all other areas.  The guidelines were in place for a good 11 years, and were then revised by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in July 2011.  This was followed in April 2012 by the publication by the Minister of the heads of the Children First Bill.  The Children First Bill was published in April 2014 and signed into law in November 2015.  The Act provides for mandatory reporting of child abuse, and is due to come into operation shortly.<\/p><p> I thought it would be helpful to outline that timeline for the committee, to show how long it has taken to move from the Child Care Act 1991 to the situation today, where we are about to introduce mandatory reporting.  From the time of the Kilkenny incest report in 1993, approximately 22 years have passed.  Experience of the development of practice and awareness in child protection services has influenced our thinking on the similar work that needs to be done in the area of adult safeguarding.<\/p><p> It may be seen from the timeline that the development of child protection practice policy and legislative proposals has taken many years, and the question of mandatory reporting is still quite controversial.  Our view, subject to Government approval, is that we should await the experience of mandatory reporting in child care services before introducing any such requirement for reporting in regard to vulnerable adults.  It is important to note there has not been the same focus on elder abuse procedures and practice.  Public education and awareness-raising is also essential.<\/p><p>To come back to the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act, we feel that is very important in terms of awareness-raising.  A director has recently been appointed and funding of &euro;3 million has been provided in the budget for setting up the decision support service and an important part of the role of the decision support service is to promote awareness of the Act.  The Act is all about helping older people to make decisions themselves and provide them with support in making those decisions.  <\/p><p> At last week's meeting of the committee, the chair of the national safeguarding committee, Ms Patricia Rickard-Clarke, noted that the question of mandatory or voluntary reporting needs huge concentration in terms of what is appropriate.  Looking at other jurisdictions' mandatory reporting systems does not necessarily work.  That is an outline of our thinking at the moment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017101100002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Frances Spillane","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507708800,"counter":348,"content":"<p>Thank you very much, Ms Spillane.

The proposed authority will be required to investigative reports of abuse or harm, and direct the HSE and others to act.  It is important that the authority is legally separate from the Civil Service.  It must not just be independent but it must also be perceived by citizens as independent.  To go back to the Government guidelines on agency rationalisation and restructuring, they recognise that a separate body is required where there is a need for this independence in the delivery of functions of a service.  That means that a separate agency or incorporating the safeguarding authority into an existing agency is the most likely option.

Last week we discussed this whole area of forward planning.  We still do not seem to have gotten the message out there about the need for forward planning.  I am coming from a legal background.  What we find helpful are enduring powers of attorney, and having people sign them.  The problem is that on too many occasions we are ending up with complications with people who have nothing done.  We then have to try to sort out the details of how we should manage the person's affairs.  Another problem is who is in charge, and from whom do we get instructions.  Has the Department considered highlighting this need for thinking ahead?  I know the witness talked about &euro;3 million being set aside in one particular area, but there is much forward planning that people can do.  We just do not seem to have gotten that message out there.<\/p> <p>  We are finding that people are living longer now.  I have come across a number of cases recently where dementia or Alzheimer's disease has suddenly set in and there is no forward plan.  In other cases, as a result of meeting people about other issues over the last three to four years, we have been able to get people to sign enduring powers of attorney.  This has been extremely helpful.  Would the Department consider keeping that in mind, that is, trying to highlight how people can avoid difficulties in the future?<\/p> <p>  The other issue I want to raise is the fact 11 agencies have been created since 2010.  The issue of separate agencies is that it can cause its own problems.  I raised this recently in relation to HIQA identifying inadequacies in care for people with intellectual disability.  I am referring in particular to respite care.  We now have a scenario where a lot of respite care facilities that were available are no longer available because HIQA has issues with, or has made decisions in respect of, these facilities but has not identified alternatives.  While we might solve a problem in one area, we now have created a huge problem in another area.  I know of quite a number of families who have children, or rather young adults who are now 18, 19 or 20 years of age, who cannot get access to respite care.<\/p><p>If the Government is to set up a new agency in this area, we need to look at the consequences if decisions are made.  Its role may be quite clear-cut and its attitude may be that it is not its responsibility to identify the solution but only to deal with the problem as it arises.  I am a bit concerned that there may be too many agencies.  What is the witnesses' view on incorporating it into HIQA?  There needs to far more co-operation in regard to withdrawing a particular service, because it does not meet standards, when there is no obligation to identify a solution.  It is something we need to keep in mind.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017101100002#M00500","speaker":"1409","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507708800,"counter":353,"content":"<p>Thank you very much, Senator Burke.

There is a range of issues that one would need to research in more detail before identifying which is the best home for it.  I agree with Senator Colm Burke that if a service's shortcomings are identified or if a service is lacking, it creates problems for people.  However, one cannot keep a service open in that two wrongs do not make a right.

That is a huge volume of work to be placed on an existing agency.  I am sure HIQA is stretched to the limit of its capacity at the moment and to have that volume of work placed upon it would be very difficult.  Perhaps the witnesses might comment on that.  Do the witnesses think that mandatory reporting, if that is the way the legislation goes, will slow its progress?  Mandatory reporting in regard to children presents a huge difficulty in terms of historical reporting.  A GP may get information from patients of child abuse going back many years, and to place a mandatory reporting obligation in that regard would be very difficult.  That may also be the case in regard to reporting adult abuse.

As I said, extensive further research would be required before a decision could be made to give this new proposed service to an existing agency, most likely HIQA.  That would need to be weighed against whether it would be better to establish it as separate authority.  There are examples of services being merged into existing public services within the local government sector and the resources going with them.  The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland merging into the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, would be an example.  There is practice and learning around agencies taking on new services.  However, there is more research required.  The area of mandatory reporting and safeguarding is not my area of expertise.

Ms O'Riordan's paper sets out a really good foundation for further research in that regard.  We have to be mindful of the cost of a new agency versus the cost of amalgamating functions into an existing agency.  There is going to be a high cost one way or another.  Probably what works best and what is most efficient will certainly be part of the thinking on this.  To give an example, Tusla, which would have reasonably similar functions and powers in the child sphere compared to what one would have in the adult sphere, has an annual budget of over &euro;700 million.  That is a very substantial cost.  There are approximately 1,500 social care workers employed by Tusla.  We spoke a lot about HIQA, and indeed the HSE.  Something that was raised with us, as part of our consultations with other Departments, was that maybe Tusla was an organisation worth looking at in terms of expanding its functions, given that it has investigative functions that HIQA, in terms of individual cases, generally does not have.  That is an interesting point worth further consideration.<\/p> <p>  I would like to touch on a point that Senator Colm Burke mentioned on striking a balance between ensuring the safety of services versus the continuation of services.  That is an important point.  We have to be mindful that we have to protect people and ensure they are in a safe environment.  That is paramount.  However, there is much to be said for ensuring close co-operation, whether that is through policies and procedures and memorandums of understanding, or through some legislative provision, to ensure authorities are working together in regard to decisions that are made.  Whether we are looking at a new authority or an existing authority, in terms of expanding and putting out legislative provisions on safeguarding, there would have to be a lead-in time for service providers to get their houses in order, if that is needed.  That may not be the case in all instances of course, but that lead-in time would be important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017101100002#O00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Redmond"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507708800,"counter":362,"content":"<p>In response to Senator Colm Burke's questions, HIQA is the independent regulator so it operates very independently.  It has regulations and standards which its applies, and it applies those standards in an objective manner.  That is the advantage of having an independent regulator in the social care area.  That can have knock-on effects in terms of services and we have seen that in both the nursing home and disability centre areas over the past number of years.  It involves huge change for service providers and for people working in the services as well in terms of getting used to the independent inspection and regulation.<\/p><p>Huge advances have been made in that area in terms of satisfying the public as to the high standards available in centres.  People can look up the Internet very easily to see what kind of report a nursing home has received, and people do that all the time in terms of trying to make decisions.<\/p><p> The second issue mentioned was about enduring power of attorney and the lack of forward planning.  Again, that is something that is dealt with in the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act, so it is more a matter for the Department of Justice and Equality.  However, just for the information of the committee, the Act provides for new arrangements.  As I understand it, enduring power of attorney is covered under a 1996 Act at the moment, so all the enduring powers of attorney under that Act will continue.  However, the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act provides for new arrangements.  The idea is that people should plan ahead, especially as people are  living much longer.  They should make their arrangements for enduring power of attorney which then kicks in at a stage when they lack capacity and when the big decisions are needed.  That is where I hope and I would expect that the decision support service would be very active in trying to publicise all that.  Equally, the national safeguarding committee has been good in terms of raising awareness of these issues but I would agree that planning for the future is an area in which Irish people are not particularly proactive.  Interestingly, in the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act, there is a provision for advanced health care directives, which is the same sort of thinking in terms of future important health care decisions.  Again, we are going to need much education of the public and awareness-raising about that important area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017101100002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Frances Spillane","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507708800,"counter":364,"content":"<p>What about mandatory reporting as opposed to voluntary reporting?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017101100002#P00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507708800,"counter":365,"content":"<p>Sorry, Chairman.

We need to look at alternative arrangements around the mechanisms and I think Ms O'Riordan's paper has given us a good start.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017101100002#Q00400","speaker":"1430"},{"type":"speech","time":1507708800,"counter":372,"content":"<p>Thank you, Senator Kelleher.

I was two and a half hours on the road this morning, it was just one of those day that traffic would not move.  I would like to compliment the witnesses' on their papers.  The number of people who may be vulnerable seems to be growing, depending on their particular location.  Some may live in their own homes, some may live in institutions and some may be dependent on care on an ongoing basis, which may not be available for a variety of reasons.  I know the witnesses attempted to cover that.<\/p><p>What I would be most anxious to know is the extent to which a person who might be vulnerable - a child, an older person, or whoever - can get ready and rapid access to support when and if required.  It is of huge importance, first of all, that the person is believed and is not dismissed and that there is a help service available to them and that they can rely on that.  As we have said previously when discussing this issue, there is a variety of situations, which I do not propose to go into at this<b><\/b>moment, where it is important<b><\/b>to have a rapid response, or a response at the end of a phone line, or that within the institution concerned, there is a dedicated person to go to who can say to the older person, &quot;We acknowledge your situation, and we can do something about it&quot;.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017101100002#Q00600","speaker":"1322","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507708800,"counter":375,"content":"<p>Thank you, Deputy Durkan.

Where there are gaps, people will obviously take advantage; people are in the business of taking advantage.  Anything we do must be constantly subject to review to make sure that there are not people taking advantage of situations.  Again, I compliment Senator Kelleher on her work so far in this area.

I know from the discussion here last week that the HSE has trained up to 30,000 of its staff in safeguarding, something which we welcome.  The suggestion of having a designated person or an officer within an institution, a service provider, a nursing home or whatever it might be is worth exploring, particularly for that sort of rapid access, whether in a nursing home or wherever.  One would know the person to whom one could bring an issue and who can respond to it.

It has been funded by the Atlantic Philanthropies and the HSE, and a lot of the advocates are very highly trained professionals.  In some cases, they are retired people, and they provide a very good advocacy service.  However, I think advocacy is an area that is still in development in Ireland.  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 has a reference to advocacy, and it is proposed that, under the Act, codes of practice will be prepared in regard to advocacy services.  It is an evolving area at the moment, but certainly there are huge advantages to having advocates working in this area, perhaps more so than expecting a parallel process to what has happened in child protection.  Some of the comments that we got from other Departments suggested that approach as well; that of training front-line people who are likely to come across instances of adults at risk, who are vigilant and who have a duty to report, which is the way it went with the guidelines in the child protection area.  We will already have all of the interveners under the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 to help older people, or people without capacity to take decisions, or people who are in danger of losing capacity.  Equally, I think advocates would play a huge role in helping older people to make sure that their concerns are conveyed properly.<\/p><p>It may be the case that somebody is having difficulty communicating, or that he or she does not know where to go to make the complaint.  Yes, I see advocates as a very important component, but it is not an area in which I have a huge background.

That is something we would want to look at.  It depends on what one means by the advocacy service; if it is going to be run by volunteers, then that is very positive in that it does not have a cost.  There are lots of people taking early retirement who would be very interested in becoming advocates, and that has been the experience of Sage.  However, all that has to be thought through in terms of developing policy.  That was one of the points we were trying to make in general; the first step is to develop policy, and then one does legislation, usually.  There is not a clear policy on advocacy services from what I have seen.  I note that the Department of Justice and Equality has a role, as well as the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017101100002#S00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Frances Spillane"},{"type":"speech","time":1507708800,"counter":384,"content":"<p>Thank you very much.
