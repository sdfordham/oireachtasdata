I have no doubt that many colleagues will be aware of people who, in good faith, either bought a house or had a house built by a contractor and who were properly bonded and insured.  People who either purchased or built such a house would have had professionals checking out the bonds to ensure there was proper insurance and so forth but, some years later, would have discovered defects.  However, when they sought redress, in some cases the builders had gone out of business.  There is no form of come back for them.  Companies have gone bust, so to speak.  In some cases, people retained professional expertise who did not do their job in terms of ensuring there were proper bonds, insurance and redress in place if something were to go wrong.  There are such people, and thankfully they are a minority, in every county, including in my county, and we need to do something to help them because they are living in homes that are defective and, in some cases, not habitable.  Some of them have to move out because the home has to be demolished.  They are in turmoil because they do not know how they will fund the retrofitting or, in some cases, the demolition and rebuilding of their homes.<\/p><p>Much has been done to help people, particularly by this Government, but this is a group in our society that deserves some help from the Government.  The economy has turned a corner.  Building has commenced again.  We are in a better position financially than we were previously.  In these minority of cases, something should be done to give some comfort to people who find themselves in such a terrible position.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018042400002#B00500","speaker":"1416","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524576600,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Conway for raising this issue, which I am taking on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy.<\/p> <p>At the outset, I wish to acknowledge the distressing and stressful circumstances the owners and residents of buildings must face where building defects emerge.  However, in general, building defects are matters for resolution between the contracting parties involved, the homeowner, the builder, the developer and-or their respective insurers, structural guarantee or warranty scheme.<\/p> <p>It is important to note that while the Department has overall responsibility for establishing and maintaining an effective regulatory framework for building standards and building control, it has no general statutory role in resolving defects in privately owned buildings, including dwellings, nor does it have a budget for such matters.  In this regard, it is incumbent on the parties responsible for poor workmanship and-or the supply of defective materials to face up to their responsibilities and take appropriate action to provide remedies for the affected homeowners.<\/p> <p>The issue of legal redress for homeowners in respect of property transactions is a complex matter, with potential implications for the entire legal system as well as for the insurance industry.  In this context, in February 2018, the Department wrote to the Law Reform Commission and also corresponded with those involved in the review of the administration of civil justice in Ireland requesting that they consider the issue of effective and accessible legal remedies for homeowners who discover defects in their homes.<\/p> <p>Under the Building Control Acts 1990 to 2014, primary responsibility for compliance of works with the requirements of the building regulations, including Part B on fire safety, rests with the owners, designers and builders of buildings.  Enforcement of the building regulations is a matter for the 31 local building control authorities, which have extensive powers of inspection and enforcement under the Acts and which are independent in the use of their statutory powers.<\/p> <p>In August 2017, the Department published a framework for enhancing fire safety in dwellings where concerns arise.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy John Paul Phelan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2004\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2004&amp;amp;pid=JohnPaulPhelan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=24\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The framework is intended to be used as a guide by the owners and occupants of dwellings where fire safety deficiencies have been identified or are a cause for concern.  The framework will also be of assistance to professional advisers, both in developing strategies to improve fire safety and in developing strategies to enable continued occupation in advance of undertaking necessary works to ensure compliance with the relevant building regulations.  In response to the many building failures that have emerged in the past decade, the Department introduced the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations to the 2014 Act which require greater accountability on the compliance with building regulations in the form of statutory certification of design and construction by registered construction professionals and builders, lodgement of compliance documentation, mandatory inspections during construction and validation and registration of certificates.  A certificate of compliance on completion is jointly signed by the builder and the assigned certifier.  This must be accompanied by plans and documentation to show how the constructed building complies with the building regulations and also the inspection plan as implemented.  Parallel with the 2014 regulations, a project is in place in the Local Government Management Agency to improve the effectiveness of the building control system.  A number of enhancements have been delivered to date and others are in progress.  Ultimately this work will be embedded in a centralised structure for the governance and oversight of building control as a shared service in a lead local authority.  Last year the Government approved the draft heads of a Bill to place the Construction Industry Register Ireland on a statutory footing and the Bill was referred to the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government for pre-legislative scrutiny.  The committee's report was received on 14 December 2017 and the Department is considering its recommendations, with a view to progressing the drafting as soon as possible.  Once it is enacted, the Bill will provide consumers who engage a registered builder with the assurance that they are dealing with a competent and compliant operator and will complement the reforms which have been made through the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations and contribute to the development of an enhanced culture of competence and compliance in the construction sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018042400002#C00200","speaker":"1265","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524576600,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, for a comprehensive reply.

That is good and it is reassuring for people who, in good faith, hire a contractor to build a home.  Of course the problem now is that contractors, who are prepared to build one off houses, are few and far between because a lot of our builders unfortunately emigrated and have made lives for themselves abroad.

There has been an inventory of architectural heritage carried out in many local authority areas.  There is merit in having it.  Outside of Dublin and Cork, D&uacute;n Laoghaire would have one of the largest percentages of protected structures, and rightly so, because they are unique and are worth protecting.  We have to make progress, at the same time, and we have to develop and move forward.<\/p> <p>We can cherish the past and mind our architectural past while also being progressive enough to look for imaginative synergies and solutions to develop our towns and villages.

I certainly knew him and I am aware of the good work that he did to protect our conservation areas and to protect the beautiful county we all share with Senator Horkan.<\/p> <p>Under the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, planning authorities are required to maintain a record of protected structures.  The Act specifies that this should include structures of special architectural, historical, archaeological, artistic, cultural, scientific, social or technical interest within its functional area.<\/p> <p>The compilation of a National Inventory of Architectural Heritage, an inventory of structures of such interest, is a project being undertaken by the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  Deputy Madigan, as Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, uses the data from the inventory to recommend to each planning authority structures for inclusion on its record of protected structures.  A total of 45,388 such recommendations have issued to date.<\/p> <p>A planning authority must have regard to any recommendations made to it, but ultimately the addition or deletion of a structure to or from the record of protected structures is a reserved function of the elected members of each local authority.<\/p> <p>The initial survey for the country has been substantially completed except for Dublin city and D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown.  These two local planning authority areas were consciously left to last as they have a significant record of protected structures, unlike many other counties.

Arising from these surveys, 383 recommendations have been made by the Minister to D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, most recently in August of last year.  Two further contracts for field recordings in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown are planned for 2018.  The first is to be advertised in May.  Arising from these, further recommendations to D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown will be made by the Minister, Deputy Madigan.  As an initial field identification for the area has yet to be completed, and based on current survey numbers with reference to previous surveys of this scale, it will be years before the Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown inventory is substantially completed.<br\/><br\/>The data from the D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown surveys will be added to the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage website, <i>www.buildingsofireland.ie<\/i>, in the near future.  The website receives approximately 1.5 million page views a year.  Although its original audience was seen as owners, building professionals and local authority staff, the experience, from user feedback and questions, is that the website attracts a much wider international audience, often people working on their family history or planning an Irish visit.

In the vast majority of cases, no reviews took place to ascertain changes in circumstances and elderly persons had no awareness they were claiming something they were not entitled to.  For instance, a person may have had a life insurance policy, a slight increase in an English pension or some other change which, under the strict legislation regarding pensions, would have reduced the weekly payment the person received.  I completely understand that to knowingly claim something one is not entitled to is fraud and is not acceptable.  The figures that were released earlier this year show that the vast majority of social welfare overpayments occur as a result of mistakes rather than as a result of fraud, which represents only a tiny percentage.  We are dealing with people who are elderly and often ill and who have difficulty understanding written communications on changing rules and regulations.  We have to have compassion and some room for error in such cases.  I have seen bereaved families distraught when their deceased loved ones were criminalised because they had not understood the instructions.  One can say they are not criminalised until they come to court but they are deceased people who were straight and honest all their lives but when they passed over their families were told they had done something very wrong.  It is really upsetting for people who are already grieving.  It is not right.  We have to ask if we can reasonably expect a frail elderly person enduring all the health challenges that come with ageing to be aware that a failure or error has occurred.  Will the Minister of State ask for compassion and understanding to usurp the need to recover overpayments?<\/p><p>I am also concerned about the fear many elderly people experience when claiming State payments.  There has been a huge drive to put people off payments and to recoup everything that can be recouped for the State.  Does the Minister of State have any figure for the underpayment of moneys that people are entitled to?  Many people are so fearful that they do not claim things they are entitled to.  Elderly people, who have contributed much to society, should not have to live in fear of payments being taken from them.  These people are made to feel really vulnerable and violated while strangers go through their bank or credit union accounts.  They are bombarded with demands for the most private and intimate details.  I talk to these people all the time.  They are asked for months and months of bank statements and asked if they are sure they do not have other bank or credit union accounts.  We have to achieve a better balance in how we treat these people.  We do not want people claiming things they are not entitled to but we do not want people frozen in a situation where they do not claim things they are entitled to.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018042400002#F01200","speaker":"1378","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524576600,"counter":40,"content":"<p>On behalf of the Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty, I apologise for her absence.

Having travelled around the country, though, there are a couple of thousand more people who are not claiming it.  We must focus on improving that situation.<\/p><p>The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection processes in excess of 2 million applications for supports each year and makes payments to some 1.4 million people every week.  There are many people in the system.  The majority of those who are supported by the Department are exercising their legitimate rights and receiving their appropriate entitlements.<\/p><p>Control of abuse of the social welfare system is one of the Department's three high-level functions.  Activity in this area is guided by the 2014-18 compliance and anti-fraud strategy.  The Department publishes an annual report on how it is achieving its targets and the priority areas for action for the following year.<\/p><p>Overpayments generally arise as a result of a revision in the amount that a customer is entitled to receive.  Where fraud has been suspected and a customer is no longer entitled to a payment because he or she returned to work, recovered from an illness or other changes in his or her circumstances, overpayments are most likely to arise.<\/p><p>There are three circumstances in which overpayments can arise after a customer of the Department dies.  First, minor overpayments can arise in the days immediately after the death and where notification has not been made to the Department or the death has not been registered.  Second and more rarely, overpayments can arise where a family member, agent or other person continues to encash the pension or other social welfare payment due to the deceased.  Third, an overpayment of social welfare can be determined during the winding up of the deceased's estate.  This can happen when the schedule of the deceased's assets is received in the Department and it is assessed that he or she had been receiving means-tested payments beyond his or her entitlement.  This is often the case where the deceased person did not disclose or fully disclose money held in financial institutions, had investments or did not disclose an interest in property or land.<\/p><p>In 2017, there was &euro;14.4 million in overpayments in respect of 517 deceased customers.  Of this amount, some &euro;14.3 million was assessed in respect of 408 customers who had undisclosed or underdisclosed assets at the time of their deaths.  The average value of these cases was approximately &euro;35,000.  The balance of &euro;100,000 in overpayments related to cases where a payment was made after death, with an average value of less than &euro;800 per case.  At the end of March 2018, just over &euro;1.6 million was outstanding in respect of all overpayments assessed during 2017.<\/p><p>In addition to its estates unit, the Department has a central debt management service that can provide specialist advice to any person who needs assistance.

I know it is an issue close to his heart, pardon the pun.  In light of international studies that have found that smokers who use e-cigarettes tend to smoke less and have increased attempts to quit, what research is being conducted here to test the effectiveness of e-cigarettes in helping Irish smokers quit the habit?<\/p> <p>The Minister of State knows that the Healthy Ireland framework is aiming for a tobacco-free Ireland by 2025.  That means achieving a smoking rate of less than 5%.  The current smoking rate in Ireland is 22%.  The HSE welcomes any aid to quitting smoking but due to the lack of conclusive evidence of the long-term effects, it has not recommended e-cigarettes as an aid.  I am not an expert in this area.  However, besides the fact that I think they look a bit ridiculous, they do seem to be effective.  We should have some policy on them.  <\/p> <p>E-cigarettes in the UK have been endorsed as a quitting tool.  There has been a drop in smoking rates there of 4.8% since 2012.  Public Health England has stated that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than traditional smoking.  That is obviously significant.  In the UK, one person switches to e-cigarettes every three minutes.  The UK now has the second lowest smoking rate in Europe.  Public Health England stated that the use of e-cigarettes is associated with increased quitting success rates and has hastened the decline in smoking. <\/p> <p>In Ireland in 2017, the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, reported that e-cigarettes are twice as popular and twice as effective at helping people to quit compared with patches, gum and other devices.  Of the people who quit smoking last year, 37% used e-cigarettes according to Healthy Ireland.  Smoking rates in Ireland have been slow to decrease.  It was 23% in 2015 and 2016, and 22% in 2017.  I appreciate that wanting to quit smoking is a personal issue for people.  However, if we, as a Government, are seeking to attain a tobacco free Ireland, it appears that our nearest neighbour is having a lot of success in this area, notwithstanding the research that needs to be carried out.  I would be interested in us at least having a policy on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018042400002#J00600","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speech","time":1524576600,"counter":50,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Noone for raising this very important issue.  I will be responding on behalf of the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris.  The Senator will be aware that smoking is the greatest single cause of preventable illness and premature death in Ireland.  It kills almost 6,000 people a year.  Our primary objectives, set out in the 2013 policy document Tobacco Free Ireland are to denormalise smoking and to protect children from the dangers of tobacco consumption.  That policy sets a target for Ireland to be tobacco free - that is having a smoking prevalence rate of less than 5% - by 2025.  The Government and I remain committed to making Ireland tobacco free.<\/p> <p>Tobacco Free Ireland contains a number of recommendations to assist smokers in quitting tobacco use.  One of those recommendations is to examine the evidence regarding outcomes of the use of nicotine replacement therapy and other approaches.  The Department requested that HIQA undertake a health technology assessment of the clinical and cost effectiveness of the pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical smoking cessation products and services.  That assessment was published in 2017.  It found that all pharmacological interventions were effective compared with no treatment.  A prescription-only drug called varenicline was the most effective drug on its own.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Finian McGrath:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1822\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1822&amp;amp;pid=FinianMcGrath&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=24\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Using a combination of varenicline and nicotine replacement therapy was the most effective pharmacological intervention and people using this combination were over 3.5 times more likely to quit than those who were in a control group and did not receive this treatment.<\/p><p>Group behavioural therapy, individual counselling, intensive advice and telephone support were all found to be effective behavioural interventions, with group therapy found to be the most effective of these interventions.  The addition of behavioural intervention to a pharmacological intervention improved the effectiveness of the intervention.  The HIQA assessment recommended that smoking cessation services should seek to increase the uptake of varenicline, either alone or in combination with nicotine replacement therapy for smokers who want to use pharmacological support.<\/p><p>Although the health technology assessment found that results for e-cigarettes are promising, there is currently a lack of evidence to recommend their use as a smoking cessation aid, and currently no e-cigarette product is licensed as a medical product in Ireland.  The safety of e-cigarettes is an evolving area of research.  It is potentially safer than smoking but evidence on long-term safety has yet to be established.  In the absence of additional evidence confirming the effectiveness of e-cigarettes, the HIQA assessment recommended that the HSE smoking cessation services should seek to increase the uptake of the combination nicotine replacement therapy treatment among those for whom varenicline is not tolerated or preferred.<\/p><p>The results of the HIQA health technology assessment will inform the development of the national clinical guidelines on smoking cessation interventions currently being undertaken by the Health Service Executive in conjunction with the national clinical effectiveness committee.  It has also informed policy decisions on potential improvements to the provision of smoking cessation services in the public health service.  The Department will continue to monitor the emerging research on all such products so as to inform decisions around any future additional regulation in the area.

This can all obviously be very good.  Even on the way here I met one of my colleagues with an e-cigarette in her hand and I stopped to chat to her about it.  She said she previously had pleurisy but has not had a cold or any kind of a cough for four or five years when she used to have them very regularly.

Obviously, the MetroLink project is a very important part of Dublin's proposed strategic infrastructure.  I wish to highlight the effect it will have on a 50-year old urban Gaeltacht near Griffith Park in the north of Dublin city.  I ask the Minister to be cognisant of the impact it will have on this Gaeltacht.  Scoil Mobh&iacute;, a Gaelscoil on Mobhi Road, was informed on 22 March that Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, was proposing to install a tunnel boring machine launch site, works and a depot at the Griffith Park underground station on the Na Fianna pitches.  The school shares the campus with Na Fianna, Scoil Chaitr&iacute;ona and the T&iacute;r na n&Oacute;g preschool.  All of their buildings are within 5 m and 15 m of the site of the proposed tunnel.  There is a very special relationship between the four institutions on the campus or hub, each of which is focused on the preservation of the Irish language and culture.  The TII plan has the potential to have a negative impact not just on Na Fianna GAA Club and its pitches but also on the daily lives of the community on a campus on which the Irish language, culture and sporting traditions are central.  Many children spend between 14 and 16 years moving from one institution to the next on the campus.  When Project Ireland 2040 was announced last week, plans for the creation of a Dublin city language and cultural hub were included.  It seems that it is important for this cultural hub which has been established and developed on the site for the past 50 years to be nurtured and taken into consideration as MetroLink is progressed.<\/p> <p>Roinneann Scoil Mobh&iacute; an campas c&eacute;anna le Na Fianna, Scoil Chaitr&iacute;ona agus r&eacute;amhscoil T&iacute;r na n&Oacute;g.

I thank my colleague, Senator Niall &Oacute; Donghaile, and Mr. Jim Gibney for organising it.  I also thank the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Coveney, for agreeing to meet them this afternoon.  I hope the meeting will be productive.  Their main request and that of Sinn F&eacute;in is that the Government appeal the judgment of the European Court of Justice, ECJ, on this case.  At the briefing we heard from Francie McGuigan and Liam Shannon in particular, two of the 14 men singled out for special treatment and torture during internment in 1971.  Those not familiar with the events should look up what happened in the nine days for which these men were taken away and deemed missing, the techniques that were used and the sheer and utter brutality of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, RUC, with the backup of the British Army, in a purpose-built torture centre in Ballykelly.  The ruling of the European Court of Human Rights in 1978 did not take into account all the relevant details.  These men want to know who was responsible for what happened to them and why it was done.  The main issue is the need for the Government to appeal the judgment of the ECJ.

It states:<\/p><blockquote>I regret [...] to have to rule that your motion in relation to the removal of Standing Order 41 is out of order on the basis that Standing Order 98 tasks the Committee on Procedure and Privileges with recommending &quot;any additions or amendments to Standing Orders that may be deemed necessary&quot;.  As you know, the Committee has already been asked by you to consider a proposal in respect of Standing Order 41.<\/blockquote> <p>This is the most farcical ruling I have ever come across in a long career in Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  It is utterly inane.  The very reason I sent the request to the CPP is because it is the committee that has the function of doing this.  For what other reason would one send the request?  It is linguistically, grammatically and legally utter nonsense to make such a ruling.  I have consulted very widely legally on this.  A senior counsel, a former Attorney General of this State, and the legal officer of the Labour Party have all agreed that this is utter, classic nonsense.  It is wrong.  It is an incorrect ruling.<\/p><p>I have already said that the 1922 committee, under the 1922 Constitution, had no such restriction on the powers of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  I have been advised that a simple motion in my name and in the names of other Senators to delete this Standing Order would be legally appropriate and that Seanad &Eacute;ireann could do it, regardless of the CPP.  In deference to the CPP, however, and in deference to Leas-Chathaoirleach and the Cathaoirleach, I put in a request.  If one is not able to request something then there is no point in continuing.<\/p><p>Professor Gary Murphy of DCU has recently called for the abolition of the Seanad again, precisely because there has been no reform of any kind whatever; not a single stitch.

I have raised the issue of funding of primary school education several times.  A report issued yesterday shows that parents in this country are contributing &euro;46 million per annum to the funding of primary education.  I am sure that comes as no surprise to the parents of this country or to primary school principals or teachers.  This needs to be addressed.  Capitation grants go some way towards the cost of running our schools, but unfortunately the current capitation grant does not go halfway to accounting for the costs that it normally would meet, such as insurance, lighting, heating and other basic items.  It is regrettable that school principals and teachers are preoccupied with fundraising measures rather than concentrating on the job they are qualified to do, teaching our children.  By extension, it is unfair to the children and to their parents.  The children lose valuable teaching time because the teachers are preoccupied with making sure the school continues to run.  The Minister for Education and Skills needs to come to the House to advise us on what moves he has in place to address this issue.  School principals have said that it is critical to the future running of the schools.  I compliment the parents of the country on all their hard work in fundraising activities, be it cake sales, 5 km walks or runs.  I earnestly request that the Leader bring this information to the Minister so that he would consider restoring the capitation grant to a level that will ensure the schools can run and that parents and teachers do not have to worry about raising funds to make sure they stay open.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018042400002#R00600","speaker":"1396"},{"type":"speech","time":1524576600,"counter":73,"content":"<p>I join my colleagues who expressed their sympathy with the people of Toronto.

I have not got anywhere with that so far, therefore, I am renewing the call.<\/p> <p>I have some statistics that may be of interest.  Recruitment is not working.  There has been a fall-off in applicants for the Defence Forces from 2013 to 2016 with 55% less now applying.  Media coverage of the state of income and conditions in the Defence Forces has led to a serious fall-off in recruitment.  A total of 2,831 left between 2013 and 2017, representing a total of 29.8% of the entire Defence Forces.  Some 76% of those retiring were premature voluntary retirements and of that group 34% had fewer than five years service.<\/p> <p>When military capacity is reduced or cannot be produced it can take months or even years to replace those who have been lost to the service.

Of those who joined, 712 left, 576 left while in training and 31 cadets left while in training.  That is an unbelievable number - people who had a clear career objective were forced to leave.  Seven officers left with fewer than five years service.<\/p> <p>The cost of training a recruit is &euro;25,000 plus and the cost of training a cadet is &euro;64,000 plus.  The cost of the 503 who left in 2016 was &euro;15.13 million to the Exchequer.  Following the Lansdowne Road agreement, that rose to more than &euro;20 million of a loss to the Exchequer of soldiers having left within five years of their service.

Obesity has been linked to 13 types of cancer so far and polls have shown that many people are unaware of the link.  I believe if the same study were done here, the findings would be the same.

I was present outside the Project Arts Centre when the mural painted by Maser, an internationally recognised artist, was painted over by Cian O'Brien, the artistic director of the Project Arts Centre in what he described as an act of defiant compliance with an instruction from the Charities Regulator in regard to the mural, which was a repeal the eighth mural.  It is a mural that represented a picture that has become iconic.  The Project Arts Centre had been told by the Charities Regulator it had to take it down and that it was in breach of the rules under the Charities Act 2009.  We need to look again at how we legislate under the Charities Act 2009 and the broader issue around SIPO and its interpretation of the same sort of phrasing of political purpose.  We have seen a lot of concern expressed by the Irish Council for Civil Liberties and other NGOs about how this idea of political purpose has been interpreted in such a way as to curtail and restrict legitimate human rights activities of different organisations.  It is a different issue from the Charities Act 2009, but the two are related.  It would be worthwhile having a debate in this Chamber as to how best we could reform the legislation, both the Charities Act 2009 and the SIPO legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018042400002#U00500","speaker":"1402","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524576600,"counter":89,"content":"<p>Today is the opening day of the Punchestown national hunt festival, which I suppose is Ireland's Cheltenham, and we wish it good weather.  It seems to me to be an opportune time to ask for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, to come into the House to give us an overview of the Irish racing situation as he sees it.  I would like to hear his views on the recent development whereby the television coverage of Irish racing has been signed over to an organisation called Racing UK, RUK, which will have exclusive rights to show Irish racing for the next five years from January 2019 onwards.  This has been welcomed by Horse Racing Ireland and by the racecourse owners' association because they will be financial beneficiaries of this deal.  That is important because they need that support, but it is very worrying to note the number of people who are very prominent in the horse racing business in Ireland who are expressing more concerns about this proposed monopoly situation.<\/p> <p>At the moment a stay at home punter can watch racing live on television on two channels, namely, \"At the Races\" and RUK.  \"At the Races\" is relatively cheap and can be bought as part of a normal Sky package.

I am no great fan of Mr. Michael O'Leary but he is a fairly good businessman, and he states it has all the appearance of a stitch-up and a monopoly.  He is very concerned, as indeed are horse owners and horse trainers such as Mr. Willie Mullins and Mr. Robbie McNamara, who have spoken out.  The man who will be hit by this is the ordinary fellow, the stay-at-home punter who has his little couple of bob each way every day, and fellows such as myself who like to have an occasional punt and are prepared to pay for a service but will not pay through the nose for it.

We have great plans for development and growth in this country, including infrastructure and roads, and private individuals have plans, whether it is to build a house or their businesses.  We all would agree that they need to operate with efficacy, to see that time is of the essence and that time means money, and that we need projects deliberated upon as soon as possible.<\/p> <p>I turn to the application currently before An Bord Plean&aacute;la which is for the replacement of Cloongullane bridge near Swinford, County Mayo.  An oral hearing was heard in March 2017.  Environmental issues were raised by the National Parks and Wildlife Service and were dealt with by the summer of last year.  After that, we waited and waited for a decision from An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The regional design office responsible for preparing the application on behalf of Mayo County Council was in touch regularly with An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I contacted it and there was no hint that there were any further issues.  In fact, if there were, one would have imagined they would have been raised.  In the first few days of January this year, An Bord Plean&aacute;la sought further environmental information, which required further studies relating to alluvial woodland.  Most recently, I am told, there may also be an issue with freshwater pearl mussel.<\/p> <p>Parking the environmental concerns aside, is this any way for An Bord Plean&aacute;la to do its business?  Surely, it has some responsibility towards the State and towards the common good that it deals with cases, especially a critical piece of infrastructure such as the N26, a national primary road which is the most substandard section of national primary road in the country and which anyone who would travel it would not even think deserving of that categorisation.  Nonetheless, An Bord Plean&aacute;la has failed to deal with this case.  It is my understanding An Bord Plean&aacute;la is not understaffed at this juncture and it begs the question why it cannot see the urgent need to have this deliberated upon as soon as possible.  If there are queries, let them be known to the applicant and let them be dealt with.  This is no way to do business.  I note we will have the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, coming before us tomorrow - at least, I hope it will be him.  If not, I will be talking to him further about this.

On a couple of occasions, I asked that the Leader ask the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to come before us to speak about various aspects of transport - Brexit being one.  Now I am making a point about traffic congestion.  It is a huge problem, particularly in my own city, Galway, but it is much wider than that.  It is in Cork, Dublin and practically all over the country.  Ask those in the Public Gallery, any of us, or anyone and they will say they could be travelling at least an hour to work and an hour home every day.  That is a full day's work a week in which they are caught up in traffic.  I am a member of the Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport which invited in the managers of both Galway County Council and Galway City Council to speak and deliberate on the traffic problem, especially in Galway but which is a nationwide issue.<\/p> <p>We have a fairly simple straightforward suggestion.  The World Economic Forum recommended this a week ago but our committee recommended it two months ago.  We should engage with a professional organisation, such as Waze, which has partnerships with approximately 60 cities throughout the world but is not in Ireland.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator P&aacute;draig &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2482\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2482&amp;amp;pid=PadraigOCeidigh&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=24\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It will help with the technology and create feedback from the public on where traffic jams are and what is causing them.  It is a simple solution with no cost to the Exchequer or taxpayer.

I ask, through our Leader, that the Minister would consider setting up an expert team to look at traffic issues in Ireland that can move from one traffic congestion problem area to another.  When one has an expert team of probably six or seven people, one can create a model or strategy for continuous improvement.  Right now, it is somewhat <i>comme ci, comme &ccedil;a<\/i>.  If one is lucky, one can get into work in half an hour or three quarters of an hour and if one is unlucky, like the vast majority of people, it takes an hour or more every day to come to work and go home again afterwards.  This is a huge economic problem.  It costs a fortune.  It is a huge issue for employers and employees, many of whom have people looking after their children when they go to work.

I welcome the report for two reasons.  It states that both the RT&Eacute; National Symphony Orchestra and RT&Eacute; Concert Orchestra should be retained.  I know from speaking to musicians, there were concerns that lower numbers in both orchestras would result in one merged orchestra.  The second issue is that the current funding situation cannot continue.  Although the Minister, Deputy Denis Naughten, might be happy to see it removed from being RT&Eacute;'s responsibility, the funding will still have to be found.  The funding issues involved in RT&Eacute;, particularly with the two orchestras, have been evident for some time.  Voluntary redundancies have decimated both orchestras' numbers.  It is, therefore, heartening to see the review recommend that funding be restored to its historic levels.  Low staffing and funding have meant that the orchestras have not been able to undertake crucial roles in recent years, as mentioned by Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell, such as travel and community outreach across the island.  The report has also made it clear that the current funding situation cannot continue.  Both Ministers should move to ring-fence that funding to allow the orchestras to return to their previous capabilities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018042400002#X00300","speaker":"1372"},{"type":"speech","time":1524576600,"counter":96,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018042400002#X00400","speaker":"1427"},{"type":"speech","time":1524576600,"counter":97,"content":"<p>The RT&Eacute; National Symphony Orchestra should remain as part of RT&Eacute;.

The safety of the existing N20 leaves a lot to be desired.  The commuting time between Cork and Limerick is between an hour and a half and two hours but we need to bring it down to 45 minutes.  It is about balanced regional development.  I spoke last week about having a debate on aviation policy.  We are a small country.  We must have interconnection.  It is not just about the regions but about Ireland Inc.  The Limerick to Cork motorway is a vital piece of that infrastructure.  <\/p><p>I will put it in context.  We want the Ryder Cup to come to Adare Manor in 2026.  We should be aiming to have the M20 built by that date.  It is an ambitious target but is nevertheless achievable.  If we do not set targets we will never get to build projects slightly ahead of time.  It is very achievable.  Would it not be great if our friends in Cork, Limerick and Galway could come to Adare via the M20 and see what our region has to offer?  When people look at Ireland from abroad and are looking at whether the Ryder Cup should be here or in the UK, they would say the infrastructure is in place and that Adare Manor is a golf course of world renown.  Padraig Haddington said it is the finest golf course in Europe.  The M20 is a vital key ingredient in that.  <\/p><p>I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach for allowing me to raise the issue.  It is a positive news story.  It feeds into the story of us being a small island and that of interconnection.  When people are looking at Ireland, I want them to look at Ireland as a whole.  I worry about us being completely regionalised because it means we do not get the synergies we should get.  It would be fine if we were an enormous country but we are not.  One can drive from one side of the 32 counties to another in a day.  There are very few countries where one can do that.  We need to think globally.  A key element, if one is looking in from the outside, is the two largest cities outside Dublin are not linked by motorway.  One has to ask why.

In recent years, following a popular music festival, a local Carlow charity filmed a mind-boggling amount of rubbish, including really good quality camping equipment left behind.  The video went viral because there was so much rubbish one could hardly see the grass.  Someone has to pick it up.  <\/p> <p>This month I was blown away by the number of people who took part in the annual Carlow spring clean.  The nationwide activity was made all the better because of the sunshine and warm temperatures.  The bright sun shone like a light on a really sinister aspect of our attitude to the environment.  There is a perception that someone else will pick up after us.  While I was out on a local annual spring clean I heard an eight year old girl call out, as she was picking up rubbish, \"Do they think that ditches are wardrobes?\"  Why do people feel they can litter, dump or pollute?  Why do we just lie down and accept this behaviour?  There are caravans, camper vans and broken down cars on green areas across the country.  Drink bottles and clothing are often seen from tourist buses.  \"Wild\", \"hidden\" and \"ancient\" are great buzzwords in our fabulous tourism sector.

Senator Ardagh is right to highlight the matter.  The national development plan has included the MetroLink north and south projects.  As Members will be aware, legitimate concerns are being raised by Senator Ardagh but also by residents and stakeholders affected by the route of the proposed development of the MetroLink.  Notwithstanding the benefits it will bring, it is important to listen and understand how we can deliver the MetroLink project while maintaining routes that do not affect the people spoken of this morning.<\/p> <p>The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, along with the National Transport Authority, NTA, are engaging in a public consultation process on the matter and it is due to conclude some time in May.  I hope that as part of that consultative process, there will be real engagement with those affected.  I have asked the Minister to come to the House to discuss transport matters because we have had a number of requests in the past number of weeks.<\/p> <p>Senator Boyhan raised tonight's \"Prime Time\" programme but I do not want to pre-empt the issues coming up in the programme.  However, it is important to recognise the serious issues being raised around foster care.  I refer, in particular, to the issues of sexual abuse and breach of trust.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=24\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->None of us can condone or support any such behaviour.  I hope that, with the airing of the segment on \"RT&Eacute; Investigates\", we will continue to see rigorous assessment and checks and balances in the area of foster care.  As a former Chairman of the committee dealing with health and children affairs, I know that such incidents are rare.  In saying that, where there are people opening their homes and offering children in need a place to receive love and care, it is important that foster carers be above reproach.  I will watch the programme tonight and, if necessary, we will have the appropriate Minister come to the House to discuss the issue.  The case in question was referred to the National Review Panel, which is an independent body, and there will be outcomes.  We will await the discussion on the programme tonight.<\/p><p>Senator Victor Boyhan complimented and congratulated Ms Justine McCarthy on receiving in Ballybunion at the weekend the Mary Cummins Award for Women for Outstanding Achievement in Media.  I join the Senator in congratulating Ms McCarthy as we all recognise that she is a very fair and thorough investigative reporter.  We congratulate her on being the recipient of this prestigious award.  I also join the Senator in saying, as I have before on the Order of Business, that we need an independent media to hold the Executive to account and which are also fair and balanced in their approach to reporting.<\/p><p>Senator Rose Conway-Walsh raised the matter of the hooded men.  Like the Senator, I hope this afternoon's meeting with the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Simon Coveney, will bring further progress to the case being presented by the men in question.  Looking at the ruling of the European Court of Human Rights, the decision was six:one, which does not add up in some of our minds.  In his interjection Senator David Norris made reference to the fact that it was torture.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018042400002#AA00400","speaker":"1391","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524576600,"counter":116,"content":"<p>It was.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018042400002#BB00200","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"speech","time":1524576600,"counter":117,"content":"<p>From reading the report and the testimony of the men, one cannot but infer that it was.

I wish them well in the final.  I also pay tribute to Munster and express pride in the manner of their comeback in the second half of the match.  I share the Senator's dismay and disappointment at the prohibitive cost of flights being offered to supporters of Leinster who wish to travel to the final.  It is not good enough to see fares up to &euro;800 being charged.  I will be happy to have the appropriate Minister come to the House to speak about the issue.  The Senator is a former Chairman of the committee dealing with transport and sporting matters and has been very strong in his defence of supporters of all sports who travel to and from events.  It is not acceptable and disappointing to see fans being ripped of in this manner.  It is a captive audience, given the nature of the event.<\/p> <p>Senator Robbie Gallagher raised the matter of education and referred to the report from the Catholic Primary School Management Association.  I remind the Senator that the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Richard Bruton, has increased the budget by &euro;1 billion in the past two years and that &euro;10 billion is being invested in education.  It is the highest ever budget spend in the sector.  In the past two years we have seen 5,000 special needs assistant posts created and there will be an extra 2,000 this year.  There will be 1,280 extra teachers.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=24\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The Government is fully committed to investment in education, with 110 schools in disadvantaged areas benefitting and 20,000 students being supported further.  It is also important to recognise, which Senator Gallagher did not mention, that while there have been cuts to capitation, the cuts were first announced by the then T&aacute;naiste, former Deputy Mary Coughlan, and the capitation levels are now above the 2008 levels.  The Minister, Deputy Bruton, is committed to the restoration of the capital funding and to putting in place the operation of the parent and student charter.  He is also asking schools to explain how they spend their allocation of funding.  The Minister will come to the House.  The programme for Government allows for an increase in capitation so we can have that debate when the Minister comes to the House in the next few weeks to discuss education.<\/p><p>Senator Craughwell raised the issue of the Defence Forces.  We have given that matter a good airing in the past number of weeks.  The Minister of State will be in the House next week, and I thank Senator Craughwell for not calling for a vote on the Order of Business.  To be fair, he approached me about it prior to the Order of Business.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, will come to the House next week for the debate on the Defence Forces.<\/p><p>Senator Butler referred to obesity and diabetes in the context of a UK report on cancer.  We have seen the introduction of a voluntary code in Ireland regarding the advertising and marketing of junk food to young people.  It is important to have a debate on obesity and on how we can use the umbrella Healthy Ireland project to promote and have a better attitude to exercise, diet and lifestyle.<\/p><p>Senators Marie-Louise O'Donnell, Bacik, McFadden and Warfield raised the report published yesterday regarding the RT&Eacute; orchestras.  The comments of all Members of the House on the report and the orchestras are absolutely correct.  Our cultural institutions must be enhanced.  Members who sit in the waiting room in RT&Eacute; on a Tuesday night as they wait to go on \"The Late Debate\" programme can hear the orchestra practising and can appreciate the level of endeavour and the quality and talent of the musicians involved.  As Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell said, it is the culture of expression, the precision of the heartbeat and what gives us oxygen.  If people attend the pre-Christmas \"Sunday Miscellany\" concert in the National Concert Hall they will see in huge graphic detail the power of the orchestra and the importance of these cultural institutions.<\/p><p>The Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Madigan, said in the D&aacute;il today that she and the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Naughten, will examine the report and return with recommendations.  This is of extreme importance.  We might disagree as to whether it should be under the remit of RT&Eacute; or elsewhere but we all agree that both orchestras must be protected and supported.  I agree with the remarks of the Senators this afternoon on the matter.  While it is about culture it is also about what we stand for as a people and how we view ourselves.  If we cannot stand united on this, we count for little in terms of our culture.  The Senator is correct that it is the beating heart.  I will be happy to schedule a debate when the Minister is ready to make recommendations or even prior to her making her decision.<\/p><p>I do not have the answers to Senator Devine's questions regarding the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, and the UN rapporteur.  I am not aware of the issues in terms of what the Senator referred to as not happening.  The Minister, Deputy Zappone, is very committed to the mother and baby homes issue.<\/p><p>With regard to the digital commissioner, that matter is before the Government.  The Minister was in the House before Christmas to discuss the issue and I will be happy to invite the Minister back to the House to discuss it.  The Senator is correct that online digital harassment is becoming far too prevalent and causing far too much distress to people.  It is having a detrimental effect on their mental health.  We must work collectively to ensure it can be stamped out, and I will be happy to work with the Senator on that.  I do not have the information to hand but I will endeavour to get it for the Senator or, if she prefers, she could submit a Commencement matter.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=24\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Senator McFadden raised the issue of Irish Water, planning and the Parteen Basin to Dublin proposal.  She referred to the importance of investment in our water infrastructure, which is something we certainly should support.  In the context of a post fee era, the issue of Irish Water is really relevant.  <br\/><br\/>I agree completely with Senator Bacik regarding the mural at the Project Arts Centre that was taken down.  The relationship between the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO, politics and the Charities Regulator under the Charities Act must be addressed.  We can become over zealous and too politically correct.  That is certainly a debate that should happen.  Perhaps the Taoiseach is correct that the mural in favour of repeal of the eighth amendment gained far more notoriety than it would have had if there had been no kerfuffle about it.  I commend the artist involved.<br\/><br\/>Senator Ned O'Sullivan raised the very important issue of the position of the horse racing industry in our country.  I agree that there is a need to have a debate on the avoidance of a monopoly in the transmission of race meetings and am happy to organise same.  While I would defer to Senator O'Sullivan's superior knowledge when it comes to horse racing, I would suggest that the fact that Channel 4 has now transferred racing coverage to ITV means that it is less accessible to Irish viewers.  I subscribe to Sky but do not have Sky Sports.  Unless TV3 is carrying Cheltenham or Aintree, I will have difficulty watching racing.  The point the Senator makes is that &quot;At the Races&quot; provided an important and valuable service in terms of showcasing Irish racing.  The possibility of Racing UK having a monopoly is a matter of concern.  I am happy to invite the Minister to the House to discuss the matter.<br\/><br\/>Senator Mulherin raised the issue of An Bord Plean&aacute;la in the context of plans and ambitions for growth in rural Ireland.  She is a champion of rural Ireland and regional development and has raised such matters on many occasions.  It is important to recognise that An Bord Plean&aacute;la is independent of the political process.  That said, it is important that the board delivers reports on oral hearings in a timely manner and does not prolong issues in rural Ireland.  I am happy to schedule a debate on that matter.  <br\/><br\/>Beidh pl&eacute; againn mar gheall ar ch&uacute;rsa&iacute; taistil.  Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh asked for a debate on transport and I am happy to have the Minister, Deputy Shane Ross, come to the House to discuss traffic congestion in particular, as well as investment in public transport.  Senator Richmond praised the Government in the context of the EU-Mexico trade deal.  I commend the Minister of State, Deputy Pat Breen, for his role in that matter.  As Senator Richmond rightly said, we are proud to see trade links being developed with Japan, South Korea and Canada.  Given President Trump's propensity to engage in trade wars, it is important that we broaden our horizons and open Ireland up to new markets across the world.  I am happy to have a debate on that issue in the coming weeks.  <br\/><br\/>Senators Kieran O' Donnell and Colm Burke raised the matter of the M20, a very important piece of infrastructure.  I welcome today's announcement of the tender to appoint design and planning consultants, which will bring the &euro;8 million M20 project closer to fruition.  This is such an important piece of infrastructure for the south and south west.  It has the support of this Government because of its importance to the Cork-Limerick region in terms of connectivity.  Senator O'Donnell is correct to ask for a deadline of 2026 for completion to support Adare Manor's Ryder Cup bid.  I am happy to support Senator O'Donnell in making that call.  <br\/><br\/>I join Senator Murnane O'Connor in commending all of the volunteers who were involved in national spring clean month.  In particular, I commend the Tidy Towns volunteers who do a huge amount of work across the country, week in and week out.  Reference was made to the canal in Portobello, which reminded me of Paddy Kavanagh's poem, Canal Bank Walk:<\/p><blockquote>Leafy-with-love banks and the green waters of the canal, <br \/><br \/>Pouring redemption for me.<\/blockquote><p><!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=24\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The Grand Canal in Dublin, of which the Barrow Line is a branch, joins the River Barrow navigation in Senator Murnane O'Connor's county of Carlow.  The canal bank is a tremendous asset and provides a place to walk and exercise.  We must take personal responsibility for the rubbish which is discarded on the banks.  We need to call out the people who are throwing rubbish in these areas and highlight it.  I will be happy for the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Naughten, to come to the House in regard to the matter.<\/p><p>Let me confirm to Senator Colm Burke that we will be having a debate on Brexit.  I commend him for his tweet today.  The Border is not just a small matter, it is of significant importance to the people on the island of Ireland and, as Senator Burke rightly said, the author of the article knows little when she states that only a tiny amount of trade crosses the Irish Border.  There are also the excursions back and forth.<\/p><p>Senator Mac Lochlainn raised the issue of the provision of goods and nappies for those who are incontinent.  I am not aware of the matter he raised but it beggars belief that there should be an inordinate delay for people who are most vulnerable, be they adults who require incontinence pads or children who require nappies.  We must get an immediate answer to this matter.  I assume the HSE is the body responsible for the delivery of the items.  I am not sure to which area the Senator is referring, but the matter needs to be addressed urgently.  I have not gone up to Swan Park, but I put a request into the Minister's office, as I said I would.<\/p><p>Senator Dolan is correct to highlight the issue of the Irish Heart Foundation report this morning and to commend Mr. Chris Macey, the head of advocacy on the work he is doing.  The Senator is correct, it is not only older people who are now prone to suffering a stroke, younger people are having strokes and that is why we need to be very clear around the issue of strokes.  It goes back to Senator Butler's point regarding a balanced lifestyle, health and exercise.  We will invite the Minister to come to the House to debate this in the coming weeks.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018042400002#BB00800","speaker":"1391","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524576600,"counter":126,"content":"<p>Will the Leader confirm that No. 2 will be taken on the conclusion of No. 1?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018042400002#EE00200","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1524576600,"counter":127,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018042400002#EE00300","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1524576600,"counter":128,"content":"<p>Is the Order of Business agreed?
