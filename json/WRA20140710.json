As of December 2013, there were 177 companies in receipt of investment under this scheme.  They employed 2,244 and generated &euro;250m in sales.  Compared to the situation at the end of 2012, the fund supported 41 extra companies, 660 extra jobs and extra sales of &euro;127m.  This compares to a situation at the end of 2012 where 136 companies were in receipt of venture capital investment under the Seed and Venture Capital Scheme 2007-2012, had 1,584 people employed with total sales of &euro;123,591,000, of which &euro;83,236,000 were exports.  This data excluded those investments made in companies where the VC latterly exited the investment. <\/p><p>  The full economic potential of these investments is as yet unrealised and these seed investments have created a platform for future job creation.  Furthermore, many of these companies where the VC has exited its investment will go on to grow organically or gain investment through other sources of finance continuing to generate economic activity and sustaining and creating jobs.<\/p><p>  Under APJ 2012, a working group was established to ascertain the need for the State to continue its support, on the same terms as the private sector, for the development of the domestic VC Sector.  This working group consisting of DJEI\/EI and NPRF concluded there was a need for continued support and this led to the development of the 2013-18 SVC scheme.  The continuation of the scheme was clearly justified by the strong performance of the existing fund in terms of companies and jobs but also its success in leveraging private capital to match the State&rsquo;s investment.  At its October meeting, the Board of Enterprise Ireland committed &euro;99.5m of 2013-2018 funding to a number of Venture Capital Funds following the conclusion of an extensive and in-depth evaluation and due diligence process.  No companies have yet received investment under the Seed and Venture Capital Scheme 2013-2018 as the Funds that received commitments under this Scheme are in the process of completing the fundraising.  Once completed the Funds will close and commence investing in companies.<\/p><p>  The balance of the capital available under the Scheme will be committed to Venture Capital Funds to meet the overall objectives of the Scheme following further analysis and consultation on the needs of business.  To this end, Enterprise Ireland issued a consultation exercise inviting interested parties to submit written views, observations, or suggestions to help inform it in identifying the sectors and company stages of development that should be targeted under future competitive calls for expressions of interest under the Seed and Venture Capital Scheme 2013-2018.  This consultation period closed on 30 May 2014 and the submissions and other inputs are currently being considered in advance of formulating the criteria for the expressions of interest to be issued in the short to medium term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071000060#WRA00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Employment Rights","counter":8,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071000060#WRA00450"},{"type":"question","counter":9,"qnumday":13,"qnumall":"[29854\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071000060#WRA00500","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the number of staff currently employed in NERA; his plans to increase that number and particularly to strengthen the numbers and powers of those working the inspectorate-investigating division.

Because of the complexities involved in putting together an itinerary for a potential investor, IDA Ireland does not comment on upcoming visits by clients. <\/p><p>  Donegal&rsquo;s industry base is transforming from the clothing and textile industry into high tech, high skill activity and IDA Ireland actively promotes Donegal as a successful location for high-end manufacturing mainly to companies in the medical technologies sector.  Today there are 13 IDA Ireland-supported companies in Donegal employing 2,381 people in full and part time employment in Software Development, Systems Development and the Medical Technology industry.  IDA Ireland actively engages with its existing base of companies in Donegal, highlighting the ongoing importance of upskilling\/reskilling and the need to add high value activities in order to ensure sustainability and ongoing development.  I should also point out that some investment and job creation projects in client companies are not simply not announced.  <\/p><p>  Another focus for IDA Ireland in Donegal is the designated linked Gateway of Letterkenny\/Derry.  This focus involves developing stronger economic links with Invest Northern Ireland, which includes initiatives like the North West Business &amp;amp; Technology Zone (NWBTZ).  The NWBTZ is aimed at promoting the linked Gateway of Letterkenny\/Derry in line with the NI Regional Development Strategy 2025.

The Minister signalled that this measure, which came into effect on 1 July 2011, would run until the end of 2013.  The measure was forecasted to cost up to &euro;190 million in PRSI forgone in a full year.<\/p><p>  The Government regularly reviews the nature of supports it provides to companies and to employers, taking account of the evolving business environment and labour market conditions.  When the reduced PRSI rate was introduced in 2011, the economy was at its lowest point and losing over 1,600 jobs per week.  By comparison, the latest Quarterly National Household Survey figures published by the Central Statistics Office show that there was an annual increase of 42,700 people in employment in the twelve months ending in the first quarter of 2014.  Subsequent to the Jobs Initiative in May 2011, the Action Plan for Jobs process has separately delivered over 600 actions across all Government Departments and many State agencies to support job creation. <\/p><p>  Although the 8.5% rate of Employers PRSI was restored from 1 January this year for those earning up to &euro;356 per week, this still represents a reduction on the standard Employers PRSI rate of 10.75%.  The Department of Social Protection also introduced the JobsPlus scheme last year under the Action Plan for Jobs, as a new support for employers who take people from the Live Register.  This scheme provides a grant of &euro;7,500 over a two year period to an employer who recruits a person who has been on unemployed for 12 months or more.

The quality of transitions will determine the quality of a worker&rsquo;s career and the smooth functioning of the labour market. <\/p><p>  Ireland has a comprehensive body of employment rights legislation which has among its objectives the protection of employees and the quality of transitions between different contractual arrangements.  Specific areas covered by employment rights legislation include, for example, the protection of part-time work, the protection of fixed-term work, the protection of temporary work and the protection of persons engaged by temporary work agencies. <\/p><p>  There were 76,561 casual and part-time workers on the Live Register in June 2014, which represents 19.2% of the total Live Register.  This compares with 20.3% one year earlier when there were 88,322 casual and part-time workers on the Live Register.  In the year to June 2014 the number of casual and part-time workers decreased by 11,761.<\/p><p>  The increase in QNHS total employment of 47,000 in Q1 2014 was made up of an increase in full-time employment of 46,400 (+3.3%) while part-time employment declined by 3,700 (-0.8%).  This is in sharp contrast to the rest of the EU where there has been steady growth in the number of employees working part-time, while the number of fulltime workers has continued to fall. <\/p><p>  The objective of the Action Plan for Jobs is to support sustainable job creation by creating the operating conditions where businesses can start-up and grow.  The efforts of IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland are geared to creating full-time employment rather than part-time employment and this is reflected in their employment trends.  Jobs Plus, the Department of Social Protection&rsquo;s employer incentive scheme has helped recruit over 2,000 long-term unemployed jobseekers from the Live Register to fill full-time positions since its introduction last July and is deliberately designed to encourage employers to provide full-time jobs.  While full-time employment is the focus of our policy efforts, I recognise that in Ireland as indeed throughout Europe, temporary and part-time jobs area a contribution to job creation since in the medium to long run they may act as a stepping stone to permanent or full-time contracts.<\/p><p>  I appreciate the Deputy&rsquo;s concerns about the way in which zero hour contracts can operate.

Complex and sensitive issues - such as parades, flags and dealing with the legacy of the past - urgently require a comprehensive and structured framework.<\/p><p>  The Irish Government believes that contentious parades are best resolved through meaningful and sustained dialogue at local level within a statutory framework.  Without such dialogue and local agreement it must fall to the Parades Commission, which is the lawful authority in these matters, to make a determination on disputed parades.  The Government fully supports the Parades Commission and the PSNI as they do a difficult job in demanding circumstances.  I was heartened to hear political leaders across Northern Ireland also call for the Parades Commission&rsquo;s decisions to be respected.<\/p><p>  I spoke on Thursday 3 July with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Theresa Villiers MP, and we agreed it was important that the talks related to the above legacy issues resume as soon as possible.  The Taoiseach also spoke with Prime Minister Cameron on Sunday 6 July.  Both reiterated their support for the Northern Ireland institutions, underlined the importance of dialogue and agreed on the need for calm during the marching season.

A claim for relief may be made in respect of a number of students.\u00a0 <\/p><p>In making a claim for relief for the tax year 2014, the maximum amount of fees that can qualify for the relief is &euro;7,000 per student, but an amount set out in the legislation must be disregarded from each claim (whether in respect of one or more students).\u00a0 Where a claim for relief includes fees paid on behalf of at least one full-time student, the disregard is &euro;2,750. \u00a0Where a claim for relief includes fees solely paid on behalf of a part-time student or part-time students, the amount disregarded is &euro;1,375. \u00a0Thus, for example, an individual undertaking a graduate entry medical course\u00a0on a full-time basis, where tuition fees of &euro;15,000 per student apply, would attract relief of &euro;850 made up as follows:  \u00a0<table><tr><th>-<\/th><th>Fees<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Tuition fees\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/td><td>&euro;15,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Capped at \u00a0<\/td><td>&euro;7,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Less\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/td><td>&euro;2,750<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>-<\/td><td>&euro;4,250 @ 20% = &euro;850.<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071000061#WRB03500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Credits","counter":110,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071000061#WRB03550"},{"type":"question","counter":111,"qnumday":49,"qnumall":"[30539\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071000061#WRB03600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will recognise that persons in receipt of the single parent tax credit can have more than one child and these children may not have both the same parents, and in view of the situation whereby there is only one credit, that an arrangement must be put in place where it can be shared; and the action he will take regarding same.

The National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), is responsible for processing applications from schools for special educational needs supports. SENOs also make recommendations to my Department where Assistive Technology is required. <\/p><p>  In order to qualify for equipment under the Assistive Technology scheme, a child must have been diagnosed with a physical or communicative disability and must also have a recommendation in a professional assessment that the equipment is essential in order to allow the child to access the curriculum.  It must also be clear that the existing I.T. equipment in the school is insufficient to meet the child's needs.  As part of the application process, for which parental consent is required, schools set out how and in what manner the equipment which has been recommended in the professional report will be used in the classroom. <\/p><p>  Although equipment is sanctioned to support a particular pupil, the equipment is sanctioned to a school and  will, as a general rule, remain the property of the schools and be available for allocation to other or subsequent pupils with similar disabilities.  Circular 0010\/2013 explains that the pupil in question may, with the consent of the management authority, use the equipment at home.  The Circular also sets out the position regarding the transfer of equipment when pupils change school.  Should a parent be dissatisfied with the manner in which the resources or facilities which have been provided to support their child's education are being applied in school, they should raise this matter directly with their school Principal or the Board of Management of the school.<\/p><p>  I wish to explain also that my Department provides a range of supports for teachers in the area of Assistive Technology which are set out in Circular 0010\/2013 also.  These include support through the Special Education Support Service (SESS) which provides seminars and courses as well as support available through the SESS Support Scheme in the area of Assistive Technology, details of which are available at .<\/p><p>  Finally, I wish to advise the Deputy that the NCSE recently published comprehensive policy advice on Supporting Students with Special Educational Needs in Schools, which is available on its website www.ncse.ie.  This advice recommended that the NCSE should establish a working group, with Assistive Technology expertise, to develop a national policy on standards for professional recommendations and to determine the supports required in an educational context and the best ongoing utilisation of these resources.  The future of the Assistive Technology scheme will therefore be considered in the context of the implementation of this recommendation. <\/p><p>  The NCSE has commissioned research on the use of assistive technology\/equipment in supporting the education of children with special needs in schools.  The outcome of this research will support the considerations of an Advisory Group which has been established, in relation to the future of the Assistive Technology scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071000062#WRC01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Support Services","counter":149,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071000062#WRC01550"},{"type":"question","counter":150,"qnumday":66,"qnumall":"[30422\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071000062#WRC01600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the details of any discussions his Department has had with private colleges regarding the provision of disability support services, including those contracted to provide Springboard courses on behalf of the State.

Schools will choose from one or the other for the up-coming academic year 2014\/2015.  This new short course  is in fact designed for 100 hours of teaching compared to less than 70 hours for the existing CSPE syllabus.

These factors include issues such as access to finance, administrative burdens on business, the need to improve company capability, and gaining access to new markets.  The Action Plan for Jobs has delivered a range of initiatives to support job creation, develop sectors of potential and improve our competitiveness.  We are also building a strong enterprise mix to ensure that Ireland is not overly reliant on a limited number of sectors for future growth.  <\/p><p>  While the task has been significant, we are making progress.  We are climbing back up the international competitiveness rankings again and the latest CSO Quarterly National Household Survey showed that over 63,000 jobs have been created since the Action Plan for Jobs process was introduced at the start of 2012.  In 2013, Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland recorded the strongest employment growth in a decade amongst their client companies, while 2014 has shown a continued flow of new job announcements. <\/p><p>  The Government will continue to work towards its target of having an extra 100,000 people at work by 2016 through the Action Plan for Jobs process, and work will commence shortly on preparing the Action Plan for 2015.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071000063#WRD01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Job Creation Data","counter":225,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071000063#WRD01750"},{"type":"question","counter":226,"qnumday":92,"qnumall":"[30606\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071000063#WRD01800","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the number and location of manufacturing jobs created in each of the past five years to date; the extent to which existing jobs were lost in the same period and the net gain or loss; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":227,"content":"<p>The Forf&aacute;s Strategy on Manufacturing, which was launched in April 2013, identified that a total of 205,700 people were directly employed in Manufacturing and that a similar number of jobs were indirectly supported.

It is this ability to compete and differentiate themselves in global markets which enables Irish firms, including those in the manufacturing and service sectors, to achieve exports, thus increasing their turnover and their ability to create new jobs. <\/p><p>  Innovation is not the sole preserve of large high-tech firms with research laboratories, it is simply the application of knowledge in order to achieve impacts more economically, more efficiently and more effectively.  An innovative idea may come from the most low-tech of sources to the most high-concept solutions, arrived at via scientific research.  As such, the vast majority of manufacturing and services companies in the past five years would have featured strong elements of science, technology and innovation in identifying and responding to market needs, ultimately leading to the creation of new jobs.<\/p><p>  The Action Plan for Jobs emphasises the significance of innovation and the use of technology as critical drivers of job creation in Ireland while seeking to maximise their impact in the coming years.  Substantial ongoing investment has been made in Ireland&rsquo;s national innovation ecosystem and in the supports that build the innovative capability in Irish enterprise.  In tandem with this approach, it is recognised that substantial international expertise and important sources of non-exchequer funding are available via EU research initiatives.  Enterprise Ireland is the Irish agency responsible for helping Irish companies and third level researchers to participate in Horizon 2020 which has a budget of nearly &euro;80 billion.  In the past 7 years Ireland&rsquo;s National Support Network, which is led by Enterprise Ireland, has been responsible for helping Irish companies and academics secure over &euro;600 million from Horizon 2020&rsquo;s predecessor (Framework Programme 7).  Of this, roughly 60% of funding went to the Higher Education sector and 40% to industry.  This funding has provided a considerable increase in the innovative capability of Irish industry and academics over and above existing exchequer investments in this area.  <\/p><p>  Horizon 2020 offers even more valuable opportunities to companies based in Ireland to participate in high-quality research collaborations with their European counterparts.  An innovative feature of Horizon 2020 is that it contains a specific initiative -  the SME Instrument &ndash; designed to assist companies in surmounting financial obstacles thereby increasing their potential for participation in the Programme.  The Government has set an ambitious but achievable target of &euro;1.25 billion in funding from Horizon 2020 over the seven year lifetime of the Programme.  I am confident that, with the support of the National Support Network and the Government Strategy we have put in place, we will reach this target  -  over double the return from the previous (FP7) Programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071000063#WRD02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Job Creation","counter":231,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071000063#WRD02150"},{"type":"question","counter":232,"qnumday":94,"qnumall":"[30609\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071000063#WRD02200","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the extent to which he has had discussions with his EU colleagues in the context of job creation throughout Europe and here in particular; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":233,"content":"<p>Since taking office, my colleagues Minister Sherlock, Minister Perry and I, along with senior officials from my Department, have availed of every opportunity to engage with the EU institutions on policies of mutual concern regarding jobs, growth and investment.  To this end, bilateral meetings have been held on a regular basis at both official and Ministerial level with Commission and high ranking EU Officials, EU partners and like-minded Groups.  This level of engagement intensified during preparations for and the chairing of the EU Presidency in 2013.<\/p><p>We have discussed with like-minded partners the prioritisation of EU initiatives under the Single Market Act and in particular the completion of the digital single market and the opening up of services markets and tackling unjustified and disproportionate &ldquo;red tape&rdquo;.  I also fully support the core elements of the European Union's strategy for Jobs and Growth: Europe 2020 and its objectives to stimulate growth based on knowledge and innovation and a more sustainable and greener economy with high employment and social inclusion.  These objectives are also broadly consistent with the Government's own strategies as set out in the Programme for Government and the Medium-Term Economic Strategy.   <\/p><p>A key issue currently at EU level is the concept of mainstreaming competitiveness across all policies.  The EU Competitiveness Council considers that there needs to be a more coherent and holistic approach between industrial and other intertwining EU policies such as research and innovation, competition, trade, energy, environmental and climate policies which should all contribute to enhancing EU and national competitiveness and ultimately job creation.  This also implies a strengthening of the decision-making capabilities of the EU&rsquo;s Competitiveness Council and preparatory Group, the Council&rsquo;s High level Group on Competitiveness.  We are actively involved in these ongoing discussions with like-minded partners and with the Commission.  <\/p><p>Proactive support for the EU in liberalising trade and across the wider economic agenda, including that of competitiveness, should assist in making the Union&rsquo;s role more relevant to business and citizens and contribute to strengthening our exporters&rsquo; opportunities and job creation.  These have been a key focus under recent EU Presidencies including the Irish EU Presidency 2013.<\/p><p>The importance of investment in innovation, science and technology in employment creation is well recognised by Government.  Therefore, we are continuing to work to maximise our strategic interests and funding possibilities under the EU&rsquo;s new Research Programme (Horizon 2020 - &euro;80bn) and the Programme for Competitiveness and SMEs (COSME - &euro;2.23bn), both agreed under my chairmanship of the Competitiveness Council during our EU Presidency.  Every opportunity will be taken to further Ireland's interests to ensure that we can extract the maximum benefit from the funding available under these Programmes, particularly in relation to maximising the scope for participation by SMEs.  <\/p><p>Access to finance for SMEs is the most pressing problem.  In that regard, the Government is making concerted efforts to source alternative financing methods (including non-banking) using European Investment Bank funding as additional leverage.  The EU SME Envoy network will be tackling these issues in the coming months as part of the development and forthcoming review of the Small Business Act for Europe initiative.  My colleague, Minister John Perry TD, Minister for Small Business, is Ireland&rsquo;s representative on this network.  <\/p><p>The Action Plan for Jobs emphasises the importance of Innovation and the use of technology as core drivers of job creation in Ireland&rsquo;s key sectors during 2014 and into the coming years.  In tandem with this approach, it is recognised that substantial international expertise and important sources of non-exchequer funding are available via EU research initiatives. Enterprise Ireland is responsible for coordinating Ireland&rsquo;s national support network for helping Irish companies and third level researchers to participate in Horizon 2020.  The Government has set an ambitious but achievable target of &euro;1.25 Billion in funding from this Programme.  Ireland&rsquo;s drawdown from Framework Programme 7, Horizon 2020&rsquo;s predecessor, was almost &euro;600 Million.  This funding has provided a considerable increase in the innovative capability of Irish industry and academics over and above existing exchequer investments in this area.<\/p><p>I have also participated in<b><\/b>continuing discussions with my fellow Ministerial colleagues at the regular meetings of the Council of Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Ministers (EPSCO Council) regarding maintaining the employability of the labour force including the long term unemployed and supporting the re-integration into the labour market of the most vulnerable groups to take advantage of potential sources of jobs in expanding sectors.  I have found that Ministers are broadly agreed on the common challenges and on the need to maintain the momentum of ongoing structural reforms if lasting results are to be achieved.<\/p><p>Ministers are broadly agreed that, without a return to strong economic growth, and the normalisation of credit flows, the labour market situation in the European Union is unlikely to improve significantly in the short-term and further labour market reforms will become increasingly difficult to achieve.  The EPSCO Council affirmed in March of this year that the most important factor in improving EU labour markets is to have more and better jobs created. In this context, on-going financial market fragmentation has led to very divergent interest rates for loans to businesses and households across the EU.  This has profound implications for labour markets, as enterprises and in particular SMEs, Europe's engine for employment growth, continue to face barriers in accessing finance. <\/p><p>I will also continue to fully engage in the development of the EU&rsquo;s common commercial policies, which I believe provide a strong stimulus for growth and job creation.  Trade policy and the promotion of an agenda that progressively opens more markets for exporters is of great significance to Irish enterprise.  My general position along with our like-minded partners is that we must enhance the EU's competitiveness agenda in order to give momentum to our exporting potential because there is a clear and unambiguous link between what we achieve on the competitiveness front and leveraging this for growth through trade deals that are good for jobs and growth.<\/p><p>We will continue to work with our EU partners, the incoming EU Commission and the European Parliament at all levels to progress these policy instruments and associated measures through the various Council Working Groups and Committees including through the EU Competitiveness, EPSCO and Trade Councils.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071000063#WRD02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":234,"content":"<p>Question No. 95 answered with Question No. 91.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Economic Competitiveness","counter":235,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071000063#WRD02450"},{"type":"question","counter":236,"qnumday":96,"qnumall":"[30611\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071000063#WRD02500","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the extent to which the cost base in Irish industry remains competitive and in line with that in other adjoining and European jurisdictions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

It is important to note that the electricity and gas markets are commercial, liberated and operate within national and European regulatory regimes and that responsibility for the regulation of the markets is a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), which is an independent statutory body.  Direct Government interventions that would impact on the prices of electricity and gas products would contravene the EU Third Energy Package of legislation which governs the energy policy framework in relation to electricity and gas markets. <\/p><p>At a national level, the competitive energy market in place helps put downward pressure on prices.  The CER is focussed on actions that can mitigate costs for business and domestic customers, including rigorous regulatory scrutiny of the network costs component of retail prices.  Energy efficiency represents a significant opportunity for households to reduce their energy costs.  There are energy efficiency measures in place to assist both business and domestic energy consumers, with significant funding allocated to them.  The Energy Efficiency Fund, which I announced in February 2013 has commenced funding specific measures and is assisting, and will assist further, energy efficiency projects in the public and commercial sectors.<\/p><p>There are a number of avenues open to consumers to try to mitigate rising electricity prices, and measures are also in place to assist them.  Accordingly, consumers can and should shop around to get the best possible price and service deal from suppliers, and switch supplier if necessary, bearing in mind that all suppliers offer competitive prices and products.  Consumers can also take steps to improve the efficiency of their electricity usage which delivers demonstrable savings including availing of Government funded measures.  The SEAI-administered Warmer Homes Scheme (WHS) aims to improve the energy efficiency and comfort conditions of homes occupied by vulnerable households in receipt of the National Fuel Allowance Scheme through the installation of draught proofing, attic insulation, lagging jackets, low energy light bulbs and cavity wall insulation where appropriate.

My Department set a target of achieving 70% generic penetration of the off-patent market by volume by 2016.  In Quarter 1 2014 generic products accounted for almost 63% of the total off-patent market by volume.  <\/p><p>A number of enabling measures are being implemented to achieve this target, in particular, the introduction of generic substitution and reference pricing under the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013.  In addition, it is intended to amend the relevant regulations to provide for the mandatory inclusion of the International Non-Proprietary Name (INN) on all prescriptions.  Under the legislation, the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) has statutory responsibility for establishing and maintaining a list of interchangeable medical products.  In doing so, the HPRA is required to have regard to a comprehensive set of qualifying conditions, all of which must be complied with before a decision is taken to make a medicinal product interchangeable.  A key objective of the Act is to enable patients to opt for lower cost interchangeable generic medicines.  Previously, when a specific brand of medicine was prescribed for a patient, a pharmacist could only supply that particular brand, even when less expensive generic versions of the same medicine were available.  The Act now permits pharmacists to substitute medicines prescribed, provided that they have been designated as safely interchangeable by the HPRA.<\/p><p>Generic substitution coupled with reference pricing provides patients with an incentive to opt for the cheapest available product, but does not impose any unavoidable additional costs on patients.  In general terms, when a pharmacist is presented with a prescription for an interchangeable medicine, which is not the subject of a clinical exemption, the pharmacist is obliged to offer the patient the opportunity to agree to substituting the prescribed product with an interchangeable medicine which is in stock in the pharmacy and is of lower cost to the patient or the HSE, as the case may be.  The patient may either accept the interchangeable medicine offered by the pharmacist or opt to receive the branded interchangeable medicine where prescribed.  Alternatively, the patient may opt to go to a different pharmacy to receive a less expensive interchangeable medicine. <\/p><p>Generic substitution is being introduced incrementally with the HPRA prioritising those medicines which will achieve the greatest savings for patients and the State.  The Authority is in the process of reviewing an initial 40 active substances in accordance with the processes and timescales set out in the legislation.  To date the HPRA has completed the assessment of 25 active substances and has updated the List of Interchangeable Medicinal Products accordingly.  It is expected that assessment for interchangeability of the first 40 priority active substances (representing 80% of the off-patent market by value) will be completed by end 2014.  This process will continue until all medicinal products on the List of Reimbursable Items have been assessed.  Full details and information concerning the designation of products as interchangeable is available on the HPRA website through the following link: <\/p><p>The Act also allows the HSE to set a reference price for groups of interchangeable medicines.  Reference pricing involves the setting of a common reimbursement price, or reference price, for a group of interchangeable medicines.  It means that one reference price is set for each group or list of interchangeable medicines, and this is the maximum price that the HSE will reimburse to pharmacies for all medicines in the group, regardless of the individual medicine's prices. <\/p><p>The HSE sets reference prices for each group of interchangeable products in accordance with the criteria set out in section 24(3) of the legislation as follows:<blockquote>(a) the ability of suppliers of the relevant listed items to meet patient demand for the relevant listed items;<br \/><br \/>(b) the value for money afforded by the relevant listed items;<br \/><br \/>(c) the equivalent relevant prices (if practicably available) of the relevant listed items in all other Member States where one or more than one of the relevant listed items is marketed;<br \/><br \/>(d) the relevant prices of therapeutically similar listed items;<br \/><br \/>(e) the resource available to the Executive; and<br \/><br \/>(f) the terms of any agreements in place (whether entered into before, on or after the commencement of this section) between the Executive and any representative body of the suppliers of drugs, medicines, or medical or surgical appliances where the agreement relates, whether directly or indirectly, to the price of one or more of those items.<\/blockquote>The first reference price for atorvastatin products was implemented on 1 November 2013.  The HSE has continued to implement reference prices for Lists of Interchangeable Medicinal Products published by the HPRA in accordance with the procedures and timescales set out in the 2013 Act.  To date the HSE has implemented reference prices for 14 of the 25 interchangeable lists resulting in reductions of between 70% and 20% in the prices paid by the HSE for these products compared to May 2013.  In addition, the HSE will implement reference prices for a further six lists of interchangeable medicines on 1 August 2014. <\/p><p>The HSE will continue the process of setting reference prices for the remaining groups of interchangeable medicinal products published by the HPRA in accordance with the processes and timescales set down in the legislation.  It is expected that 80% by value of the off-patent market for prescribed medicines will be subject to reference pricing by end Quarter 1 2015 resulting in further significant reductions in the price of generic medicines.  Reference prices will ensure that generic prices in Ireland will fall towards European norms.  Full details and information concerning the implementation of reference pricing is available on the HSE website through the following link: <\/p><p>It is expected that referencing pricing will save approximately &euro;50 million in 2014.  However, it is not possible at this stage to provide accurate figures regarding the potential savings to be generated from extending reference pricing beyond the initial 40 priority active substances, as this depends on various factors including prevailing prices, number of competitors, availability of substitute products, and market dynamics.  However, it is the HSE's policy to set reference prices that maximise the savings for the State and patients consistent with protecting continuity of supply for essential medicines in the Irish market.  Consequently reference prices will not be set so low as to jeopardise the supply of the relevant medicines.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071000066#WRG04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ambulance Service Provision","counter":468,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071000066#WRG04150"},{"type":"question","counter":469,"qnumday":176,"qnumall":"[30460\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071000066#WRG04200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the annual average cost of providing a fully resourced Health Service Executive ambulance service.

Irish hospitals use the AR-DRG grouping system which groups each hospital's inpatient and daycase workload into 698 DRGs.  Until the end of 2013, the main use of the DRG system was to adjust the budget allocations of acute public hospitals by up to 3% in line with the complexity of their casemix and their relative performance under the Casemix System.  DRGs have also been used as a tool to assist with planning as well as monitoring and assessing performance within the acute hospital sector.<\/p><p>  Since January, 2014 the DRG grouping system has been used to facilitate the introduction of a new prospective, case-based funding model for public hospital care called Money Follows the Patient.  The new model involves moving away from inefficient block grant budgets to a new system where hospitals are paid for the actual level of activity undertaken.  As such, hospitals will be funded based on the quantity and quality of the services they deliver to patients.  They will be liberated, subject to overall budgetary ceilings, to pursue the most cost-effective means of achieving this standard of performance.  Budgetary discipline will be delivered through the use of fixed budgets for MFTP activity.<\/p><p>  The new model is being rolled-out on a phased basis and full implementation will take a number of years.  The MFTP approach is initially being applied to inpatient and daycase activity in public hospitals.  However, it is intended that the payment system will extend over time to cover other hospital activity and eventually evolve so that money can follow the patient out of the hospital setting to primary care.  The work of the National Clinical Programmes will be central to the future development of the payment model so that care can be financed as a bundle\/package across a variety of settings.<\/p><p>  Encouraging hospitals to use the resources at their disposal more efficiently is one of the central objectives of the MFTP system.  A recent pilot project, which implemented a MFTP model in the orthopaedic speciality, showed the positive impact that MFTP can have through productivity gains.  Introduction of MFTP resulted in significantly reduced average lengths of stay, increased numbers of day of surgery admissions, and an increase in the number of discharges at the weekend.  Crucially, these improvements were delivered while not raising any quality concerns.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071000067#WRH00700","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":491,"qnumday":185,"qnumall":"[30469\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071000067#WRH00800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his views on whether the introduction of a prospective case-based payment system for hospital services using the existing diagnostic-related grouping system would result in savings arising from increased efficiency and productivity of 5%; if he will provide details of the pilot projects carried out to date; if he will provide detail of efficiencies and savings realised, including the money saved, total value and as a percentage of local budgets; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Implementation of this new funding model commenced in January of this year with the approach initially being applied to inpatient and daycase activity in public hospitals.  Full implementation will take a number of years and a phased approach to roll-out is being employed.  The new model involves moving away from inefficient block grant budgets to a new system where hospitals are paid for the actual level of activity undertaken.

They will be liberated, subject to overall budgetary ceilings, to pursue the most cost-effective means of achieving this standard of performance.  Budgetary discipline will be delivered through the use of fixed budgets for Money Follows the Patient (MFTP) activity.  It should be noted that, as stated in the MFTP Policy Paper, the new funding mechanism does not aim to reduce budgets but, rather to drive efficiency in the provision of high quality hospital services.    <\/p><p>  Prior to the commencement of MFTP, the HSE operated a prospective funding pilot programme for Primary Hip and Knee Replacements (four DRGs) between 2011 and 2013.  The pilot related to elective work only.  Seven hospitals initially participated, with a further five joining from January 2012.  The pilot involved the participating hospitals' current budgets being reduced by an amount of money related to the four DRGs.  This portion of the budget was then &ldquo;earned&rdquo; back, based on the work carried out in the hospital.  There was no other change to any other portion of the hospital budget.<\/p><p>  No specific savings figures have been calculated for the pilot programme.  However, reviews of the pilot highlighted a number of efficiency related benefits including significantly reduced average lengths of stay, increased numbers of day of surgery admissions, and an increase in the number of discharges at the weekend.  While the level of improvement varied across the different hospitals and the different DRGs, all showed significant improvements in these key determinants of hospital efficiency and productivity.   <\/p><p>  This pilot was the first example of Money Follows the Patient in operation in Irish hospitals and was a useful exercise in highlighting the benefits that can accrue as a result of these types of funding arrangements.  It also provided useful lessons in terms of systems and process requirements as well as the need for stakeholder buy-in ahead of roll-out to the wider hospital system.  <\/p><p>  A shadow funding exercise was also carried out in Q4 2013 using eight representative hospitals.  This exercise: (i) compared, on a systematic basis, actual hospital activity against baseline activity targets; and (ii) informed hospitals of what the financial implications of any variance from the targets would be in a &ldquo;live&rdquo; system without impacting on budgets.  Although this was not strictly speaking a &quot;pilot&quot; it did provide key lessons which are being applied in the 2014 MFTP roll-out.<\/p><p>  While it is not possible to specify a percentage increase in efficiency that will result when MFTP is rolled out across all public hospitals, I am confident that its introduction will drive efficiencies in similar areas to those evident in the orthopaedic project.  This will help to deliver a more efficient and productive hospital system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071000067#WRH00900","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Suicide Prevention","counter":493,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071000067#WRH00950"},{"type":"question","counter":494,"qnumday":186,"qnumall":"[30470\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071000067#WRH01000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the total State spend on suicide prevention and awareness projects, including funding for the National Office of Suicide Prevention, for the years 2011, 2012, 2013 and to date in 2014; if he will provide a breakdown of same by year and by scheme and-or project; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

There are in the region of 300 such agencies at present across the country that provide a significant and broad range of services for children and adults with disabilities in partnership with and on behalf of the HSE. <\/p><p>  The manner in which funding is allocated\/distributed allows for a distinction between broad categories of funding such as services for older people, primary care and disabilities in general.  Disability services are provided based on the needs of an individual rather than by the actual type of disability.  The HSE has informed the Department of Health that it does not separate out the spend on  Physical &amp;amp; Sensory, Intellectual or Autism Disabilities as some of the Disability Service providers offer services to both Intellectual and Physical &amp;amp; Sensory service users.  <\/p><p>  In relation to the specific queries raised by the Deputy, as these are service issues, they have been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071000067#WRH01300","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Reviews","counter":499,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071000067#WRH01350"},{"type":"question","counter":500,"qnumday":188,"qnumall":"[30474\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071000067#WRH01400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason a financial statement regarding a medical card has not issued to a person (details supplied) in County Cork some eight weeks after the decision, thus preventing an appeal; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"990","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":501,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p><p>  The Health Service Executive operates the General Medical Services scheme, which includes medical cards and GP visit cards, under the Health Act 1970, as amended.

This model gave rise to the application of a non-standard approach when the element of discretion was used in the decision to grant a medical card.  The different treatment of cases depending on their geographical location, is fundamentally discriminatory, an undesirable administrative practice and contrary to fair or sound administration. <\/p><p>  The centralisation of  medical card processing was completed on 1 July 2011.  This meant that all new medical card applications and reviews made from 1 July 2011 were processed centrally by the PCRS Office in Finglas, Dublin.  Centralisation delivered a consistent and equitable application of eligibility and service provision and has provided clearer governance and accountability, as well as improved management information.  It is in the context of the finalisation of the centralisation project  - 1 July 2011 - that the Government decided that the HSE would issue cards to persons, with a serious illness, whose discretionary card was refused renewal in the period from 1 July 2011 to 31 May 2014.<\/p><p>  It should be noted that the provisions of the Health Act, 1970 (as amended) have not changed and that all applications for a medical card continue to be assessed against the HSE's National Assessment Guidelines.

The application was considered in line with the procedures and timescales agreed in 2012 by my Department and the HSE with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA). <\/p><p>  In accordance with these procedures, the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE) conducted a pharmacoeconomic evaluation of Eculizumab and concluded that, at a total cost per patient per year of &euro;437,247 and a cumulative gross budget impact over 5 years estimated at &euro;33 million, the therapy did not represent value for money for the treatment of patients in the Irish healthcare setting.  In addition, the manufacturer did not include an economic model as part of their submission and failed to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of this therapy.  Consequently, the NCPE was unable to recommend reimbursement of the product under the community drug schemes.

The overarching aim of the Programme is to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with asthma in Ireland and to improve clinical outcomes and the quality of life of all patients with asthma.  A key component is the improved management of people with asthma in primary care, thereby avoiding emergency attendance at General Practitioner (GP) out-of-hours services, emergency departments and in-patient services. <\/p><p>  The initial focus has been on the development of national asthma guidelines based on international best practice, early asthma diagnosis, active asthma treatment, guided self-management and patient education.  This work is complete.  A number of other elements of the Programme have also been implemented, including an asthma education programme and patient education materials.  The Programme has also developed a National Model of Care for Asthma, which details how physicians, nurses and other health professionals will work with engaged patients to make the clinical decisions most appropriate to their circumstances; and to collaborate with specialist colleagues in providing a safe, seamless patient experience within the health system in Ireland.<\/p><p>  The National Model of Care for Asthma in general practice has been agreed by the HSE's Clinical Programmes, the Asthma Society and the ICGP.  Implementation of this model in general practice involves consultation on the GP contract with representative bodies.
