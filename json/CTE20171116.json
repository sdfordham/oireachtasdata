There was then a discussion about whether or not a service level agreement was in place.  I have a number of concerns.  I fully understand the need for there to be independence and separation between politics and the national broadcaster, and that we should not stray into policy or seek to ask questions which could be seen as us trying to influence the programmes of RT&Eacute;.  Those are not the questions I have.  Some 40% of the budget of that Department goes to RT&Eacute;.  The majority of RT&Eacute;'s funding comes from the taxpayer.  There are issues with regard to bogus self-employment within RT&Eacute; and how some well-paid people in RT&Eacute; are using legitimate tax avoidance schemes.  It is legitimate but they are avoiding paying income tax.  There are various issues, including issues related to the disposal of assets, which I would like to put to RT&Eacute;.<\/p> <p>  The Secretary General was not able to give us a line by line breakdown or even answer basic questions about how that money is spent.  It is reasonable for us to have RT&Eacute; before us.  I understand that it is not audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  That is fine, but it gets substantial money from the taxpayer.  A number of people from RT&Eacute; came forward to me following last week's meeting to say that this is an issue.  Philip Boucher-Hayes, who people will know works for \"Drivetime\", did a programme on this where he talked about the prevalence of these bogus self-employment contracts in RT&Eacute;.  It costs the taxpayer money and is an issue the Chairman said he wants to look at.  If there is a loss of revenue to the Exchequer, we should focus on it.  I propose that we examine the matter and invite RT&Eacute; in to address those specific issues which are important.  We know the issue is prevalent in the construction sector, among others.  We will have Revenue in and can put the matter to it.  If the national broadcaster is involved in this sort of practice, facilitated by the taxpayer, we should be given the opportunity to put questions to RT&Eacute; about how it spends public money.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017111600002#B00400","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1510822800,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I understand everything the Deputy is saying.  He correctly said that auditing RT&Eacute; is specifically excluded from the Comptroller and Auditor General's remit.  In a way, it might not be directly under our remit but as we have clearly established, over 50% of RT&Eacute;'s funding comes directly through the Department from licence fees.  RT&Eacute; is in an unusual situation.  It leads to the question of whether it should be on the State balance sheet.  Is it a commercial semi-State company if the majority of its income is a direct subsidy from the taxpayer?  It raises a few interesting questions.  We asked the Secretary General at the last meeting to give us a detailed response.  Can we study that detailed response and keep it on hold?  I am not disagreeing but information has been requested, which I am sure we will get back promptly.  We can include it on our work programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017111600002#B00500","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1510822800,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I have no difficulty with that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017111600002#B00600","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1510822800,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I am not disagreeing with anything the Deputy has said.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017111600002#B00700","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1510822800,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I understand that.

We do, however, have a job to probe how money is spent.  I am not sure that the responses we will get from the Secretary General will answer my concerns.  At some point, we will need to hear from RT&Eacute;.

I have submitted a series of parliamentary questions relating to RT&Eacute;'s funding, the public service obligation, its standing as a commercial semi-State entity on the State balance sheet and so on.  What concerned me most of all last week was that when we asked the Secretary General about the service level agreement, he did not know and came back about it.  I had submitted a parliamentary question about that, which we produced over the lunch break.  The Secretary General then said, and I am paraphrasing, that a circular was issued by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in 2016 saying that an oversight agreement should be in place.  I have the circular and have made sure that members have received it in their correspondence.  It is the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies from August 2016.  It stated that Government Departments should ensure they have a written oversight agreement with State bodies under their aegis to clearly define the terms of the State body's relationship with the relevant Minister or parent Department.<\/p> <p>  Some 15 months after that circular was issued by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Secretary General does not have it in place.  I will be adding to why RT&Eacute; needs to come in the failure of the Accounting Officer to have the oversight agreement, as specified in public policy, in place.  If he had an adequate service level agreement that he could bring in and prove to us that everything was kosher, it would be fine, but he has not done his job 15 months afterwards and does not have an oversight agreement.  The failure of the Accounting Officer to comply with Government regulation leaves us no option but to do his job.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017111600002#B01100","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1510822800,"counter":15,"content":"<p>Absolutely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017111600002#B01200","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speech","time":1510822800,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I think we are agreed that RT&Eacute; will be invited to address this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017111600002#B01300","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1510822800,"counter":17,"content":"<p>Teachta Connolly made a point.

I am not even asking for a response but saying that it is a bit unfair.  I have put it on the record that we support the independence of RT&Eacute; as a national broadcaster.

The GPO Arcade was a property that we had as an example last week.  It was valued at &euro;895,000 but the rent was &euro;200,000 a year.  The basic formula for the value of that property would be a figure of ten times the rent at the moment, though it could be much more.  That is a figure of &euro;2 million.  That skews the people's picture of the assets the State has.  It seems that accepted practice is so much on autopilot that the State does not care what a property is valued at, provided it is consistent.  If a property was purchased in 1975 for &pound;25,000, and we stick with the acquisition cost, then everything is fine.  From a basic business point of view, that would be absolutely incredible.  There are valuers employed by the State permanently in the Valuation Office, and indeed for relatively modest fees, auctioneers all over the country would be prepared to undertake valuations.  If property was valued last year in detail, then a desktop valuation or upgrade, which I have often done in the private sector myself, is a very nominal cost, but at least it gives us accuracy.<\/p> <p>  I also have a fear, and perhaps this is something that we engage with the Office of Public Works on, that we have a whole series of properties all over the country that we are not really up to speed on, regarding squatters' rights, rents, or valuations.  You yourself, Chairman, in parliamentary questions, have noted that when businesses are struck off, properties accrue to the State, and we have also learned that there is not even a register of these properties.  We could have hundreds of properties or five, and the people in control on the ground, who may hold squatters' rights on those properties may again impede upon the State's holdings.  Practice, that word that scares the life out of anybody who has been around politics for a few years, is one thing, and the law and what is best is another thing, and this is a problem.  We need to set aside some time to look at this, because it has highlighted what I believe is a serious problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017111600002#C01700","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speech","time":1510822800,"counter":38,"content":"<p>I will ask the Comptroller and Auditor General, not necessarily in time for next week, to write a note on how fixed assets are recorded in the different groups of organisations, whether they are appropriation accounts, semi-state bodies or different bodies.

In the accounting policies of most organisations, before you get to the figures, there is a detailed section saying how they revalued the assets, and it must be ensured that that is consistent.  I would like Mr. McCarthy to put together a document on it, and we will come back to that document.   It will be useful, because there are obvious questions.  If, for example, one went to local authorities and asked the same question, they might ask if they are to put a value on the road network through our county, and question what constitutes a State asset.

The investigator, Richard Thorn, has also requested that the committee be advised [yes, we will be advised] of the need to avoid discussion that will potentially do so.  I would be grateful if you can ensure that all members of the Committee are made aware of this.  I and Department officials attending the Committee will be very conscious of this during the discussions at the Committee meeting.  <\/blockquote> <p>That is the point, the other paragraph is on a different topic.

It was not in the correspondence at the time it was sent in so we agreed we would take it this week.  It was follow-on correspondence because there was a discussion on the difference between how ConnectIreland and the IDA have to verify jobs that are created.  There are two attachments.  The first is PAC32R8482C, which is the requirements that ConnectIreland have to meet.  Can we get that up on the screen for a second?  What it has to do is identify somebody responsible within the organisation to ensure the jobs were created.  It has to create a spreadsheet which then shows the name of the employee, the employee's position, the employee's start date and end date.  It must be on company headed paper.  There needs to be verification in terms of P30s, contracts and all of that.  The verification process is very intense.  If we then look at the IDA's one, it is a simple one-page survey and all it has to do is fill in a number of boxes recording how jobs are created.  All it is is self-verification.  I have a difficulty with that because we depend on that data to present to us the facts of how many jobs are actually created by the IDA.  The process here is a joke as far as I can see.  This self-assessment and self-verification is madness because we are being told there are a certain number of jobs created and yet there is absolutely no guarantee the figure is genuine.  It is simply relying on information it is getting from the company.<\/p><p>There is no follow-up or real inspection and no way we can verify whether it is accurate.  I imagine that in most circumstances it probably is and that companies give accurate figures.  My point relates to the difference between the hoops ConnectIreland has to go through, rightly.  It should be the case that ConnectIreland has to verify the information.  If it claims jobs are created, then the company should prove it.  IDA Ireland insists that ConnectIreland goes through this process.  Yet, there is a far less rigorous process that IDA Ireland has to go through to verify the jobs that it claims to have created.  I am not happy with it, to be honest.  I am unsure how we deal with it.  It may be a matter for the sectoral committee.  I am unhappy with the process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017111600002#D01400","speaker":"1258","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510822800,"counter":63,"content":"<p>We should write to IDA Ireland.

IDA Ireland can give us any amount of data.  The question is whether the data is accurate.  The problem is when the data is not accurate.  We can put up on the screen the actual survey that IDA Ireland companies are asked to fill in.  It is a one-page document that includes the Companies Registration Office number and the number of employees or jobs created, but that is it.  Where is the follow-up or verification?  There is no process - it amounts to zero.  We are taking at face value information being given by companies.  The data is then given to Oireachtas Members in response to parliamentary questions.  Statements on job creation claim X number of jobs have been created, but we cannot verify whether that is the case.  That has an impact on policy and revenue.<\/p> <p>  Let us juxtapose that with the data on the screen relating to what ConnectIreland has to go through.  It is a far more rigorous process.  There is a problem here.  I do not believe that responding in terms of data is the answer.  Perhaps we need to write to IDA Ireland again to say that we are concerned about process and verification.

Does the funding of the actual activities of Tourism Ireland represent value for money from a taxpayer's point of view when the outputs are taken into account?

I could understand it if there was an outlier among the number of buildings, perhaps because of unclear title issues.

In addition to the list that has been promised, can we be given some indication as to when we are likely to see a conclusion?  What is being done, or what remains to be done, to get to a conclusion in all cases?  Perhaps that can be indicated on the list or spreadsheet we are to be given.<\/p> <p>  I am aware that one of the Department's documents indicated that a sizeable amount of administrative time was being spent on this.  I presume that the longer this goes on, the heavier that investment will be.  Is somebody who is dedicated to this initiative working on it in the Department, or is it an intermittent thing?  What is going on to cause it to take so long?  Is a different kind of focus required to get this over the line?  We are going to keep coming back to this.  As Deputy Connolly said, if a building is sitting there idle, it is not improving.  The buildings that will be received by local authorities or the Department when they come into public ownership will end up needing to have money spent on them by virtue of the fact that they have been empty.  Can we have some sort of an indication?  Who is doing what?  When are all of these matters likely to come over the line?  It seems like it is taking an inordinate length of time.

People may recall that earlier this year the Committee of Public Accounts engaged with the third level sector and produced a report which focused on seven third level institutions.  Financial accounts were examined by the committee, as was the voted expenditure and the appropriation account from the Department of Education and Skills, as well as the financial accounts of the Higher Education Authority.  The committee held five public meetings to consider the matter.  In recent weeks the University of Limerick report, authored by Dr. Richard Thorn, has been released.  Many of the serious issues discussed by Dr. Thorn were raised and discussed at this committee in our engagement with him before he was requested to carry out that work by the Department.<\/p><p>Our concerns in relation to the education sector in general are rooted in issues raised by the Comptroller and Auditor General on the publishing of accounts and statements by education bodies.  A fundamental difficulty is the fact that in this sector the accounts of many bodies are not published until two or three years after they are due.  Some ETBs continue to go back every year to the Department or SOLAS for an allocation of funding, and the Department and SOLAS continue to fund them without having seen the audited financial statements of the prior years.  That is a major concern for this committee.  <\/p><p>Our focus on the education sector, as the Comptroller and Auditor General will also comment, is because a report was produced on the timeliness of reporting in the entire public sector, which includes the 300 bodies that he audits, and the education sector came out bottom of the class.  It is surprising that so many of the organisations referred to for late production of financial statements were in the education sector.  In simple English, we ask that the Department of Education and skills practises what it teaches when it comes to financial matters.<\/p><p>The production of annual accounts in a timely fashion is a requirement, and is important in the interests of public accountability that they be published and available for discussion in a forum like this.  This committee has signalled that it will not tolerate a continuation of this situation next year.  This applies not just to the education sector, but right across the public sector.  We will ensure that all organisations meet their requirements, statutory or otherwise, and have their full<b><\/b>accounts presented within three months of the year end with the objective of having them certified by the Comptroller and Auditor General within six months.  All public bodies should send their accounts to the Comptroller and Auditor General by 31 March 2018.  That is five months away.  They are now on notice and have five months to get it right.  There is no good reason that this cannot be done by the end of March of the coming year.  <\/p><p>Today we will focus on the ETB sector.  We also have representatives from the Department of Education and Skills and SOLAS, which are the funders and as such have oversight responsibilities.  Our first session will be with the Department and SOLAS, followed by two further sessions with Dublin City ETB and Kilkenny ETB , and then Tipperary and Kildare-Wicklow ETBs.  The representatives of those organisations are in the Gallery today.  They are free to come and go.  However, because what is being discussed here affects a range of ETBs, we hope it will be a learning process for everybody involved in the sector.  We will look at the good points and the pitfalls we have encountered.  <\/p><p>To begin, our first session will deal with SOLAS and the Department of Education and Skills, and the Comptroller and Auditor General will make an opening statement regarding his report.  I welcome the representatives of the Department of Education and Skills to this session, including the Secretary General, Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Mr. Hubert Loftus, Ms Ann Fitzpatrick, Mr. Eamonn Cusack and Mr. Phil O&rsquo;Flaherty.  From SOLAS, we have Mr. Paul O&rsquo;Toole, chief executive, who is accompanied by Mr. Connor Dunne and Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Conlon.<\/p><p>I remind members, witnesses and those in the Gallery that all mobile phones must be switched off.  It is important that phones are put into flight mode because just putting them on silent will not prevent them from interfering with the recording system in the Oireachtas.<\/p><p>I wish to advise the witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.<\/p><p>Members of the Committee on Public Accounts are reminded of the provisions of the Oireachtas Standing Orders that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies.<\/p><p>I ask the Comptroller and Auditor General to make an opening statement about the Department and SOLAS.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017111600002#K00200","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510822800,"counter":263,"content":"<p>My opening comments will set the context for the examination of the education and training boards, ETBs.  Under the Education and Training Boards Act 2013, the 33 vocational education committees, VECs, were dissolved on 30 June 2013 and all their assets, liabilities and approximately 13,000 staff were transferred to 16 new education and training boards which were established on 1 July 2013.  Most of the ETBs were formed through the amalgamation of two, or in some cases three, adjoining former VECs.<\/p><p>The ETBs manage and operate second level schools, further education colleges and a small number of community national schools.  They are also responsible for a range of adult and further education centres in line with their predecessor VECs.  In addition, 19 former F&Aacute;S training centres were transferred to the ETBs in 2014.  This involved the transfer of around 800 staff to the ETBs from SOLAS, which had taken on F&Aacute;S&rsquo;s training responsibilities.  In 2016, the combined payments of the 16 ETBs were just under &euro;2 billion.  The primary source of funding for the ETBs is the Vote for education and skills, with expenditure from a number of different subheads.  SOLAS, which itself is funded from the Vote and from the national training fund managed by the Department, also provides significant funding to the ETBs.<\/p><p> The Minister for Education and Skills is responsible under the Education and Training Boards Act for setting the financial reporting framework for the ETBs.  The Act specifies that draft financial statements are to be presented for audit by 1 April following the period of account.  Timely production of audited financial statements has been a challenge for many of the ETBs from the outset.  The first period of account for ETBs was the 18 month period from July 2013 to the end of 2014.  In April 2015, the Department established a working group to develop the format for the financial statements.  The group completed its work in October 2015.  While audit work was progressed as far as practicable on an interim basis, the initial audits could not be completed until final form statements were available.  Other causes of delays in one or more of the ETBs were the incompatibility of financial management systems when amalgamating some former VECs, challenges arising from the integration of the training centres, which also had a different financial management framework, and the impact in some ETBs of the moratorium on recruitment on their capacity to generate financial statements and to service the demands of the audit.  The combination of challenges resulted in only seven of the 16 ETBs being in a position to present their first financial statements before the end of 2015.  One ETB, Mayo, Sligo and Leitrim, is only now in a position to complete its first financial statements.<\/p><p> As I outlined in my special report published last week, some progress was made by the ETBs in advancing the timeliness of financial statement production for 2015.  As a result, 11 of the 16 had 2015 financial statements ready for presentation by the end of 2016.  In the two cases of Limerick and Clare ETB and Mayo, Sligo Leitrim ETB, there continue to be problems in producing accounts and back-up to a standard that is sufficient for audit purposes.  We are working with those ETBs to bring the outstanding audits to completion as soon as possible.  In three cases, matters which came to light during audits of draft 2015 financial statements have required further inquiries and explanations and this has resulted in protracted audits.  The table on the next page of my written submission and which can be put up on the screen now aims to summarise the position, as of last Friday, in relation to the audit and presentation of ETB 2015 financial statements.  Some key points for committee members to note are as follows.  Only Kilkenny and Carlow ETB met the statutory date for presentation of draft 2015 financial statements.  For Limerick and Clare ETB, the audit was only able to commence on site around July 2017.  We expect to complete that audit by the end of this year.  For Mayo, Sligo and Leitrim ETB, we received draft 2015 financial statements only in July 2017.  We are currently working on both the 2013-14 and 2015 audits and expect to complete the process for 2013-14 by the end of the year and for 2015 in the first quarter of 2018.  For a number of ETBs, we were able to complete the 2015 audit process from commencement on site to my clearance of the file for signing in a timeframe of six to 12 weeks.  By comparison, however, in the case of Louth-Meath ETB, the audit process has already continued for more than 15 months.  We understand the ETB is in contact with the Department and SOLAS about certain issues we raised and we now expect to be able to complete that audit early in the new year.<\/p><p> We have prepared a similar table to give an overview of progress to date in relation to the production of audited 2016 financial statements.  Again, I ask for that to be brought up on screen.  The table gives the picture as of last Friday as to where we are with the individual audits.  The table indicates that a number of ETBs have moved closer to meeting the statutory submission date for their draft financial statements.  Already for 2016, three ETBs have audited financial statements while two more will be completed in the next few days.  We expect that the financial statements of six further ETBs will be signed off by the end of the year.  That leaves five ETBs which are likely to be in an arrears position for 2016 at the end of 2017.<\/p><p> My office recognised early on that there were significant challenges for the Department and ETBs in putting in place effective accounting and financial reporting systems for the sector.  Our main focus has, naturally, been on the format of financial statements and advancing the timeliness of certification of financial statements.  We were represented on the financial reporting working group for the sector and we are in regular contact with the Department about the current status of audits within the sector and to discuss any emerging sectoral issues or concerns.  We also meet with ETB senior managers as a group in ETB Ireland forums.  Members may wish to note that the reform process for the ETBs is still ongoing.  During 2016, the corporate structure of most of the ETBs was enhanced with the appointment of three new senior posts at director level.  The directors have responsibility for specific broad areas, including further education, organisation support and development, and schools.  In line with the Government's public service reform plan, a number of back office functions in ETBs are planned to move to a shared services model.  The first function to be transferred is payroll and this is expected to happen over the next six months.  The Secretary General will be able to provide the committee with an update on progress of these reforms.  I will introduce the blocks for each of the ETBs as it is called.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017111600002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510822800,"counter":265,"content":"<p>I call Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; to make his opening statement, which I ask him to keep to under ten minutes.

Through a series of Government decisions, 33 VECs were amalgamated into 16 ETB in July 2013 and SOLAS was established as the new further education and training authority in October 2013 to provide strategic direction, co-ordination and funding to the further education and training sector.  The reduction from 33 to 16 entities gives better scale for the delivery of education services in an efficient manner.  The reform also brings better cohesion to the further education and training sector and enables it to be transformed into a strong and vibrant fourth pillar of education and training.  This is one of the most ambitious reform programmes occurring throughout the public service and it involves transformational change including the disbandment of the VECs and F&Aacute;S, the mergers of former VECs through the establishment of ETBs and the transfer of training functions from SOLAS to the ETB sector.  It is also the case that positioning ETBs to respond effectively to demand for well-designed and high quality education and training programmes involves significant and ongoing organisational change within and between ETBs and ETB Ireland and increased interaction with bodies such as SOLAS and Qualifications and Quality Assurance Ireland.  In addition to managing significant change, the ETBs, along with SOLAS, have played a key role in our economic recovery.  Many ETBs are also involved in developing and delivering new apprenticeships and traineeships and supporting the upskilling of people in employment.  Mr. Paul O&rsquo;Toole, chief executive of SOLAS, will outline the further education and training reform programme in more detail.<\/p> <p>  I take this useful opportunity to clarify for the committee the role of Education and Training Boards Ireland, or ETBI, which is recognised in legislation as the national representative body for the 16 ETBs to enable it to provide a single voice for the sector in its engagement with the Department and others.  This single voice for the sector was particularly important in helping to work successfully through the transition from VECs to ETBs and the integration of training functions.<\/p><p>The Department engages and works closely with ETBI on a number of fronts particularly in relation to the implementation of the ETB reform programme and the development of shared services.  Another important aspect of the reform programme is the introduction of the payroll and finance shared services projects for the sector.  Payroll and finance are operated at individual ETB level using outdated systems which results in inefficiencies and duplication and is a contributory factor to the delays in completing accounts in time.  A robust project governance model has been put in place to develop shared services for both the payroll and financial services needs of all ETBs.  This will be a transformational change for the sector.  As part of this process, the Department had significant engagement with a range of Government offices prior to initiating the tender process for the payroll shared services solution.  These tenders are currently being evaluated.  The ETBs will be migrated into shared services in three waves to commence early next year and with a target to have fully migrated all ETBs to payroll shared services by the fourth quarter of 2019.  The finance shared services project is currently drafting the request for tender with a plan to publish in the second quarter of 2018.  The target is to have fully migrated all ETBs to finance shared services in 2020.<\/p><p> It is not satisfactory that ETBs have not finalised their accounts within the required timescales.  Several factors have contributed to this.  The transition from VECs to ETBs, including the transfer in of training functions, centres and employees, represented a momentous restructuring of the sector and was a major contributing factor in the delay in producing accounts in most cases.  The most significant issues can be categorised as relating to systems or human resources capacity.  Some of these are still live and will take time to fully work through.  They include compatibility issues arising from the variety of IT and financial systems in operation in former VECs and in former F&Aacute;S training centres; connectivity at server level between centres within an ETB; the added complexity arising from the transfer of training functions; the 18 month period for the first set of accounts; the impact of the moratorium on recruitment in the public sector; and the need for ETB staff to support the development of a number of shared services and other sectoral reforms.<\/p><p> I have provided members with a graph to give a visual representation of the progress made by ETBs over the past three years in relation to getting their accounts submitted to the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The statutory deadline in the ETB for submission of accounts to the Comptroller and Auditor General for audit is 1 April in the year following the period of account.  There has been progress in the timing of submission of accounts and this is encouraging.  While just two ETBs submitted their 2016 accounts by the 1 April deadline, a further eight ETBs improved the date of submission of their 2016 accounts compared to 2015.  The progress made over the past three years can also be assessed by the average time it took ETBs to submit their accounts.  It took ETBs an average of about ten and a half months to submit their initial 2013-14 accounts.  This average reduced to about eight months for the 2015 and was reduced to about six months for 2016 based on 14 of the 16 which have been done to date.  However, further improvements need to be made and efforts redoubled to ensure that, as we move out of the period of establishment and restructuring of the sector, all ETBs comply with the deadline.<\/p><p> The Department is very concerned about the delays in relation to ETB accounts.  These delays are not acceptable and the Department is working closely with the ETB sector and through its regular engagement with officials in the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General in order to ensure that statutory timelines can be achieved.  The Department has tried to address challenges and reduce delays by focusing on two key areas, namely, improvements in systems and in staffing.  In relation to systems improvements, the long-term plan, in line with public sector reform, is to move the ETB payroll and finance systems to a shared services model.  While this is in progress, a significant number of interim measures have been implemented by the Department in co-operation with the sector to supplement the existing systems.  These interim measures included merging of systems and supporting ETBs by the provision of additional functionality, all of which are helping the ETB sector to reduce delays.  Other non-IT related system improvements include supporting reconfiguration of functions in ETBs; strengthening the internal audit function; supporting the work of the audit and finance committees through the provision of briefing sessions for committee members; working with ETBs and the Comptroller and Auditor General on the format of the accounts; regular meetings with individual ETBs on staffing and financial matters; strengthening the role of ETBI in supporting the ongoing ETB reform programme; professional advice and support to individual ETBs by the Department&rsquo;s accountant; and regular liaison with the Comptroller and Auditor General, and consequently with ETBs, regarding the timing of submission of accounts and issues arising during audits.<\/p><p> In relation to personnel improvements, this involved strengthening the senior management team in the ETB sector; filling of critical vacancies; additional support for Mayo Sligo Leitrim ETB to enable it to catch up with the submission of accounts to the Comptroller and Auditor General; and close engagement with ETBI in relation to the phase two organisation design project which will provide a robust framework for assessing staffing requirements in the ETB sector over the short to medium term.  Considerable work is being done by the Department, ETBI and at individual ETB level to ensure ETBs are better positioned to meet their statutory obligations in relation to the submission and completion of their annual accounts.  I will be happy to discuss this in more detail as well as other queries the committee might have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017111600002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510822800,"counter":268,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;.

During 2016 SOLAS provided a net &euro;538.2 million in funding to education and training boards, ETBs, to support its provision of a suite of further education and training opportunities to more than 300,000 learner beneficiaries.  This provision was delivered to meet learner, enterprise and community needs and opportunities across the full spectrum of further education and training.  For example, an estimated 14,000 learners undertook specific skills courses in areas with employment opportunities and more than 40,000 learners received support to improve their literacy and numeracy.<\/p> <p>  The delivery of this provision took place against the backdrop of the wide-ranging and continuing reform of the further education and training sector.  Since the establishment of SOLAS in late 2013 and the transfer of training responsibilities and associated resources to education and training boards during 2014, SOLAS has worked with education and training boards and in conjunction with the Department of Education and Skills to improve further education and training in Ireland.  A body of reforms and improvement programmes have been initiated, are completed or are in train.  We expect this process to continue. <\/p> <p>  The ultimate objective of the reform of the further education and training, FET, sector is to achieve better, measurable improvements to the outcomes for FET learners in terms of their employability, their progression to other further or higher education options, and their participation in life-long learning, as well as societal equity for those experiencing disadvantage in this respect.  The achievement of these goals will yield demonstrable benefits to employers seeking employees with FET level skills, as well as benefits for communities in general.  In pursuit of this reform programme a range of measures have been put in place and are being implemented.  Details of these have been provided in the briefing note for today&rsquo;s meeting and my colleagues and I will be happy to provide further detail or clarification as may be required by the committee. <\/p> <p>  While SOLAS does not have a role in the institutional governance of education and training boards as statutory bodies in their own right, we clearly understand and accept our responsibilities in respect of the grants provided by SOLAS to the ETBs.  We adopt a multi-layered approach in respect of the governance and oversight of the funding we provide.  Key elements of this approach include the preparation and issue by SOLAS of a national parameters and guidelines&rsquo; document to each ETB which sets out a framework of requirements arising from policy objectives of the Department of Education and Skills and other Departments, together with a range of reporting and other requirements.  These policy instruments include the action plan for education 2016 to 2019; the further education and training strategy 2014 to 2019; the national skills strategy 2025; the action plan for jobs; pathways to work; and a number of social inclusion polices such as the comprehensive employment framework for people with disabilities. <\/p> <p>  ETBs are requested to develop a proposed response to the above in respect of their catchment areas and taking into account local conditions.  They are provided with an initial financial &lsquo;envelope&rsquo; to assist planning.  Actual financial allocations are not confirmed until the end of the process.  This approach seeks to combine a top-down approach reflecting national priorities with a bottom-up approach which reflects local needs and opportunities.  Further steps will be outlined later in this statement.  On completion of the planning process, which involves significant interaction between SOLAS and ETBs, individual service plans are agreed for the provision of FET activities in each ETB and combined to produce an annual FET services plan.  The SOLAS board approves this plan and the individual block grant to each ETB.  A detailed review of expenditure and activity is carried out mid-year, in May; at the end of the third quarter, in September;  and at year end, in December.  ETBs declare funding which is no longer required or may seek additional funding.  Their grant allocations are then adjusted accordingly and with board approval.<\/p><p>This is within the financial year in question and subsequently.  This ensures that SOLAS and education and training boards, ETBs, apply the claw back principles envisaged under the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Circular 13\/2014.<\/p><p> The reporting process is subject to a significant level of review.  SOLAS receives an annual, formal, declaration regarding further education and training, FET,   expenditure from each ETB,  which is signed by its CEO and finance officer.  This confirms that all funds received by the ETBs have been spent appropriately and in line with requirements, terms and conditions by SOLAS.  ETBs also provide their final audited accounts and these are used for review and final reconciliation purposes by SOLAS, comparing previous returns with the audited accounts and making any final funding adjustments that may be required.<\/p><p> SOLAS is represented on the ETB internal audit committee and has access to relevant findings and reports in respect of further education and training.  SOLAS participates on the ETB-SOLAS programme management board operated by the Department of Education and Skills and also contributes to a number of specific projects being undertaken by the programme management office.<\/p><p> While very substantial progress has been achieved since 2014 in the reform of further education and training, SOLAS recognises that the process of reform must continue.  A series of enhancements to improve the effectiveness of further education and training, through its continual improvement, are in train and include the introduction of new strategic performance agreements with ETBs, a revised funding model and the adoption of appropriate outcome targets. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017111600002#O02900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul O'Toole","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510822800,"counter":375,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Toole for that.

This is a potential cost to the State if it loses and in terms of legal fees etc.  In this context, there are Department circulars, such as Circular 59\/09 which deals with complaints around teacher competence and Circular 99\/08 which relates to sick leave.

We then had the universities in and we did a special report, late last year and earlier this year, and we will be returning to that.  We did that because, just like the ETB sector, we were seeing that they were outliers.<\/p> <p>  Today we have the ETBs in because there is a significant lag in time in presenting accounts and having accounts audited to the point that it is very difficult for us to do the job that we are asked to do on the Committee of Public Accounts because the information is so out of date.

I have got to say that for me is incredibly concerning.<\/p> <p>  When we look at the ETBs for example, and the witness has given us a lot of reasons, and I completely understand that there are amalgamations and changes, and when one is trying to amalgamate different financial management systems that poses problems in addition to the backdrop of human resources and all of the rest of it.  However, some of these ETBs were not amalgamated.  There was continuity.  One cannot say that all of the issues are down to amalgamations, but the same profile is there.  What kind of sanctions are imposed in the Department for not conforming with the production of accounts in a timely way?

Of the overall expenditure of &euro;1.9 million, payments of more than &euro;400,000 were made to one company that was formed by a person who had worked part-time in the VEC.  The then chief executive officer of the VEC at the time claimed that the details of tenders could not be located but he was satisfied that the procurements requirements had been followed and the documents were probably misfiled.  As Deputy MacSharry said, the Department circular states that in the VEC sector that competitive tendering is the normal process.  The Comptroller and Auditor General's report at the time states that the Department will continue to insist on adherence to proper procurement practices in VECs and reminds VECs of their obligations in that regard.

There is a big spend in each ETB,   The reason we have representatives of the ETBs before us today is that some of them are performing very well in audits and are up to date.  I can hold up Carlow-Kilkenny ETB in my area as an example.  I am delighted it has submitted its audits for 2015 and 2016.  It is leading the way in that respect.  However, there are other ETBs that have not completed accounts for 2015 or 2016.  It is now 2017 and we are heading into 2018.  Is is fair that some ETBs are making an effort to be up to date in their audits and to keep in line with the system, while other ETBs are not doing so?  These ETBs are looking for money for 2018 and we have not seen how the money they were allocated has been spent in 2015, not to mention 2016 or 2017.  That is not right.  I am self-employed and if I did not submit my accounts by the end of last month, I would incur a surcharge from the taxman and would have to pay through the nose.  Why are we allocating taxpayers' money to people who are not performing and not submitting audits?  How does the Department know what way they are performing or spending their allocated money when it does not have audits to prove it is being spent?  The Comptroller and Auditor General has not looked at some of their books.  We do not know what is happening in them when they have not provided audits.  This is a big mistake and a penalty should be imposed on boards that do not come up with their figures and submit their audits.  If they were only paid on a quarterly basis until they submitted their audits, perhaps they would up their game.  Any corporations or bodies should be preparing audits and showing how they are spending the money they have been allocated.  It is a significant amount of taxpayers' money.  The details of the way it is being spent should be before us for us to scrutinise on behalf of the people who are paying their taxes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017111600002#V00400","speaker":"1368"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510822800,"counter":632,"content":"<p>I share the Deputy's concern about the delay in having the accounts both submitted to and processed by the Comptroller and Auditor General.

In terms of systems issues, with the bringing of former VECs together with different systems, there was a good deal of recoding manual work to be done at individual ETB level and the bringing in of the training function brought in another management system that had to be integrated to enable them to complete their first set of accounts.  There was quite a significant amount of networking, improved IT systems and the strengthening of those, which was a key challenge.  That remains a challenge but good progress has been made in terms of stabilising systems and improving them to a point whereby the shared service model that is coming down the tracks will be the real modern solution to those.<\/p> <p>  The other area was personnel challenges. The ETBs, like many other areas throughout the public service, were affected by the Government's moratorium on recruitment and some individual ETBs were hit harder than others in terms of how that moratorium impacted.  It would have affected a loss of expertise in particular areas.  That was a difficult challenge to manage in a small ETB office.  With respect to what we have done for the sector, we have strengthened the senior management team with the appointment of directors.  That is a big support to the chief executives.  Additionally, we have put processes in place to fill critical vacancies.  In the period since 2015, 2016 and to date in 2017, we have enabled ETBs to fill about 100 critical vacancies spread across the ETBs - these are critical areas within their head office - to enable them to meet their obligations.  In fairness to the sector, it is not for the want of trying.  A lot of good work happens in the ETB sector.  We are seeing the benefits that have come from the senior management teams that were put in place in 2016 and the critical vacancies were filled in terms of the improvements in timelines in getting accounts done.

At the end of the year, each ETB provides a balancing statement for its further education and training expenditure.  Each board outlines each programme and all the boards give us funding reconciliations in respect of those figures.  We use these to determine the final allocation for the year, that is, any adjustments, moneys to be handed back or whatever.

I will just finish this one point.  I have three or four more points to make before I let Deputy Kelly in with his question for Mr. O'Toole.  Mr. Loftus has given an answer that is not acceptable to the Committee of Public Accounts.  The question I put to Mr. Loftus and indeed to the Secretary General concerned requests received by the Department for staff to deal with this issue, and in answer to this Mr. Loftus raised the parameters of affordability and comparability.  The first thing he should have addressed, however, was the need to meet statutory duties.  Mr. Loftus did not name the meeting of statutory duty as one of his criteria; it does not seem to have applied here.  Neither Mr. Loftus nor the Secretary General has the freedom to put statutory duties to one side.  We cannot just forget about our statutory duties; we cannot afford it.  What I am saying to the Department of Education and Skills today is that it has statutory duties.  The first job of a public body is to meet its statutory duties, and not because these might be affordable or comparable to someone next door.  The Department thus needs to reconsider the criteria under which it considers requests.  Where there is a statutory duty, the first duty of a public body is to meet that duty.  That did not feature here.   The proof of this is in the fact that this year to date only two of the ETBs met their statutory duty to submit their accounts for 2016.  This is why we are helping the Department ensure the ETBs meet their statutory duties for 2017 by early 2018.  Does Mr. Loftus get my point?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017111600002#Y02000","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510822800,"counter":748,"content":"<p>I do.

The Committee of Public Accounts, along with the entire public of the Republic of Ireland, are sick and tired of the lack of accountability in the public service.  We see it in finance; banks; the HSE; the ETBs; and in education.  The Committee of Public Accounts no longer has any latitude in these matters.  If a body is obliged to meet a statutory obligation then it will meet it.  Members of the public rightly condemn the national Parliament for letting some people off the hook and not others.  If there is a statutory duty then it is to be met: it is not negotiable.<\/p> <p>  If one of the things that a Committee for Public Accounts can achieve in national Parliament is to make public bodies accountable, then we will have done a good day's work.  Others can do as they choose.  I think the witnesses will understand, however, that we reflect the public mood here and we cannot stand over claims that it does not matter if accounts are sent in a year late.  The Department stood over this but this Committee for Public Accounts will not.  I am giving a strong message here, and I say to the Department of Education and Skills, and to the ETBs under its aegis, that they should use this committee as grounds for coming the heavy on matters like this one.  The Department should use us; we do not mind if the Department is telling the ETBs that that Se&aacute;n Fleming fellow is on its case about this.

I ask Mr. O'Toole to send an update in writing to the committee on the status of that next week.<\/p> <p>  Pages 70 and 71 of the accounts have the title, Direct Provision of Funding (Further Education Grants) - Breakdown of Grants by Programme as Reported by the Education and Training Boards.  I ask Mr. O'Toole to explain the rationale; he may need to send me something on the criteria.  I look at the post-leaving certificate courses.  Kilkenny and Carlow ETB got &euro;245,000 for PLC courses, but Laois and Offaly, an ETB of the same size, only got &euro;92,000.  If I move across the column and look at Youthreach, Kilkenny and Carlow ETB only drew down &euro;911,000 for Youthreach, whereas Laois and Offaly ETB drew down &euro;2.439 million.  They are vastly different figures for areas of similar populations and similar urban-rural breakdown.  It is not just those and I ask Mr. O'Toole to explain the rationale for deciding which ETBs get big money for PLCs and which get big money for Youthreach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017111600002#AA00100","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510822800,"counter":790,"content":"<p>When the ETBs were established, they were, obviously, an amalgamation of VECs.  This is my understanding rather than detailed knowledge.  VECs developed over time and the nature of their specific provision in each VEC grew up based on local considerations.  Some might have a Youthreach centre and some might have a PLC college or whatever.  The distribution of PLC places is reflected in our contribution to them.  There is an overall cap on places in place.  They are distributed largely in proportion to the existing PLC colleges - in other words, the colleges exist.  They provide the PLC places and we are one portion of their funding.  My answer in the round is that there is an historical network of various facilities around ETBs which grew up over time within each VEC and now ETB.<\/p> <p>  That is the as-is situation.  Going forward, we are systematically evaluating each of those major programmes, using a socio-economic model.  We are looking at the current state of those programmes and how they might be approved going forward.  The big-ticket one is the PLC.  We have completed our review of that and we had objective independent economic advice in doing so.  We have proposed a series of improvements - a programme of improvements - to the Department of Education and Skills.  We would hope, on getting that approval, to move progressively towards, if one likes, ensuring the PLC provision is delivering.<\/p> <p>  A simple way of looking at it is as follows.  I am from County Wicklow.  There is no training centre in County Wicklow, but there is one in Loughlinstown and it might serve a bigger catchment than in a particular area.  It is a similar picture on Youthreach.  We are currently evaluating the Youthreach programme with exactly the same lens on it - how we can make sure these programmes are optimised for the future.  We are in process with that at the moment.  We will bring forward whatever recommendations we have in due course for policy decisions with the Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017111600002#AA00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul O'Toole"},{"type":"speech","time":1510822800,"counter":791,"content":"<p>The Youthreach figure for Louth and Meath is &euro;5 million whereas the Youthreach figure for the city of Dublin is only &euro;9 million.

The City of Dublin Education and Training Board, CDETB, was established on 1 July 2013, replacing the former City of Dublin VEC.  It is a large and diverse organisation with an overall estimated budget of &euro;588 million and a staff of approximately 3,200.  CDETB provision includes second level education, very large post leaving certificate, PLC, courses and vocational training and opportunities scheme, VTOS, provision, two training centres and ten Youthreach centres.  We provide education services to more than 2,000 prisoners in seven prisons, part-time programmes for adults up to Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI, level 6 delivered in more than 80 centres in the city and a wide range of specialist projects.  We also fund 13 community training centres.<\/p> <p>  CDETB, through its youth services board, CDYSB, delivers, funds and supports a wide range of community organisations to develop and deliver youth work services.  CDETB has been at the forefront of innovation from the original work in the curriculum development unit to the development of PLC provision and QQI programmes.  We continue to develop new programmes in partnership with industry and third level institutions.  These include maths as part of science, technology, engineering and mathematics, STEM, a QQI level 5 course in digital media production and new programmes in ICT and construction and, through our international projects, technology enhanced learning, work-based learning and blended learning.  Recently, we have been involved in the development of two new apprenticeships in accounting technician and commis chef, now being delivered in three of our further education colleges.  We are also leading the development of three further apprenticeships and two traineeships.<\/p> <p>  Since 2012, the Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, unit of CDETB has replaced 66 former grant awarding authorities in the provision of a centralised student grants administration function.  Handling more than 100,000 grant applications annually and awarding more than 80,000 student grants, SUSI administers approximately &euro;365 million in student grant funding, has annual administration costs of approximately &euro;8.5 million and an approved staffing complement of 100.  With grant payments to more students now commencing earlier each year, and with more than 95% of all grant applications now processed and paid before Christmas, SUSI continues to meet and exceed its key performance targets for the timely processing of grant applications and for the payment of awarded grants.<\/p> <p>  CDETB has adopted the code of best practice for governance as set out by the Department of Education and Skills.  The board has 20 members and holds an average of ten meetings each year.  The audit and finance committees meet as required by the Act and also report to the board.  CDETB has a strong risk management structure and a strong system of internal control.  In compliance with the ethics Acts, CDETB board members and designated staff provide annual disclosures of interests.<\/p> <p>  The 2016 budget for CDETB was approximately &euro;585 million, an increase of 200% over the 2010 CDVEC budget of &euro;190 million.  The significant budget increase over this period was due in the main to the set up of the new SUSI unit in 2012 and the transfer of two Dublin F&Aacute;S training centres on 1 January 2014.  In 2014, the payment of Department of Education and Skills scholarships and bursaries, to the value of approximately &euro;4 million, transferred to SUSI.  The total value of SUSI-related receipts in 2016 was approximately &euro;394 million and the training centres accounted for a further &euro;46 million of the budget total.<\/p> <p>  Until 2016 no additional staff had been assigned to the CDETB head office finance department as a result of this significant increase in operational activity, but the broadening of functions has resulted in an increased demand for senior staff management and oversight.  The completion of the annual financial statements on a timely basis continues to be a key priority.  Despite significant challenges facing the organisation over recent years, CDETB has, since 2012, continued to produce draft accounts for audit by the middle of the year immediately following the accounting period, and they have been signed off by the Comptroller and Auditor General before the end of the year.  However, the running of the operational areas of the finance department in a time of significant change and scarce staff resources has also been prioritised so as to ensure that all CDETB staff, trainees, students and suppliers are paid.  The 1 April statutory deadline for submission of draft accounts for audit has not been achievable to date by the organisation.  However, we are committed to bringing forward the date for submission of the draft accounts to the Comptroller and Auditor General to an earlier date.<\/p> <p>  Since 2013, CDETB has gone through a significant process of change.  We successfully made this transition and we have maintained and grown our services notwithstanding a net reduction of more than 60 administrative staff due to the public service staff moratorium.  CDETB continues to engage with industry to open up employment opportunities for students and to ensure that the programmes offered are relevant to the skills needs of employers.  Over the years, CDETB has developed a wide range of progression routes from its colleges to third level institutions.  CDETB's strategic vision is to deliver a high quality provision for all its learners in line with QQI guidelines and it is committed to further developing its systems to enhance the central oversight of its provision and to lead proactively the continuing advances required at a time of change and development.  It aims always to respond to student and learner needs and to fully engage its staff in the change management process.  The pathways to achieve these changes are set out in our strategy plan for 2015 to 2020 and in our quality assurance procedures continuous improvement plan of 2017.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017111600002#LL00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Carol Hanney"},{"type":"speech","time":1510822800,"counter":852,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Hanney and I will now ask Ms Cynthia Deane to make her opening statement on behalf of Kilkenny and Carlow ETB.

As chief executive, I take very seriously my role as the accountable person under the ETB legislation, and I acknowledge the committee&rsquo;s role in ensuring that public services are run efficiently and achieve value for money.  I am pleased to have an opportunity to make a brief opening statement to the committee and I will give a quick summary of three main points, namely, our ETB services, developments since 2013 and our approach to preparing financial statements.<\/p> <p>  I will start with very brief information about Kilkenny and Carlow Education and Training Board, KCETB.  Our ETB caters for the needs of 25,000 learners in 14 schools and colleges and 30 further education and training centres across the counties of Carlow and Kilkenny.  We reach into towns, villages and rural communities from Hacketstown on the Carlow and Wicklow border to Ferrybank in south Kilkenny on the outskirts of Waterford city.  We have approximately 1,200 staff on our payroll and our annual budget is in the region of &euro;53 million.<\/p> <p>  I will now discuss the main developments in KCETB since it was formed in 2013 following the amalgamation of Kilkenny and Carlow VECs.  After the amalgamation of the two county VECs in July 2013, KCETB had three main aims.  We wanted to maintain continuity of services, uphold good standards of governance and minimise the risk of failure in critical areas of administration.  These aims were all achieved, thanks to the commitment of all staff and especially our administration team leaders, who made it possible for the ETB to maintain high standards of service and minimise disruption to our learners and staff.<\/p><p>One of the ways we maintained continuity of services involved reorganising and rationalising the work of the Carlow and Kilkenny office so that our ETB head office functions are carried out between the two locations.  Since 2013 we have integrated and improved administration systems across the two offices.  We have implemented a new code of governance, we have harmonised policies and procedures across the ETB, we have merged computer systems and installed a shared ICT network operating between the two centres, and we have integrated the training services from March 2016.<\/p><p> During the transition period our services not only continued uninterrupted, we also prepared for significant growth and reform.  Since 2013 enrolment in our schools has grown and we have undertaken a number of building projects to extend our capacity and refurbish our facilities to meet demand.  We had, for example, a major extension in the Abbey Community College in Ferrybank and we are about to open a new campus in Carlow, which will house 2,000 learners in state-of-the-art teaching and learning facilities.<\/p><p>  I shall now turn to the preparation of annual accounts.  We give priority to the preparation of annual accounts by the relevant deadline.  This has been achieved in recent years because of a number of critical factors.  We have robust and efficient systems for regular checking of income and expenditure throughout the year.  All our school principals, senior managers and administrative staff co-operate fully to routinely carry out this.  We invest considerable staff resources in the preparation of the annual accounts in the first quarter of the year.  We also make effective use of our ICT system to support the annual accounts process.<\/p><p> I hope I have managed to give the committee an overview of our operation in the Kilkenny-Carlow Education and Training Board, and a sense of how we try to make a positive difference for the people in our two counties.  Out of a total population of 156,000 people in the two counties the KCETB has 25,000 participants in our education and training services.  This is one in six people of all ages, or one quarter of the people who are aged 12 to 65,  in the two counties.  In other words, an average of one person in every household in Kilkenny and Carlow is accessing our services.  The average cost is &euro;776 per head per annum. In everything we do we try to achieve a balance between competing demands and priorities.  As public service managers we try to do things right and we try to be efficient.  As educators we try to do the right things and be effective for our learners.  As the chief executive, it is my goal to ensure that KCETB is doing the right things right.  I thank the committee for its attention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017111600002#LL00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Cynthia Deane","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510822800,"counter":855,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Deane for her opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017111600002#MM00200","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1510822800,"counter":856,"content":"<p>I thank all the witnesses for coming in to speak to the committee this afternoon.

We currently integrate SAP into our SunSystem for our annual accounts.  That causes part of the delay in preparing the accounts.  The idea behind finance shared services is basically to have one finance system for each ETB.  It will be operated out of a shared services centre, with the 16 ETBs each having their own company in the shared services.  The main areas for processing will be the accounts payable, which will be quite labour intensive, and a general ledger function.  There will be a lot of input from the schools and centres under the shared services model.  It is very important that a lot of training would be given right across the board and not only to head office staff, which is where the core finance function currently is.

There was a very short lead-in time of only two weeks as opposed to eight weeks.  The training centre had not been completely briefed and was not completely on top of it when it was introduced.  There were anomalies in correspondence.  There was confusion about phase numbers.

As soon as the payments were identified, measures were put in place to contact the apprentices and seek recoupment.  At this stage, the apprentices had finished in the training centre and many efforts were put into contacting them in different ways but it was unsuccessful.

Bagenalstown is a small town and about 25 years ago it had three schools.  Many Irish towns were the same, with the nuns, the brothers and the tech, as it was called.  There was a Department proposal to amalgamate all three into a community school but the two religious congregations, the De La Salle Brothers and the Presentation order, decided they did not want a community school.  They made an amalgamated secondary school for the boys and girl and the vocational school was left as a stand-alone school.  It was a second school in a small town attempting to maintain its enrolment.  Over a number of years the school struggled to fill with first year enrolments.  It tried to reinvent itself on several occasions by bringing in more PLC students, more adult learners on a part-time basis and introducing more programmes for people with special needs and disabilities.  However, in 2015, we in the executive examined the enrolment pattern over a number of years and discovered that eight students were enrolled for first year for that coming September.  We had a consultant examine the matter and the recommendation was that, as it was a small number, the school was not sustainable or viable at that stage.  We established a task force to examine the issue in more detail and to determine what approaches we might take.  The outcome of the task force was that the school should attempt to review its enrolment and try to expand its catchment to attract more students to the school.  It has also rebranded and is now called Col&aacute;iste Andrew.

In 2015, the ETB had receipts of &euro;42 million, matching payments of &euro;42 million.  Just under &euro;31 million was received from the Department and &euro;8 million from SOLAS.

It manages 11 second-level schools and one special school, St. Joseph's detention centre, Ferryhouse, Clonmel.  In addition, it operates extensive further education and training programmes and has youth officers in both north and south Tipperary supporting the development of youth services.  In total, Tipperary ETB manages 30 buildings including schools, further education and training centres and administration offices.  The two offices are the headquarters in Nenagh and the designated sub-office in Clonmel, the result of a ministerial decision.  The distance between the two offices is 90 km, a 180 km round trip.  There is no administration office in Thurles.<\/p> <p>  In 2016, Tipperary ETB managed a budget of &euro;50.6 million.  The main elements of this budget were schools and administration, &euro;32 million, further education and training &euro;13.7 million, youth services &euro;0.6 million, capital funding &euro;1.8 million, other programmes &euro;2.5 million.  By far the largest element of our expenditure is staff pay costs.  For the last full financial year, 2016, these costs were almost &euro;35 million.  The full-year expenditure in 2017 will be approximately &euro;55 million.<\/p> <p>  County Tipperary has a population of just fewer than 160,000.  It is the sixth largest and the largest inland county.  Population growth in recent years has been modest and below the national average.  Traditionally, north Tipperary has been aligned with the mid-west region and south Tipperary with the south east.  This requires participation in regional boards in both areas.  Estimated unemployment stands at approximately 9.3% against a national figure of 7.5%.<\/p> <p>  Several significant milestones have been achieved since the amalgamation in 2013.  The highlights include the transfer of training services for the county from both Waterford and Wexford ETB and Limerick and Clare ETB in March 2016; the opening of the new &euro;12 million public private partnership, PPP, school at Comeragh college, Carrick-on-Suir in 2016; and the opening of the new &euro;1 million extension to Borrisokane community college recent weeks.  In each year, the financial statements have been signed by the Comptroller and Auditor General within the following 12 months.  Unqualified Comptroller and Auditor General audit reports have issued since amalgamation.  There has been a successful amalgamation of the two former VECs, including the merger of the financial database and the establishment of network connectivity between the two offices.  We have also implemented a robust risk management process including focused staff training.<\/p> <p>  During 2016, Tipperary ETB employed 1,200 staff.  This includes full-time and part-time teachers, tutors, special needs assistants, caretakers, cleaners and administrative staff.  This year Tipperary ETB provides education services across the county to 4,708 students at second level and post leaving certificate, 9,809 people in further education, 662 people in training, and 583 people in part-time\/night classes.  Our 90 post leaving certificate courses are provided at eight locations at levels five and six.  Enrolments in schools and post leaving certificate courses in 2017 have increased by 4.6% since 2016.<\/p> <p>  The main achievements since the amalgamation have been to maintain continuity, uphold standards of corporate governance and minimise risks of failure.  The draft accounts produced by Tipperary ETB for 31 December 2014 were submitted to the Comptroller and Auditor General on 19 September 2015 and the final sign-off was 31 December 2015.  The draft accounts for the year to 31 December 2015 were submitted to the Comptroller and Auditor General on 23 September 2016 and the final sign-off was on 16 December 2016.  Our 2016 accounts will be signed off in the next day or so, or even possibly this evening.<\/p> <p>  At the end of 2016, the two databases of the former VECs were merged following the completion of the government network connection between the two offices.  The 2016 accounts were the first set to be produced from the amalgamated database.  Since 2013, priority has been given to producing the V15 in as timely a manner as possible.  In each year, Tipperary ETB has had it statements signed by the Comptroller and Auditor General within the following year.  In common with other ETBs which use the Manser\/ESI system, production of the V15 is largely a manual exercise using Excel spreadsheets.  The board and the finance and audit committee are continually updated on the expenditure throughout the year.  This year will be the first set of accounts to be produced from a full year of operating the amalgamated database.  We believe this will lead to a significant improvement in the timeliness of finalising the V15 for 2017.<\/p> <p>  Financial reporting is now managed centrally from the Nenagh office by the finance APO.  All Comptroller and Auditor General audit reports have been unqualified.  The merge of the main financial database was completed in 2016.  The introduction of way-2-pay allowing students and parents to make online payments for books, contributions, tours, etc, has reduced the amount of cash managed by schools.  Tipperary ETB has assumed responsibility for training services including new systems such as SAP, new payment and accounting processes.  An automated system, DCS, is in place for part-time staff to submit their timesheets for payment.  This is being rolled out to additional centres across the county. &middot;A portal is being tested which will allow staff travel claims to be submitted automatically and for staff P60s to be distributed electronically.  The payroll function is being centralised in Clonmel and all other payment processes, creditors, travel, trainee payments, are being centralised in Nenagh in preparation for the move to shared services.<\/p><p>SOLAS introduced the Funding Allocations Request and Reporting, FARR, system and Tipperary ETB has introduced the FARR web application.<\/p><p> In terms of human resources, staff recruitment is managed from one office in Nenagh and the volume of recruitment has ramped up significantly, in particular in the further education and training area.  Some 200 positions were advertised in 2017.  Staff leave is managed and recorded from one office in Clonmel.  Contract conversion for back to education initiative, BTEI, staff is currently in progress under a national initiative of which we are part.  Continuing professional development, CPD, policies are in place that encourage all staff to upskill to meet the changing needs of Tipperary ETB.   Arrangements are in place for part-time staff to join the superannuation scheme and staff training on the single public service pension scheme is ongoing.<\/p><p> As regards corporate services, including capital, procurement and ICT, additional work on freedom of information, FOI, data protection etc. has been taken on in this area and is managed centrally from Nenagh.  All statutory committees are in place and are working effectively.  They are also managed from Nenagh.  Tippeary ETB complies with FOI reporting requirements and this is published on our website.  A comprehensive risk management process is now in place and there is a regular review of risk registers.  Comprehensive training for boards of management and board members has been completed.  Tipperary ETB worked with Education and Training Boards Ireland, ETBI, to upgrade its website utilising the common design template and our site went live last week.  School websites are currently being upgraded and new sites will go live in November 2017.  Office 365 and related cloud-based services are being introduced in schools and further education and training, FET, centres.  Encryption of mobile devices to improve security and comply with data protection is in progress.  Several significant procurement processes have been completed by Tipperary ETB including print services, canteen provision, contracted cleaning, school books and all ICT hardware requirements.  The capital programme includes a combination of major and minor capital works including the provision of new autism spectrum disorder, ASD, facilities, school extensions and various upgrade and repair works.  Capital expenditure in 2016 was &euro;1.8 million.  The VSware administration platform has been introduced in schools.<\/p><p> The revised policy direction and funding model for further education and training resulting from the establishment of SOLAS has been embraced by Tipperary ETB.  These changes have altered the structure of governance, strategy, focus and funding of FET provision.  The integration of FET as a result of the establishment of Tipperary ETB has resulted in improved service provision to learners, the removal of duplication of programme provision and an extension of available course provision.  Following the establishment of SOLAS, Tipperary ETB has fully implemented the additional reporting and other requirements including strategic planning, progress review, monitoring of outcomes, the FARR reporting requirements, adaption of the programme learner support system, PLSS, database and the revised QQI processes.   The transfer of the training services function in March 2016 was a significant event in the history of Tipperary ETB.  Prior to that, training services provided in the county had been managed from either Waterford or Limerick.  With the transfer of training services, there has been an expansion in the volume of courses provided, additional staff have been hired to manage the service and in 2017 Tipperary ETB received sanction from SOLAS to operate national apprenticeship courses for the first time.  Those courses will start in early 2018 and will be based in a new training centre in Thurles.  In our written submission I have given a breakdown of our training programmes and numbers.  The total programme provision is 10,101, including services for refugees and asylum seekers.<\/p><p> Highlights of the current youth services provision include two new sample projects in Cahir and Fethard-Killenaule that were established in 2016-17 with funding of &euro;261,000 from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, DCYA.  They are projects of national significance because that will be the way forward for funding of youth services.  Local youth work equipment grants of &euro;170,000 were allocated to 35 youth groups and 35 youth club groups benefitted from &euro;45,000 under the local youth club grant scheme.  The student leaders congress held in recently in Nenagh College was the first of its kind in the country.  All student leaders in our schools were represented and it provided a forum for us to listen to their voices.  It was the first event of its kind in the country.<\/p><p> In articulating the progress that has been made in Tipperary ETB as outlined above, it is important to note that the staff employed by Tipperary ETB have tirelessly shown their commitment, dedication, adaptability, innovation and perseverance in moving through the most momentous period of change the education and training sector has ever seen.  Our focus in the immediate future will include ongoing improvements in our service delivery including the introduction of new ICT services, managing the impact of shared services on our staff and services, the introduction of new apprenticeships, managing growth in our schools and expanding the scope of services delivered in further education and training.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017111600002#TT00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Fionuala McGeever","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510822800,"counter":1077,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair for inviting us to today's meeting and giving us the opportunity to make this opening statement.  Kildare Wicklow ETB, KWETB, incorporated the former Wicklow VEC and Kildare VEC.  Due to its size and geography, KWETB was established by ministerial order with a main office in Naas and a sub-office in Wicklow town, approximately 95 km apart.  Following extensive discussions with administrative staff and others, we decided to locate the finance function in Wicklow town and the corporate services and human resource functions in Naas in an effort to bring cohesion and efficiency to our operations.  KWETB manages a region that is part of the commuter belt outside the M50 and has experienced significant demographic change over the past five years and continues to expand exponentially.  This generates significant workload and challenges for management.<\/p> <p>  The KWETB service plan budget is &euro;138 million, with &euro;30 million of that allocated to further education and training, an increase of 39% since the amalgamation.  We have a projected capital budget between now and the end of 2018 of &euro;50 million to &euro;70 million.  We have over 2,500 teachers and administrators as per the P35 total.  We have in excess of 13,000 main scheme students, which is an increase of 15% since amalgamation.  We have 16,251 beneficiaries of further education and training, an increase of 29% since amalgamation.  We have issued 27,809 QQI awards since amalgamation.  There are 21 post-primary schools, six community schools and one large stand-alone PLC college of over 1,100 pupils under our remit.  We have recently been engaged in the development of two community national schools that are expanding rapidly and currently cater for 400 pupils.  We have seven Youthreach centres, seven vocational training opportunities scheme, VTOS, centres, two youth officers, one apprenticeship centre and ten adult basic education centres.  I am very proud to say that we piloted an innovative refugee education centre in Kildare town which became the model to be used elsewhere in the country.  I thank the staff who set up that project for their dedication and commitment to supporting the Syrian population in Kildare town.  We have one outdoor education centre.  We have two trainee centres: Newbridge community and training workshop and the Racing Academy and Centre of Education, RACE, and farrier school in Kildare town.  We are one of the largest providers of school completion programmes and have eight under our remit.  We have two prison education centres, operating out of Shelton Abbey and the Midlands Prison in Portlaoise.  We have a music generation project, which is expanding, a sports promotion unit, a music education centre in Bray and five adult guidance services.<\/p><p>We are operating across the entity out of 79 locations, which is a fairly challenging task, but nevertheless as my colleague who spoke previously said, our function is to get out there into the communities and deliver services at local level.  In addition we have 23,000 co-operation hours, as they are known, where we provide local institutions with teaching support services.<\/p><p> I ask members to look at the chart - I will take the highlights out of it -  of our comparative statistics between 2013 and 2016.  Our operational budget, as I said, is up 39%.  The staff pay budget is up 5%.  The whole-time staff equivalent is up 21%.  Post-primary students are up 15.5%.  Post-primary-community national schools are up by 14.2%.  Our FET students are up by 28.9% and our capital project spend is up 90%.<\/p><p> KWETB is delivering large capital projects, land purchase and project management in conjunction with the Department of Education and Skills and other patron bodies.  This is in accordance with the expanded responsibilities under the Education and Training Boards Act 2013.<\/p><p> We are currently delivering on the following major capital projects.  Naas community college is an &euro;18 million project at stage 2B and I hope to have the stage 2B report in the Department next week.  Maynooth community college and Maynooth post primary school are in one campus now in Maynooth.  That project is a &euro;30 million-plus project; it is the largest second level project ever undertaken in the State.  I am proud to state that project is progressing at a rapid rate and hopefully we will have buildings by September 2018.  We have Greystones community national school going into the RAPID programme.  We have St. Conleth's in Newbridge currently under construction.  We have a PPP project, Col&aacute;iste R&aacute;ith&iacute;n in Bray; that is due to hand over, I understand, at the end of the month.<\/p><p> In addition the ETB has progressed eight major capital projects into the 2018 capital building programme.  That was a major challenge in itself.  What it means is that the bulk of the schools in our ETB either have new buildings or will experience new extensions.  KWETB is also providing or managing new start-up schools and extensions to existing schools for other patron bodies including Educate Together, An Foras P&aacute;tr&uacute;nachta, the Church of Ireland and the Diocese of Kildare and Leighlin.  There are a total of nine major capital projects.  Those projects are located in Wicklow town, Bray, three in Naas, two in Kildare town, Templerainey in Arklow and Athy.  That is a significant workload, but we undertook it.  I think there is value for money in the way we approached it in that we are using existing stock of buildings to enable the Department start up these projects in these locations at no cost to the Exchequer.<\/p><p> The other thing to note about the entity when it was formed was that there was no training in KWETB.  When the training function transferred from F&Aacute;S, we were challenged as to how we would deliver training facilities across the entity.  I highlight three in my opening statement.  Marine House is in Wicklow town.  We have now developed a hospitality trainee centre of excellence.  That will deliver the skill sets that are needed and currently in high demand from the hospitality industry.  There is a major deficit there and I think this building and the staff we have put in there will meet the needs in our entity.  I was over there yesterday and I was delighted to see that we have a group of Italian trainers teaching Irish people who are unemployed how to make pizzas.  I asked one question, \"What's the cost of the oven?\"  It was &euro;30,000 supplied from Italy for this project, which is going to roll out a new line of pizza product across the State.  I am delighted to say that with the initiative of our head of training and our head of FET we got that project into Wicklow town.<\/p><p> In conjunction with Intel and FIT, fast-track into technology, we also developed a new mechanical-electronics course in Celbridge.  The significance of that project is that all the trainees from the first cohort were employed directly by Intel.  It has come back to us to train another cohort.  It has asked us to expand that programme into pneumatics and we are currently working on that.  They are innovative new courses.  SOLAS has asked us to develop a centre of excellence to train apprentice electricians and we are dealing with that.<\/p><p> For an organisation or entity that had no training centre, what we are trying to do, as is the board's policy, is to deliver locally and regionally.  I think that policy is working.  I would like to thank the board for supporting it.<\/p><p> We have noted the following challenges.  There is a lack of authority to recruit staff for eight years and consequential lack of expertise.  I would put in there that because of the rate of expansion we have experienced, the shortfall in providing teaching staff is also caught in that statement.  We have a high level of increase in responsibilities with, as I have said, no increase in staff.  I think I have outlined the activity there.  I will not go into the detail, but it is quite significant.<\/p><p> KWETB is a strong organisation in a continuous high-growth situation with student numbers increasing at a rate of 5% per annum.<\/p><p> A key management risk that is identified is the lack of an effective financial information technology system.  I know the Department of Education and Skills, through the PMO is working on that.  I was privileged to chair the payroll shared services committee and still chair it.<\/p><p> I will outline our plans for the delivery of accounts and particularly to address the concern of this committee over the delivery of the accounts on time.  We are working closely with the Comptroller and Auditor General and the ETBI finance forums and will continue to do so over the coming months to ensure on-time delivery of accounts.  On reviewing the Comptroller and Auditor General report to this committee - this was the November 2016 report - I note that KWETB submitted our 2014 accounts.  I think we were the second ETB to do so in that period.  One thing that puzzled me was the length of time it took for the accounts to be processed.  I am only assuming it was because we were also piloting new formats of the accounts for the Department and we were also piloting the merger of our software systems, our financial systems, our payroll systems and our creditor systems on behalf of nine other ETBs.  We were the pilot scheme.  I would like to thank the staff involved in that because it proved to be a very successful project and now we have an integrated system across those nine ETBs, using what is known as the ESI\/Manser system.<\/p><p> I would hope and am confident that draft financial accounts can be produced within the timespan stipulated by statute going forward.  Every effort is being made in-house to ensure that will be the case.  I am confident that next year's set of accounts will be delivered in a timely manner.<\/p><p> KWETB is a dynamic and vibrant organisation prepared to engage and manage the challenges it faces.  It is fortunate that its key operations staff will go the extra mile and continually upskill.  It is committed to the delivery of excellent customer service and corporate governance.  KWETB has operated within its sanctioned budgets and made the adjustments to its expenditure necessary to remain as far as possible within budget, but more importantly even though we had sanctions from the Department and from our own board for borrowings, we have not borrowed since 2012.<\/p><p>The focus is on channels of funding but we also receive funding from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, the Department of Health, Pobal and EU sources.  A significant range of bodies fund the entity, all with different accounting requirements with which we have to deal.<\/p><p> We are educationalists and our primary focus is on the delivery of a first-class education system for our learners.  We must keep them in our sights at all times to ensure we deliver a world-class education service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017111600002#UU00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n Ashe","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510822800,"counter":1080,"content":"<p>Deputies have indicated in the following sequence: Deputy Mary Lou McDonald, Deputy David Cullinane, Deputy Alan Kelly, Deputy Catherine Connolly, Deputy Catherine Murphy and Deputy Bobby Aylward.

When I studied the code of governance for State bodies, it stated comply or explain.  In our case, we would like to explain there were staffing issues.  We do not blame the Department or anybody for this.  We went through a serious recession.  There was an embargo and a moratorium on staff.  The two VECs in Tipperary were merged and we were not given the support we have now, such as a director of organisational support, a director of schools and a director of further education and training.  We had no senior middle management team as such, and we had two financing systems in operation, one in Nenagh and another in Clonmel.  Both of these were manually done through spreadsheets.  We had no high speed connection between the two offices.  We had a serious lack of IT infrastructure and a lack of staff due to the moratorium.  We were also constrained by the 90 km between the offices.<\/p><p>We think we had a fantastic achievement in submitting our accounts in 2015.  I say \"fair play\" to Carlow-Kilkenny ETB because it is an excellent board.  Its final accounts for 2015 were submitted approximately two weeks before our final accounts were submitted.  I know its draft accounts were in by the statutory deadline.  We have been contending with infrastructure and staff deficits.  The 2016 accounts for Kilkenny were submitted two or three weeks ago.  We are told that our accounts will be done tomorrow.  Thanks to the Department, at long last we have the staff and the high-speed interconnection between the offices.

At the same time, we were taking over the training aspect.  We cannot alter the past, but we can try to make the future better.  We are fully committed to ensuring the accounts that are coming up now will be delivered on time.  That was a particularly traumatic period of change.  We were getting to know each other.  Different structures within the system were based on codes and all sorts of things.  Codes X and Y had to be changed to code W to unify them.  All that kind of thing had to be done.  This made it very hard.  The then director of finance outlined to us at various meetings just how difficult this was.  It was a sort of nightmare situation to get it all together.

They were based on the same platform but had a different structure.  The database was amalgamated at the end of 2016.  As we said in our opening statement, 2017 is the first full year of operating on the amalgamated database.  We think that will add to the efficiency of producing the accounts.<br\/><br\/>Two of the other main ICT initiatives were also mentioned in the opening statements.We have introduced a system called<b><\/b>Way 2 Pay,<b><\/b>which allows parents and students to pay contributions online.  The benefit of this lies in taking a lot of cash out of the schools and reducing the amount of money in the school bank account, which was a big objective of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The other initiative is a system called DCS, which allows our part-time staff to claim their hours electronically.  Those two systems have been successful, but there may be tinkering around the edges a little bit.  The main system is the same one that we have had for a number of years.  The big change in the last 12 months is that we have amalgamated the two databases, which will lead to some efficiencies. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017111600002#OOO00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Bermingham"},{"type":"speech","time":1510822800,"counter":1807,"content":"<p>My last question is about the merger of ETBs.

I think it has improved.  The main focus is on the learner, whether they are primary, post-primary or adult.  Going through Kildare and Wicklow ETB's operations, one will find very positive observations on the way the learner is engaged with, the supports we give the learners and the supports we give our staff so that they can support the learners.  That is what it is all about.  I emphasise the efforts that have gone in at school level in particular.  Our schools are the schools of choice in the vast majority of our locations.  That makes its own statement, that is, that the emphasis has been on the delivery of a quality learner experience.  The ethos that we have created is one where students want to go to school, want to be in school and want to learn. That is demonstrated in the reports we get at board level from our schools.<\/p> <p>  At school level, a lot of work goes into analysis and self-evaluation.  We are among the first to bring in self-evaluation at school level, conducted by all parties.  From an efficiency point of view, we are waiting for a fit-for-purpose IT system.  It is taking longer than expected because of the process that must be gone through at national level.   The Secretary General made reference to that in his opening statement.  However, what we have done in-house is to bring in new systems to minimise the workload in trying to account for, as the chairman from Tipperary said, large volumes of cash coming in from schools.  We are trying to eliminate that.  This has spread to nine of the other ETBs.<\/p> <p> Kildare and Wicklow ETB has one of the best records where paying our creditors on time is concerned.  Some 85% of our creditors are paid within a two-week period, which is a fairly high success rate and one of the highest in the country. <\/p> <p>  On the risk register side, we have been able to track systems and reduce many of the risks.  Our insurers tell us that we have brought our claims-to-premium ratio down to 82% or 83%, which is one of the best in the public sector.  The IT systems are needed to track, to see what is going on out there and to give management good, regular updates on the issues as they emerge.  <\/p> <p>  There is an Office of Government Procurement, OGP, procurement taking place for a new purchase-to-pay card system.  As was noted this morning, that will provide an opportunity for the local school to purchase locally, by buying goods in the local supermarket for example .  One of the big criticisms that we have had of the OGP's \"big bang\" approach is that the local supplier lost out.    I hope that the purchase-to-pay card system will bring some needed money back into the local economy, because schools have a lot of relationships and contacts with local providers. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017111600002#OOO01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n Ashe"},{"type":"speech","time":1510822800,"counter":1809,"content":"<p>I thank the witness for telling us that.

Some great work has been done by the ETB in Tipperary.  I see the evidence of that every day.  There are some incredible statistics and people.  However, a number of people who work in its head office have expressed deep concern for many different reasons about the head office and where it is going.  It is not a small number of people.  In particular, concern has been expressed that three of the four senior people in the organisation are not based at the head office.  I would be failing in my duty and would not be comfortable to leave here without raising that issue with the Chair.  I ask that he take it on board.  We are all on a learning curve or whatever the expression is that was used earlier.  These are not just my views, they are the views of several people.  That concern creates a risk in terms of the administration of the ETB, as does the concern that those at the most senior level in the organisation are not based in the head office and very little time is spent there by the chief executive.

The joint committee agreed as part of its work programme for 2017 to review the work of Irish Aid, particularly the overseas development aid programme and the way in which this has been used to date to deliver added value in communities around the world.  Meeting Professor Walsh affords the committee an opportunity to hear from an expert in international development and to discuss the Ireland's performance around international development through Irish Aid.  The committee proposes to report on its findings to both D&aacute;il and Seanad &Eacute;ireann.<\/p><p>The format of the meeting will consist of hearing Professor Walsh's opening statement before going into a question and answer session with the members of the committee.

The invitation to someone from a university is very much appreciated.  I wish to discuss the role of universities in the Irish Aid programme and development work in Africa.  However, I will describe first some context concerning where I am coming from and my experience with the sustainable development goals, SDGs, and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.  It is a very good time to review the Irish Aid programme in light of the fact that the development architecture has changed.<br\/><br\/>I have been working with Professor Jeffrey Sachs in the Earth Institute at Columbia University for well over a decade now.  Members will know him as the special adviser to the United Nations Secretary General on the sustainable development goals, but he is also the director of the UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network, UNSDSN, on which I am a senior adviser.  Members might know some of the products that we have produced lately, like the world happiness report, the SDG dashboard and the SDG academy.<br\/><br\/>I will outline for the committee a little bit about my background with the SDGs and what is called the post-2015 development agenda.  During the period from 2012 to 2014, the UNSDSN had a formal mandate from the then UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, to provide academic and scientific input into the post-2015 development agenda.  This was just one work plan among many, and by the end of 2014, all of the work plans and inputs gathered from both governmental and non-governmental sources were summarised by the UN Secretary General and presented to Ambassador David Donoghue of Ireland and Ambassador Macharia Kamau of Kenya as input into the negotiations.  They were the co-facilitators of the negotiations on the 2030 agenda.<br\/><br\/>I participated in those negotiations as well, not in a Government capacity but as part of one of the major groups, as they are called, this one representing the scientific and technological community.  One of the innovations of that negotiation, about which I will be saying more from an Irish perspective, was the UN major groups.  These were made up of women's' groups, youth groups, indigenous people, trade unions, local authorities, academics, business people, farmers' groups and so on.  They all had a seat at the table.  The major groups had 12 seats and the diplomats had 193 seats.  However, we were able to speak, submit papers, comment, and attend all meetings.  One of my major battles during the whole negotiation was to keep the term &quot;academic&quot; listed as one of the major partnerships or stakeholders that would deliver or implement this agenda. <br\/><br\/>I would now like to define something which will be a challenge for everybody, including Irish Aid.  The duty-bearer for implementing the 2030 agenda is summarised in paragraph 52 of Transforming Our World: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development:<\/p><blockquote>&quot;We the Peoples&quot; are the celebrated opening words of the UN Charter.  It is &quot;We the Peoples&quot; who are embarking today on the road to 2030. Our journey will involve Governments as well as Parliaments, the UN system and other international institutions, local authorities, indigenous peoples, civil society, business and the private sector, the scientific and academic community &ndash; and all people.<\/blockquote> <p>The idea is that we will not get transformative change in societies, governments, private sector or corporations if all people do not buy into this agenda.  People in government, the private sector, universities and civil society must start working together.  This is a theme that I will draw on in some of my comments later.  Coming from a university background, I would like to see universities playing a much more central role in all of the activities in the development arena of foreign affairs.<\/p><p>As has been mentioned before to this committee, Mr. David Donoghue was a very skilled negotiator.  I would say Mr. Noel Dorr contributed to the UN Security Council a good few years ago but Mr. Donoghue's contribution was absolutely massive for Ireland.  We cannot understate how skilled and brilliant he was in that arena.  He ensured the UN major groups, in other words, civil society, were in the meetings all the way until the end.  He carried them with him.  He realised the only way this agenda had any hope of getting implemented was if the private sector, local government, civil society and all stakeholders got behind it.  It was not just about government but everybody together, unified to deliver this.  The partnership would have to be formed at local levels, such as Dublin, for example, or even on the UCD campus, at national and regional levels, like the European Union, and at global levels.  This is the duty bearer for the agenda and it is something Irish Aid will have to respond to.  There is a new partnership out there that must implement the sustainable development agenda.  I have highlighted the enormous contribution of Ambassador Donoghue, particularly his contributions on the Northern Ireland peace process, these intergovernmental negotiations on sustainable development goals and his chairing of the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants.  These were honoured in UCD and we gave him an honorary doctorate in September 2016.  Academia is extremely impressed with what he has done for Ireland and the world.<\/p><p> In my brief comments, I want to highlight the role of partnerships in universities.  I also want to come at the sustainable development goals agenda in three dimensions.  I know we want to focus on Irish Aid but other dimensions are potentially competing elements for finance, resources and policy.  The sustainable development goals, unlike the millennium development goals, are universal and indivisible.  In this context, universal means that every country must achieve or commit to trying to achieve these goals by 2030.  That means Ireland, as well as Kenya or any of our programme countries.  They are indivisible in the sense we cannot cherry-pick and we must try to achieve the economic, social, environmental and governance goals.  We have to see the linkages between them and try to implement them simultaneously.  We cannot just say we will specialise on industrial development, as that is not the spirit of the agenda.<\/p><p> The other big point that will be quite important for the Irish Aid programme is that there is an overarching principle about leaving nobody behind.  This could be a very good guide for us in terms of where we want to be with development.  This relates to fragile states, the least developed countries and providing aid to those who are left behind, marginal, vulnerable or disadvantaged.  This is the place where we can do the most as a small aid programme with focus.  I will summarise a paper I have already written for the Royal Irish Academy, called Implementing the UN 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda in Ireland, in which I make a case for hybrid sustainable development parliamentary committees.  Members may read that.  The sustainable development goals agenda has implications for Ireland on three interrelated dimensions of the agenda.  There are also implications for the financial architecture and everything else in terms of implementation.<\/p><p> It might surprise many when I say this agenda must be implemented at home.  We are committed to a voluntary national review at what is called the high-level political forum in July 2018.  We must make a report on behalf of the Irish Government to say where we are in terms of implementing the sustainable development goals at home.  The other part of that is the more traditional responsibility, which we take on ourselves, of an overseas aid programme.  As part of that, Ireland should be stepping up and helping partner countries to implement the UN 2030 agenda.  Finally, there is the other dimension, which is a global challenges idea.  We are very aware of Paris and the climate deal, and our commitments are binding in that regard.  This is just one of several emerging global challenges where we must deal with tax havens, the health of oceans, land degradation and disease.  There are many interstate or global challenges, and Ireland will be expected, in partnership with others, to step up and address them.<\/p><p> The millennium development goals were more about getting into least developed or developing countries and helping them to implement a development programme.  The sustainable development goals are more global in their reach and they are more universal.  We have to do it on the UCD campus, in Dublin, on a national and European level with our developing partners, and at a global level.  We are asked to engage on different levels.  Of course, this will create tension in terms of the financial architecture or the type of resources we want to commit, as a nation, to these responsibilities or demands.<\/p><p> The Irish Aid section of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade looks after overseas development aid, but I have always taken a very hard line on the idea of what should fund such aid.  Ireland should commit as soon as possible to the metric of 0.7% of gross national product, GNP.  We are already cheating because we do not say gross domestic product and GNP is much lower.  To commit to 0.7% of GNP would be to take a leadership role in the world.  Norway has already committed to 1% and other countries are above 1%.  We have made the commitment going back decades and we are now going backwards.  We are probably at the 0.3% level, although we moved forward in the past.  I would nearly have a referendum on this issue.  We should have a fiscal contract for social global responsibility, with the Irish committing to 0.7% of GNP, irrespective of our budgets or political cycles.  It is not much at 70 cent for every &euro;100.<\/p><p> There are many benefits to making this commitment.  The first relates to putting money into the sustainable development goals at home or into security or other issues.  That tension would be gone as the money would be for overseas development aid.  There would be no more politics or lobbying in that respect.  It would also create certainty.  With programme countries, whether it is humanitarian assistance or development with bilaterals or multilaterals, we can plan with certainty over five or ten years.  The money would be committed and we could do certain things.  We are causing chaos with our flipping up and down the level of overseas development aid.  More important, when we start shifting the composition of aid and moving money from development to humanitarian assistance before moving it to multilateral elements and coming back again, we are destroying our reputation.  We are not stepping up in the way we should.  We need to create certainty, have long-term planning, pick partners and stay with them.  This will lead to a much more successful programme.<\/p><p> With overseas development, we should embody the principle of leaving nobody behind.  Projects, when they involve the private sector and bigger countries, might naturally help middle development countries more and they may not necessarily want to be in fragile states.  They may not necessarily want to be in orphanages or deal with mental health or disability matters.  A programme aligned to our history and which focuses on the least developed countries, those vulnerable to famines, conflict, disability, mental health and issues relating to women and children, should be our niche.  It should be the focus of the 0.7% of GNP.<\/p><p> When we go to these countries, and this includes our non-governmental organisations, we must be open to working in partnership with the private sector.  Even in fragile states, we can work with the private sector and governments in the UN system.  We can work with local authorities and universities and go into partnerships in these defined areas.  There are many successful examples of how that can work.<\/p><p>When we are doing humanitarian development work and we define these particular partnerships, whether they are multilateral or bilateral, I would like to see Irish partnerships threaded through the implementation and review of any money we spend.  The idea that we send cheques off to the UN system or to some humanitarian crisis and let other partners spend them in places where there is no Irish entity present, whether a person from a university or Government, is not really good enough.  I would make sure that we have an Irish presence in those partnerships, all the way down to impact and evaluation level.  It is the best way to ensure accountability and buy-in in our society and structures.  We should have companies and Government people going out to be part of the multilateral or bilateral partnerships. That could ensure that we are in it and are seeing it, and that we can improve it by being part of it.  <br\/><br\/>When we look at the countries where peacekeeping is carried out and where our universities, NGOs, programme countries, and the African section of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade - who are based in Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa - are, they are all in different countries.  Different elements of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade are staffed, but in different countries.  I believe that they should be in the same country.  Peacekeepers and development workers can learn and work very well together, and they should be together.  This is particularly true if we orientate towards Sudan or Somalia.  They should be together.  The universities and private companies should also be there, and should be working together.  We would then have more cohesion and coherence at home and abroad, and would make accountability easier to achieve.  It is a weakness that we are in different countries for different activities.  <br\/><br\/>Those are some of my academic or external views on where Irish Aid should go.  It embeds a nice part of the sustainable development goals, SDGs, framework into it.  The Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment will take the lead on the implementation of the SDGs in Ireland.  It will report to the UN high level political forum in 2018 in the first instance.  Some people have argued that environment should take the lead.  There are several reasons that is the case.  The high level political forum, HLPF, actually replaces the Commission of the Environment, so there is a legacy of having serviced that committee.  It has traditionally been serviced by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment<b>.  <\/b>In terms of the SDG dashboard that United Nations Social Development Network, UNSDN, did, many of our red flags are on environmental pillars.  There are social and economic issues, no doubt, but most of our big weaknesses relate to the environmental pillar.  <br\/><br\/>The EPA and the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment can act as a springboard for a whole of Government approach.  They are very open to bringing in civil society groups such as Coalition 2030.  They are in a good position.  UCD have a research contract to work with them on the governance and the indicators for this voluntary national review, but also going forward for implementing the SDGs at home.  I am encouraging partnership between parliamentarians, the bureaucratic side of Government, the Departments, the universities and groups like Social Justice Ireland, Environmental Pillar and the Mary Robinson Foundation.  They all should be a part of this and help to define the goals, targets, recommendations and pressure for legislative change.  I believe Ireland can do very well.  I am very supportive of the energy coming from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  I would like to point out that we are under pressure to report globally, but the SDG agenda tells us to implement in our own way, and it very much tells us that we have to be part of a data revolution.  For Ireland that means we have to be able to map out all of the economic, social and environmental issues town by town, city by city, with data, and use the best technology available.  The CSO could be pivotal to that.  It is a new way of doing things, but we can do it.  <br\/><br\/>In the paper I have just put forward for the Royal Irish Academy I asked a basic question.  At the high-level political forum stakeholders are in the room with the bureaucrats, and then the leaders arrive.  It is Ministers up until 2018 and then every five years it will be leaders.  A HLPF-type committee should be able to work here.  There is no reason we cannot set up policy committees that should, <i>ex ante<\/i>, incorporate elements of what we call at the UN major groups from civil society, academia and others, which are chaired by the parliamentarians and Senators, and bring good papers and positions with a view to having action taken on these issues.  We have examples of this already.  The national action plan on women, peace and security 2015 to 2018 group, led by Ms Nora Owens, has people from various departments, universities and society groups.  That sort of thing has already happened, but the idea is to formalise it and to really prioritise it.  I prefer this to a sustainable development council, for example the climate change or fiscal council.  Those are advisory and outside of the issues, not inside.  It does not give those parties a seat at the table.  It is not really giving them a real chance to set agendas and to actually bring through legislative change.  <br\/><br\/>Where do the resources come from for this?  I am very clear that no overseas aid money should be used for any voluntary national review or any actions at all to implement the SDGs at home.  This has to come from the mainstream budget.  It should come from the Department of the Environment or the Department of Finance.  It has nothing to do with official development assistance, ODA.  This is about Ireland mainstreaming its economic, social and environmental policies to align with the SDGs.  It is nothing to do with overseas development aid and should not take any money from that.  <br\/><br\/>Ironically, if we do this well at home it gives us real leverage so that all of these partnerships can engage overseas, and in the future can engage in these global partnerships.  We already had a little bit of this from the Government, where the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, carried out a spin-over analysis on the possible effects of the Irish tax system on developing economies.  The idea is that Ireland, on the issues of ocean health, climate, land and managing security and disease, gets its partnerships into these issues globally.  It is a different arena, a different set of committees and a different set of partnerships.  It is not overseas development aid as we know it.  Again, I would not use any money from ODA, but I certainly would use money from the Department of Finance and others.  We are getting very bad press, portrayed as a tax haven around the world at the moment.  Some people are calling us the epicentre for global social inequality and environmental degradation, because all of the multinationals, value chains, food systems and pharmaceuticals and others are avoiding taxes.  They avoid taxes so that all of the nations of the world cannot build roads, schools and houses all over the world.  We need to take our role seriously in dealing with global challenges, in partnerships., and we cannot just ignore the fact that we are perhaps quite negatively involved in something.  It is perceived to be that way.  Because the SDG agenda operates nationally and globally, including in the developing world, it has different focuses.  In terms of sustainable development we need to build a reputation in all of those dimensions.  We cannot just say that we have a famine history and a history of missionary work and that we have done well in Africa.  That is just one dimension of this agenda.  We cannot, on the other side of that, be seen to be creating chaos.  <br\/><br\/>I wanted to highlight the role of universities.  UCD is certainly stepping up to the plate in terms of trying to reorient our education and research, innovation, policy outreach and community outreach towards that SDG backdrop.<\/p><p>This is largely because one element of our funding, that is to say, the European Commission, has made the framework programme 9 and the sustainable development goals the backdrop for funding of universities.  This is important to UCD.  It relates to some work that people undertook.  One thing Mr. Guterres had on his agenda was a switch in the focus from security to development to prevent future wars.  The other thing is to reorientate global finance to the sustainable development goals.  This means finance that was supposed to be for universities, for example, should be made SDG-orientated.  Finance for equity and pension funds should somehow be made STG-orientated.  Finance should be made to be SDG-orientated.  Global tax, taxation and public tax should be made SDG-orientated.  Those involved will win this agenda if they hone in on the financial focus.<\/p><p> UCD is perfectly capable of orientating towards this agenda without using overseas development aid money or anything like that.  This is because the college gets its own funding.  The college has its own fees and structure and it can engage.  However, the college does need funding in another sense.  UCD likes to build partnerships with universities in our programme countries.  We do this and we are successful at it but we could scale it.  It is really important that academics and students start to undertake their scholarship together on joint programmes.<\/p><p> Up to now Irish Aid has had a successful fellowship programme.  It is a smaller programme.  The idea is to bring civil servants in Africa to do masters degrees in Ireland for a year.  Then, we send them back.  It should be possible to build capacity in Africa.  Those who have participated never really shadowed the Departments here or came to the D&aacute;il.  Then, when they went back to Africa they never really stayed with us on our development projects.<\/p><p> The UCD approach is to go up a level.  We focus on the training of staff and civil servants in Africa up to PhD level.  We have a nice programme under which people come for 12 weeks per year for up to four years.  They can get a PhD in any discipline.  Our fees are low and we put a great deal of effort into it.  The joy of it is to realise that universities in many of the programme countries are part of government and state.  In fact, a person who is head of an economics department can be head of finance one year, governor of the bank the following year and then back as head of economics in the university the year after that.  They are rather interchangeable.  Apart from getting people up to PhD level, the universities can train the masters students of the future, but they are central to policy as well.  They are useful in terms of engaging with the Irish Government and our embassies in implementing the programme.<\/p><p> My recommendation is that regardless of the type of education programme in question, no development education money should be spent here.  No money should go to United Kingdom universities either, although that is what we are doing.  It should all be out in Africa.  It should be about getting our universities and everyone out in Africa, doing things in partnership and getting capacity there.  That is what the overseas department aid programmes should focus on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017111600002#A00400","nonspeaker":"Professor Patrick P. Walsh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510824600,"counter":1884,"content":"<p>Thank you very much, Professor Walsh.  There is a good deal of material for consideration.  This is one of three meetings of our committee today.  Later today, we will meet the ambassadors of Ethiopia and Kenya.  We will also meet representatives of the UK House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, who are on a visit.  The context is the British departure from the European Union.  Britain has a good record in overseas development aid and reaching the target of 0.7% of GNP.  We will raise the issue with the visiting representatives in the afternoon.  We know from discussions with various members of the House of Commons and some members of the British Government that they are committed to continuing to co-operate at European Union level in respect of various aid programmes.  That is important.  When meeting the members of the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee we will raise the issues with regard to our island and the difficulties that will emerge for us when Britain leaves the European Union.  It is simply one of the many issues on the agenda of the committee today.<\/p> <p>  Professor Walsh, you have highlighted well the whole area of silo thinking in this country in all endeavours.  For far too long, the academic world, the public service and the private sector have not worked together in collaboration or co-operation in the areas where they are needed.  I saw that at first-hand in my limited experience of Government.  We effected some changes but they are always slow to come about, unfortunately.  People go off and do their own thing.  There is unnecessary waste of public expenditure and duplication.  We do not see the return for the taxpayer that there should be.  In that context, universities are not bad at living in a silo world either.  Aside from the public service - academics are public servants as well - what co-operation does UCD have with other universities in this country?  I recall representatives from a particular department in UCC making a presentation to the committee some years ago with regard to programmes they were running.  I know some of the masters programmes in Maynooth are very much focused on international co-operation.  Is there enough synergy between the universities here?  Does UCD have co-operation with the British universities in that respect?  Will you elaborate, Professor Walsh, on the concern you expressed about funding going to British universities?  You mentioned that it should stay here.<\/p> <p>  Committee members are aware and appreciative of the work of the former ambassador, Mr. David Donoghue in different roles in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  My first interaction with him was many years ago when he was on the then Anglo-Irish desk in the Department of Foreign Affairs.  He was very much involved in the Northern Ireland talks.  He contributed immensely to the progress made on the island.  Perhaps we need to bring him back to have his input again with impasse.<\/p> <p>  Professor Walsh, you made reference to a referendum.  Certain leaders in neighbouring islands put a referendum but I do not think they knew the answer although they posed the question.  That could create certain difficulties.  All committee members would have spoken in the past about getting the message across to the taxpayer about the effectiveness of Irish Aid as well as the extraordinary work and the benefits that accrue from relatively small funding.  When there are catastrophes and crises the Irish public respond exceptionally well.  All of us, especially those of us who grew up in rural communities, are aware of missionaries, religious and lay, who did such good work in the most deprived communities before our overseas demand programme.  There was awareness at local level with regard to that work.  We need to create greater awareness before we go for a referendum.  The last thing we want is a referendum seeking approval only to have it rejected.  I advise caution in that respect unless a great deal of work is done in the meantime.  Will you refer to the questions on universities and silo thinking etc.?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017111600002#D00200","speaker":"1270"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510824600,"counter":1885,"content":"<p>I am a big fan of the Whitaker-Lemass days.  The then Minister had a finance committee made up of Louden Ryan in Trinity as well as the professors of economics in UCD and Queen's University.  With the capital programme and economic policies he was tapping in directly to academia.  It was a good time for Ireland in many respects.  I am romantic about that.  I am in favour of anything in the D&aacute;il or the various Departments that puts infrastructure on what I terms our science-policy interface.  All that helps with meetings, feedback and consultation.  The idea is not to leave out the scientists and the academics.  That is a positive move.  We are small and we can do it easily.  Indeed, we are doing it now, for example.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to co-ordination.  I am chairman of the Global Association Master's in Development Practice.  We have 40 universities throughout the world, including universities in Colombia, Berkeley, Harvard and Tsinghua.  We have one in Dublin.  The association includes Lund University and Sciences Po.  We have associates in Africa and South America as well.<\/p> <p>  I will explain what are trying to do.  It is akin to what the MBA is to business.  We are trying to give professional training to young people in order that they can hit the ground running at high level management either in government, private sector or civil society under the SDG agenda.  I am keen for every university in Ireland to have a masters in development practice, just as we have masters degrees in economics or finance.  We need professionals in this agenda.<\/p> <p>  Do we co-ordinate properly?  Perhaps we do not.  The university presidents have the IUA.  The association tries to co-ordinate and there are many different aspects to it.<\/p><p>Ronan Murphy has gone from Cork and into a European committee where he is going to try to fight within the European Commission to move the sustainable development goals, SDG, agenda into the mainstream for university funding etc.  We compete at a local level for students at undergraduate, postgraduate and PhD level, through the points system, but there is much work to do to orient our universities to the SDG agenda and to have them interface properly with the D&aacute;il, Seanad, the private sector and NGOs.  We created a scheme called Collaborative Research Fellowships for a Responsive and Innovative Europe, CAROLINE, with the Irish Research Council.  This is for approximately 55 post-doctoral researchers who would work exclusively with universities and NGOs to work better together on implementing SDGs.  That is happening in Ireland, which shows a bit of leadership.<\/p><p> There are two challenges.  One is that we do not co-ordinate within our own universities and with other universities.  There is also the challenge of outreach and better interaction with civil society, Government and the private sector.  More important, we should do that in Africa with our partners.  There are examples of that happening all the time but it needs to be programmed and more systematic so that it can become something the Irish do well.  I gave a keynote speech in Newcastle University and it has the lead on the voluntary national review for the UK for the high-level political forum, HLPF, in 2019.  It is in what is called the general assembly.  It also has a group, like Coalition 2030, which I think is called SDG coalition and is comprised of civil society groups.  It is very keen that Whitehall, together with the civil society groups and a whole-of-Government approach, does something innovative for SDGs and mimics what is in the HLPF in the UN in the UK.  This is a great opportunity, irrespective of what is happening with Brexit, to link universities on this global agenda and to work together out in Africa.  This is a nice thing that we could do together irrespective of what is happening with the European Union.  This is a message I give to them and that they give back to us.<\/p><p> Academia does not have boundaries or border controls.  It is one of the most free-moving things one can have although I know it is not easy to get visas for students.  In theory, academics and students move very freely between universities and we can use that to address global challenges and work together across our nations and outside Europe.  We can work well with the UK's Department for International Trade or UK Aid when we are out in fragile states.  That is a nice message in this time when Brexit is happening.  Rather than zoning in on the negative things, we can ask what things we can co-operate on irrespective of Brexit.  I second the praise of Mr. David Donoghue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017111600002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Patrick P. Walsh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510824600,"counter":1887,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Walsh for an interesting, challenging presentation.  I was struck by his support for the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment being the driver.  There is irony in that since we are far behind when it comes to meeting our targets.  Would he have considered any other Department as the lead?  We have been having a debate about bilateral and multilateral aid here.  It is good to hear what Professor Walsh says about Ireland's presence in the multilateral area.  How does he think we could do that?  We see the effect of bilateral aid but we are not sure about the multilateral aid.  There are concerns that it is swallowed up in administration and the security agenda.  I agree with Professor Walsh about tax havens because it is damaging our reputation.  There is also the multinational agenda, which I think we have to be stronger on, as well as corruption we see in governments.  That corruption can be for a variety of reasons.  It can be deliberate or it can be due to governments not having the capacity to take on multinational companies.<\/p> <p>  I have a big bugbear with my colleagues about education and how we measure SDGs.  It is not just about getting numbers into schools.  It has to be about the quality of education that students receive.  Perhaps our universities or training colleges might be more involved in that.  Some 70 to 80 children come into a school with one teacher, a couple of books between them and maybe one blackboard.  It cannot just be a box-ticking exercise.  We spoke with Mr. David Donoghue.  If Ireland reaches 0.7% of GNI on the current projected growth rates, we would provide &euro;2.5 billion.  We will have a meeting here at the end of November about how we could spend that.  We talk about the big picture but there is also the little picture.  While people theorise and create policy, other people are starving and dying.  We had the opportunity last week, being in Malawi and Mozambique, to see the work of our ambassadors, with ambassador Gerry Cunningham in Malawi and William Carlos in Mozambique.  We saw first-hand the benefit of bilateral aid and it was incredible.  Once that bilateral aid goes to women, they will do more with it than if it were given to the men.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017111600002#E00200","speaker":"1291"},{"type":"speech","time":1510824600,"counter":1888,"content":"<p>I will call Deputy Darragh O'Brien then ask Professor Walsh to answer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017111600002#E00300","speaker":"1270"},{"type":"speech","time":1510824600,"counter":1889,"content":"<p>There was a little segue there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017111600002#E00400","speaker":"1228"},{"type":"speech","time":1510824600,"counter":1890,"content":"<p>Deputy O'Brien can continue on that route.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017111600002#E00500","speaker":"1270"},{"type":"speech","time":1510824600,"counter":1891,"content":"<p>I will not try to follow that.  I thank Professor Walsh for his contribution but I missed the very beginning of it.  If he covered what I ask about here at the start, I apologise.  Professor Walsh's clear message relates to how, in our move towards attaining SDGs, no funding should be taken from the official development assistance, ODA, budget.  I agree with that and think this committee should endorse that in a formal way.  Professor Walsh made a fair point that we have raised here on numerous occasions.  If we ever move back towards attaining the 0.7% goal, we should make a clear distinction between development aid and humanitarian aid, and there has been a move over the last years such that, when there is a humanitarian crisis, the ODA pot is dipped into to pay that out.  I do not support that and I think it inhibits our progress.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman has covered Professor Walsh's idea on a referendum.  I get his point.  I do not think he was entirely serious about that and we will stay away from that for a moment.  We have called for a multi-party, multi-annual approach and a planned way to get to 0.7%.  I have said that consistently.  For us to do that means that all political parties and representatives must cost that in their budgetary plans.  We have a Committee on Budgetary Oversight now that looks forward which parties and Independent groups must commit to.  It is easy for me to stand, bang a desk and say we should reach 0.7% but I and my party, Fianna F&aacute;il, for argument's sake, must show how we can do that.  Sinn F&eacute;in, Labour, and last but not least, Deputy O'Sullivan and Independent groups, must do likewise.  There is a mechanism to do that and I generally believe there is a political will to do it.  We have to be realistic too.  Britain took a big jump forward and it would require us to catch up by approximately &euro;160 million in one year.  It is very little in the overall context and I believe the general public is ahead of the Government on this.  It has been shown clearly that Irish Aid and our NGOs work, and instead of talking about it, many of our NGOs have assisted in showing us that roadmap and how we can commit to it.  I heard a figure from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade saying that we would get to 0.7% by 2030.  If it is going to take us ten years to get there, then let us say it and be honest about it, or say that we are not going to reach 0.7%.  It is damaging our reputation and credibility.<\/p> <p>  The point Professor Walsh made about chaos being caused by fluctuation in funding levels is true.  I do not want us to undo all the good work that has been done over the generations.  It is not just about money but if there is one thing the Oireachtas can do, it is to say what the roadmap is and when it can be done, as well as what it means.<\/p><p>If the fiscal space, which is a horrible phrase, is X, every party will have to factor in the substantial increase in overseas development aid, ODA, over the first two or three years to get back on track, but we are failing at that.<\/p><p> I wish to conclude on two matters.  I do not know whether I heard Professor Walsh's comment at the start on third country arrangements.  This country pays into the EU-Turkish arrangement on dealing with a humanitarian crisis, but we have no oversight of it.  Actually, I am not correct to say that we have no oversight, but we do not know how our contribution to that fund is being spent.  I cannot get a commitment that none of our money is being spent on security, for example.<\/p><p> Will Professor Walsh comment on the move towards these arrangements?  An Afghanistan arrangement on resettling refugees and returning them to Afghanistan that is tied to future aid commitments is a real issue.  We could discuss sustainable development goals, SDGs, and 2030 until the cows come home, but if the EU is moving towards these types of arrangement, under which people are sent back to regimes and countries that are not safe, it undermines the process.<\/p><p> Hearing about co-operation between universities and what they can do in our partner countries in the developing world was interesting.  That is already happening well at secondary school level.  I have seen it with Students for the Advancement of Global Entrepreneurship, SAGE.  Portmarnock community school in my area won an award for #MapLesotho and did incredible work.  That is happening across the country.  We need to be able to harness it because I am unsure whether we would know the answer if someone asked what our universities and secondary schools were doing in respect of our aid countries.  Many good things are happening but they are not being brought together.  Doing that would be important.<\/p><p> I thank Professor Walsh for his interesting contribution.  Perhaps he will comment on a couple of my points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017111600002#E00600","speaker":"1228","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510824600,"counter":1893,"content":"<p>Before I invite Professor Walsh to respond, I must go to the Chamber to speak, so I will ask Deputy O'Sullivan to take the Chair.

The Deputy is right, and I want us to be at 0.7% of GNP now.  I am in a school of politics and international relations, so I realise that there are political constraints.  I believed that I had the public with me, but the Deputy is telling me that it might not be, so I will turn to something else.  What the Deputy suggested was good.<br\/><br\/>To some extent, this answers the question on the environment.  When we took action to stop burning coal and get rid of plastic bags, there was disquiet and many political parties were running for cover, but we could always say that it had nothing to do with us and that it was down to a directive of the European Communities or European Commission.  The beauty of setting up an inter-party committee - this was the recommendation in my paper - that comprises the whole of Government, its Departments and elements of civil society is that if we can put it out to the public that the best of the best in the private sector, civil society, academia, government and the Civil Service have sat down together and committed to making a binding recommendation, all of the political parties could just say that they signed up to the committee, its decision had nothing to do with them and they could not roll back on it if the recommendation from that major consultation, like the One World, One Future document, was for 0.7% of GNP.  That is another way of being a bit top-down while also being inclusive to a degree.  However we do it, we cannot allow what is happening at the moment to continue.  The Deputy's suggestion was a good one.<br\/><br\/>The work done by schools has been great.  We are involved to a certain extent.  This is where the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment plays a great role in initiatives, such as the green flag programme and so on.  That Department is in tune with society.  Someone mentioned that its score card was the worst, but the EPA and others involved in this area are smart and they hold engagements with local communities and academia that perhaps other Departments do not.  If we need to mobilise and get things done, the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment might be the right choice.  I know the Taoiseach and the President.  They will all row in behind it because they will just say that they are the facilitators and they want to move the situation forward.<br\/><br\/>UCD has undergraduates, researchers and other academics volunteering overseas.  Squaring all of that and examining our engagement in education in Africa is important.  However, the point I was trying to make was that, rather than putting money into UK universities or sustainable development programmes in Ireland in order to market the Irish Aid programme, the best way of marketing the programme is to get people in schools in Portmarnock and all around the country and in universities engaging with people in Africa, discussing these issues and implementing measures together as opposed to sending an intermediary to tell people what the story is.  That is a major point.<br\/><br\/>The question on multilateralism refers to the same idea.  I am proud of what Irish Aid does.  I have seen it in Tanzania.  It is creative.  When our PhD students graduated from Dar es Salaam University College of Education, DUCE, and so on, the Irish Embassy held the graduation ceremony.  For the first time, our senate met in Tanzania and gave out degrees.  The graduates' families could attend the event.  This is the sort of creativity that these ambassadors have.  They know exactly what to do and when to do it.  They are outstanding in that regard.<br\/><br\/>Why do we like bilateral aid?  We say that it is not untied, but it is when we focus on the fragile and least developed.  While we might address livelihoods and societal issues like education, health, clean water and sanitation, when we focus on those who have been left behind and the most vulnerable and make that our priority, we are locking aid in.  I would like our partnerships to work in partnership with them to deliver that.<br\/><br\/>This does not mean that one cannot bring in the private sector.  Many wonderful things are happening, from artificial intelligence to back-up systems.  Instead of providing health care through something like the HSE, hospitals or community outlets, systems could, via mobile phones, move towards community workers doing extension work with communities.  The private sector would get behind that and finance it.  One could have all sorts of wonderful SDG partnerships with that type of focus in the most fragile states.<br\/><br\/>Both Deputies asked about multilateral aid.  We must contribute to the UN, the EU and so on because we are members of certain bodies, but there are parties that are more discretionary.  I call them &quot;quangos of the UN system&quot; or &quot;quangos of humanitarian assistance&quot;.  A part of our reason for being involved in them is that we do not have the capacity, outreach or scale to work alone, yet we want to respond and to be able to tell the Irish public that we have given a couple of million of euro to tackle something.  We might not have a presence or capacity there, but we have partners that allow us to get there.  That is comforting and it works.<br\/><br\/>On the other hand, though, we must recognise something about the SDG agenda.  The UN system and humanitarian lines are opening up to partnerships with, for example, universities, parliamentarians and civil society agents.  When we see a line taking shape, there is no reason for us not to get involved.  The more that we are involved, the more of an impact we will have.<br\/><br\/>I am with the Deputy.  It was a beautiful point to make.  We could be cross about this.  Regarding Mr. Guterres, the UN used to be about security first and development later.  If we put the money that we invest in military and security into development instead, particularly in north Africa, and ensured that that region developed properly, we would mitigate war, future migration and other problems.  It is terrible that we let all of that happen and, <i>ex post<\/i>, there may be a migration pressure coming at us that we want another country to take on instead.  We pay it to take on the sins of our lack of action on our borders in the past ten, 20 or 30 years.<\/p><p>At the same time, we should really respect the care given to refugees in Lebanon.  We should really respect Lebanon for what it is doing for Syria.  Having money going in there still matters.  Should we have a presence there?  Yes.  Our peacekeepers should have development people, academics and others side by side.  If we start to pump money into certain places, we should be asking for a greater presence in them.  Perhaps it takes a little time to catch up but we could be a little more strategic in this regard.  We should recognise that there is an effort to fix a problem that should have been fixed way up the line.<\/p><p> I agree on not liking to see cheques being written to third parties with no oversight.  That is not good. <\/p><p> I have answered some of the questions.  The main one asked was on educational access.  I know the response does not go down well.  There are three levels.  The Sustainable Development Solutions Network, SDSN, the group I work with, has an ethics in action programme.  I could give the members the minutes.  The programme is hosted by the Pontifical Academy and it works with Religions for Peace.  It involves representatives of five major religions, the UN system, scientists and civil society people talking about the SDG agenda and the role of ethics.  With regard to education, we have seen that the figures on participation at preschool, primary, secondary and university levels are appalling and getting worse.  While we might say the second millennium development goal, MDG 2, is great, yielding good rates of attendance and enrolment at primary school, we would, if we were really being honest, acknowledge that completion rates are a disaster.  Quality is a problem.  My main point is that one can build schools and put money into them but one has to put money into the professional training of the teachers.  In this regard, a big mistake is being made.  We have St. Patrick's College and Mary Immaculate College.  We are brilliant at training teachers, yet when we are in our programme countries, we do not put an effort into forming university partnerships, involving UCD, Marino, the Church of Ireland or others, with a view to training teachers, training them on extension and getting the curriculums up to speed.  This is a huge problem. <\/p><p> The final issue on which we focus &ndash; this is big for UCD and everywhere else &ndash; is that knowledge is not virtue.  What one is teaching does not necessarily make the trainees people who will go out into the world and participate for the public good and be sympathetic to humanity, the environment and the places in which we live.  This is even a challenge for Ireland now.  One of the questions posed by the SDGs is whether, in our civics education and the way we deal with ethics at both primary and secondary levels, we are training people to work for the public good when they emerge from the school system.  As they are paid by the taxpayer, they should be contributing to the community, nation and globe.  Are we training people for oil companies or the financial sector?  What are we doing?  Is our approach correct or not?<\/p><p> Access and quality of education are important but so, too, is the nature of what one is teaching, be it virtue or whatever else one wants to call it.  These levels need to be borne in mind.  Our teacher training colleges are excellent and would jump at the opportunity to work with similar ones in Tanzania and other countries, in addition to gaining access to the schools.  That is the SDG-type partnership.  We can use various technologies, the private sector and other things.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017111600002#F00800","nonspeaker":"Professor Patrick P. Walsh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510824600,"counter":1901,"content":"<p>Professor Walsh mentioned in his presentation this morning the destruction of Ireland's reputation.  He said investing more heavily in and moving towards humanitarian aid is destroying Ireland's international reputation.  Perhaps I misunderstood Professor Walsh.  Could he expand on that?  He said he sees a weakness in Irish Aid's involvement in various projects in various countries.  What does he mean by that?  Is he saying that if there is a crisis or tragedy owing to a famine, tsunami or earthquake, for example, we should not make money available to the affected country?  Is he saying there should be some sort of separation?  Is he saying humanitarian funding should be coming from some other source?  If so, what is it?<\/p> <p>  Professor Walsh referred to the importance of universities and schools.  He also referred to the importance of travelling to African countries and others.  Does he believe it is important to have a two-way process that entails the groups he deals with travelling to Ireland?<\/p> <p>  South Dublin County Council, my local authority, was involved in a project in Ethiopia.  It dealt with water supply, sanitation, waste collection, educational facilities, public realm improvements and so on.  It was partly funded by the council and there was also support from Irish Aid.  The attitude was that the traffic involved a two-way process, including visits to Ireland.  It was said that, as a result of such engagement, friendships were formed and lessons learned on both sides.  How important is this?<\/p> <p>  Irish Aid is involved in budgetary oversight in many countries.  In Ireland, budgetary oversight is a new development, involving Opposition parties etc.  Does Professor Walsh believe it should not be a matter of Europeans going to Africa or other parts of the world in the belief that we have all the answers?  It is important to have a two-way process and for parliamentarians to meet one another. <\/p> <p>  Professor Walsh referred to people participating in programmes through UCD.  In this regard, how important is it to have accommodation for graduates and others coming to UCD?  I ask this because of the accommodation crisis.  The Institute of Technology Tallaght is involved in a project that involves graduates and undergraduates going to Kenya to work in the slums to gain experience.<\/p> <p>  Professor Walsh referred to the referendum and the public.  It is clear that the public will not give us a blank cheque.  Therefore, it is important to have oversight of projects.  The difference between bilateral and multilateral arrangements must be considered.  EU institution-related overseas development aid expenditure was &euro;188 million.  No one has ever appeared before this committee to say where exactly that funding is going.  How important is it to have such oversight?  It is important for us, as parliamentarians, not only because we are supposed to engage in oversight but also because we have to be able to answer questions in communities on what the money is being spent on.  Clearly, we need to know that.  How important is oversight to Professor Walsh?<\/p> <p>  Professor Walsh mentioned the UN target of 0.7%.  A suggestion was made about political parties.  How important is it for the Government to have a plan to reach the target?  It is all very well for Opposition parties to say they would meet it but surely the most important point is that the Government should have a plan to do so.  Up to now, we have not heard it. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017111600002#G00200","speaker":"1309"},{"type":"speech","time":1510824600,"counter":1902,"content":"<p>Professor Walsh is very welcome.  It is good to have him here.  I thank him for the very interesting presentation.  He will be responding to Deputy Crowe's comment.  I did not understand the professor to say what Deputy Crowe implied about humanitarian aid.  He may clarify that.<\/p> <p>  I was very glad to hear Professor Walsh's comments about Mr. David Donoghue, who was before this committee on 19 October and who was superb and really impressive.  I absolutely endorse what Professor Walsh said in this regard, as would everyone else.<\/p> <p>  At our earlier hearings, I asked a representative of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade about the target of 0.7%.<\/p><p>His comment was that our ODA spend has increased in absolute terms even while the percentage has not because our economy is growing.  The subtext I felt was that there was a resistance to committing to a percentage target.  Will the witness comment on how do we answer that if we want to see a multi-budget commitment to reaching that target?  How do we deal with that criticism, which is that as our economy is growing the pot of money allocated to this area become bigger and bigger.  <\/p><p> With regard to the bilateral versus multilateral Irish direct contribution to aid in the EU, we had a debate on this in previous sessions.  I agree with what Professor Walsh and others have said about the visibility of a direct bilateral programme and direct accountability.  We need to be careful that we are not seen to be overly critical of the hugely important multilateral programmes run by the EU and the UN and the huge capacity for more effective delivery without duplication when it is done on a transnational basis.  Who should we have in here from the EU to speak to us about where that spend is going?  Is there an office we can ask as a foreign affairs committee in the same way as we have had officials from our foreign affairs programme and Irish Aid?  <\/p><p> It was good to hear the witnesses emphasise the role of universities.  There is a great deal going on across all universities, as others have said, with secondary schools and student-led organisations like the SUAS educational development initiative.  The Trinity College law school had a long running programme with Rule of Law in southern and eastern Africa.  I have been in Tanzania, Botswana and South Africa and have seen how small amounts of money can really impact.  How do we co-operate among our universities to ensure no duplication and the most efficient and effective delivery through building up those connections that we have with individual law schools and other universities?  How can we co-ordinate that? <\/p><p> What does Professor Walsh think is the big strength of Irish Aid seen from an international perspective?  Others have talked about the different ways in which Irish Aid is well regarded but what do we bring specifically, particularly through our bilateral programmes, that is different? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017111600002#G00300","speaker":"1402","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510824600,"counter":1904,"content":"<p>Thank you Senator Bacik.

The drop in GNP was greater and was catastrophic.  That has the effect of keeping our ranking high on the OECD DAC.  Even though the absolute value was dropping - it actually nearly dropped, I am guessing, to &euro;400 million or &euro;350 million - because it was expressed as a percentage of GNI, which is the value of goods and services produced in Ireland, Irish Aid was saying we were still at 0.5% or 0.6% in terms of the target.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017111600002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Patrick P.

Now, however, when GNI has started to boom, or boomerang back, what is happening is that even though funding has increased to about &euro;600 million, the percentage figure in terms of the 0.7% target has fallen to about 0.3%.  That is embarrassing for those concerned because it shows on the league table.  In terms of an international perspective, the league table that matters is 0.7% of GNP.  At one stage we were up close to 0.8% and former Taoiseach Bertie Ahern made a commitment that we would get there before 2012.<\/p> <p>  I refer to the money aspect and somebody mentioned that it is increasing to &euro;2.6 billion.  When one becomes a &euro;1 billion donor, one is in a different game.  One has different partners.  If one is a &euro;2 billion donor, particularly with the sustainable development goals, SDGs, then maybe Siemens and other big companies, the big philanthropists and the big equity funds become involved.  Then the challenge is not to become overly burdened with administration and accountability issues but to set up partnerships and to trust them and turn that &euro;1 billion impact into a &euro;1 trillion impact.  That is what has to be done because a lot of these companies have good oversight, as do universities and other partners.  If there is an idea that there has to be a manager of every &euro;1 million of funding then that becomes bureaucratically very difficult.  However, if the view is taken that this can be operated more like, say, the Ford Foundation or the Hewlett Packard Foundation and where we are able to take leadership and fund partnerships, particularly Irish partnerships, then a lot can be done.<\/p> <p>  There is no problem spending money.  The levels and composition features need to be watched as this matters to the Department of Finance.  In this regard reference was made to shifting the composition of the spread.  The moral aspect to the 0.7% target is that if we have a major crisis then it is acceptable to reduce funding from, say, &euro;800 million to &euro;300 million because we needed the savings at home for domestic use.  However, now that we have recovered from the financial crash we should increase the funding again.  An analogy might be in respect of pay restoration for civil servants.  That is why that metric is useful.  It is what is called pro-cyclical.  When one is poor one does not give but when one is rich one gives more.  That was the whole motivation in the 1970s for people signing up to this metric.  Does that answer the Senator's question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017111600002#H00500","nonspeaker":"Professor Patrick P.

When we are doing our PhD programme for staff in Africa we have the chief statistician in the Central Statistics Office in Rwanda involved.  He is young and he will come here on a PhD programme in economics, when he will be here for 13 weeks a year.  The idea is that he does the course work and gets supervision here.  We appoint his head of school in the University of Rwanda to be his supervisor in Africa.  We do not charge fees for that.  The idea is that when he is here he also visits our CSO.  He talks about what it is doing because he is doing metrics for being part of the African Union and it is the same idea as how we changed our statistical methods when we joined the EU to align ourselves with the European community.  They are the same kind of issues.<\/p> <p>  The committee is right that there has to be a two-way flow.  There have to be people working together, whether it is in Africa or here.  They will learn from each other and they will contextualise what they want to do.  Mobility becomes a bit expensive but what I would argue is that a first contact must involve a meeting to bed down the relationship and what is going to be done.  Once people know each other then facilities such as Zoom and Skype play an important role.  Then it is possible to start working daily online in today's world or even on the phone.  It is so much easier.  There has to be some element of contact and then it can go forward.  The whole spirit of the STGs is that the universities should partner and do it with their own funds.  Local authorities, parliamentarians, NGOS and all stakeholders should do it.  The private sector should learn to partner and deliver if that is what it is interested in.<\/p> <p>  However, the big part of the STGs is the working together element, to join the dots between these players.  I mentioned earlier that our peacekeepers are in Lebanon and Syria.  Perhaps they should be in Sudan and other such areas.  Irish Aid is in Mozambique, Malawi, Tanzania, Uganda while our universities are in South Africa, and Aid for Trade is in Uganda and South Africa.  The key element is how we engage with Africa.  Even the diaspora, those who live in Ireland, the Irish Africans, are from different countries from where we are programming.  That is a mistake in the sense that if we were in a similar area or in similar countries we would get more synergies and we could do more together, interacting humanitarian elements with development, etc.<\/p> <p>  On the question of Ireland's reputation, I said there are two aspects.  Not being on the upper scale of the 0.7% GNP target damages Ireland's reputation on aid.  Being down to 0.3% has really not been good enough.<\/p><p>The sustainable development agenda is not just about overseas aid but engaging in global challenges.  The big examples currently include climate change.  The committee has seen this with COP23 etc and its report.  Ireland, as a result of burning peat and its land use in intensive agriculture, is a disaster.  People now know it is a disaster and it is recorded as such.<\/p><p> With the tax haven issue, particularly with Apple, people are getting very frustrated with multinationals and value chains not paying tax.  They are just seeing Ireland as one of the most clever actors in terms of the double-this or triple-that, with people not paying taxes.  We cannot afford that reputation.  We need to say everybody is headquartered here as a gateway to Europe and we will get them together to support the sustainable development goal project.  We want to be an epicentre that drives respect for society and the environment, rather than just driving efficiency on some of the key products out there like mobile phones or computers.  We must be careful.  We have set IDA Ireland loose.  It was brilliant in many ways but now it seems to have autonomy and distance from the Government to be able to negotiate these types of deals, and that is not good enough.  There are other sides to Ireland's reputation, not least getting back to the question about Irish Aid.  It is hard to sell Ireland.  We have Bob Geldof, Mary Robinson and U2 and Bono; we have sold ourselves and our famine past as caring about famine and the developing world but in this era, when there has been a shift to environmental matters and bigger social inequality matters, we are now getting a reputation on the other side.  These are competing stories that are not helping us.<\/p><p> The committee might ask what I think is good about the Irish Aid programme.  I come from UCD, which has the legacy of missionaries.  Everybody in parliament or every civil servant in Africa would tell me they had an Irish teacher.  They know what UCD is and where those teachers came from.  Those days are gone a bit.  I learned from this that there is an importance in being there with those people.  There is a great thing about going out, setting up a church and staying there.  If there is something great about Irish Aid, it is that.  There is a long history of being in one part of Tanzania.  It is a case of being friends forever and we are staying there.  It is where our flag is and we are partners in the delivery of schools, for example.  That resonates very strongly.  It is not a cheque being helicoptered in and the people do not know who is giving it to them.  These people really understand that the Irish are good craic and good friends.  They have the ability to really want to chip in and help whatever activity is there, whether it is for a local authority or something else.  It is the cornerstone of Irish Aid.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017111600002#H00700","nonspeaker":"Professor Patrick P.

I propose to give an account of the Irish Aid development programme in Kenya.  Aid makes an important but small contribution to a country's sustainable economic and social development.  Irish Aid, for several decades, has been a key player in the provision of aid supported by best practices in ensuring the set objectives of funding granted to participants in its programmes in Africa have had a positive impact on the lives of people and the environment.  Various Irish non-governmental organisations have established programmes in Kenya through Irish Aid funding.  The commitment of the Irish Government through Irish Aid has been instrumental in Kenya over the years in developing or partnering with different non-governmental organisations, NGOs, to develop programmes that can save lives and ameliorate suffering, not just in the short term but also in the long term.<\/p> <p>  Debilitating diseases such as smallpox, tuberculosis and river blindness have been controlled thanks to targeted development aid efforts.  Millions of children in Kenya are alive thanks to the control of measles and other vaccinations.  Hundreds of thousands more lives have been saved thanks to international co-operation to fight HIV-AIDS and malaria through Irish Aid funding.  In Kenya's case, targeted aid seems to work better in the provision of mosquito nets, vaccines, cash transfers to the poor, education subsidies, education on use of condoms to prevent sexual transmitted diseases, STIs, and urban and rural water provisioning.  These seem to achieve their objectives through targeted programmes.<\/p> <p>  In Kenya, deliberate government policy to direct aid effectively while expanding on other sources of finance has been critical to the positive impact of aid.  With even better co-operation between Irish Aid and the government, greater achievements could be realised in chosen areas of assistance.<\/p><p>On future prospects, Irish Aid will continue to achieve its intended purpose.  It is important that objectives be narrow and expectations modest.  In this context, it is worth noting that the United Nations elected Ireland and Kenya to co-chair the sustainable development goals initiative, which established 17 wide-ranging goals, namely, ending poverty, ending hunger and achieving food security, ensuring healthy lives, ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education, achieving gender equality, ensuring availability and sustainable water and sanitation for all, ensuring access to affordable reliable energy, promoting inclusive sustainable economic growth, building resilient infrastructure, reducing inequality within and among countries, making cities and human settlement inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable, ensuring sustainable consumption and production patterns, targeting urgent action to combat climate change, conserving and sustainably using oceans, seas and marine resources, protecting and restoring ecosystems, promoting peaceful and inclusive societies and strengthening the means of implementation, as well as revitalising the global partnership for sustainable development.<br\/><br\/>Ireland's association with Kenya for over 100 years shows how these sustainable development goals have been addressed.  Irish Aid's structured engagement with Kenya has helped elevate our country from a least developed economy to a middle-income economy, according to the World Bank's latest estimates of 2015.  Ireland played a role in this process, by harnessing the developmental programmes from the grassroots in rural Kenya, assisting in the provision of education, health and environmental improvement and sustenance.  In a small but effective way, the benefits of these interventions are felt across Kenya through an association that spans over a century.  Through missionary work carried out in diverse sectors of the nation of Kenya, Ireland remains one of the most respected partners in the national well-being of the Kenyan people and continues to play an integral part in the development objectives of the nation.  Some of the organisations and individuals funded by Irish Aid include Concern Worldwide, World Vision, Tr&oacute;caire, Christian Aid, Aidlink, Aidspan, Gorta-SeIf HeIp Africa, Camara, Cara Girls Rescue Centre, Brighter Communities Worldwide, Westport-Aror (Kenya) Partnership and Friends from Ireland. <br\/><br\/> The re-opening of the Embassy of Ireland and appointment of the ambassador in 2014 greatly boosted co-operation between Kenya and Ireland.  This has been done through defined objectives and the participation of Irish Aid in funding networking sessions, trade mission visits, participation in programmes such as the Young Scientists Kenya award scheme, which was launched on 15 July 2017 by the cabinet secretary for education with the Irish ambassador and Professor Tony Scott, founder of Young Science and Technology Exhibition (Ireland) in attendance, and which is funded through Irish Aid.  The programme is targeted at the secondary school children to incentivise the children to take up leaning of science in school.  Engagement with the Business Ireland Kenya, BIK, network group, has helped to grow opportunities between Ireland and Kenya.<br\/><br\/> During his recent visit to Kenya, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, stated: <\/p><blockquote>Ireland and Kenya have an excellent bilateral relationship built on strong historical ties and people to people links.  This positive legacy means that it is natural and easy for Irish and Kenyan people to do business for the mutual benefit of both countries.  <br \/><br \/>It is clear that there are significant opportunities for Ireland and Kenya to increase trade and strengthen business to business relationships, based on sharing expertise in sectors which are hugely important to both countries; such as agriculture, food, health and education.  The Irish Embassy in Nairobi is playing a pivotal role, along with the Business Ireland Kenya network and Enterprise Ireland, to seize on these opportunities. <\/blockquote><p>I will give some examples of these opportunities.  In agriculture, Teagasc and the Kenya Agricultural Livestock and Research Organization, KALRO, in 2016 signed a memorandum of understanding to further research into finding the best methodology to improve yields in both animal husbandry and crop production.  Several researchers have already been trained at the Teagasc facility.  In education, several memorandums of understanding have been signed between Dublin Institute of Technology and Kenyatta University, University College Dublin and Pwani University, Maasai Mara University and the University of Limerick, Riara University and Griffith College, Dublin covering a wide and diverse educational program that will benefit students in Kenya and Ireland on commenced student exchange programmes.<br\/><br\/>In fisheries, a memorandum of understanding was signed recently between the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries and the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority and the Marine Institute in Ireland, which will open up the entire programme and will revisit the economic stimulus programme that had been started by the Government of Kenya in both inland and oceanic fisheries research and development of the industry, which has great potential.<br\/><br\/> Ireland, through Irish Aid, has continually addressed with Kenya the 17 sustainable development goals.  The programmes which are being funded adhere to the development goals of provision to Kenyans across the board and in far-flung areas for more than 100 years.<br\/><br\/>As the World Bank has raised Kenya's status to a middle-income economy, development funding could decline but this should not happen.  As a regional power house, Kenya plays an important role in the economic and social growth of her neighbours, which, for the most part, continue to receive aid for humanitarian assistance and environmental management including food security.  In respect of organisations such as Irish Aid and the many people of good will who give of themselves in humanitarian and voluntary aid and charity work from Ireland, hope is the best strategy.  We hope the programmes which have begun will not dissipate as people of good grow old and weary, funding dies up and children, women and men of advanced years have their dreams shattered.  We hope that there will be continued and sustained aid from Irish Aid as Kenya develops.<br\/><br\/>Kenya continues to make great strides in ensuring the people are the principal beneficiaries of all progress as defined by the Vision 2030 development strategy, the provisions as defined in the 2010 Constitution, the devolved system of governance and the sharing of national resources across all counties.  There are 47 counties funded by the national government for grassroots development programmes and projects in the sectors, aimed at growing their potential to improve the people's well-being.  It is through this and the recalibration of the economic goals in Kenya, that together with Ireland and Irish Aid, much has been achieved, as I have outlined here and as the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, noted on his visit to Kenya.  While in Nairobi last month, the Minister participated in a panel discussion with approximately 30 representatives of Kenyan and Irish businesses representing the Business Ireland Kenya network to discuss opportunities for increasing trade and co-operation between Ireland and Kenya in the coming years, focusing on the education, health care, agrifood and ICT sectors.  Together with the Kenyan cabinet secretary for agriculture, livestock and the marine, he launched a new Ireland-Kenya agrifood strategy, which will be delivered through a Team Ireland approach led by the Irish Embassy in Nairobi in close co-operation with Teagasc and Enterprise Ireland.<\/p><p>The strategy will support the creation of two new trading opportunities for Irish companies interested in the Kenyan market.<\/p><p> The Minister witnessed the signing of two memoranda of understanding between the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries in Kenya and the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority and the Marine Institute in Ireland.  These agreements relate to the commitment to joint co-operation between Ireland and Kenya in fisheries training, the development of aquaculture and increasing trade in fish and fishery products.  The Minister also announced the awarding of grants to three Irish businesses through a joint initiative between Ireland's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine called the Africa agri-food development programme.  This joint initiative aims to build innovative partnership with Kenyan businesses in agrifood that will yield benefits both for businesses and smallholder farmers.  <\/p><p> The Minister witnessed the signature of three business-to-business agreements between Irish and Kenyan companies.  These are an agreement between International Potato Marketing based in Donegal and Kevian Kenya which provides for the supply of high yielding varieties of certified potato seed from Ireland that will be made available to Kenyan farmers, an agreement between Griffith College and Riara University which formalises plans for student exchanges and an agreement between Irish company Vitro Software, its local partner Savannah Informatics and Nairobi Hospital.  The agreement formalises an agreement for Vitro Software to install and provide support services for computer software at Nairobi Hospital.  He also presented computer literacy certificates to clients of the International Computer Driving Licence, ICDL, Africa.  ICDL is a fully owned subsidiary of European Computer Driving Licence based in Dublin.  He opened the new East Africa offices of MagGrow.  MagGrow is an Irish company that has pioneered the development of a magnetic spraying system for the horticulture industry which greatly improves spraying efficiency, cuts costs, reduces water usage and improves consumer safety.<\/p><p> This shows that there is much to be done in continued support and funding of growth oriented and self-sustaining projects and programmes with which both Ireland and Kenya can associate for a further 100 years of cordial, respectful, progressive and beneficial engagement.  As Kenya moves to become an oil exporting nation, thanks to the exploratory prowess of Tullow Oil, we seek guidance in the extractive and construction sectors in this new industry and the ripple effect that will come from it.  There is also the meeting on the sustainable development goals that the United Nations are having our two nations co-facilitate.  The trade and development arm of Irish Aid will be of huge benefit in areas of education, factoring in the engineering capacities of Ireland and her large worldwide network of experience.  Ireland's capacity in renewable energy, environmental preservation, agricultural technical knowledge, health provision, information and communications technology, financial management, to mention but a few, are areas which will require assistance to grow capacity in Kenya.  Kenya looks to maintain the well-established engagement with Irish Aid in to new development for the overall benefit of both the Irish and Kenyan people.<\/p><p> I thank the Chairman and members of the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017111600002#L00500","nonspeaker":"H.E. Mr. Richard Opembe","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510824600,"counter":1919,"content":"<p>I am honoured and privileged to make a presentation on the account of Irish Aid Ethiopia and thank the Chairman for the invitation.  This presentation does not purport to capture all the details of invaluable contributions Irish Aid Ethiopia has been rendering in the past 25 years.  For the same reason, I would like to make it clear that only the significant nature of the partnership could be underlined today.<\/p> <p>  I will begin by highlighting some facts about Ethiopia which concern the nature of the supports we seek.  The Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia is located in the Horn of Africa which is now known as \"troubled one\".  With a population approaching 105 million, in Africa it is the second largest populous nation next to Nigeria.  Ethiopia is a federal republic of nine regional states.  A parliamentary system has been embraced for the past couple of decades and a half with a five-year first past the post periodic election.  This is currently under negotiation with Ethiopian opposition political parties to try a mix of one that is first past the post and a representational system.  It has a bicameral system.  The lower house is called the Parliament and the upper house is the House of Federation, where each nationalities have a minimum of one seat and continues to add one for every additional million in its population.  Therefore, the Ethiopian federal system is based on multicultural pluralism.  Such a system empowers the community to be masters of their own destiny and also boosts this kind of development through their efforts.  <\/p> <p>  Ethiopia and Ireland have enjoyed a robust relationship.  It is to be recalled that both countries opened their embassies soon after the agreement on diplomatic relations - Ireland in 1994 and Ethiopia in 1995.  Several exchanges of visits have been made at various levels of the leadership of both countries.  The exchange of visits by leaders of the two nations is worth noting as a testimony of our cordial relationship.  Ethiopia took the lead and the late Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Meles Zenawi, visited Ireland in 2002.  His Excellency Michael D. Higgins also visited Ethiopia in 2014 which further uplifted the co-operation.  During this visit three pivotal agreements were signed: one on air transport co-operation, one on the avoidance of double taxation and tax evasion and one on development co-operation for the next 20 years.  The current visit by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade will also enrich the robust relationship.  Ethiopia has been one of the priority countries and a major recipient of Irish Aid.  Ethiopia has always appreciated the nature of Irish Aid as it has not been hedged by a maze of conditionalities.  Ireland has also been considered a true friend as it stood with the Ethiopian people through thick and thin.  The relationship is based on mutual respect and co-operation.  Thus, the nature of Irish Aid is considered a manifestation of such a cordial vibe.  <\/p> <p>  To come to the specifics of the relevance of Irish Aid, it is imperative to touch on the economy of Ethiopia.  The Ethiopian economy is largely agrarian.  Agriculture is mostly based on small holding farming where a farmer has on average 0.5 to 1 ha.  Apart from the smaller size of the land, productivity was also very much lower.  Moreover, besetment of erratic weather makes crop seasons unpredictable.  Therefore, to offset the subsistence produce hampered due to the meagre size of land and the freak nature of rain, recourse to water harvesting mechanism has been a matter of no choice.  Such undertaking allows farmers produce two to three times a year.  It appears approximately every four seasons.  There is a rainy season, a season during which the rain comes and goes frequently, and there is a dry season.  If we use water harvesting mechanisms, we can produce three times a year.  This leads the farmer to produce a surplus which will go to the market and this will bring about betterment for the peasants of Ethiopia.<\/p> <p>  Despite the fact that it was theoretically believed and practically proved such a mechanism helps farmers to produce surplus, it is not yet widely practised by the majority.  Regardless of all the coddling and prodding, it is not yet scaled up as much as the matter calls for, although encouraging trends are currently being witnessed.  Hence it still requires aggressive awareness creation and capacity building from the grassroots.  The need for Irish Aid comes in here, and Irish Aid is there.  It is playing a pivotal role in helping farmers to bring about resilience.<\/p> <p>  Community health is a variable that can be factored in when the productivity of a community is a subject in question.  It is believed that 80% of diseases have to do with personal hygiene and environmental sanitation.  The Government of Ethiopia believes that the community and every household could produce its own health.  It was therefore with such a profound conviction that the Government of Ethiopia came up with an all-encompassing community health extension strategy where about 40,000 front-line health extension workers are trained and helping the community by going house-to-house.  This has been bringing about profound strides forward.   The central plank of the strategy is prevention of diseases rather than treatment.  Time is crucial and can be instrumental to production and resources which cannot be wasted for treatment in hospital are scarce.  Irish Aid is also a partner in such a fundamental health sector development and this is widely appreciated.<\/p><p> Education is another crucial aspect of development.  It is both the engine and the result of fighting poverty apart from the fact that it is a development in its own right.  Just two and half decades ago access to primary education in Ethiopia was only about 20% and there were only two universities in the entire nation.  The country has had formal education for only 100 years.  Today, the Millennium Development Goal, MDG, in primary education in Ethiopia has been achieved in breakneck fashion.  The number of universities has grown from two to 45 in just a couple of decades.  In addition, about 30 million Ethiopians attend schools, which is a stupendous achievement.  Alas, a lot remains to be done in secondary education, in particular, and to ensure quality in general. <\/p><p> Overcoming a challenge does not end there as success only poses yet another challenge.  Success in creating access to education coupled with the diminished size of land engendered unemployment pressure.  Therefore, recourse to off-farm job creation schemes has become vital.  Irish Aid also plays a role as a partner in the above solutions that are meant to boost resilience and productivity for the population at grassroots.<\/p><p> Ireland is known for its success in education and its ongoing endeavour to support Ethiopian universities is worth mentioning.  Such support could be more fruitful if Irish universities were encouraged to twin with their Ethiopian counterparts with the aim of building institutional capacity and taking a university in its entirety.  There are signs of such initiatives by individual universities, a situation which must be encouraged. <\/p><p> Poverty alleviation will not materialise without improving the productivity of a small sized country, improving the health of the population, ensuring access to education and without heavy investment in infrastructure.  These are deemed pro-poor sectors to which the bulk of the budget in Ethiopia goes.  Irish Aid, as mentioned earlier, plays its fair share in improving agricultural productivity and building resilience.  The people of Ireland have also extended their right hand to alleviate the plight of the millions of Ethiopians who struggle to extricate themselves out of the rut at the bottom of the socio-economic ladder.  I also wish to mention the safety net programme and relief aid.<\/p><p> Ethiopia has made significant strides and has become one of the fastest growing economies in the world.  It has enjoyed growth of between 8% and 10% for the past 15 years.  It is one of the best performers in human development even though it began from a very low base.  Half of the population used to live below the poverty line.  In 1996, it was 46% but over 20 years that percentage has been reduced to 23%.  Irish Aid has played its fair share in that achievement. <\/p><p> Ethiopia's current performance of rapid economic growth is aimed to continue under a climate resilient green economy.  Massive re-afforestation and community-based nationwide water catchment treatment is aggressively taking place in all regions.  Also, the supply of energy efficient technologies to avoid using more firewood is under implementation.  The generation of energy from renewable sources like hydro power, thermal energy and wind energy has become the focus of the government, which has heavily invested in same.  I wish to note that Irish Aid has given to energy efficient technology for households<\/p><p> Ethiopia has about 800,000 refugees from south Sudan, Somalia and Eritrea.  Ethiopia also plays a pivotal role in peacekeeping in the Horn of Africa and Africa at large.  I wish to mention the support that Irish Aid provides to refugees and call for it to be broadened.  To cut a long story short, it would not be an overstatement to attest that Irish Aid's support is in line with Ethiopia's priority.  Irish Aid's successive country strategic plans address and buttress the Ethiopian national successive five-year plans to reduce poverty, alleviate poverty and growth and transformation plans I and II.  For the aforementioned reasons Irish Aid contributes positively to the nation's endeavours to bring about a better life for the many poor. <\/p><p> Ethiopia has made commendable strides in the past two decades.  Rapid social and economic growth has been registered.  Nevertheless, the country is not yet out of the woods given the level of poverty and the dire need to ensure the structured transformation of the economy.  Thus, Irish Aid has still a bigger role to play.  A continuous support for farmers with smallholdings to boost their productivity remains crucial in this regard. <\/p><p> The support that has begun in potato production in the southern region has proven successful and needs to be broadened.  Ireland can also extend its support to help Ethiopia make the best use of its huge but hitherto unproductive livestock.  As much as 70% of the Ethiopian population is under the age of 30.  Rapid educational access has been a significant success; it is an aspect of human development and poses increasing pressure.  Both skilled and semi-skilled labourers need jobs.  To rub salt into the wound, land in the central, northern and parts of southern Ethiopia have  become too small to be further divided among new generations of family members thus creating a mounting and urgent pressure.  Off-farm job creation has become non-elective.  It would be much appreciated if Irish Aid could widen its support in this regard. <\/p><p> Universities in Ethiopia could serve as incubation centres for innovative job creation and make use of the growing access to tertiary education.  The University College Dublin has began an impressive initiative with Wolaita Sodo University of Ethiopia, which has received EU funding under the Building Resilience Through Education, BRTE, Horizon 2020.  Such partnership needs to be nurtured and scaled up. <\/p><p> Ethiopia has become one of the growing destinations for foreign direct investment.  Private sector investment both in manufacturing and agriculture is growing but has not reached its full potential.  The missing link is small and medium-sized enterprises that could have broadened the industrial base of the domestic private sector.  Therefore, Irish Aid could encourage the Irish private sector to venture into investment and avail of the myriad of joint venture possibilities.  Ethiopia has massively invested in special investment zones whereby an investor can rent a shed and start manufacturing without the need to tie up its start-up capital.<\/p><p> In addition to enhancing aid in the ongoing sectors, job creation through private sector engagement would have manyfold advantages.  Therefore, the initiative operating in Ireland to enhance trade and investment partnerships with Africa needs to be accentuated.  In addition to the Africa-Ireland business forum, it would be more practical if a tailored one could be considered bilaterally.  It would mean that business communities in both countries would have opportunities to make acquaintances and form partnerships.  The commencement of the frequent Ethiopian Airlines passenger and cargo flight could be considered a colossal augmentation for the venture.  It is worth mentioning, in conjunction with such a case, the need for rapid inward and outward travelling by the private sector.  The time it takes to secure a visa to come to Ireland for our business community is too long.  It would further beef up co-operation if consideration was given to ways to expedite the process. <\/p><p> Finally, I reiterate our appreciation for what Irish Aid and the people of Ireland have done to help Ethiopia.  Ethiopia now has the opportunity to conduct business and investment which benefits itself and others.  I believe that continuing assistance and the broadening of opportunities is the way forward. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017111600002#N00200","nonspeaker":"H.E.

The last ambassador, at the end of his presentation, mentioned the impact a young population has on the sub-division of land holdings.

It was very interesting to hear what they had to say.  Some of my questions are common to both.  One concerns the political situations in each country, for example, the difficulties surrounding the election in Kenya.  I was very struck that in the recent elections in Ethiopia, the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front, EPRDF, won every single seat.  While it must be great for a political party to have no opposition it is not a very healthy situation.  Both countries are coping with refugees on top of all the other challenges they face.  It would be interesting to hear about their work in that area.<\/p> <p>  No doubt population is a serious issue and the ambassadors mentioned access to reproductive health measures.  Are they accepted or is there opposition to them, for example on ethnic or religious grounds?<\/p> <p>  I know more about Kenya because I know our ambassador, Vinnie O'Neill, and the work he has been doing to build trade.  It is opportune that Ireland launched its human rights and business report yesterday.  Sometimes when we are pushing trade we do not consider workers' rights, the right to decent work and living standards.  It is important that we do not lose sight of that in considering trade.<\/p> <p>  I have been to Nairobi, and have been around the slum areas, as they are called.  The people there told me these are their communities; they are not slums.  I have seen the work that goes on there and the resilience of the people.  They are sometimes threatened with being cleared to make way for development and they are losing their homes and communities.  <\/p> <p>  Can the Ambassador from Ethiopia talk about his relationship with Somaliland, as opposed to Somalia?  I know it has difficulty getting recognition but it is trying to be a democratic country and its elections passed off peacefully.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017111600002#P00200","speaker":"1291"},{"type":"speech","time":1510824600,"counter":1925,"content":"<p>Two of the projects from Deputy O'Sullivan's area were originally in my constituency.  I am aware of the Harambee project.  The ambassador from Kenya visited the Institute of Technology in Tallaght to talk about that.  I think it means in Swahili 'all pull together'.  We are talking about our two countries pulling together and the idea that it is not just one-way traffic but that we work together and pass ideas back and forth.  South Dublin County Council ran a project in the Waribi area in Ethiopia.  Local authority workers went back and forth and council staff and councillors put part of their income towards funding it.  There was that sort of interaction, with people travelling back and forth and learning from each other.  There was a lot of positivity about that.  People brought back their own stories about the relationship and the friendships that will go on forever and be passed on to others.<\/p> <p>  Irish Aid is involved in both countries.  What are the Kenyan Government's thoughts on how Irish Aid interacts and works with it, compared with other European aid organisations - for example, Irish Aid is not tied?  Both ambassadors spoke about conditionality.  How important is that in the context of Irish Aid?  Are there any specific areas on which they would like Irish Aid to focus?<\/p> <p>  I recall the lack of fisheries protection in Tanzania.  European trawlers come in and strip the sea of tuna.  How important would a partnership approach and greater European funding be in that region?<\/p> <p>  The World Bank recently classified Kenya as a lower middle income country.  It was previously ranked low income.  Given the country's increasing income and the growing middle class, how important does the Government feel it is that the wealth is shared?  <\/p> <p>  What is the impact of climate change and the east African food crisis on Kenya?  I am interested in the political situation.  There have been all sorts of allegations in the media of excessive police force and so on.  Are these cases being investigated?  It would be important for Irish people to know they are supporting a country that is clear about democracy, and that goes for Ethiopia too.  <\/p> <p>  Are there any specific issues on which Ethiopia would like Irish Aid to focus?  Ethiopia has become one of the fastest growing economies, with a growth of 8% to 10% in the past 15 years.  That is phenomenal growth.  Has the government there been able to use the wealth to tackle inequality?  How much is Ethiopia affected by climate change?  <\/p> <p>  There were 880,000 refugees from south Sudan, Somalia and Eritrea in Ethiopia.  What support does Ethiopia get from the international community?  Do the Ethiopian people support the decision to host these refugees or is there resentment there?

I am old enough to remember the introduction of free education in this country.  That was the one single change that transformed Ireland.  The ambassador spoke about smallholdings and large families trying to make a living from an impossible situation.  Free education in Ireland allowed the children of those families to move on and get involved in other activities and professions which reduced the dependence on the smallholding.  It is only just over 50 years since we introduced free education but it was the single biggest action that brought us forward.  Are there any indications in either country that Kenya or Ethiopia is considering a similar move?  It may sound expensive but in the long term it is very cheap.  Based on my practical experience and my years in politics, no matter who is in government I stress that once the people are educated they will progress very rapidly.  In the late 1950s and early 1960s Ireland was a very poor country.  It has changed in the space of 50 years and I put that down to free education.<\/p><p>Has any consideration been given in either country to taking that step?

Deputy Darragh O'Brien asked where Irish Aid will go.  It will go towards education, which as Deputy Barrett has ably said, is crucial.  In answering this matter I will also address some of the previous questions.  Kenya already has a programme of free primary education and is now moving towards free secondary education.  We hope that university education will also be free within the next five years.  This is a central area in which we would like to see the co-operation of Irish Aid.  It is a focal point for the Government that education now become the critical tool to open up all of the other spaces in our country.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the situation around human rights and refugees, the Kenyan constitution gives great prominence to human rights.  In every aspect of the constitution the individual is granted prime importance, be they Kenyan or otherwise.  Kenya hosts two major refugee camps, Dadaab and Kakuma,  and Irish Aid has played a central role in assisting with them.  The current political climate in Kenya is essentially based on the constitution in that we have systems and institutions that can make decisions that are obeyed politically.  We have human rights access for any organisation that comes in to provide positive information and guidance to ensure that we can articulate our human rights as per our constitution.  With regard to our slums and other poor communities, through our constitution which was promulgated in 2010, we have created 47 counties, each funded by the national Government.  It is through this funding that the counties articulate their own development agenda as well as that of the national Government.  Almost &euro;60 million per year is given to the counties to allow them become responsible for managing and developing themselves. <\/p> <p>  In response to Deputy Crowe, the motto \"Harambee\",or \"Let us all pull together\", has been a clarion call for Kenya since the 1960s.  Education and agriculture come to the fore of the areas in which we would look to Irish Aid to sustain. Agriculture encompasses fisheries and, as I mentioned in my statement, a number of memoranda of understanding have been signed in the fisheries and agricultural sectors.  Funding for many of these programmes will have a limiting aspect.  No tangible research has been done, for example, to identify what fish stocks we might have in our oceanic space along the Mombassa coast into the Indian Ocean.  Our economic stimulus programme built 3,000 ponds around the country for inland fishing and acquaculture purposes, but funding was, and indeed remains a challenge today.  It is hoped that now, by virtue of the fact that we have signed several memoranda of understanding in this sector, we can start moving into these areas. <\/p> <p>  With regard to environmental matters, our environment ministry has increased our forest cover.  This was certainly a challenge as parts of Kenya are becoming semi-arid due to deforestation.  One of the reasons why we are looking at the set-up of the Dadaab camp, for example, is that the high number of refugees accommodated there is having a negative impact on the environment of the region.  The camp is causing the loss of tree cover because most of the trees have been cut down and used for firewood.  When one is housing 300,000 to 400,000 people in one space, providing the energy requirement for cooking and so forth becomes a challenge.  We hope that Irish Aid will be able to help look at these factors and see how we can best address them.<\/p> <p>  Police harassment is not something that happens willfully, certainly in so far as we as a Government are concerned.  The problems lies in the definition of what people do to have the police stop a situation before it gets out of control.  Demonstrations, for example, are actually enshrined in the constitution, meaning citizens can picket or go on strike.  In the certain instances where people take advantage of these situations, however we find hooligans and thieves.  People who might have no good will towards expressing themselves start attacking the property of others and the police have to move in to quell the situation before it gets out of hand.  The committee may have heard of situations in which entire supermarkets were broken into.  That is not an expression but rather an abuse of a right or of a human right.  <\/p> <p>  I return to the question of free education.  As I said, since 2010 we have been working towards providing free education up to university level.   We are somewhat behind Ireland in this regard but if we follow the same path and receive guidance and assistance from well-wishers like Irish Aid we will then be able to factor in a free education programme that will be sustainable right the way through, meaning that we will have no cutting of links within the funding parameters.  <\/p> <p>  Looking at Government policy around development goals as based on the sustainable goals initiatives,  the Government is looking to prioritise four of the total 17 areas involved here. One of these priorities is the access to water and sanitation, irrespective of whether people are living in a slum or otherwise.  We are also looking at environmental aspects, because a clean environment will ensure a healthy flow of water which will in turn reduce the spread of disease-causing germs.  As I mentioned at the outset, there was a high occurrence of malaria and everything that comes with it.<\/p><p>Education will play a key role also, in access to a quality education.  It is good to have a free primary or secondary programme or a university programme, but if it is not a quality programme, it becomes a challenge.<\/p><p> How do we increase food security and ensure there is enough food for people to have sufficient nutrition, which is a major challenge in many countries.  We are tackling that issue in Kenya and we are examining ways to ensure that by the application of our Vision 2030 we will meet the sustainable goals initiatives that have been set forth.  We hope by 2030 to have achieved 90% if not 100% of them. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017111600002#Q00300","nonspeaker":"H.E.

I will address some of the issues which must be seen as a matter of fact.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the political situation and the number of seats won by the ruling party and also the conditions that could be considered to broaden that space, there are some factors that must be accepted but are not generally understood.  If one looks at the Ethiopian political experience, there are about 74 opposition parties in Ethiopia.  In one constituency where the contenders could run, there are about 11 or 12 contenders to avoid dropping out above the contender list so that the vote could not be fractured.  There are about 12 contenders in one constituency.  There is a ruling party EPRDF and there could be about 11 others.  Because our system of election is first past the post, then the ruling party gets 49% of the vote, 51% goes to opposition parties, so literally the ruling party lost, technically, but actually the ruling party wins, because the remaining 51% of the vote would be dispersed among 11 other opposition parties.  That is not the making of the ruling party but the nature of our fledgling democracy.  Ideas and ideals are not yet crystallised.  Political parties can be formed in response to the kind of issues which people think is relevant for them.  When we progress, many political parties will wither away and the others will consolidate, as has happened in other developing democracies.  The present 75 parties may become four or five or even two bigger parties.  In any one constituency there are at least 12 contestant parties, so whatever vote the electorate could cast, it would be divided among the political parties.  The ruling party benefits from that advantage.<\/p> <p>  At the last election, the EPRDF party on aggregation got only about 70% of the votes.  There were about 1 million voters and about 700,000 only voted for EPRDF and 300,000 did not vote for it.  If one looks at that, they are 546 of seats and EPRDF could have lost four or five seats, but they did not because the remainder of the votes would be divided among the other 11 opposition parties and they would not get an aggregate vote, so that they gain a seat.  People could not vote 100% for EPRDF.  If one goes to rural areas, this is true in almost all urban areas, but the strong base for the ruling party is in rural areas.  When there was not a consensus, the farmers would not vote 100% for the ruling party, but again because of the fractured opposition parties which could not merge their ideas and voting cards so that they can aggregate the vote and take certain seats,  That was a fact that we could not correct because of the nature of our emerging democracy.<\/p> <p>  What are we doing to offset this difficulty?  The first past the post election system has no problem with regard to the rights of citizens to vote, but we still we have a gap.  Opposition parties, even though they get a vote across the country, would not be able to come into the Parliament.  There is a debate and negotiation in Ethiopia to consider a mix.  All the votes across the nation could be added up for both the ruling and the Opposition parties and then one will see the percentage share of the vote.  A certain percentage would determine the Opposition seats, because this was taking account of the entire vote of the nation, rather than looking at only one constituency.  It is democratic because the citizens have cast their vote for the Opposition parties, but there is the disadvantage of the fractured Opposition parties.  To offset that difficulty, the mixed system was agreed last week.  Some 20% will be for mixed parties, the remaining percentage of the vote will be for those first past the post.  The mixed party vote could be tested for a certain period and then I think it would open up the presence of opposition parties in the Parliament.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the equitability of the Ethiopian growth, when there is rapid economic growth, there is a challenge to keep it equitable.  If one looks at the nature of growth, it is based on agriculture and on the smallholding farmer and whatever increment in the economy comes the bulk of the growth comes through the achievement of smallholding farmers.  Even though we are saying that productivity is not up to expectation, because there could be 120 quintals per hectares, on average the productivity of one hectare is about 28 quintals, most farmers have reached 18 quintals, and somewhat better ones approached 40 to 50 quintals.  If we manage to help all the farmers, we would have about 18 million farmers with land.  If their productivity would approach 70 or 80 quintals per hectare we would produce a surplus, some of which could be brought to market.  One of things we have to do is to keep on building their capacity so that they can improve their farming practices and use the modern seeds and technologies.  If we were to keep on doing that, equitability would remain.  The growth in the economy would come from the grassroots, because every income that goes to the household of the peasants is equitable by its nature.  If one looks at the GIN coefficient it is about 0.3%; it is one of the most equitable economies that we have.  We are facing a challenge  We have companies that keeps on growing, the private sector is coming in and some of the private sector companies would have a significant accumulation of resources greater than the average of the grassroots.  Then it is being pushed to be skewed to the benefit of the few.  The base is broader.  Even though we can still have the room to keep it equitable, there is a challenge because of this fast nature.<\/p> <p>  The other issue is climate resilience, we have a strategy to reach a zero emission in 2030.  For that we are trying to afforest the nation widely.  The percentage of forestry in Ethiopia was 2% 20 years ago.  Now it about 15%.  If some of the committee members had a chance to visit Tigray, they would have seen that the majority of the land had become barren, now there has been massive afforestation and water catchment treatments in the past 30 years even before the coming of the ruling party.  The barren land has been revitalised and the lost streams are coming.  The forest is now coming and the land is being used for cultivation.<\/p><p>The nature of the land is changing.  That practice is widespread across the nation and the percentage of forest is growing.<\/p><p> The other aspect with regard to manufacturing is that we are focusing on lower emissions industries, particularly agri-industries.  With regard to our industrial zones, Hawassa industrial zone, which was commissioned last year, has zero release of waste liquid.  Some 99% of that waste can be treated and it does not pollute the environment.  Another aspect is energy.  We are investing massively in energy, in particular hydropower, thermal energy and wind energy, so we can export to neighbouring countries.  We have begun to export to Djibouti and Sudan and we have an agreement with Kenya that energy will go to Tanzania, Rwanda and Burundi.  Therefore, not only Ethiopia but other countries also will use this renewable energy source so they can avoid polluting energy sources.  The other aspect I mentioned was that of the energy efficient technologies that can reduce the use of firewood and boost the resilience of the green economy.<\/p><p> Reference was made to Somaliland, which is a tricky issue.  There is a hope of exercising some democratic ethos and the whole of Somalia could learn from that exercise and prevent the rifts that could be created through lack of democracy.  When it comes to recognition, Ethiopia would act in line with the standards of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, IGAD, and the African Union.  No other country in Africa would act bilaterally to recognise any part of a certain country.  Maintaining the peace and unity of the entirety of Somalia and then helping it to overcome this challenge would be the burden of all Africans.  The African Union and IGAD are trying their level best to hold the country together by solving the problems which have been creating a rift between the different societies of Somalia. <\/p><p> There are areas where Ireland could assist us on the way forward.  One aspect is to keep helping the farmers to bring about efficiency and to enhance their productivity, which has begun but needs to be boosted.  The other point is that land is not the only way.  As I said, in some parts of Ethiopia land-holdings have become too small to be sustainably used.  As a result, off-farm activities and other sources could be considered, for example, beekeeping and other activities.  This process has begun and Irish Aid is helping in this regard.  However, this has to be scaled up because only a small number of youths are using these opportunities.  The number of youths is very large and the demographic challenge is growing.  Unless we use off-farm economic activities, simply tilling the land will not sustain the society, particularly in the central and northern parts of Ethiopia.  As it stands, the situation is pretty volatile.<\/p><p> Another issue is job creation through business and investment.  Ethiopia is producing raw materials and agricultural products which could be exported.  If we enhance this business and trade, first, it would help job creation, and, second, those who produce would get the benefits and would keep on producing because they are selling into the economy, rather than using production just for domestic consumption, and this would enhance their incentive to produce more.  If we keep enriching business, trade and investment, this will create jobs and will also incentivise Ethiopian businesses to produce more.  What we export now is mainly agricultural produce and only a few foreign investors are coming in, for example, from China and Turkey, and the British are also now there.  These investors are interested in the export of certain leather and textile produce.  Until we diversify that, off-farm activities and getting the farmers to produce more are the imperatives.<\/p><p> The issue of free education was raised.  In Ethiopia, general education is already free at primary and secondary level.  When it comes to tertiary education, there is cost-sharing but the student only pays 15% of the cost and this is paid after graduation.  There are also certain holiday years so graduates can settle themselves and buy household items.  When their lives stabilise, they pay only 15% of the cost.  They do not have to pay before they receive their education but after graduation.  To repeat, general education is free and there is cost-sharing for tertiary education,  with the student paying 15% only after the education is completed and only after the person has a job and stays in that job a certain number of years.  This bolsters primary education because tertiary education is somewhat of a privilege when compared to the millions at the bottom and those who reach the top level have to pay a little of the cost so they can help their compatriots.  That is the rationale behind it but they do not have to pay before they get that education.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017111600002#R00300","nonspeaker":"H.E.
