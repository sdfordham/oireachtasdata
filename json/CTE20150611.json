Can I ask members and those in the public gallery to ensure that their mobile devices are switched off.  I would like to welcome everyone to the 32nd public hearing of the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis.  Today we continue our hearings with key figures from the Central Bank of Ireland and the Financial Regulator who had key roles during the crisis period.  At this morning's session we will hear from Mr. Liam O'Reilly, former CEO of the Financial Regulator.  Liam O'Reilly was assistant director general of the Central Bank of Ireland from 1998 and had been responsible for all of the Central Bank's financial supervision functions.  He was appointed interim chief executive at the Financial Regulator in November 2002, the chief executive in may 2003 until he retired in January 2006.<\/p> <p>  Mr O'Reilly, you are very welcome before the inquiry this morning and before we commence proceedings I wish to advise you that by virtue of section 17(2)(l) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If you are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and you continue to do so, you are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of your evidence.<\/p><p>You're directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  I would remind members and those present that there are currently criminal proceedings ongoing and further criminal proceedings are scheduled during the lifetime of the inquiry which overlap with the subject matter of the inquiry.  Therefore, the utmost caution should be taken not to prejudice those proceedings.  In addition, there are particular obligations of professional secrecy on officers of the Central Bank in respect of confidential information they have come across in the course of their duties.  This stems from European and Irish law, including section 33AK of the Central Bank Act 1942.  The banking inquiry also has obligations of professional secrecy in terms of some of the information which has been provided to it by the Central Bank.  These obligations have been taken into account by the committee and will affect the questions asked and the answers which can lawfully be given in today's proceedings.  In particular, it will mean that some information can be dealt with in a summary or aggregate basis only, such that individual institutions will not be identifiable.<\/p><p> Members of the public are reminded that photography is prohibited in the committee room.  To assist the smooth running of the inquiry, we will display certain documents on the screens here in the committee room.  For those sitting in the Gallery, these documents will be displayed on the screens to your left and right.  Members of the public and journalists are reminded that these documents are confidential and they should not publish any of the documents so displayed.<\/p><p> The witness has been directed to attend this meeting of the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis.  You have been furnished with booklets of core documents.  These are before the committee and will be relied upon in questioning and form part of the evidence to the inquiry.  So with that said, if I can now ask the clerk to administer the oath.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015061100002#B00100","speaker":"990","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1433977200,"counter":8,"content":"<p>The following witness was sworn in by the Clerk to the Committee:\r\n\r\nMr. Liam O'Reilly, former CEO, Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1433977200,"counter":9,"content":"<p>Once again, welcome, Mr. O'Reilly, this morning, and if I can invite you to make your opening remarks to the committee, please.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015061100002#C00300","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1433977200,"counter":10,"content":"<p>Before beginning my oral statement this morning, I would like to make the following two corrections to my written statements to the inquiry, dated 14 May 2015.: at page 2, section 1.2, paragraph 2, the second sentence should read: \"The other directors consisted of six Financial Regulator board members, together with five other members appointed by the Minister for Finance\"; (b) at page 5, section 2.5, last paragraph, the first sentence should read: \"Modest increases in capital requirements were agreed by the board in 2006 subsequent to my departure.\"<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015061100002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam O'Reilly"},{"type":"speech","time":1433977200,"counter":11,"content":"<p>Sorry, Chairman, I can't find the second one.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015061100002#C00500","speaker":"1129"},{"type":"speech","time":1433977200,"counter":12,"content":"<p>Just reference the second one again, Mr. O'Reilly, please.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015061100002#C00600","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1433977200,"counter":13,"content":"<p>Page 5, section 2.5, last paragraph.

First of all, I'd like to talk about principles-based regulation.  The approach of the Financial Regulator was that of a principles-based regime.  Such a regime was also the standard approach throughout Europe and was in line with the Basel capital requirements.  The approach was well known and enunciated by the Financial Regulator, and by Government, and publicly accepted.  It was the centrepiece of strategy of the Financial Regulator from the beginning.  The policy laid a heavy responsibility on the boards and senior managements of banks.  It demanded of them that they had high standards of corporate governance, a clear business risk policy, and risk controls in place to monitor and control that risk.  Resources in the Financial Regulator were based on that premise.  The Financial Regulator's main focus at the time was on determining the quality of corporate governance, including risk controls, within the bank.  An important aspect of corporate governance regime was that non-executive directors had a controlling role in the audit committee and remuneration committee.  The regime required direct reporting lines between both the internal auditor and external auditors to the board audit committees.<\/p><p>The Financial Regulator asserted its influence by requiring a financial institution to take remedial action as a result of findings of inspections or as a result of other issues that came to light or in some other way.  For example, issues might arise in the course of a review meeting with the bank during themed inspections, by a bank itself reporting a problem or by information supplied by the external auditor, the internal auditor or members of staff.  There was a view that taking over-aggressive action might cause reputational damage to a banking institution, with possible consequent contagion effects.  In general, the foregoing measures were seen as appropriate at the time.  The approach then adopted by the Financial Regulator in line with our principles-based approach was to expect a board would implement the necessary changes and in an expeditious manner.  With the benefit of hindsight, it is now clear that this system did not work.  More robust and intrusive measures should have been taken.  <\/p><p> At the time, the Financial Regulator was of the view that enforcement action would be more effective if there were in place a set of legally based codes and if administrative sanctions were applied for breaches of such codes.  The appropriate legislation for administrative sanctions was enacted in 2004.  The use of such sanctions was viewed as a more effective and lower key way of keeping non-compliant institutions in line.  The system of codes was well developed in the consumer area and where a set of consumer codes were being finalised in 2005, towards the end of my tenure.  Administrative sanctions would apply to breaches of the codes.  A sanction could range from an official caution to monetary penalties or a disqualification of a service provider.   In the prudential area, it was planned that sanctions would be imposed on institutions in the event of breaches of corporate governance codes and other codes.  Updated requirements were being developed in relation to being a fit and proper person to hold a senior position in a credit institution.  Directors' compliance statements were also being developed.  These were to be implemented following an extensive consultative period. <\/p><p> Resources in the Financial Regulator devoted to regulation were determined by the principles-based approach which was not as intrusive as the present system.  The idea was that the internal audit departments, risk committees and external auditors were to be leveraged to fulfil the role of the Financial Regulator.  The Irish principles-based system was endorsed by the IMF FSAP report published in 2006.  That report provided a favourable conclusion as to the adequacy and effectiveness of this system.  However, it is now internationally recognised that the principles-based regulatory system was flawed.  It failed, not only in Ireland, but worldwide.  As a result, regulatory systems are now more intrusive and aggressive.  Greater responsibility is being taken by financial regulators to ensure that adequate systems are in place to measure and mitigate risks.  The Basel II initiatives have also been completely revised to ensure that capital is adequate to cover for adverse and unforeseen circumstances.<\/p><p> The interrelationship between the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator: it was clearly set out in a memorandum of understanding between the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator that macro-prudential stability was the primary role of the Central Bank and micro-financial stability, i.e. the soundness of individual institutions, was the role of the financial regulators. Both of these parties were determined to make this system work.  This was our mandate under the law.   One of the most important elements for its success was to ensure that there was adequate information exchange.  To achieve this, the following mechanisms were in place: the CBFSAI board, chaired by the Governor, consisted of six Financial Regulator board members and five other board members.  The secretary of the Department of Finance was on the board.<\/p><p>All board papers of the Financial Regulator were circulated to senior management in the Central Bank and board minutes would have been made available to board members.  A paper entitled, &quot;Financial Regulator update&quot;, which reported on the activities of the Financial Regulator, was an item on the agenda of the monthly meetings of the CBFSAI board.  All pertinent areas of concern of the Financial Regulator were communicated orally to the board and board minutes on these items were recorded.  The offices of the Governor, the director general of the Central Bank, the CEO of the Financial Regulator and the prudential director were physically in close proximity to each other and day-to-day concerns would have been discussed as a matter of course.  The channels of communication were always kept open.  If any significant action was being contemplated, be it against a given bank or banks generally, such matters would have been brought to the attention of the Central Bank before implementation.<br\/><br\/>The effect of EMU on financial regulation: after the establishment of EMU, the Central Bank, the Financial Regulator and the banking system operated in an environment characterised by a strong exchange rate and low inflation, low interest rates.  Cheap credit was available to the banking system from Europe.  The control of credit growth, through changes in domestic interest rates, was no longer possible.  Because credit was cheap, there was an over-reliance on short-term lending from the EMU interbank market.  Customer deposits is usually the more stable source of liquidity as a proportion of balance sheets continued to contract.  Increasing reliance was being placed on large, commercial depositors which, by their nature, would have been more mobile.  EMU was formed without the provision of mechanisms for measuring and controlling risks, arising from aggregate euro credit flows, in terms of their destination and-or a concentration in certain sectors.  Therefore, the inherent risk of a financial stability problem on a pan-European basis, due to the build up of credit risk in certain sectors or countries, was neither being monitored nor controlled.  This was a fundamental flaw of the EMU system at its inception.  It was thought that individual countries could look after their own regulatory affairs and markets would do the rest.  This flaw has now been rectified.  Without the use of the interest rate tool, Ireland depended on euro interest rates changing favourably, changes in fiscal policy and moral suasion to rectify the situation over time.  By way of a macro-prudential policy instrument to replace interest rates, two options had been mentioned in the Honohan report and in evidence to this committee: change general capital requirements to reflect the increase in risk and the application of sectoral limits on a mandatory basis.  Subsequent to my departure, increases in capital requirements were applied to high loan-to-value mortgages and speculative property development in May 2006 and January 2007 respectively.  However, in terms of their effectiveness, to quote from the Honohan report, &quot;The measures were in reality also rather modest in their likely [effect].&quot;<br\/><br\/>Concerns about credit growth: the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator regularly voiced concerns in its publications, quarterly bulletins, annual reports, financial stability reports, about credit growth and the increase in personal indebtedness, particularly in property.  Concerns about commercial property lending were also voiced.  The following are two examples of public statements made by the Financial Regulator.  On 29 July 2005, the Financial Regulator warned about 100% mortgages, saying that they had to be appropriate to each borrower.  Clearly such mortgages were not appropriate to first-time buyers.  At the time, 100% mortgages were a very low proportion of mortgages provided.  A warning also was given on 26 July 2005 in the Financial Regulator's press statement at the launch of its reports ... of its report for the period 2003-2004:<blockquote>There is an increasing debate about the rapid growth in credit in the economy and I want to address this area as a matter that could cause concern in the future.  Along with the Central Bank, we are concerned about the rapid rise in the level of indebtedness in the economy and are well aware that if conditions changed adversely, many people could be severely affected. ... It is the responsibility of each financial institution to ensure that their credit standards, provisioning policies and levels of capital are appropriate to provide not only for today but in the event of a future downturn in the market. ... In short, institutions should only advance loans where they are confident [that their customers are ... have an] ability to repay.  They have the responsibility to inform their customers about the risks they are taking on borrowing large amounts of money and that they retain some flexibility to cope with changes in their personal circumstances like unemployment and higher interest rates.<\/blockquote><\/p><p>It is important to emphasise that, in making that statement, the Financial Regulator had no evidence that conditions might deteriorate to such a level that the banking system would succumb to a traumatic shock of the magnitude that occurred in 2008.<\/p><p> The following were the factors which provided comfort.  There were demographic and other structural reasons for the need for increased activity in the construction sector and the increase in the level of credit necessary.  However, a view emerged that property was becoming overvalued and there was a need for correction.  At the time of my departure, that correction appeared to be in train.  Fiscal policy was moving in the right direction - through the removal of incentives in the building industry - interest rates in Europe were set to rise and house prices were stabilising.  The regulator had no serious or imminent concerns about the solvency of any particular financial institution.  As the IMF Article IV report emphasised, Irish banks had sufficient buffers of capital to meet any shock that faced the system.  Annual stress tests reinforced this view.  Moreover, the general consensus in the market was that the Irish banking system was well capitalised and the Irish economy was healthy and growing.<\/p><p> General conclusions.  In hindsight, the principles-based approach to regulation had major shortcomings.  The Financial Regulator can no longer place the same degree of trust which it previously did in the boards and senior management of banks.  In future, the Financial Regulator must adopt a more intrusive and aggressive approach.  Moreover, the regulatory system did not appreciate the full extent of the credit exposures.  I deeply regret that these failures in the system were not recognised during my tenure in office.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015061100002#C00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam O'Reilly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1433977200,"counter":19,"content":"<p>Thank you very much, Mr. O'Reilly, for your opening statement.

In the case of banking supervision, certainly, what was happening was that the staff were ... were ... needed to be very specialised and, as a result of that, it was very, very difficult to continue to maintain the level of specialised staff.  It's a constant battle to keep good people on board.  In terms of numbers, I can say that, in 2000, the number of people in banking supervision was 32, I think; in 2005, it was 46.  Was it enough?

So, therefore, if there was to be a saving of an insolvent institution, the Government had to be involved.  So, I certainly felt at that stage, we need to get the Department of Finance involved in this process as quickly as possible.  That ... that's the only one now in terms of crisis.  Otherwise, we would have been talking about progress in legislation.  For instance, there was an issue once about the building societies Act and this thing about, you know, demutualisation of building societies and there was an anxiety to see that that progressed.  The administrative sanctions legislation, we would have been up there trying to get it passed as quickly as possible.  And even in the case of the 2003 bill, I remember being involved with the Department of Finance just talking about it.  So general business issues to do with the progress of legislation, I think, more than anything else.  Of course, as well as that, when our budgets started to go to the Department of Finance, we would have had an interaction with them then.  But just to emphasise on that side, there was never an issue about, you know, cutting budgets or anything like that.  It was more about how are we going to fund this?

I am going to reference some documents and they are actually up in front of you in a moment.  This is from Vol. 3 and it is page 40.  What we have here is an aggregate summary, it's in relation to the financial stability report of 2004 and it's the very end of the page there Mr. O'Reilly, where it says &quot;A number of risks to financial stability were highlighted in the report ... Irish banks growth rate 4 times that of the European average ... Irish banks accessing substantial funding from non-Irish sources ... continued increase in house prices [and] tax policy in favour of home ownership.&quot;  Just moving on further, there is a summary of the actual final stability report of 2004 and that moves to page 45 of the same document.  I just want to bring your attention to the end of col. 1, which is the heading, &quot;Household Sector&quot;.  Bear in mind this is for 2004, again during your tenure.  The &quot;Private-sector indebtedness, measured as the value of debt to gross domestic product ... has increased substantially since the mid-1990s and it is now at historically high levels&quot;.  Moving down then to what would the third paragraph on the second column it says:<blockquote><br \/><br \/>First-time house buyers are now more heavily indebted by comparison with their peers in the early and mid-1990s.  Consequently, the repayment burdens of first-time buyers have not fallen with the decline [of] variable mortgage interest rates, which are now at historically low levels, as households are opting [I maybe question the word &quot;opting&quot; here] for higher mortgage debt ... income ratios, higher loan-to-value ratios and\/or longer maturity loans.<\/blockquote>In layperson's language, this meant that the traditional way of buying a house over 20 years with three to four times one's income was now being pushed out in every conceivable way, 100% mortgages, loan-to-value ratios, the maturity levels over 35 years.  This is all happening under your watch and it is happening in 2004.  Can you give us an explanation as to how the standard, whatever about the standard banking model that was being referred to, I think by Deputy Higgins, and yourself earlier, where banks existed for 100 years.  In a very short period of time, peoples' ability to buy a home had been completely refigured into a new model, all at additional cost.  Even though interest rates now were historically low, it was still costing more to buy a house.  Can you explain to us why that happened during your tenure?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015061100002#CC03100","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1433977200,"counter":708,"content":"<p>I would say that my statement in the middle of 2005, which actually expressed those concerns and was saying that we were reaching the stage where institutions must make sure that people can afford this.

Thank you, Chairman.<br\/><br\/>In April 2002, I was asked to become the non-executive chairman of the interim Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority, which we know as IFSRA, by the Minister for Finance, and with involvement also of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  The authority was formally constituted in 2003 and I remained chairman until my term expired in April 2008.  Because it may come up later, Chairman, I should mention that as from October 2007, I was dealing with a serious illness.  As chairman of IFSRA, I was also, <i>ex officio<\/i>, a non-executive member of the board of the Central Bank.<br\/><br\/>In 2004, instead of the more cumbersome title Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority, it was decided to adopt in everyday usage the simpler term, &quot;Financial Regulator&quot;, to mean the whole organisation, and that is the meaning I shall use here.  In this statement, I'll also use the term &quot;authority&quot; to mean the board of the Financial Regulator and &quot;executive&quot; to mean the CEO and his staff.  I'll also refer to the board of the Central Bank.  <br\/><br\/>My job was to manage the authority, that is, the board, and to ensure that its non-executive group of independent, senior people worked well together and worked effectively with the executive in developing and approving policies, strategies, plans and initiatives.  The executive&rsquo;s job was to manage the organisation and to report to the authority on the ongoing work of regulation.  <br\/><br\/>The first line of defence against a bank&rsquo;s failure and the responsibility for protecting its safety and soundness lies squarely with the bank itself - its board, its management, its risk committee, its compliance officer; the second line of defence is the bank&rsquo;s auditors; the third line of defence, at that time, was the Financial Regulator, responsible for the prudential regulation of individual banks; and the fourth line of defence was the Central Bank, which retained responsibility for systemic financial stability.  In the banking crisis which befell us here in Ireland, all of these defences failed for complex and interrelated reasons. <br\/><br\/>As well as setting up a completely new organisation, the Financial Regulator achieved much in developing its consumer protection mandate, in implementing very complex EU directives, as well as regulating insurance, credit unions and the many other areas under its supervision.  However, it clearly failed in its duty to uphold the safety and soundness of Irish banks.  As chairman of the authority, I accept responsibility for my part in that failure.  It's something I regret deeply.  Had I known then what I know now, things could have been very different.The authority and the executive of the Financial Regulator took their responsibilities very seriously.  They were diligent, hard working and, at all times, acted in good faith.  Contrarian opinions were encouraged.  So why did things go so wrong?  That is the question on which I'll try to shed some light, and to do so without in any way seeking to evade my responsibility.  I'll outline a number of reasons that, in my view, led to the ultimate failure of banking regulation.  I'll describe these briefly under two main headings - structure and practice. <br\/><br\/>Let me first deal with structure.  The interim regulatory authority was set up in 2002 following a long debate which followed the McDowell report about how it might best be structured.  The main issues were: one, which financial services should be brought into its remit; two, whether a new structure would be independent of, or be part of, the Central Bank; and, three, whether it should focus on consumer protection alone or be combined with prudential regulation.  The impetus for an integrated and separate regulator to cover the whole of the financial services industry came from a number of sources.  One, following the radical deregulation of financial services under Presidents Reagan and Bush in the US during the 1980s followed by the &quot;Big Bang&quot; deregulation of 1986 in the UK, financial services had become more deregulated, more complex and were converging across traditional sector boundaries, which, in Ireland, and for historical reasons, had been regulated by separate entities reporting to different Government Departments.  No. 2, it was believed that banks and other financial services were mis-selling to their customers and that stronger emphasis need now to be placed on consumer protection.  Three, the DIRT inquiry and a number of other matters in the 1990s had raised persistent questions as to how effective the Central Bank was in supervising the banks.  So it was believed that a more independent structure with a substantial focus on consumer protection was required.  However, there were strongly competing views as to how this should be done.  Following a lengthy debate, the structure that resulted was a complicated compromise.<\/p><p>The Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority<b><\/b>would have responsibility for both consumer protection and the supervision of individual financial services providers, including over 50 banking entities plus 30 EU banks operating on a &quot;passport&quot; basis into Ireland, two building societies, 180 insurance companies, 3,400 funds, 4,000 intermediaries, as well as re-insurance companies, stockbrokers and the Stock Exchange, bureaux de change, licensed moneylenders and 430 credit unions who were vocally opposed to the new regulatory arrangements.  The organisation, with supervisory responsibility for over 8,000 different entities, had a lot on its plate. Of its approximately 350 staff, around 45 were initially allocated to banking supervision.<br\/><br\/>The authority reported to the Oireachtas through the Minister for Finance.  It had a degree of independence, but, at the same time, operated within the overall framework of the Central Bank in what was to be known as the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland<b>, <\/b>CBFSAI.  The Central Bank and its Governor retained responsibility for financial stability and had powers to direct the authority in that regard; it remained the &ldquo;competent authority&rdquo; under EU directives; it was the sole point of contact with the ECB.  <br\/><br\/>The web of accountability's was, to say the least, complicated.  Some observers described the new structures as unwieldy and unworkable.  However, early on, the Governor and I decided to try our best to make them work.  I should say at this point that the Governor and I had a good, professional relationship all the time through my tenure as chairman. In the initial stages, the challenge was to begin implementing the legislation, which at that point was still a Bill, and to build an entirely new organisation with staff who were then working in a number of different organisations and Government Departments.  The regulator inherited most of its staff from the Central Bank and so also inherited, and was effectively constrained by, the Central Bank&rsquo;s HR policies, systems, and culture, a culture which, in my view, was generally hierarchical, deferential, cautious, and secretive.  Accommodation and the critically important services of HR and IT systems were provided by the Central Bank.  The bank was not a strong performer in either of these areas and this did slow down our banking regulators in coping with change, of which there was a lot in the period, and in developing their crucial data analytics capacity. <br\/><br\/>The Financial Regulator was given formal legal status in 2003, although its sanctioning regime was not in place until nearly two years later, and its ... the new legislative framework for banking supervision, under Basel II, was not in place until 2006.  The authority had its own board of ten members, six of whom also sat on the board of the Central Bank, including myself as chairman and the CEO.  None of the authority - the board - had any experience in regulating banks.  There was some initial training for authority members in prudential regulation and financial stability.  In hindsight, there was not enough. <br\/><br\/>At the time, those outside the regulator often saw prudential regulation as being in opposition to consumer protection.  There was little or no acceptance that prudential regulation was, and is, in fact, the ultimate in consumer protection for depositors, for shareholders and, as we now know, for taxpayers. Some consumer groups even criticised the amount of resources the authority was then committing to prudential regulation, in so far as it used resources which, in their view, could have been better deployed to consumer protection.  Through all of this time, looking back, there&rsquo;s a theme of taking prudential regulation for granted. <br\/><br\/>As an example of this mindset, the legislation laid down that the consumer director was to be a statutory, <i>ex officio<\/i>member of the authority; surprisingly, the prudential director was not.  Early on we recognised this deficiency and we wrote to the Minister to put it on record that even though not written into law, we would treat the prudential director as if he were a full member of the authority, in the sense that he attended and participated in all meetings and received all board papers.  The Minister agreed.<br\/><br\/>The priority given to consumer protection was exacerbated in those early years by a number of high profile consumer issues, for example, foreign exchange overcharging, which absorbed much time and energy of both the executive and the new authority.  Many of the interactions with senior bankers on these issues were extremely robust.  During one heated discussion in my presence, the CEO of a large bank threw a bunch of keys across the table to our CEO and asked him if he wanted to run the expletive bank. <br\/><br\/>Part of the CBFSAI mandate was to develop the financial services sector, although not at the expense of safety, soundness and stability &ndash; a responsibility more recently removed in the 2010 Act.  While the regulator legally had no similar responsibility, it was widely believed that its remit included supporting the development of the industry.  Hence there was an effort to ensure that rules and regulatory practice did not have a disproportionate impact on the operation and development of the financial services sector, particularly in relation to the IFSC.  Following a fact finding visit to the US in early 2007, the CEO and I came to the view that the authority did not have sufficient visibility of what was happening in international financial markets and, in particular, in the US. On return, I suggested appointing an international adviser to the authority.  This idea, unfortunately, did not find enough support in the board of the Central Bank or of the authority and, in April 2007, I was forced to drop it.  Again with hindsight, an international adviser might have alerted us to the risks in the US financial markets at that time and how these would come in time to impact the Irish banking system. <br\/><br\/>Let me turn to the powers of the regulator.  There is some misunderstanding about the limits of the Financial Regulator&rsquo;s powers in relation to the banks.  One, first, it had no powers, <i>per se<\/i>, of approval or disapproval over the banks&rsquo; products like 100% mortgages.  The regulatory framework was not designed around prohibiting products, but around imposing additional capital charges on more risky products.  Second, while it did regulate full subsidiaries of foreign banks in Ireland, it had no powers of prudential regulation over EU banks &quot;passporting&quot; as branches into Ireland, and which were regulated by their home supervisor.  The authority was very conscious that if, for example, the capital requirements on Irish banks were pushed too high, foreign banks which were already, or could move beyond our supervisory reach by switching from subsidiary to branch could have gained advantage over their Irish competitors.  This was particularly the case with some aggressive UK banks, attracted to the Irish market by increased margins.  Trying to regulate these foreign banks through their home supervisor was futile; the role of the ECB in supervision was, at the time, very weak, as was transnational co-operation between banking regulators. <br\/><br\/>The McDowell report had recommended that the regulator be given powers of administrative sanction so that it could challenge the banks more effectively, although most countries in Europe did not use sanctions as a core part of their prudential banking supervision.  However, the power to impose sanctions on the industry took a long time to materialise.  The legislation was not enacted until August 2004, and by the time statutory instruments and staff training were complete, sanctions were not available to the authority until late 2005, more than two years after vesting.  This lag in giving the regulator powers of sanction may have weakened the new organisation in the eyes of powerful, and dare I say, in the case of a few increasingly arrogant banks.  When eventually enacted, the legislation gave the authority powers to sanction without having to access the courts.  Internally, there were real concerns about legal and possible constitutional challenge.  If, in the early stages, the authority&rsquo;s sanctioning powers were to be struck down by the courts, it would have far-reaching consequences, and these concerns fed into a Central Bank culture which had already had in-built cautiousness and hesitancy.<br\/><br\/>Resourcing levels in banking supervision, as you've heard, were derived from the principles-based approach.  It's worth noting that in the new, post-crash regulatory regime, a more intrusive, inspection-based approach required a 170% increase in staff resources.  As you have heard, resources at the time were under considerable pressure.  As well as carrying out ongoing supervision, they had, at the same time ,to implement a raft of complex EU directives, particularly Basel II.  Management in banking supervision did seek some increase in resources but there was a perceived need to keep a lid on costs and the procedure for getting approval for additional staff was extremely complicated.  Even when approval was obtained, the filling of posts was constrained by, first, the inability to attract enough external candidates at the right level and, second, by the capability of the Central Bank&rsquo;s recruitment function.<\/p><p>In relation to the first of these points, the regulator was constrained by the pay scales and HR policies of the Central Bank and its long-standing conformity to terms and conditions of the Civil Service.  And there were three consequences of this: number one, it was virtually impossible to offer competitive market conditions and to bring in, particularly at a senior level, expertise from outside, especially from the highly paid financial services industry.  For example, on the basis of figures which are in the public domain, the authority would never have been in a position at that time to recruit a Matthew Elderfield.  Number two, performance management systems and practices were very weak and number three, the organisation culture was formal and slow.  The authority was obliged to take its IT and systems development from the Central Bank.  Because of problems in this unit, it was a constant source of frustration and inefficiency to the whole organisation and to banking supervision in particular.<br\/><br\/>In summarising this part about structure, it's clear with hindsight that the Financial Regulator, as it was constituted, was not entirely fit for purpose.  A modern Financial Regulator needs a board with regulatory experience and skills.  It needs an enabling legal framework with strength to counter the naturally powerful influence of the banking sector.  It needs to be well resourced, to have a fast-moving capacity to develop its IT capability and to recruit expert staff.  It needs freedom of action and clarity in its legislative mandate that it's single-mindedly to prioritise the stability of the banking sector over other competing public policy goals.<br\/><br\/>Let me turn to regulation and practice.  As you've heard <i>ad nauseam<\/i>, principle-based prudential regulation was at the time perceived internationally as best practice.  It was the bedrock of EU banking supervision as enshrined in the Basel accords &ndash; to which the Irish Government was a signatory.  It had therefore to be embraced by the Central Bank and was inherited and continued by the new Financial Regulator.<br\/><br\/>In an era of deregulation and belief in free-market policies, principles-based regulation was based on the belief that one, the market should be allowed to operate freely; the regulator should not interfere in product design or pricing and had no powers to do so.  Two, responsible financial services providers were best placed to make decisions about their businesses and were required by government ... required to be governed by experienced managements and boards, backed up by risk committees, compliance officers and auditors.  Boards were required to comprise of persons who were &quot;fit and proper&quot; and who operated in a transparent and ethical way.  This would take, number four, place under regulatory oversight, with reporting, monitoring and risk-based inspections, backed up by strong enforcement.<br\/><br\/>As part of the EU push to develop the single internal market with a common regulatory framework, the Government had signed up to implement EU-wide, complex, data-rich, risk-based system of prudential regulation named Basel II<b>, <\/b>which was to complement the principles-based core principles of effective banking supervision<b>. <\/b>The regulator was required to adopt this system and to bring the Irish banks under its disciplines.  Implementation of Basel II, completed in 2006, fell to the Financial Regulator.  This work was extremely challenging, complex and detailed; it put a lot of strain on the Central Bank&rsquo;s systems development capacity.  Critically, it temporarily diverted a large number of banking supervisory staff from day-to-day supervision at a time when, as we now know, the seeds of the banking crisis were already germinating.  Ironically, the new Basel II framework did not prevent an EU-wide banking crisis and it was superseded in 2011 by a new accord, Basel III.<br\/><br\/>To strengthen its principles-based approach, in 2005 the authority set out to introduce a new fitness and probity regime for the directors of financial institutions.  There was, inevitably, strong challenge from the industry.  The authority sought legal advice, which was that constitutionally, no directors who were already appointed, could be reassessed and by implication potentially disqualified.  In other words, they were effectively grandfathered or grandmothered.  After the crash, the 2010 Act brought in extensive powers for the Central Bank to examine existing appointees &ndash; powers not available to the regulator before that time.<br\/><br\/>In a second move taken by the authority to strengthen its supervisory approach, in November 2004 the authority set out to use its discretionary powers under the Central Bank Acts to require compliance statements of directors in financial institutions.  The consequential consultation process ran into a barrage of resistance from the industry.  They deployed a range of arguments, including that this was inconsistent with the company law review group&rsquo;s report.  Following extensive lobbying and discussion, the Department of Finance wrote to the authority in November 2006 asking it not to proceed with the necessary consultation process, &ldquo;without first consulting the Department&rdquo; &ndash; a clear signal to us that this did not have Government support.  In retrospect, I believe we were mistaken not to have pressed ahead with this measure despite the extreme resistance that we faced.<br\/><br\/>Banking supervision collected data from the banks and carried out on-site inspections.  The principles-based approach focused on checking banks&rsquo; internal control systems and board minutes to assure the supervisors that their internal controls were operating.  Instead of, for example, random sampling of loan files to challenge bank managements' assertions, the inspection methodology left actual judgements of what was prudent to the banks' managements.  The dramatic rise in credit called for new information to be collected from the banks.  However, the Central Bank just did not have the IT change management capacity to specify that data need or to implement it quickly, while also implementing Basel II and doing everything else it was doing for the Central Bank and for the ECB.<br\/><br\/>Within an often crowded agenda, the CEO and the prudential director reported on their supervision responsibilities at the monthly authority meeting.  The prudential pack, which contained detailed data on an institution-by-institution basis, was a quarterly standing item on the authority&rsquo;s agenda and was discussed at length.  Solvency ratios of the banks under supervision were examined and were continually seen to be within the defined limits.  The pack included some details of major exposures of Irish banks including those to property developers.  These exposures were examined by the executive and were the subject of detailed discussion with the institutions themselves.  The executive assured the authority that all these loans had strong asset backing.  With the benefit of hindsight, the valuations on which this was based depended on some kind of soft landing.<br\/><br\/>Chairman, I've omitted the next sentence which was in my written statement as I realised after I had submitted it that it was not fully correct.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015061100002#FF00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Patterson","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1433977200,"counter":759,"content":"<p>Okay, thank you.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015061100002#HH00200","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1433977200,"counter":760,"content":"<p>The regulator had no powers to investigate the affairs of bank customers.  After the crash, it emerged, as we know, that some large developers had never been asked by their bank to provide a statement of affairs nor had the bank properly assessed their net worth.  In hindsight, the executive should examine ... should have examined this more closely and, if necessary, forced the banks to improve the standards of inquiry on which they based their lending decisions.  The prudential pack did not include micro-trend statistics which could've become the focus of discussion had they been present.  This reflected the view that the regulator was a micro-prudential supervisor only, with a mandate to ensure every individual bank had strong capital ratios, rather than to analyse if risk was building in the system as a whole.  <br\/><br\/>Much has been said on the subject of sector limits.  It is my understanding that the Central Bank had effectively relaxed these limits in the 1990s, prior to the setting up of the Financial Regulator, in order to encourage the development of the IFSC and in particular to facilitate the arrival of one large foreign bank which had a major sector exposure<i>.  <\/i>It was then felt that foreign and domestic banks had to be treated the same, a level playing field, in order to avoid giving substance to any impression that Ireland was host to an off-shore centre that was being treated more lightly than its domestic banks.  Furthermore, sector limits are notoriously difficult to define and so were used more as guidelines than rules.  And as banking supervision got closer to the full implementation of Basel II, it became less and less tenable to give any weight to sector limits, which were to be superseded by the Basel II approach.  Nevertheless, and again in hindsight, while sector exposure was monitored by the executive, we paid insufficient attention to this indicator.<br\/><br\/>The regulator paid close attention to the Central Bank&rsquo;s stress tests, which were largely carried out in the banks themselves under supervision of the Central Bank.  As presented to the authority, they indicated that even under their most pessimistic scenarios, for example, slowdown in economic growth, rise in unemployment, the banks were well capitalised and capable of withstanding any external threats.<\/p><p>However, in hindsight they did not factor in, number one: the degree of reliance on international wholesale funding which, as events were to prove, was highly volatile - the banks were borrowing short to lend long; two, the risk of a calamitous collapse in property prices and the consequent impact on the banks&rsquo; balance sheets; and, three, severe economic recession, which impaired the ability of borrowers to repay loans.  The authority took great comfort from the results of these stress tests.  Had they shown a risk to any bank&rsquo;s solvency, let alone to the banking system as a whole, the alarm bells would have been ringing loudly and action would surely have followed. <\/p><p> The annual financial stability report, as you have heard, was issued by the Central Bank in each of the years 2004 to 2007, inclusive.  The report was prepared by a joint Central Bank-Financial Regulator committee under the chairmanship of the then director general of the Central Bank.  The report was based on the Central Bank&rsquo;s economic analysis and most recent stress tests, plus input from staff in banking supervision.  Even though the magnitude of the risk was not properly understood, there was often disagreement in this committee about how strong the report should be in identifying risks to the banking system.  The report was finalised by the Governor and the board of the Central Bank.  As the clouds gathered, there were concerns that a strongly worded financial stability report could have resulted in the unintended consequence of causing the very collapse the Financial Regulator and the Central Bank were seeking to avoid.  However, the Governor had regular one-to-one meetings with the Minister and it was believed that he could be more direct in private than he could be in public.<\/p><p> The authority was also given a false sense of security by a series of external reports: number one, audit reports on the regulated banks, which did not raise any concerns about liquidity or solvency; number two, the 2006 IMF financial sector assessment programme report, which gave the banks and the Financial Regulator a glowing report; number three, the PwC 2007 report, which again concluded that the banks were in good health and able to weather any storm; and, number four, the IMF report of September 2007, which found that the banking system is \"well capitalised, profitable and liquid, and non-performing loans are low\".  Again, the authority took great comfort from these reports.  They seemed to confirm what the internal processes and reports were saying, that is, that the banks were well capitalised, and could withstand any downturn or external shocks.<\/p><p> To summarise this section on practice, the regulator was operating a system of principles-based regulation, which was internationally accepted as best practice at the time.  It was also embedded in the Basel II accord, a regulatory system to which the Irish Government was committed and which called for dramatic increases in data gathering from the banks.  Implementing Basel II challenged the Central Bank&rsquo;s IT capability and diverted banking supervision staff from normal duties.  None of the many internal processes or external reports that I have described raised serious red flags about the banks&rsquo; viability or pointed to any of the cataclysmic events that were to follow.  Had any of them shown a risk to the banks' solvency, let alone to the banking system as a whole, the alarm bells would have been ringing loudly and the authority would have been impelled to investigate and to take action.<\/p><p> In conclusion, Chairman, the Financial Regulator had an overly complex structure with an extremely broad mandate, which emphasised consumer protection as the main priority, with constrained powers and limited resources devoted to banking supervision.  The complex entanglements with the Central Bank also limited the regulator&rsquo;s effectiveness in a number of ways.  However, shortcomings in the structure do not alone explain why the system failed.  The regulator&rsquo;s processes and reports and the findings of external scrutineers, any of which should have raised red flags or sent warning signals, all failed to do so.  As a result, the authority simply did not see the enormity of the risks being taken by the banks themselves and the calamity that was to overwhelm them through the speed and severity of the crash.  Had we known then what we know now, we would, of course, have acted more strongly and used whatever powers were at our disposal with the forcefulness required to rein in the banks&rsquo; ending.  But we did not know then what we know now.  And so, as a key part of the defence against banking failure, the Financial Regulator failed in its responsibility to uphold the safety and soundness of the Irish banks.  As a former chairman of the authority, that is something I will for ever regret.<\/p><p> Thank you, Chairman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015061100002#HH00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Patterson","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1433977200,"counter":762,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. Patterson, for your opening statement.

And as I think I've said, the regulator had powers to try and curb and could have curbed the issue of 100% mortgages.  Now why did it not do so?  It didn't do so because number one ... I think there are a couple of reasons, number one, because the approach at the time was not to...  what's the word I'm looking for...  to become involved in products but the two things that the authority could do would be to police through consumer protection how they were sold.  Were they being sold inappropriately to the wrong people?  Because for some people, 100% mortgages would be okay.  Not a majority but for some people they would be okay.  To police how they were sold and also if the authority felt that the loan book was becoming risky, more so than it should be, then to impose additional capital requirements, which ultimately was done.

They used all kinds of arguments about setting the Irish banks with competitive disadvantage, \"Here we go again\", etc.  And having taken legal advice, my recollection is that the legal advice was that we would be unable to examine and potentially to disqualify existing directors; and this goes something, if I remember it, it was something to do with the constitutional protection to a right to earn a living, something like that.  And that, therefore, people already in ... in ... office, which is 99% of them, could not be brought into this new regime, and with that realisation, I think the regulator had to think again.  I do believe that later on a new regime was put in place.  Initially, it could only examine new appointees, but with the 2010 Act, as I understand it, they were able to go back and ... and question and reassess existing office holders.  That's the fitness and probity one.

We weren't to go ahead with the consultation without seeking their permission, if you like, first.  Now, what happened in that event was, that there was coming down the track, from left field, a consolidation of financial services legislation because there had been layers and layers and layers of legislation and it got very complicated and the Department had planned to consolidate all this into a couple of updated Acts and the decision was taken to try and address it again through that process.
