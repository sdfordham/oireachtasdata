There is much work to be done, but we have made good progress.<\/p>  <p>  Officials from my Department, along with colleagues in Pobal, have been working hard to develop the legal, technical and administrative infrastructure for the new Affordable Childcare Scheme.  This scheme will provide financial support for parents, establish a sustainable platform for investment in the childcare sector for decades to come and, crucially, allow us to continue to invest in giving our children the best start in life. <\/p>  <p>  Before Christmas the Childcare Support Bill 2017, the legal framework for the scheme, was published.  It passed all stages in the D&aacute;il in the first quarter of this year.  I was very pleased with the positive, cross party support it received and I want to thank Deputies again for their valuable input which strengthened the legislation. The Bill has now completed Second Stage in the Seanad and will commence Committee Stage this Thursday.  <\/p>  <p>  Alongside the Childcare Support Bill, intensive work is ongoing on the drafting of supporting regulations for the scheme and on regulations to provide, for the first time, for the registration of school-age childcare providers.  The latter regulations will ensure that all school-age childcare services are registered with Tusla prior to the introduction of the Affordable Childcare Scheme and can participate in the scheme from the outset.   <\/p>  <p>  With regard to the scheme's supporting IT infrastructure, good progress is also being made.  In January I published a Request for Tenders for the development of a new IT system and received these at the end of March. They are now being evaluated in line with strict procurement rules, and I anticipate finalisation of the process very shortly.  The introduction of the scheme is dependent on this new IT system. As soon as a contract is awarded to a successful bidder and a timeframe agreed for the completion of the system, I hope to be in a position to confirm and communicate an official launch date for the Scheme. <\/p>  <p>  I have often emphasised that we need to take the time to put a rigorous, carefully planned IT system in place. We are continuing this process and making good progress. It is vital to an effective, user-friendly scheme for parents and providers, and I want to get it right.<\/p>  <p>  The ACS is an ambitious project, which my Department is working on intensively. I will be happy to keep the Deputy, and this House, informed of developments as we move ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100072#WRC00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":12,"content":"<p>Question No. 36 answered with Question No. 34.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child and Family Agency Staff","counter":13,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100072#WRC00600"},{"type":"question","counter":14,"qnumday":37,"qnumall":"[18786\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100072#WRC00700","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"her plans with regard to recruiting more social workers.","asker":"1276","askee":"1358"},{"type":"question","counter":15,"qnumday":38,"qnumall":"[18546\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100072#WRC00800","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the number of social work vacancies in Tusla by title; the number of children classified as high priority awaiting allocation of a social worker; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1358"},{"type":"question","counter":16,"qnumday":45,"qnumall":"[18545\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100072#WRC00900","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the work she is undertaking alongside Tusla to address staff recruitment and retention issues; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":17,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 37, 38 and 45 together.<\/p><p>I acknowledge that the recruitment and retention of social workers is one of the biggest challenges for Tusla with only 200-250 graduating per year in a very competitive labour market. <\/p><p>Working in child protection is one of the most difficult areas, and I fully appreciate the dedication of all professionals in Tusla who undertake this extremely important task.<\/p><p>I am fully supportive of Tusla&rsquo;s proactive approach to recruiting, supporting and retaining staff across all grades. In support of this I have provided for a significant increase in Tusla&rsquo;s funding allocation with an increase of &euro;40.6m in 2018 and a total increase of &euro;144m since its establishment in 2014. <\/p><p>Given this level of funding, Tusla expects to increase its total workforce by approximately 422 resulting in a total workforce of 4118 whole time equivalents (WTE) by the end of 2018. <\/p><p>Also, given the current limited availability of social work graduates, Tusla expects at least 45 of these staff to be additional social workers. There will also be proactive recruitment of grades such as social care and clerical administration staff to support social workers to ensure that they can focus on their core tasks.<\/p><p>To support Tusla&rsquo;s ambitious recruitment targets it launched its 2018 graduate recruitment campaign last September. This campaign is currently open for applications with interviews expected to commence in May\/June 2018. <\/p><p>The campaign included Northern Ireland and Scotland. Continuing <i>Tusla Recruit&rsquo;s<\/i>proactive approach of previous years all campuses were visited and over 200 students registered their interest. <i>Tusla Recruit<\/i>maintains on-going communications with the registered students and partners them through the application and CORU registration process with a view to making Tusla an employer of choice. <\/p><p>Tusla also has an on-going rolling campaign to attract existing social workers who have a particular interest in working in child protection. This campaign is also designed to appeal to social workers who may currently be living abroad and wish to move to Ireland. <\/p><p>I have also asked Tusla to develop a <i>Multi-annual Strategic Workforce Plan<\/i>to identify the future composition of Tusla&rsquo;s workforce so as to deliver on Tusla&rsquo;s priorities. I expect the Plan to encompass a range of activities aimed at addressing Tusla&rsquo;s short, medium and long term needs and to manage the current challenges Tusla faces recruiting social workers. <\/p><p>The Plan will also form the basis of engaging with key stakeholders such as the education sector to ensure a sustainable supply of social workers in the future.<\/p><p>With regard to current vacancies, Tusla advises that 207 social work posts are at various stages of the recruitment process. <\/p><p>Of the 207 posts:<\/p><p>- 26 are Senior Social Work Practitioner;<\/p><p>- 15 are Principal Social Worker;<\/p><p>- 17 are Social Worker - Team Leader and<\/p><p>- 149 are Social Worker.<\/p><p>Tusla publish their Performance and Activity data on a monthly basis and I can inform you that as of the end of February 2018 there were 4,756 cases awaiting allocation to a social worker, out of 24,366 open cases. <\/p><p>Of the total number of unallocated cases, 898 were categorised as High Priority. An unallocated case relates to a case about a child  that is deemed to need a social work assessment,  but has not yet been  allocated to a social worker. <\/p><p>It is important to note that all urgent and emergency cases receive immediate attention by the local duty social work team. The majority of unallocated cases are new referrals. However, they may also include children living with their families who had an allocated social worker, or to a child in care, where there may be a social work vacancy.<\/p><p>Tusla is working hard to maintain and improve its retention rate. In March 2018 it had a total staff turnover rate of 5.6%. The current social worker turnover rate is 8.1% compared to 9.4% in March 2017. A low turnover rate is clearly in the interest of vulnerable children and families and it is also more efficient for the organisation as a whole. <\/p><p>Tusla values its staff and in acknowledgement of this it has established a Retention Steering Group to plan and implement an integrated approach to retention throughout the organisation.  Tusla's Health, Wellbeing and Employee Assistance Programmehas a range of services available to staff. The Programme has completed a staff survey on retention and its findings will inform part of a new Strategy on Retention for Tusla.<\/p><p>Tusla is also placing an increased focus on well-being by actively encouraging employees to adopt behaviours that will improve their life and improve workforce morale. <\/p><p>Furthermore as part of its retention strategy, Tusla has also implemented an extensive Continuous Professional Development Strategyin recent years. The strategy commits all social workers to having a minimum of 21 hours for personal development plans and 10 hours for engaging in continuous profession development. <\/p><p>Tusla has also introduced a National Transfer Policyto facilitate staff wishing to relocate to another part of the country within Tusla&rsquo;s services while ensuring that the Agency retains their valuable expertise.  <\/p><p>Other supports for Tusla staff include rehabilitation services to support staff that are out of work due to injury or illness and a Critical Incident Stress Management Teamto support teams and individuals in the event of any traumatic event.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100072#WRC01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Care Services Provision","counter":18,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100072#WRC01100"},{"type":"question","counter":19,"qnumday":39,"qnumall":"[18607\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100072#WRC01200","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if the childcare needs in the zero to two years of age group will be addressed in Dublin 1 in view of the concerns of public health nurses.","asker":"1291","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":20,"content":"<p>I understand the Deputy is referring to issues around childcare supports in Dublin 1, particularly for lone parents and parents wishing to return to education.<\/p><p>I am aware of issues relating to the availability of early years places in that area and officials from my Department are in fact scheduled to meet with stakeholders this week to discuss them. <\/p><p>Dublin City Childcare Committee, which is funded by my Department, is also available to parents and childcare providers who may require assistance regarding capacity issues and access to various programmes offered by my Department.<\/p><p>My Department operates a number of childcare programmes which may be of assistance to families of very young children in the area. <\/p><p>Targetedprogrammes include:<\/p><p>The Community Childcare Subvention (CCS)which provides support for parents on low income to avail of reduced childcare costs at participating community childcare services.

The upper age ECCE requirement is that the child must not reach 5 years and 6 months before the end of the programme year.<\/p>  <p>  Some children will not be able to commence their ECCE in September 2018 as they will not have reached the age of 2 years and 8 months on or before 31st\u00a0August 2018. However, they will be able to commence ECCE in September 2019, and continue for a further year from September 2020, commencing school in September 2021. Parents of children born around this time of the year may prefer for their children to start school at 4 rather than 5.\u00a0These parents may therefore choose to avail of 1 year of ECCE only.

I would be delighted to update you on positive progress in preparing the new Affordable Childcare Scheme. <\/p>  <p>  Officials from my Department, along with colleagues in Pobal, have been working hard to develop the legal, technical and administrative infrastructure for the new Affordable Childcare Scheme.  This scheme will provide financial support for parents, establish a sustainable platform for investment in the childcare sector for decades to come and- crucially- allow us to continue to invest in giving our children the best start in life. <\/p>  <p>  As you know, the Childcare Support Bill passed all stages in the D&aacute;il in the first quarter of this year. I was delighted with the positive, cross party support it received and want to thank you again for your valuable input. The Bill has now completed Second Stage in the Seanad and will commence Committee Stage this Thursday.  <\/p>  <p>  Alongside the Childcare Support Bill, intensive work is ongoing on the drafting of supporting regulations for the scheme and on regulations to provide, for the first time, for the registration of school-age childcare providers.  The latter regulations will ensure that all school-age childcare services are registered with Tusla prior to the introduction of the Affordable Childcare Scheme and can participate in the scheme from the outset.   <\/p>  <p>  With regard to the scheme's supporting IT infrastructure, good progress is being made. In January I published a Request for Tenders for the development of a new IT system and an evaluation of tenders received is currently coming to a conclusion. The introduction of the scheme is dependent on this new IT system.  As such, as soon as a contract is awarded to a successful bidder and a timeframe agreed for the completion of the system, I hope to be in a position to confirm and communicate an official launch date for the Affordable Childcare Scheme. For planning and procurement purposes, we have an indicative estimated timeframe of late May\/ June 2019 for opening the system to applications, with financial supports flowing from September 2019.  <\/p>  <p>  Work is also ongoing on the administrative and communication elements of the scheme.  In particular, specialist expertise has been procured to support the detailed development of a robust governance framework for the scheme.  A high-level Communications and Engagement Strategy was published in February and a training needs analysis is underway at present. Both of these provide the starting point for significant work in preparing timely and user-friendly information, resources and supports for parents, providers and other stakeholders.  In tandem with the development of these resources, I am also committed to ongoing consultation and engagement with all stakeholders in the run-up to the introduction of the scheme.  <\/p>  <p>  As you know, ACS is ambitious in scale and complex in its design but I am delighted that we are achieving our milestones in its development and confident of the lasting impact it will have once launched. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, in order to fast-track some of the benefits of the new scheme, last September I introduced a new universal subsidy, worth up to &euro;1,040 per year for children under three in registered childcare, alongside significantly increased subsidies under existing targeted schemes. I can confirm to you that these supports have now reached the families of over 74,000 children, well in excess of our original estimate of 70,000. Of these 74,000 children, over 35,500 are receiving the new universal subsidy, while a further 38,700 are receiving up to &euro;145 per week towards the cost of their childcare. I have confirmed that these supports will remain in place until the Affordable Childcare Scheme goes live.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100073#WRD02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":73,"content":"<p>Question No. 57 answered with Question No. 46.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Internet Safety","counter":74,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100073#WRD02200"},{"type":"question","counter":75,"qnumday":58,"qnumall":"[18802\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100073#WRD02300","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the status of her Department's work to implement the recommendations of the Internet content governance advisory group; the actions she is taking to keep children safe online; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1231","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":76,"content":"<p>Keeping children safe online requires a whole of government approach.\u00a0I am committed to playing my part in a co-ordinated cross-Government approach. <\/p>  <p>  The Department of the Taoiseach is currently developing an Action Plan on online safety involving all relevant departments to ensure that our actions are coordinated, complementary and robust.

The EU provides direct assistance to the UN-led Geneva peace talks and has launched, in coordination with the UN, an initiative to identify common political ground with key actors from the region.  We also support a broad range of measures to ensure full legal accountability for all war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Syria. Ireland has been a strong and consistent donor to the humanitarian response to the crisis.<\/p>  <p>  I attended the Second Brussels Conference &ldquo;Supporting Syria and the Region&rdquo; on the 24th of April. I met with key EU and UN humanitarian and political partners - including EU Commissioner Christos Stylianides and United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi - to discuss further humanitarian assistance and highlight our commitment to a peaceful resolution of the conflict.<\/p>  <p>  At the conference, Ireland reiterated its support for the UN-led efforts to bring about a resolution of the conflict.  Ireland also called on the international community, particularly those with influence on the parties to the conflict, to redouble efforts to ensure a ceasefire and unimpeded humanitarian access.  Ireland condemned the repeated breaches of international law which have taken place in Syria, and called for full legal accountability for all war crimes and crimes against humanity, particularly the use of chemical weapons.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland also pledged a further &euro;25 million in humanitarian support in 2018 - maintaining the same level of assistance as provided last year.  This brings Ireland&rsquo;s support since 2012 to over &euro;100 million &ndash; our largest ever response to a single crisis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100074#WRE01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1241"},{"type":"question","counter":109,"qnumday":69,"qnumall":"[18643\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100074#WRE01200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the details of Ireland's involvement in contributing to the humanitarian effort in Syria.","asker":"1276","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":110,"content":"<p>Since 2012, Ireland has provided over &euro;108 million in response to the Syria crisis.

Relief under the KDB was introduced for accounting periods ending on or after 1 January 2016.  Therefore, the first corporation tax returns in which relief could be claimed were due for filing up to 23 September 2017.  However, as the regime is complex and a company must make an irrevocable election into the KDB, the legislation provided that companies had a 24-month period in which to make their claim for relief.

They have presented at a number of R&amp;D industry events to help ensure a consistency of approach in applying the legislation, and also ensure that uncertainties on the application of the KDB are identified at an early stage and addressed.  As taxpayers encounter uncertainty in the application of the rules &ndash; particularly those around the tracking and tracing documentation requirements &ndash; Revenue will develop updated examples to bring clarity to issues identified.<\/p>  <p>  I also understand that a number of State Agencies are actively engaged in promoting the use of the KDB.

Neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  <\/p><p>I am aware of recent reports in the media relating to the management expenses of insurance undertakings. I understand that the coverage relates in particular to the portion of Net Premium Income which these costs represent. <\/p><p>The Central Bank has informed me that, audited insurance company returns to the Central Bank of Ireland show that total industry management expenses and commission have remained relatively stable over the last ten years. <\/p><p>Insurance Ireland has separately noted that the net premium income which has been referenced does not include the costs of reinsurance protection.  In other words, it represents premium income retained by insurers following payments made for such reinsurance protection.  This means that where the cost of reinsurance protection increases, net premium income by definition falls.  Insurance Ireland has indicated that this is what has actually happened in some years and that a comparison is being made in such years between a reduced net premium income and a level of management expenses that have not risen in absolute terms and have remained largely the same since 2005.  This they say is demonstrated by Central Bank Statistics on motor management expenses which in 2005 amounted to &euro;224 million and in 2015 were &euro;216 million.  They say that the effect of this comparison is to create an apparent spike in management expenses in recent times, which does not reflect the reality of the situation. <\/p><p>Insurance Ireland has also pointed out that reinsurance is an essential risk management tool for insurers as it involves the transfer of claims risk to a reinsurer.  There is a cost associated with this as such reinsurance entities must also meet their own regulatory solvency requirements and therefore they charge the appropriate reinsurance premium to cover such risks, which an insurer must pay.<\/p><p>In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s second query, the Central Bank has informed me, that information on management expenses was included in the Solvency I returns that were submitted to the Central Bank. These audited returns formed the basis of the blue book. Those returns were based on the insurance companies&rsquo; financial statements, which were audited, and are available from the Companies Office. <\/p><p>It should be noted that information on management expenses is also available in the Solvency II returns submitted to the Central Bank. Interested parties seeking data at company level can find such data in publically available reports which are required of all insurance undertakings under the Solvency II regime.  These reports are known as the Solvency and Financial Condition Reports (SFCRs).  The SFCRs include a detailed narrative report on the insurance undertaking coupled with key quantitative reporting templates that contain premiums, claims, expenses, technical provisions, solvency and other information.  All SFCRs for 2016 are made available by the Central Bank in a dedicated SFCR repository which can be accessed at<\/p><p><i>.<\/i><\/p><p>Whilst the Central Bank monitors the levels of management expenses at a company and industry level it has no role in the control of those expenses.<\/p><p>It is worth noting also that one of the recommendations of the Cost of Insurance Working Group linked to increasing transparency in the insurance sector is the publication of key aggregated metrics on claims costs and trends within the market, as an interim measure prior to the establishment of the National Claims Database.  In July of last year, I published the first of these reports on the Department&rsquo;s website: . That Report provides information on the expenditure of a large portion of the insurance industry for the years 2011 to 2016 as a percentage of gross premium income.  In that regard, the data provided by insurers indicates that combined commissions and other operating expenses reduced from 18.9% to 17.4% during that time. <\/p><p>In conclusion, the reports in the media demonstrate the need for the National Claims Information Database.  It is clear that there is a need to be able to collect data related to the income and expenditure of insurers, in addition to the data linked to the costs associated with claims.  Having such information will assist policyholders and researchers to better understand the drivers of the costs of insurance.  This is one of the central policy aims of the National Claims Information Database and I think the publication of such data at industry level will facilitate an understanding into how particular expenses may or may not have an impact on the overall cost of insurance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100075#WRF01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legislative Measures","counter":156,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100075#WRF01800"},{"type":"question","counter":157,"qnumday":87,"qnumall":"[18700\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100075#WRF01900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the status of the central bank (national claims information database) Bill; when it will be introduced and enacted; if concerns put forward by an organisation (details supplied) will delay the publishing of the Bill; the changes that will be made as a result of the submission made by the organisation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":158,"content":"<p>On 19 December 2017, the Government approved the General Scheme of the Central Bank (National Claims Information Database) Bill, which was prepared following extensive work on the part of the Data Sub-group of the Cost of Insurance Working Group last year.  <\/p><p>The Office of the Parliamentary Counsel assigned a drafter to the Bill on 26 January 2017 and officials in my Department are currently working with the drafter to finalise the Bill as soon as possible.  <\/p><p>I also submitted the Bill to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and the Taoiseach for Pre-legislative Scrutiny at the beginning of the year, and that Committee contacted me in February to indicate that it would not be conducting any further scrutiny on the Bill.  <\/p><p>A public consultation was launched on the General Scheme which concluded in March and the responses received were published on my Departments website: .

In effect, it is a form of procurement available to the public sector. <\/p>  <p>  There are a number of different PPP models which can be used, including:<\/p>  <p>  1. Projects financed by the private sector and remunerated by deferred\u00a0annual payments (Unitary or Availability Payments) from the Exchequer\u00a0e.g., Design, Build, Operate &amp;amp; Finance (DBOF);\u00a0or Design, Build,\u00a0Operate, Maintain and Finance (DBOMF);<\/p>  <p>  2. Projects partly or fully financed by the private sector and\u00a0remunerated by user charges, mainly in the roads area (DBOF with a\u00a0Concession to levy user charges for a period); and<\/p>  <p>  3. Projects funded from State Authorities own resources, mainly in the\u00a0local authority area (e.g., Design, Build &amp;amp; Operate\/Maintain).\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  When referring to PPPs, we generally mean projects in category (a) or (b) above, whereby the asset is funded and constructed by the private partner, following which it is made available for public use and is paid for by the State and\/or users over an extended period (typically 20-25 years), after which the asset comes into State ownership.\u00a0 In the meantime, the PPP is regarded as &lsquo;off balance sheet&rsquo; from a General Government perspective, which means that the initial capital cost of the project does not impact on the General Government Balance (GGB) over the construction period, nor does the debt associated with the project impact on General Government Debt (GGD).\u00a0 Rather, the cost of such projects is spread over the lifetime of the projects, by way of annual unitary payments.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  These are the projects that are reported on annually by my Department on the ppp.gov.ie website - on the basis that these are the PPP projects which have not been recorded on the balance sheet of the Government and so constitute a future contingent liability for the State.\u00a0 Such contingent liabilities pose a potential risk for the Exchequer, in terms of a potential future GGB\/GGD impact were they to be terminated and surrendered to the Exchequer earlier than anticipated, thus requiring a reclassification as on-balance sheet at that time.\u00a0 For this reason, these contingent liabilities must be reported to Eurostat, via the Central Statistics Office, on an annual basis.\u00a0 Accordingly, it is appropriate that such contingent liabilities associated with PPPs be carefully monitored and reported on. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  On the other hand, the projects pursued under category (c) above have been fully funded by the Exchequer and are already classified as on-balance sheet in General Government terms.\u00a0 Such projects are not generally regarded as &lsquo;classic&rsquo; PPPs and there are no contingent liabilities associated with them as there is no risk of a potential future GGB or GGD impact associated with such projects, since they are already on-balance sheet (unlike &lsquo;classic&rsquo; PPPs).\u00a0 On this basis, we do not record these projects on the PPP.gov.ie website, nor do I propose to change this approach.\u00a0 \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Since 1 January 2014, Irish Water now has statutory responsibility for all aspects of water services planning, delivery and operation at national, regional and local levels, and this included taking on responsibility for the water related &lsquo;PPPs&rsquo; from the local authorities.\u00a0\u00a0Details of the PPP projects in the water area would therefore be available from Irish Water.\u00a0 \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the PPP related expenditure that is provided for in the context of the multi-annual capital allocations now agreed for the period 2018 to 2022, my Department is in the process of producing a detailed breakdown of this information to be published soon.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Chapter 6 of the NDP included a section on the PPP review which stated that, in order to improve transparency in reporting on PPPs, a number of changes in the reporting arrangements for PPPs were recommended by the Review Group.\u00a0 One of the improvements in reporting being introduced on foot of these recommendations is that the table published by my Department on the ppp.gov.ie website will, in\u00a0future, include details of the PPP unitary payment charges for each individual project by year, until such time as the project is handed back by the PPP Company to the Sponsoring Authority. \u00a0Officials in my Department are currently compiling the required data in conjunction with the responsible Departments and it is expected that the new reporting arrangement will be in place and the data published on the PPP website soon.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  These new arrangements will address the suggestion of the Parliamentary Budget Office that future PPP commitments be disaggregated and that clarity be provided on the amount of the total capital allocations for 2018-2021 that will be required to fund such commitments - but in respect of all future years and not just the period 2018-2021.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100077#WRH01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Private Partnerships Cost","counter":233,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100077#WRH01400"},{"type":"question","counter":234,"qnumday":114,"qnumall":"[18763\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100077#WRH01500","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the PPP contracts that account for an increase in PPP liability from &euro;6 billion in 2013 to &euro;9.6 billion in 2016;

The specific YEI allocation for Ireland of &euro;68m is matched by equal amounts from our ESF allocation and from the Exchequer, giving an overall allocation of &euro;204m.   <\/p>  <p>  All ESF activities, including YEI activities, are fully funded up-front by the Exchequer with the EU (ESF\/YEI) funding being claimed in arrears.

These systems requirements include the provision of a computerised accounting and information system for EU funds to meet the 2014-2020 functionality requirements.

In addition, no school received an allocation, for the support of pupils with complex needs, less than the allocation they received to support such pupils during the 2016\/17 school year.  <\/p><p>An additional 900 teaching posts have been provided in the 2017\/2018 school year to support the introduction of this new allocation model.

This new school will provide additional school capacity to meet demographic need in the area. <\/p>  <p>  Following this announcement, my Department was in further contact with the school relating to the building project that has been approved.  The school indicated that they will revert to the Department with additional information and this is awaited. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that under the National Development Plan (NDP), increased funding has been provided for the school sector capital investment programme.  This funding allows for a continued focus on the provision of new permanent school places to keep pace with demographic demand and also provides for an additional focus on the refurbishment of existing school buildings to include the building and modernisation of PE facilities in primary and post-primary schools.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100081#WRM03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Discipline","counter":405,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100081#WRM03500"},{"type":"question","counter":406,"qnumday":175,"qnumall":"[19043\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100081#WRM03600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"his views on whether the section 29 procedure is inappropriate in the case of a proposed expulsion or suspension of a child with special needs; and his plans for reform in the area.","asker":"1225","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":407,"content":"<p>Under Section 23 of the Education (Welfare) Act 2000 each school is required to develop a Code of Behaviour.  Each Code of Behaviour must be developed in accordance with the Education Welfare Service national guidelines, Developing a Code of Behaviour: Guidelines for Schools. <\/p>  <p>  Each school Code of Behaviour sets out the standards of behaviour that shall be observed by each student attending the school.  The Code of Behaviour must also set out any measures that the school may take when a student fails or refuses to observe those standards of behaviour.  The Code of Behaviour must also disclose the procedures to be followed before a student may be suspended or expelled from the school.  The School must implement fair procedures when considering whether to suspend or expel a student and the school is obliged to take special care to ensure that the fair procedures are accessible to students with special educational needs. <\/p>  <p>  Under Section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 an appeal can be made to the Secretary General of my Department where a board of management has decided to suspend a student for more than 20 school days in any school year or to permanently expel a student.  In relation to expulsion, a Section 29 appeal can only be taken where a board of management have formally decided to expel a student.  Under Section 24 of the Education Welfare Act, 2000 a board of management must inform the Education Welfare Service of Tusla when they intend to expel a student and the Board must allow 20 school days to pass before making a decision on whether to formally proceed with the expulsion.  <\/p>  <p>  Each Section 29 Appeals Committee conduct a full &lsquo;de novo&rsquo; appeal on the matter.  The Appeals Committee must come to their own independent determination on whether the suspension or expulsion is warranted.  In the appeal hearing, parents outline the grounds for their appeal and they are also allowed to question the school representatives through the Appeals Committee chairperson. <\/p>  <p>  Each Section 29 Appeals Committee is made up of three members.  One of these must be a serving school inspector and the other two members are normally retired former school principals and inspectors.  It is generally individuals with significant experience of working in the education sector, normally at a senior level in schools, who are appointed to serve as Appeal Committee members.  My Department also provides regular training to Section 29 Appeal Committee members. <\/p>  <p>  While I do not believe that the Section 29 Appeals process is inappropriate in the case of a suspension or expulsion of a student with special educational needs, I am proposing to make some changes to the Section 29 Appeals process as part of the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2016. These changes aim to make the Section 29 appeals process more efficient and less cumbersome for parents and schools.  Among the changes proposed, I am setting out in legislation for the first time the factors that a Section 29 Appeals Committee must have regard to when hearing and determining an appeal in relation to suspension or expulsion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100081#WRM03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Justice and Equality","counter":409,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100081#WRM03900"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Family Reunification Policy","counter":408,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100081#WRM03800"},{"type":"question","counter":409,"qnumday":176,"qnumall":"[18589\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100081#WRM03900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the rights to work of non-EEA citizens here who are partners or spouses of Irish citizens.","asker":"1225","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":410,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that immediate family members of Irish citizens who are granted immigration status through the family reunification process have the right to work without employment permits and to establish or manage\/operate a business in the State.

My Department also met separately with a representative from Dublin City Council on 23 April. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, a multi-agency approach is required to tackle this anti-social issue effectively.

The experiences of local authorities involved in these and other projects will be very informative to my Department in terms of assessing the contribution that such approaches can make to reducing the misuse of these vehicles.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will also be aware, an important element of this issue is the misuse of scramblers and quad bikes by children.  I would emphasise that the supply of mechanically propelled vehicles to persons under 16 and 17 (depending on the vehicle) constitute offences under accordance with Section 30 of the Road Traffic Act 2004.  In this regard, I am advised that the Road Safety Authority (RSA) intends to run a safety campaign later this year with the aim of discouraging those who may consider purchasing scramblers or quad bikes as Christmas presents for minors.  I might add that the RSA targets road safety awareness campaigns at young people throughout the school curriculum. <\/p>  <p>  I remain committed to actively supporting any positive actions that can be pursued to counteract the serious public safety issues associated with the misuse of scramblers and quad bikes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100082#WRN03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Immigration Controls","counter":450,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100082#WRN03800"},{"type":"question","counter":451,"qnumday":190,"qnumall":"[18846\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100082#WRN03900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the criteria used by immigration officers for carrying out additional checks including interviews in respect of persons arriving at airports here and who have a passport from another EU member state; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":452,"content":"<p>A European Union citizens in possession of a valid national identity card or passport as evidence of his or her nationality and identity may not be refused entry to the State subject to restrictions only for reasons of public policy, public security or public health.  <\/p>  <p>  Immigration Officers are required to establish the validity of travel documents presented to them for entry to the State.

When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.<\/p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal. <\/p><p>Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just under 1,800 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide.  22 members of this cohort have been assigned to the Galway Division. Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 &ndash; a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016. <\/p><p>I am pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track.  This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College; some 400 of whom have already done so. In total, 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year, some 200 of whom attested last month.  Further, Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, are on track to reach 14,000 by the end of this year.<\/p><p>In addition, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties.  There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training in 2018. <\/p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Division, including the Galway Division.<\/p><p>In so far as the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute; is concerned, this is a matter for the Commissioner.  I am assured by the Commissioner that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of resources.  However, it is important to keep in mind that newly attested Garda&iacute; have a further 16 months of practical and classroom based training to complete in order to receive their BA in Applied Policing.  To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required training and development structures and resources in place, including trained Garda tutors and access to a permanently appointed supervisory Sergeant who is thoroughly familiar with their responsibilities under the training programme.<\/p><p>I am advised by the Commissioner that due to the moratorium on recruitment there were no attestations in 2014.  The number of newly attested Garda&iacute; assigned to each Garda station in the Galway Division in 2015 to 2017 and to date in 2018 is as set out in the following table.<\/p><p><table><tr><th>Probationer Garda Allocations 2015 &ndash; 2018*<\/th><th><\/th><th><\/th><th><\/th><th><\/th><th><\/th><th><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>DIVISION<\/td><td>STATION<\/td><td>2015<\/td><td>2016<\/td><td>2017<\/td><td>2018<\/td><td>TOTAL<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>GALWAY<\/td><td>GALWAY<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>7<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>19<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>SALTHILL<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>3<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>TOTAL<\/td><td><\/td><td>5<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>7<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>22<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>*To date in 2018.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100082#WRN04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legislative Process","counter":457,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100083#WRO00200"},{"type":"question","counter":458,"qnumday":192,"qnumall":"[18994\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100083#WRO00300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the status of the report arising from the pre-legislative scrutiny on the communications (retention of data) Bill 2017 that proposes to significantly change the Communications (Retention of Data) Act 2011; the progress he has made on considering the report's recommendations in view of the fact that a case (details supplied) is still before the courts; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":459,"content":"<p>The report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality on pre-legislative scrutiny of the General Scheme of the Communications (Retention of Data) Bill 2017 was received in my private office on 5 February last.<\/p><p>I am considering the recommendations of the Joint Committee to see whether changes are required to be made to the Bill, which is currently with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel for drafting, with a view to publication once drafting has been completed.<\/p><p>It would not be appropriate for me to comment on a case before the courts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100083#WRO00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Deployment","counter":460,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100083#WRO00500"},{"type":"question","counter":461,"qnumday":193,"qnumall":"[19017\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100083#WRO00600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of garda&iacute; assigned to each Garda station in each division within the Dublin metropolitan region in 2017 and to date in 2018; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1296","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":462,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will appreciate, it is the Garda Commissioner who is responsible for the distribution of resources, including personnel, among the various Garda Divisions and I, as Minister, have no direct role in the matter.  Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.<\/p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that the Garda strength of the Dublin Metropolitan (DMR) Divisions on 31 March 2018, the latest date for which figures are available, was 3,443 with 165 Garda Reserves and 264 Garda civilian staff attached to the Division.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.<\/p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal.<\/p><p>Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just under 1,800 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, of whom 831 or 46% have been assigned to the D.M.R. Divisions.  I am pleased to say that Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 - an increase of over 600 since the end of 2016.<\/p><p>I am pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track.  This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College; some 400 of whom have already done so.  In total, 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year, some 200 of whom attested last month.  Further, Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, are on track to reach 14,000 by the end of this year.<\/p><p>In addition, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties.  There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training in 2018.<\/p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division, including the DMR Divisions.<\/p><p>The information requested by the Deputy in relation to the number of Garda&iacute; assigned to each Garda Station in the DMR in 2017 and on 31 March 2018, that latest date for which figures are currently available, is as set out in the following tables.<\/p><p><table><tr><th colspan=\"4\"><div><b>D.M.R.

This contrasts with the requirements placed upon finance providers when selling other financial products, for example when a consumer takes out a loan to buy a car.

The CCPC licenses credit intermediaries and keeps an online register of credit intermediaries holding a valid authorisation.  The CCPC also deals with complaints about the advertising of credit agreements.

In respect of Ophthalmology, the NTPF are currently authorising patients who will be nine months waiting by June 2018.<\/p>  <p>  In all cases, the appropriate care pathway of an individual patient remains a decision for their treating clinician.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the particular matter raised by the Deputy, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100087#WRS02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Nursing Homes Support Scheme Review","counter":653,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100087#WRS02800"},{"type":"question","counter":654,"qnumday":258,"qnumall":"[18774\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100087#WRS02900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of the fair deal nursing home scheme (details supplied) which is due to be amended.","asker":"1278","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":655,"content":"<p>My Department has been advancing work on this matter and having regard for this complex issue and for the sensitivities of the scheme I requested legal advice from the office of the Attorney General regarding potential changes to the legislation that will address this matter. <\/p>  <p>  The Department has received this advice and is exploring the policy and legislative changes necessary and any potential impacts as a result of amending the scheme.

It made its first report to Government in May 2017, which informed negotiations on a successor to the Lansdowne Road Agreement.  While the evidence collected by the Commission suggested that there are no significant recruitment difficulties across the public service vocational streams, it found evidence of some recruitment and retention issues in certain specific areas of the public service. These include certain areas of the health sector (including nurses and midwives) and the Defence Forces, as well as senior executive and professional posts in the civil service.<\/p>  <p>  It suggested that &lsquo;a more comprehensive examination of underlying difficulties&rsquo; could take place where &lsquo;such difficulties are clearly evident&rsquo;. The Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020, which was ratified by the PNA, provides for such an examination to take place.

For that reason, developing a new statutory scheme will be an important step in ensuring that the system operates in a consistent and fair manner for all those who need home care services.  It will also help to improve access to the home care services that people need in an affordable and sustainable way.  The system of regulation for home care will help to ensure that the public can be confident that the services provided are of a high standard.<\/p>  <p>  As an initial step in this process, the Department commissioned the Health Research Board to undertake a review of the home care systems in four other European countries.  This review, which was published in April 2017, will help us to learn from the experiences of other jurisdictions and will inform the debate and future consideration of approaches to formal home care financing and regulation here in Ireland.  I, along with Minister Harris, also launched a public consultation process in July 2017 which closed in October 2017.  The purpose of this consultation was to allow all those with views on this topic to have their say, including older people themselves, their families, and healthcare workers.  There was a very high response rate to the consultation process with approximately 2,600 submissions received.  I intend to publish a report of the findings of the consultation process at the end of May.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that a significant amount of detailed work remains to be carried out before final decisions are taken on the form of home care scheme and the system of regulation for these services.  This is required if reforms are to be successful, affordable and sustainable.<\/p>  <p>  However, while the new home care scheme is under development, the Department of Health and Health Service Executive (HSE) are continuing efforts to incrementally improve the existing services.  The HSE has begun streamlining services in 2018 by bringing together the funding for home help and standard home care packages, which now operate as a single home support service. This new approach will provide significant benefits including making the services easier to understand; streamlining the application and decision-making processes; and facilitating service users to move to changed levels of service as their assessed needs change, without the need for an additional application process.<\/p>  <p>  2018 has also seen a significant increase in the provision of home support services.  The HSE&rsquo;s National Service Plan provides for a target of some 17.094m home support hours to be provided to 50,500 people.  This represents an increase of 754,000 hours to 500 more people over last year.  In addition 235 intensive home care packages will provide 360,000 home support hours for people with complex needs.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE will also continue to encourage local integration of services and build appropriate care pathways, in particular for people with dementia and complex needs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100091#WRW01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Emergency Departments Waiting Times","counter":816,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100091#WRW01900"},{"type":"question","counter":817,"qnumday":312,"qnumall":"[19055\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100091#WRW02000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to reduce the time persons over 75 years of age are forced to wait in emergency departments; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1298","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":818,"content":"<p>Against a background of growing demand for unscheduled care and high acute hospital occupancy rates, Government provided &euro;30 million in 2017 and a further &euro;40 million in 2018 for measures to increase acute hospital capacity and alleviate overcrowding in Emergency Departments.  Almost 50% of this funding was used to deliver home support packages and transitional care beds to reduce the incidence of delayed discharges.  Furthermore, over 200 beds have been opened this winter and more beds are due to come on stream later in the year.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the increased level of resources provided, this winter has been particularly difficult for our health services with ED attendances up 3.7% and admissions up 3.3% during the first quarter of the year, as compared to the same period in 2017.<\/p>  <p>  The situation was further exacerbated by Storm Emma and the severe weather that followed.  In response to this, I approved a further &euro;5m in emergency funding to provide additional home support packages and transitional care beds to assist the safe discharge of patients who required support to return home following the adverse weather.<\/p>  <p>  In the light of the conclusions of the Health Service Capacity Review that the system will need nearly 2,600 additional acute hospital beds by 2031, I have asked my Department to work with the HSE to identify the location and mix of beds across the hospital system which can be opened and staffed this year and into 2019 in order to improve preparedness for Winter 2018\/2019.<\/p>  <p>  As outlined in the Capacity Review, the demographic pressures being experienced by the health service are such as to demand not just additional capacity but continued emphasis on health and well-being initiatives, an improved model of care with a stronger role for enhanced community based services and continued improvement in productivity including in acute hospitals.  The Government has approved a record level of capital investment in health at &euro;10.9 billion over the next 10 years.  This will provide for a major enhancement of the capacity of our health services to meet demand.  Importantly, the accelerated introduction of additional capacity for 2018\/2019 will be matched by forthcoming reforms including the publication of a detailed Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Plan and the overhaul of the current GP contract.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, a review of the Winter Initiative 2017\/2018 is being undertaken, which will inform a 3 year plan for unscheduled care, as well as supporting the provision of additional capacity in Winter 2018\/19.<\/p>  <p>  With specific regard to the Deputy's question on persons over 75 years of age, there are three main programmes focused on prioritising and improving the experience of patients over 75 in the emergency healthcare system.<\/p>  <p>  The Integrated Care Programme for Older People (ICPOP) and the National Clinical Programme for Older People (NCPOP) are developing integrated primary and secondary care services for older people.

Phase 1, which comprised the Dunboyne Rail Line project and involved the reopening of 7.5km of a railway line running off the Maynooth line, at Clonsilla, to the M3 interchange at Pace near Dunboyne, was opened in September 2010 with Park and Ride facilities for 1200 at Pace and for 300 at Dunboyne.  Phase 1 was completed in 2013 with the opening of Hansfield Station. Exchequer funding of &euro;160 million was approved for Phase 1.  No TEN-T funding was received for the Navan Rail Link Project.<\/p>  <p>  The plan for Phase 2 involved the extension of the Dunboyne Line between Clonsilla and M3 Parkway Station, onwards to north Navan. This development together with a number of other transport projects was postponed in 2011 due to the economic and fiscal crisis.<\/p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s recently published National Development Plan confirms a number of key investment priorities including not only protecting investments already made but also considerable investment in public transport modes including Bus, Rail, Luas, Metro, Cycling and Walking, next generation ticketing systems, customer information systems, transition to low emission fleets all to deliver a much expanded comprehensive public transport network that would match travel demand, alleviate congestion and deliver a range of benefits over the next decade. <\/p>  <p>  The NDP also recognises that over the period of the plan it will be very important to examine the role the interurban rail network can play in enhancing regional connectivity. In this regard the NDP notes that the NTA is required to review its Greater Dublin Area Transport Strategy before the end of 2021. This review will include a reappraisal of the extension of the Dunboyne\/M3 Parkway line to Dunshauglin and Navan taking into account the scale of new and planned development along the route and will allow for its consideration during the NDP Mid Term Review.<\/p>  <p>  Also looking ahead, the European Commission, in reviewing the implementation of the TEN-T core network by end 2023 and in consultation with Member States, will evaluate whether the core network should be modified to take into account developments in transport flows and national investment planning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100094#WRZ03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Traffic Management","counter":959,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100094#WRZ03600"},{"type":"question","counter":960,"qnumday":360,"qnumall":"[18764\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100094#WRZ03700","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"when his review of transport and traffic challenges in Dublin city will be published.","asker":"1311","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":961,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware the Dublin City Centre Transport Study, published jointly by Dublin City Council and the National Transport Authority (NTA) in 2015 recognised that a rebalancing of the available road space would be required on various streets to facilitate the introduction of additional capacity for public transport, cycling and walking. Through a multi-agency approach by NTA, DCC, and TII working in conjunction with the various Public Transport Operators, the measures set out in the 2015 Study (including the College Green Plaza proposal, developed by Dublin City Council, and currently being considered by An Bord Plean&aacute;la) are being progressed so as to ensure that Dublin City transport system is capable of operating efficiently and reliably, with consistent journey times, and that it is facilitating the City's continued development and growth. <\/p>  <p>  The NTA's \"Transport Strategy for the GDA 2016-2035\" provides the overarching framework for the planning and delivery of transport infrastructure and services in the GDA over the next two decades.

While no further studies on the impact of homelessness have been carried out by my Department, there can be little doubt that homelessness is an extremely distressing experience, and that any medium to long-term period living in a hotel or other emergency accommodation seriously impacts on normal family life and is particularly detrimental to children. <\/p>  <p>  Where children are homeless as part of a family experiencing homelessness, my Department is working closely with Tusla to provide supports to mitigate the challenges faced by these parents and children.  These include the introduction of free childcare for the children of families experiencing homelessness.  As part of the scheme a daily meal is provided for each child, the cost of which is included in the subvention rate.  The scheme is also designed to help those transitioning from homelessness to permanent accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  Tusla works together with other statutory and voluntary agencies to provide services and supports to children, young people and families experiencing homelessness.  Actions taken by Tusla include the provision of funding for child support workers and the appointment of a Homelessness Liaison Officer.<\/p>  <p>  Family Resource Centres, part funded by Tusla, are working with people who are experiencing homelessness and many have developed local responses to the needs of families in emergency accommodation.  These include, by way of example, family fun days, homework support, after school programmes, play therapy and transport services.  Under its Business Plan for 2018 Tusla has committed to assigning a Tusla team to all currently operational family hubs and to each new hub at the commencement of operations. Tusla has also committed to developing specific targeted initiatives so that children and their families who are homeless can avail of services in a safe, warm, welcoming space where they feel comfortable and respected.  These initiatives will be located in FRCs and places which are close to where children and families may access emergency accommodation. <\/p>  <p>  In recognition of the difficulties associated with homelessness and school attendance, Tusla&rsquo;s Educational Welfare Service offers a number of supports to children (and families) experiencing homelessness.<\/p>  <p>  Tusla&rsquo;s joint protocol with the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive (DRHE) covers child welfare and protection matters for children in emergency accommodation.  It is fully operational in the DRHE areas and it is intended to replicate this protocol across the State. A Joint Working Protocol has been signed between Tusla and Galway City Council. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, the DRHE is coordinating the development of a comprehensive National Quality Standards Framework for homeless services on behalf of all housing authorities.  Consultation with service users and key stakeholders, including Tusla, has been undertaken and the draft standards have been piloted in selected services.  These standards, including a child safety element which will provide homeless services with a framework for continuous quality improvement, will be implemented nationally. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that Tusla only intervenes in family life in exceptional circumstances.  Children who are with their families in emergency accommodation remain in the care of their parents or guardians.  Where Tusla has concerns regarding the welfare and development of any child they will provide family supports to assist that family and child.<\/p>  <p>  Ultimately, my concern is that we minimise and then eliminate the problem of homelessness.  In the meantime, I will continue to support measures to help those affected, to the greatest degree possible within my area of responsibility. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100095#WRAA01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Homeless Persons Data","counter":1003,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100095#WRAA02000"},{"type":"question","counter":1004,"qnumday":377,"qnumall":"[18654\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100095#WRAA02100","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the number of children or young adults that Tusla is assisting with housing needs; the costs associated with same for each of the past four years; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1347","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1005,"content":"<p>As these are operational matters, I have asked Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, to respond directly to the Deputy with the most up-to-date information.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100095#WRAA02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Protection","counter":1006,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100095#WRAA02300"},{"type":"question","counter":1007,"qnumday":378,"qnumall":"[18687\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100095#WRAA02400","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if she has sought clarification as to whether all family hubs funded by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government have child protection policies in place (details supplied); and if all staff are Garda vetted.","asker":"1215","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1008,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, all Private Emergency Accommodation service providers are required to have child protection policies in place.

Where appropriate, children who are in need of care and protection are received into the care of the State under the Child Care Act, 1991, as amended. <\/p><p>Regulations govern the placement of children in care.  These provide for the welfare of the child, the care practices, care records, accommodation and safety precautions. The Regulations also provide that the allocated social worker oversees the implementation of the child's care plan, visits the child and consults with family members, foster carers and other people involved with the child to ensure that his or her needs are being met and that the care being provided is optimal. <\/p><p>Children, depending on their identified need, may be placed in foster care either with relatives or general foster carers, in residential care, special care or other placement types.  The majority of children in care in Ireland are in foster care.  Matching carers with children and young people is outlined in the National Standards for Foster Care (2003), and the National Standards for Children's Residential Centres (2001) outlines the need for suitable placements in residential care. <\/p><p>It is vital that all children in care, and their carers, receive adequate support to ensure a successful placement.  Foster care is the main form of alternative care for children in need of care and protection, and is the preferred option for children who cannot live with their parents or guardians.  At the end of December 2017, there were 6,189 children in care in Ireland.  92% (5,702) of these were cared for in foster placements.  The majority of children are in the care of general foster carers. <\/p><p>Key elements of the support to be provided to children in care include: access to a link social worker for supervision and support to the foster carers; allocation of a dedicated social worker for children in care; onward referral and advocacy for access to specialist services to meet the child's identified needs, such as speech and language therapy, counselling and psychology services.<\/p><p>The link worker is a professionally qualified social worker and meets regularly with foster carers to supervise the capacity of the foster carers to adequately meet the needs of the child and to provide training, information and whatever other support that may be required.  At the end of December 2017, 81% (3554\/4384) of foster carers had a link social worker and 95%(5415\/5702) of children in foster care had an allocated social worker.<\/p><p>Tusla provides funding to the Irish Foster Care Association which provides supports to carers, including training and a phone advice service. <\/p><p>My Department receives regular detailed reports on key performance and activity indicators of service provision, including on children in care, from Tusla, the Child and Family Agency.  My officials have regular meetings on a monthly and quarterly basis with Tusla management to review the overall level of service provision, including areas in need of improvement. In addition to regular reports, Tusla also provides occasional or special topic reports, as required, which can then be used for budget and resource planning. <\/p><p>In addition to the reporting arrangements with Tusla my Department also reviews the findings of a number of independent bodies, which are made available in the inspection reports from the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) who inspect all statutory children's residential centres and special care units run by the State, as well as Fostering Services and Child Protection and Welfare Services in each area.

This means that there is now a statutory obligation on Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, to prepare an aftercare plan for each eligible child and young person.

This might include identifying suitable accommodation, which for many young people may mean remaining with their former foster carer.<\/p>  <p>  A minority of young people leaving care are at a more pronounced risk of entering unstable accommodation due to the complexity of their support needs.  Funding is now available to Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) under the Capital Assistance Scheme (CAS) to provide accommodation to these particularly vulnerable young people.

This is a review required by legislation.  It examines the projected income and expenditure of the SIF over the course of the 55 year period from 2016 to 2071.<\/p>  <p>  The review found that the fund currently has a modest surplus of income over expenditure.  In 2016 there was a surplus of &euro;0.4 billion on expenditure of &euro;8.8 billion and receipts of &euro;9.2 billion.  However, this will reduce over the next two years and will return to a small shortfall in 2020.  The annual shortfalls are projected to increase from 2021 onwards as the ageing of the population impacts.<\/p>  <p>  Projections indicate that, in the absence of further action to tackle the shortfall, the excess of expenditure over income of the fund will increase significantly over the medium to long term.  The shortfall in expenditure over income is projected to increase from &euro;0.2 billion in 2020 to &euro;3.3 billion by 2030 and to &euro;22.2 billion by 2071.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the review the independent consultants were required to project the additional PRSI expenditure if invalidity pension and illness, jobseeker's and carer&rsquo;s benefits were extended to Class S self-employed workers and the PRSI contribution rates required to provide these benefits on a revenue neutral basis.<\/p>  <p>  The review found that the combined cost of introducing the invalidity, illness, jobseeker's and carer&rsquo;s benefits for Class S contributions is estimated to be &euro;118 million in 2018, rising steadily to &euro;223 million in 2020.  By 2025 the projected cost is &euro;413 million and, over the period of the review the cost would rise to &euro;1.3 billion in 2071.<\/p>  <p>  These costs assume that the cost of extending invalidity pension to the self-employed builds up steeply for the first 10 years after introduction after which time the scheme is almost at maturity or a steady state.<\/p>  <p>  For the shorter term schemes, illness and jobseeker's benefits, it is estimated that they will reach maturity after 2 years.  Projected expenditure on jobseeker's benefit assumes the same incidence rate as prevail in the employed (PRSI Class A) population.<\/p>  <p>  The review indicates that, where these benefits are extended to the self-employed, the Class S rate of PRSI contribution would need to increase substantially in order to ensure that the benefits are delivered in a revenue neutral manner.  It estimates that when expenditure on the additional benefits is considered over the entire projection period, PRSI rates would need to increase by 94% under a scenario of no subvention from the exchequer.  This is equivalent to an increase of the Class S contribution rate from the current 4% rate to 7.8%.<\/p>  <p>  This increased contribution is attributable to the costs of extending these additional benefits to PRSI Class S contributors.  It does not take account of the value to PRSI Class S contributors of access to the range of existing benefits, and in particular State pension contributory.  The consultants estimated that the typical cost of State pension (contributory) on its own is of the order of 10% to 15%, depending on other factors including rate of average earnings and date of commencing paying PRSI.  Adding in the other benefits referenced, the total Class S rate of contribution to ensure revenue neutrality would be of the order of 20% per annum.<\/p>  <p>  The findings of the Review play an important role in informing the overall debate on policy developments in relation to the SIF in the years ahead including the financial sustainability of the Fund given the expected demographic challenges and consideration of extending the scope of benefits for workers generally, including the self-employed.  The Actuarial Review provides government with a timely and evidence-led opportunity to undertake a full review of our social insurance system and to consult with stakeholders.<\/p>  <p>  Work has commenced on preparation of the consultation paper in my Department with a view to adhering to the timetable set out in the Pensions Roadmap.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100099#WREE03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Pension (Contributory) Expenditure","counter":1188,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100099#WREE04000"},{"type":"question","counter":1189,"qnumday":441,"qnumall":"[19122\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100099#WREE04100","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the progress she has made to set a formal benchmark target of 34% of average earnings for State pension (contributory) payments and institute a process whereby future changes in pension rates of payment are explicitly linked to changes in the consumer price index and average wages; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1227","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1190,"content":"<p>The level of income provided to pensioners in the form of the State pension is currently decided through the annual budget process.

Dublin City Council is progressing the procurement of these sites as a top priority. In total, the two sites will deliver over 1,200 new build homes. <\/p><p>In addition, the Government is determined to make cost rental a major part of the Irish housing system, similar to the role it plays in many European countries.  Under this approach, rents are set at levels to recover the construction costs and to facilitate the management and administration of developments, but with only a minimal profit margin included.  A pilot project is currently being progressed by D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, at Enniskerry Road, Dundrum, in conjunction with the Housing Agency and Approved Housing Bodies (AHB), using land owned by the Agency.  This pilot is providing very valuable learning to inform the wider roll-out. We are now working with the EIB and other stakeholders with a view to announcing the first major cost rental project in Dublin shortly, with a cost rental programme across Dublin and other cities to follow.<\/p><p>Importantly, the new measures announced in January of this year are specifically targeted at delivering more affordable homes from our State land bank in urban areas where affordability issues are greatest, and have the potential to deliver more than 3,000 new affordable homes to buy or rent initially, with a target delivery of at least 10,000 new affordable homes across all initiatives in the longer term. <\/p><p>Recognising that there may be enabling infrastructure requirements on some sites, I am also providing Exchequer funding of &euro;25 million, over 2018 and 2019, as a key contribution towards the delivery of more affordable housing. Applications for this funding will be invited shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100100#WRFF03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"question","counter":1230,"qnumday":455,"qnumall":"[18847\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100100#WRFF04100","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the efforts in place by his Department to allocate housing to the 76 housing applicants in Ballyshannon, County Donegal who are on the housing list in the county; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1343","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1231,"content":"<p>As Minister, I am primarily responsible for the formulation and implementation of policy and for the preparation of legislation in relation to housing nationally.  The day-to-day operation of the social housing system is a matter for the relevant local authority.  The allocation of social housing support is a matter for the relevant local authority in accordance with the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 and associated regulations.  Section 22 of the Act requires all housing authorities, as a reserved function, to make an allocation scheme determining the order of priority to be accorded in the allocation of dwellings to households qualified for social housing support and to households approved for a transfer, the allocation of which would, in the opinion of the authority, meet the accommodation needs and requirements of the households.<\/p><p>Under the Housing Acts 1966 to 2009, I, as Minister, have no function in relation to the assessment of individual housing applications and the allocation of accommodation to eligible households, which are matters solely for housing authorities.  Section 6 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 specifically provides that the Minister&rsquo;s power to issue policy directions and guidelines to housing authorities in relation to their housing functions shall not be construed as enabling him or her to exercise any power or control in relation to any individual case with which a housing authority is or may be concerned.  More particularly, section 22(17) of the 2009 Act provides that the Minister&rsquo;s statutory power to issue directions to a housing authority regarding the operation of its allocation scheme shall not be construed as enabling him or her to direct the allocation of a dwelling to a specific household.<\/p><p>In terms of meeting the need of households on waiting lists across the country, there are a range of social housing supports which qualified households may avail of in order to meet their housing needs.  In addition to traditional social housing built and provided directly by local authorities, support is also provided via the private rental sector through the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) and Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) and through the voluntary sector via approved housing bodies. <\/p><p>Rebuilding Ireland set ambitious targets for social housing delivery.  I have made it clear to local authorities that the delivery of social housing supports must be focussed on and consistent with their assessments of housing need, a process which now takes place on an annual basis. <\/p><p>Last year, an additional &euro;500 million was secured during Budget 2018 negotiations, to increase the social housing delivery ambition from 47,000 to 50,000 social housing homes by end 2021.

Section 162(3) of the Act provides that no enforcement action under the Part VIII enforcement provisions of the Act shall be stayed or withdrawn by reason of an application for retention of unauthorised development.<\/p>  <p>  I have no plans to amend the provisions in this regard at this time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100101#WRGG03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Approved Housing Bodies","counter":1262,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100101#WRGG03600"},{"type":"question","counter":1263,"qnumday":469,"qnumall":"[19026\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100101#WRGG03700","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 646 of 8 March 2018, the position regarding the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1264,"content":"<p>Having compiled the data requested, I replied to the Deputy's Parliamentary Question of 8 March 2018 in accordance with standard procedures on 29 March 2018.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100101#WRGG03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Electoral Register","counter":1266,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100102#WRHH00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1267,"qnumday":470,"qnumall":"[19044\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100102#WRHH00300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the new format of the electoral register as produced by Dublin City Council, Fingal County Council and D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council;
