At the end of 2016, a total of 350 rapid build homes were advancing through various stages of delivery, including construction, with 22 rapid build homes being delivered and occupied in 2016.  A further 650 rapid build homes will be advanced in 2017, with another 500 units to be delivered in 2018. <\/p>  <p>  In terms of specific progress at the end of 2016, Dublin City Council were advancing a number of rapid build projects, including on four sites at Finglas, Darndale, Cherry Orchard and Drimnagh, which are under construction and will deliver a further 131 homes over the coming months.  My Department is working closely with the Council to expedite delivery.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to these four projects, further work across the four local authorities has resulted in the 350 rapid build homes, referred to above, advancing through various stages of delivery by the end of the 2016.  The additional sites in question are in Dublin City, Dun Laoghaire, Cherry Orchard, Tallaght, Blanchardstown and Balbriggan.  Construction dates will be finalised in the context of completion of procurement and award of contracts.  In addition, sites are being identified and planning requirements advanced for a further 650 rapid build homes in 2017, across the 4 Dublin local authority areas and other local authority areas across the country.  This will ensure that the commitment in Rebuilding Ireland to deliver 1,000 rapid build homes over 2016 and 2017 is met.  It is important to note that the units being delivered are permanent, high quality homes, with 60 year life guarantees.<\/p>  <p>  There has been significant pressure to ramp-up rapid build delivery, which local authorities have been responding to positively.  However, there are requirements, such as in relation to procurement, that must be adhered to and in some instances this has caused delays.  Notwithstanding this, I am confident that all parties are\u00a0endeavouring to move the programme forward speedily. \u00a0Of particular note is the establishment of a framework of rapid build contractors by the Office of Government Procurement, which means that local authorities will be able to run quicker procurement competitions and advance projects to site more efficiently and effectively.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, it is important to note that rapid delivery needs to be viewed in the context of the wider range of solutions to address the unacceptable level of families in emergency accommodation.

Twenty-one local authorities, including Kildare County Council, have submitted a total of 74 project applications, relating to specific sites or development land areas. <\/p>  <p>  The overall total cost of the 74 funding bid applications is approximately &euro;800m, with funding of some &euro;600 million being sought from the Exchequer and local authorities agreeing to fund approximately &euro;200 million as part of their matching fund requirements.  It will not be possible to approve all applications, given the scale and value of applications received.<\/p>  <p>  The viability of the applications is currently being examined in detail against the assessment criteria set out in the Call for Proposals, with a focus on the level of funding required and what it might leverage, the number of housing units that could be delivered, their strategic location and speed of delivery, and affordability levels of a proportion of the homes.

While commercial property investment has been a key focus for some of the REITs launched to date in Ireland, residential property also forms part of the sector's interest and exposure.  It is expected that the sector will continue to develop over time and in so doing to increase the supply of professionally managed, good quality, secure and affordable rented accommodation.  Investments by REITs that increase the number of dwellings available in the rented sector are a positive development.

Refugees have been resettled in 39 different communities throughout Ireland and in all four Dublin local authority areas to date.<\/p>  <p>  The key elements of the programme are:<\/p>  <p>  - The programme is overseen at the national level by an Inter-Departmental Working Group chaired by the Office for the Promotion of Migrant Integration (OPMI) in the Department of Justice and Equality.<\/p>  <p>  - It is overseen at the local level by an inter-agency working group established in each receiving community and chaired by the Local Authority.<\/p>  <p>  - Representatives of the OPMI resettlement team, accompanied by interpreters, meet the refugees on arrival airside in the airport and accompany them to an Emergency Reception and Orientation Centre where they are accommodated for approximately 8 to 10 weeks.<\/p>  <p>  - An 8 to 10 week language training and orientation programme is provided by the Education and Training Board in cooperation with OPMI at the Emergency Reception and Orientation Centre.  Speakers are invited from various organisations to provide information about their services to the refugees.  Interpretation is provided to ensure a full understanding of the content on the part of the refugees.<\/p>  <p>  - Childcare is provided free of charge to allow the adults to attend the programme.<\/p>  <p>  - Education provision is made for school age children by the Department of Education and Skills.<\/p>  <p>  - Refugees are assisted to apply for medical cards and assigned a GP.<\/p>  <p>  - Refugees are taken to register with the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) where they are issued with a Registration Certificate and to the Department of Social Protection to register for a public services card and to be assessed for a social protection income.<\/p>  <p>  - Programme refugees have, in general, the same rights and entitlements as an Irish citizen in relation e.g. to employment, education and training, medical care, social welfare, access to the courts etc.  OPMI works in consultation with all relevant agencies at the national and local level to ensure that refugees can access services to which they are entitled and that the necessary services are put in place as quickly as possible.<\/p>  <p>  - Prior to the transfer of refugees to their permanent location, decisions about housing, education, health services etc. have to be taken by the local inter-agency working group in consultation with OPMI.<\/p>  <p>  - The OPMI arranges the transfer from the Emergency Reception and Orientation Centre to the receiving community.  OPMI staff also accompany refugees to their first appointments with the various public services in the local community, providing interpretation where required and assisting in the resolution of any difficulties etc.<\/p>  <p>  - Further language training is provided in the receiving community by the Education and Training Board for a period of 12 months post arrival.<\/p>  <p>  - The OPMI resettlement team supports the local inter-agency working group for approximately 18 months after the transfer of the refugees to the receiving community.  Grants are made by the OPMI to the receiving community to employ a resettlement support worker for a period of up to one year.  The Resettlement Support Worker organises a suite of integration initiatives during the first year post arrival, such as the establishment of homework clubs, developing links with sporting clubs; promoting participation in local men&rsquo;s and women&rsquo;s activities; organising intercultural events and promoting participation in the arts and in volunteering at a local level.  In the first year post resettlement, the focus is on preparing refugees for employment and independent living.  Language and other training programmes are organised at a local level by the Education and Training Board in consultation with INTREO and other local agencies.<\/p>  <p>  - All resettled refugees have the contact details of their key OPMI resettlement officer should any issues arise that cannot be resolved locally.<\/p>  <p>  Similar supports will be provided for all refugees admitted under the Irish Refugee Protection Programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011900058#WRC03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1277"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Naturalisation Applications","counter":142,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011900058#WRC04000"},{"type":"question","counter":143,"qnumday":57,"qnumall":"[2261\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011900058#WRC04100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will review the case of an application for naturalisation (details supplied) whereby the person's application cannot be processed any further with INIS until the person provides a passport from the Ivory Coast; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1298","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":144,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that the processing of the application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person concerned is under consideration and has not yet reached a conclusion but I understand that the case is due to be submitted for decision in the very near future.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, the granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.<\/p>  <p>  It is recognised that all applicants for citizenship would wish to have a decision on their application without delay.

The programme is premised on the key requirement that applications are beneficial for Ireland, good for job creation, are in the public interest and that the funds invested are legally acquired and owned by the investor (i.e. not borrowed).  It is also essential that applicants be of good character. In return the investor applicant and their immediate family members are granted rights of residence in the State which will allow them to enter the State on multi-entry visas and to remain here for an initial period of 2 years, renewal for a further 3 years, subject to certain criteria being met (i.e. the investment has not been withdrawn, they continue to be law abiding and self sufficient). <\/p><p>All applications under the Immigrant Investor Programme are considered on their merits by an independent Interdepartmental Evaluation Committee who have the requisite skills and experience to evaluate the applications.  The membership comprises of officials from the IDA; Enterprise Ireland; Department of Finance; Department of Foreign Affairs &amp;amp; Trade; Department of Jobs Enterprise and Innovation, and the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (which also provides the administrative assistance to the Committee).  <\/p><p>I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service of my Department that a total of 130 applications have been approved, resulting in an Investment of approximately &euro;65 million at &euro;500,000 per investor.

This was reduced to &euro;500,000 to stimulate interest in the programme.  In total 450 IIP applications have been made since April 2012, with some 273 applications i.e. 40 % being submitted between July and November 2016.  This upsurge in applications was considered by the independent Evaluation Committee who recommended the restoration of the minimum investment threshold to its original level.  I approved this course of action having brought the matter to the attention of my Cabinet colleagues. <\/p><p>One notable trend associated with the surge in applications under the scheme has been the significant number of the applications received in the area of Primary Health Care Centres, nursing homes and social housing.  The evaluation committee considered that investment in these areas needed to be co-ordinated with the major state service providers responsible.  In that context, discussions have taken place, and will continue, with officials from the relevant Departments and where necessary other State agencies, to ensure that any possible investment options are appropriately aligned with the strategic priorities of the State's health and social housing strategies.  The apparent slowdown in applications approved in 2016 is explained by this need to consult with these stakeholders.  A final decision on some 306 applications (all made prior to the increase in the threshold), will be made in coming weeks. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011900059#WRD00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Immigration Status","counter":152,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011900059#WRD00350"},{"type":"question","counter":153,"qnumday":60,"qnumall":"[2299\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011900059#WRD00400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the current residency status in the case of a person (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":154,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that the person concerned currently holds residency and should be aware of his or her position in that regard. <\/p><p>The Deputy may wish to note that queries in relation to the status of individual cases may be made directly to the INIS of my Department by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

What I can say is that the Garda Authorities will continue to take all necessary security measures proportionate to the level of terrorist threat and all the relevant agencies here co-operate closely in respect of any threats identified.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has developed considerable operational capacities in countering terrorism and in responding to critical incidents.  There is, in particular, a highly-trained and well-equipped special intervention capability in the Emergency Response Unit that is supported by the regional Armed Support Units and the range of other resources across the Garda organisation.  In addition, the considerable skills and resources of the Defence Forces are also available in support where needed.<\/p><p>There is a number of persons here whose activities in support of extremism give rise to concern and they will continue to be monitored closely by the Garda authorities and all appropriate measures will be taken in this regard. <\/p><p>The Garda Authorities will continue to work closely with their EU and other international security and intelligence counterparts in responding to the shared threat of international terrorism.  The gathering and sharing of relevant information is an important aspect of this international co-operation.  The Government is committed to providing An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with the necessary resources to enhance their connectivity to a range of EU and other international resources and significant work is ongoing in this regard.  This includes connecting to the Schengen Information System and, indeed, to other EU and Interpol information-sharing resources relevant to countering the terrorist threat.<\/p><p>A series of measures is currently being rolled at EU-level out to build on the current EU framework for information-sharing, combating terrorism and controlling illegal firearms, and Ireland is fully engaged in pursuing these developments.<\/p><p>I should emphasise for the Deputy that the main security threat in the State is from republican paramilitary groups who reject the Good Friday Agreement and they continue to be a priority counter-terrorism focus for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Garda authorities will continue to target those involved and to work closely with their counterparts in Northern Ireland in combating these groups.

The Strategy identifies high and rapidly rising rents as the key driver of accommodation insecurity for tenants and a factor in the termination of tenancies.

In this regard Dublin City Council will be launching a call for Expressions of Interest in relation to three Dublin sites.  In the longer term the strategy aims to support the development of the not-for-profit rental sectors and an Expert Group to take forward this work will be established in the near future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011900062#WRG04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Housing Provision","counter":329,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011900063#WRH00150"},{"type":"question","counter":330,"qnumday":119,"qnumall":"[2322\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011900063#WRH00200","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will review the extent to which under present circumstances he can augment the local authority house building programme given the increased incidents of homelessness; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1286"},{"type":"question","counter":331,"qnumday":120,"qnumall":"[2324\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011900063#WRH00300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"to outline the extent to which he can foresee the implementation of a major emergency house building programme to address the needs of countless families currently homeless or due to become homeless as a result of repossessions in respect of buy-to-let properties or family homes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1286"},{"type":"question","counter":332,"qnumday":122,"qnumall":"[2326\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011900063#WRH00400","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"to outline the extent to which he remains assured that adequate suitable and serviced building lands remain available in each local authority area to facilitate house building in line with requirements; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":333,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 119, 120 and 122 together.<\/p><p>The publication of <i>Rebuilding Ireland: Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness<\/i>, has seen a new level of ambition in respect of tackling the housing crises and I am confident it represents a well judged and comprehensive response to the urgent need for social housing and to respond to the need for an increased general housing supply.<\/p><p>To support the ambitious target of 47,000 new social housing units, I have secured &euro;5.35 billion in exchequer investment over the period to 2021.

In 2016, I provided over &euro;175 million to local authorities for such acquisitions and these approaches are delivering early social housing solutions for people in need of social housing.<\/p><p><i>Rebuilding Ireland<\/i>contains a number of integrated actions to underpin active land supply management for the delivery of housing.  Initially, this involves identifying and mapping sites in local authority and public ownership with appropriate lands to be master-planned to deliver increased mixed-tenure housing, including social and more affordable homes, to meet demand.<\/p><p>The Housing Agency, in close consultation with my Department and local authorities, has already commenced the mapping of approximately 700 sites in local authority ownership and those held by the Agency under the Land Aggregation Scheme, showing their location, size, boundaries and other information.<\/p><p>This map will form part of the broader National Land Supply Management Strategy (as committed to under Action 3.5 of <i>Rebuilding Ireland<\/i>), which is being developed within the context of the National Planning Framework (NPF).  In this regard, an initial public consultation process will commence later this month with the aim of finalising the NPF later in 2017. Once collated, the map will be made available, and will be updated to record the development and use of these lands.<\/p><p>With regard to the availability of land in private ownership, the <i>Residential Land Availability Survey 2014<\/i>, which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: , indicated that there was 17,434 hectares of residential zoned lands nationally which could theoretically enable the construction of over 414,000 dwellings.  The mapped results of the survey are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: .  A further Residential Land Availability Survey will be undertaken in due course.<\/p><p>A suite of actions is being implemented under <i>Rebuilding Ireland<\/i>, building on actions already underway, to ensure these sites are activated, to increase the supply of homes, at a far greater scale and at more generally affordable prices and rents.  For example, targeted reductions in development contribution requirements have been introduced and &euro;200m in State funding is being provided for key enabling infrastructure, through the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund.<\/p><p>In this regard, in November 2016, under Pillar 3 of <i>Rebuilding Ireland<\/i>, I announced details of 23 Major Urban Housing Development Sites, with the potential to deliver up to 30,000 additional homes on existing zoned lands and close to the key areas of demand over the next 3-4 years.  These sites will be highlighted as exemplars for the co-ordination and delivery of plan-led housing development and active land management.

Moreover, I understand that this matter is the subject of a criminal investigation.<\/p>  <p>  The elected council has primary responsibility for governance and oversight generally of the local authority.  The Local Government Act 2001 also includes specific measures to provide oversight of the financial governance arrangements in place within local authorities.  Section 122 of the Act requires each local authority to establish an audit committee.  The functions of the audit committee include: the review of financial and budgetary reporting practices within the local authority; and the development of best practice by the local authority of its internal audit function.  The accounts of each local authority are subject to statutory audit annually by the Local Government Audit Service.  The local government auditors are independent in the performance of their professional functions and may prepare a report on any matter which comes to notice during the course of the audit.  Any implications arising from such reports for the financial governance legislative framework would be considered carefully by my Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011900063#WRH03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Wind Energy Guidelines","counter":370,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011900063#WRH03050"},{"type":"question","counter":371,"qnumday":133,"qnumall":"[2372\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011900063#WRH03100","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"when he will publish the new wind farm guidelines.","asker":"1250","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":372,"content":"<p>In December 2013, my Department published proposed draft revisions to the noise, setback distance and shadow flicker aspects of the 2006 <i>Wind<\/i><i>Energy Development Guidelines<\/i>.

Activity by institutional and professional residential sector investment specialists such as Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITS) in purchasing housing and engaging in the building out of part completed schemes and commencing new housing projects is a positive signal of investment beginning to flow back into the housing sector to provide increased housing supply<i>.<\/i><\/p><p>The acquisition and management of properties by REITS is one component part of a more sustainable, long-term property rental market for both investors and tenants.  While commercial property investment has been a key focus for some of the REITs launched to date in Ireland, residential property also forms part of the sector's interest and exposure.  It is expected that the sector will continue to develop over time and in so doing to increase the supply of professionally managed, good quality, secure and affordable rented accommodation.  Investments by REITs that increase the number of dwellings available in the rented sector are a positive development.  That said, a diverse sector, which includes both institutional investors specialised in providing and managing larger scale residential rental projects and small scale and individual landlords, is inherently more stable and less exposed to property market risk and volatility. <\/p><p>Historically the private rented sector in Ireland has been largely made up of small-scale landlords, who will continue to provide the bulk of private rented accommodation.  Institutional investors can also help provide the range of tenancy options that households need across their lifecycles.  Attracting large scale investment in property has an important role to play in helping to deliver the professional high-standard rental sector that tenants deserve.<\/p><p>In cases where buy-to-let mortgages are sold on by the original lender, the rights and responsibilities of the landlord and tenant and the terms of the mortgage are unaffected.  However, I am very aware of the scale of the problem of debt distressed landlords.  There are more than 25,000 buy to let mortgage accounts in arrears and more than half of these have arrears of over two years.  In many cases, when these result in receivership and repossession, the lender does seek to sell the property with vacant possession, although such cases only come to the attention of the Residential Tenancies Board when a dispute arises.  Under the <i>Strategy for the Rental Sector<\/i>, published in December, my Department is establishing a working group with the participation of the Departments of Justice &amp;amp; Equality, Finance, and Jobs, Enterprise &amp;amp; Innovation, to explore the scope for landlord obligations to be transferred to receivers in such cases.

Where there is a dispute regarding the appropriate period of notice to be given in respect of a tenancy or the validity of a notice of termination, the dispute may be referred to the RTB for resolution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011900064#WRJ02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social and Affordable Housing Provision","counter":402,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011900064#WRJ03000"},{"type":"question","counter":403,"qnumday":144,"qnumall":"[2531\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011900064#WRJ03100","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"his plans to reverse the instruction to local authorities not to construct any further one-off local authority houses in the countryside on land provided at a nominal fee by the applicant; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1312","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":404,"content":"<p>As housing authorities, local authorities are responsible for the identification of the social housing need in their area and the development of appropriate responses to the need identified.

Its main aim was to help unemployed jobseekers to break the vicious cycle of &lsquo;no experience no job, but no job no experience&rsquo;.  Since then over 19,000 Host Organisations have offered work placement opportunities to over 48,000 participants.  A detailed breakdown of participants on a county basis is available in Appendix 1.<\/p><p>My Department does not compile the detailed progression statistics on an annual basis requested, however the findings of the recent external evaluation of JobBridge by Indecon Economic Consultants shows that it has been very effective in improving the employment outcomes of jobseekers.  It indicates that 79% of participants &ndash; over 38,000 people &ndash; have had some period of employment since completing their placement, with over 64% still in employment.  Compared to non-participants, jobseekers who participated in JobBridge improved their employment outcomes by 32%.  By any measure this is a significant uplift and shows that placements with a direct link to an employer deliver higher employment outcomes than other options.<\/p><p>Appendix 2 contains tables on employment progression outcomes highlighted in the Indecon evaluation.  Table 5.13 shows progression outcomes by length of time since the internship finished.  Table 5.10 shows the current employment status of participants by sector of Host Organisations.  The complete evaluation can be found at: .  <b><\/b><\/p><p>Just under half (45%) of all placements finish early &ndash; for a variety of reasons.  Almost half (49%) of those who finish early say it is to take up employment and a further 7% go on to further education, training or another internship.  About 30% leave for a variety of personal, domestic or health reasons.  14% leave early because they did not find the internship suitable, which is not surprising given that, for many, JobBridge is a first-chance opportunity and sometimes participants find that the particular career direction is not for them.  The Department continues to work with them to support them with a range of alternative pathways to work.  Appendix 3 provides an annual breakdown on a county basis of the number of participants who dropped out of the scheme before completion.<\/p><p>An annual breakdown of the total number of companies that were suspended from participation in the scheme for any period since its inception is attached in Appendix 4.  The table also highlights the number of participants in those companies, broken down by employment sector.  No companies were suspended in 2011 or 2016.  The Jobbridge scheme is no longer open to new participants or host organisations as such.  There are no companies currently disqualified or suspended from participation in the scheme. <\/p><p>All participants are entitled to a quality work experience and every reasonable effort is made by my Department to minimise the risk of exploitation of the scheme by Host Organisations.  All complaints are taken seriously, fully investigated and appropriate action taken in cases of non-compliance.<\/p><p>In addition to responding to complaints, my Department operates a robust monitoring regime and has conducted over 13,000 on-site inspection visits.  The evidence from these inspections is that the vast majority of host organisations are fully compliant with the terms and conditions of the scheme.  In fact, of the more than 19,000 Host Organisations that have participated in JobBridge, a total of 86 (less than half of 1%) have been suspended from participating in the scheme for any period.  <\/p><p>The level of misuse of the scheme is therefore much lower than is popularly thought and this position has been confirmed by the Indecon evaluation.  The scheme is viewed positively by the majority of participants.  For example 70% of participants reported a quality work experience.<\/p><p>The Deputy will be aware that I intend to replace JobBridge with a new work experience programme later this year that is better suited to the much-improved labour market and addresses criticisms of the scheme.  JobBridge was closed to new applications from October 2016 to allow for a period of consultation with key stakeholders on design principles that I announced and to facilitate an orderly wind down of the existing scheme.  These consultations are currently underway.<\/p><p><b>Appendix 1<\/b><\/p><p><b>Number of participants by county*<\/b><table><tr><th>County<\/th><th>Total<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Carlow<\/td><td>693<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cavan<\/td><td>682<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Clare<\/td><td>998<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork<\/td><td>4,343<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Donegal<\/td><td>1,611<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin<\/td><td>15,274<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Galway<\/td><td>3,079<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kerry<\/td><td>1,553<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kildare<\/td><td>1,745<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kilkenny<\/td><td>713<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Laois<\/td><td>695<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Leitrim<\/td><td>305<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Limerick<\/td><td>2,613<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Longford<\/td><td>369<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Louth<\/td><td>1,346<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Mayo<\/td><td>1,314<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Meath<\/td><td>1,187<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Monaghan<\/td><td>848<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Offaly<\/td><td>663<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Roscommon<\/td><td>431<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Sligo<\/td><td>914<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Tipperary<\/td><td>1,536<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Waterford<\/td><td>1,592<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Westmeath<\/td><td>1,231<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wexford<\/td><td>1,399<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wicklow<\/td><td>1,018<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Grand Total<\/td><td>48,152<\/td><\/tr><\/table><blockquote>*Figures as of July 2016<\/blockquote><b>Appendix 2<\/b><\/p><p><b>Employment Progression Outcomes of Participants<\/b><\/p><p><b>Table 5.13: Progression Outcomes - If Intern Gained Paid Employment at any Stage since Internship by Length of Time since Internship Finishing (Percentage of Respondents)<\/b><table><tr><th><\/th><th><\/th><th>Completed Internship Less than 1 Month<\/th><th>Completed 1-2<br \/><br \/>Months<\/th><th>Completed 3-4<br \/><br \/>Months<\/th><th>Completed 5-6<br \/><br \/>Months<\/th><th>Completed 7-12<br \/><br \/>Months<\/th><th>Completed 13-24<br \/><br \/>Months<\/th><th>Completed Over 24 Months Ago<\/th><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>All Responses<\/td><td>May 2016<\/td><td>March- April 2016<\/td><td>January- February 2016<\/td><td>November- December 2015<\/td><td>May- October 2015<\/td><td>April 2015-<br \/><br \/>May 2014<\/td><td>Before May 2014<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Gained paid employment at any stage since internship<\/td><td>79.1%<\/td><td>41.0%<\/td><td>53.8%<\/td><td>57.8%<\/td><td>66.2%<\/td><td>70.7%<\/td><td>79.2%<\/td><td>88.8%<\/td><\/tr><\/table><b><i>Source: Indecon and DSP Confidential Survey of JobBridge Interns<\/i><\/b><\/p><p><b>Table 5.10: Progression Outcomes - Current Status of Intern by Sector of Host Organisation<\/b><\/p><p><b>(Percentage of Respondents)<\/b><table><tr><th>Please indicate which of the following best<br \/><br \/>describes your current situation:<\/th><th><br \/><br \/>All Responses<\/th><th><div>Private Sector\/Commercial Organisation (incl.<br \/><br \/>Commercial Semi-State Organisations)<\/div><\/th><th><div>Public Sector Organisation (incl.

On 19 December, I issued a statement condemning the brutal assassination of the Russian Ambassador to Turkey, Andrei Karlov.  On 1 January, I issued a statement following the shooting at the Reina nightclub in Istanbul in the early hours of that morning.  I unreservedly condemned this unspeakable attack, in which 39 people tragically lost their lives.  I extended my condolences to the families of the deceased and injured in these heinous events, and to all the people of Turkey, who have suffered a surge in violent, terrorist attacks over the past year, carried out mainly by the outlawed PKK and its affiliates or ISIS.<\/p>  <p>  The situation in Turkey was discussed at the meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council on 16 November.  Turkey was also extensively discussed in the context of Enlargement at the meeting of the General Affairs Council on 13 December.  Presidency conclusions were subsequently issued, which were highly critical of current trends in Turkey, but, nonetheless, maintained the country&rsquo;s candidate status.  Ireland continues to support keeping the lines of communication open in all fora.  All the people of Turkey, including minorities, deserve the prospect of a future in keeping with European values and it is important to keep the long-term rights and interests of all of the people of Turkey in mind in our discussion on EU-Turkey relations.    <\/p>  <p>  Turkey was also briefly discussed at the meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council on 16 January and I expect that there will be further discussions at future meetings<\/p>  <p>  It is clear that the situation in Turkey remains very difficult.  Ireland, along with our European partners, stand in solidarity with Turkey in the fight against terrorism.<\/p>  <p>  While the Turkish authorities clearly need to combat terrorism vigorously and effectively, they must also maintain a measured and proportionate response which upholds the rule of law.

The list of my formal engagements since 23 June is presented in the following Table.  It is important to note that alongside these formal discussions, I engage on an informal basis very regularly with my EU counterparts including in the margins of EU FAC meetings and other international and multilateral gatherings.  I also discuss Brexit matters in the context of Northern Ireland on a regular basis with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, James Brokenshire.<\/p><p>Most recently, I met with the Spanish Foreign Minister on 16 January and I hope to have bilateral discussions with my Luxembourg and Finnish counterpart in the weeks ahead.

pension provision applies, including the An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Permanent Defence Force, the Irish Prison Service, firefighters, the judiciary and TDs.<\/p><p>For pre-1995 recruited public servants the employee or member contributions position varies across sectors.  However, most public servants recruited since 1995, including Single Scheme members, are subject to the following occupational pension scheme contribution rates:<\/p><p>-  3% of pay, plus<\/p><p>-  3.5% of net pay (which is defined as pay minus twice the Contributory State Pension).<\/p><p>Irish public service pension schemes operate on an unfunded pay-as-you-go basis, being exempt from the funding standard requirements set down in Part IV of the Pensions Act 1990.\u00a0 On that account public service\u00a0schemes, with only minor exceptions, do not feature an explicit employer contribution.\u00a0 They do\u00a0however have a significant implicit employer contribution, insofar as the cost of taxpayer-financed\u00a0benefit outgo, generally based on final salary, significantly exceeds member contributions.  This implicit\u00a0employer contribution is widely recognised as a valuable\u00a0benefit in public service employment, including in\u00a0the second report\u00a0of the Public Service Benchmarking Body published in\u00a02007, which is available at .<\/p><p>The minimum age at which normal-course pensions are paid in the Irish public service varies by reference to period of recruitment, as follows:<\/p><p>-  60 years for persons recruited up to 31 March 2004.<\/p><p>-  65 years for persons recruited between 1 April 2004 and 31 December 2012.<\/p><p>-  66 years, rising to 67 years in 2021 and 68 years in 2028, for persons recruited from 1 January 2013 onward: these persons are members of the Single Public Service Pension Scheme, which applies to new recruits across the public service since the beginning of 2013.  The Single Scheme pension benefits are based on career-average pay, not retirement-time pay (final salary).<\/p><p>Retirement lump sum in almost all public service pension schemes, except the Single Scheme, is set at a maximum of one and a half times final pay. <\/p><p>In general, 40 years' service is required to qualify for\u00a0maximum public service pension benefits. <\/p><p>Single Scheme members may accrue both pension and retirement lump sum over a longer period than 40 years. For most\u00a0Single Scheme members, there are\u00a0no\u00a0legislated\u00a0rules capping the level of pension and\u00a0retirement lump sum that can be accrued; in practice however\u00a0the Single Scheme's\u00a0career-average design is\u00a0a\u00a0restraint on benefits build-up under those headings.<\/p><p>Responsibility for all aspects of taxation relating to pensions rests with my colleague the Minister for Finance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011900066#WRL02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Issues","counter":494,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011900067#WRM00150"},{"type":"question","counter":495,"qnumday":179,"qnumall":"[2523\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011900067#WRM00200","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the bilateral meetings he had with his European counterparts outside of EU Council meetings since the UK referendum to leave the EU took place in which the issue of Brexit and the unique challenges faced by the island of Ireland were discussed, including the name of each European government ministerial counterpart, the meeting location and the date of each meeting, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":496,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach and Ministers continue to meet and engage with our EU counterparts to emphasise Ireland's concerns and to ensure that they are fully understood once negotiations commence.

Waiting list data, compiled and published by the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) last week, provide evidence that the cardiology inpatient\/daycase procedure waiting list at the hospital has reduced by almost 20% since the end of November, and the number of persons waiting longer than a year has reduced by some 67%.  By year end, a total of 489 patients remained on the list, with no patient waiting longer than 18 months.<\/p>  <p>  The focus on the UHW cardiology waiting list will continue in 2017.  The SSWHG has a robust plan in place to address the remaining backlog which involves access to cath lab capacity across the region.  In addition, as recommended in the Herity Report, an additional &euro;.5m funding has been provided to UHW, in 2017, which will enable the hospital to provide 2 additional cath lab sessions (8 hours) per week.  I am advised that patients waiting over 12 months will have their procedures completed in the first 8 weeks of 2017; patients waiting 3 &ndash; 12 months will have their procedures completed by June 2017.  It is not expected that those procedures will be delayed by other measures currently under consideration.<\/p>  <p>  Budget 2017 makes specific provision for those patients waiting longest for treatment within the health service.  In this context, I am considering a national cardiology waiting list initiative which will address waiting times for cardiology treatments in a number of hospitals, including UHW.  A range of measures are envisaged including sharing of facilities and resources amongst public hospitals, use of private facilities and the deployment of a mobile cath lab.  Further details of the proposed initiative will be made available in the coming weeks.  <\/p>  <p>  I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly regarding the number of mobile cath labs currently in use.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011900067#WRM02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Services for People with Disabilities","counter":526,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011900067#WRM02450"},{"type":"question","counter":527,"qnumday":192,"qnumall":"[2227\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011900067#WRM02500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of partial residency spaces for persons with a disability available in County Waterford; the number of persons on the waiting list for a partial residency space in County Waterford; the average waiting time for a partial residency space in County Waterford; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1258","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":528,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives, provide greater independence in accessing the services they choose and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.

This dossier included details on all relevant costs and relevant cost offsets including those associated with hospitalisation, disease management costs, intravenous antibiotics, adverse events and any additional costs arising in patients not taking Orkambi.<\/p>  <p>  The NCPE has completed its Health Technology Assessment and this is available on its website.  It was submitted to the HSE in June 2016.  The NCPE determined, following an evaluation of the economic dossier, that the manufacturer failed to demonstrate cost-effectiveness or value for money from using the drug.  The NCPE have confirmed that all relevant costs were included in the analysis.  In line with the HSE's assessment process, the HSE Drugs Committee considered the NCPE recommendation, the manufacturers submissions and commercial offer and other information.  Following this consideration the Drugs Committee did not recommend reimbursement at the current price.  The HSE Directorate considered the Drugs Committee&rsquo;s recommendation in December and the Directorate took the decision not to reimburse at current price offered by the company. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE has since re-entered into negotiations with Vertex, the manufacturer of Orkambi, with a view to significantly reducing the cost of Orkambi.  This process is on-going.  A meeting was held in December and again in early January.

This followed the confirmation of H5N8 in a wild bird in Wales, and is the first time such action has been taken by this Department.

Payments under this intervention have already commenced for the first tranche of farmers who entered the scheme in 2016.\u00a0\u00a0Payment to those entering in 2017\u00a0commence towards the end of this year, as is normal with schemes of this nature. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011900071#WRQ00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Scheme","counter":668,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011900071#WRQ00850"},{"type":"question","counter":669,"qnumday":243,"qnumall":"[2350\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011900071#WRQ00900","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will include eligibility under TAMS for the erection of underpasses to improve safety for farmers due to the increase in herd sizes and increase in traffic; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1350","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":670,"content":"<p>The construction of underpasses is not currently available under the Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Scheme suite of measures.

following the recent Bord Bia report which showed that food exports to the UK were down over &euro;500 million in 2016 due to devaluation of sterling following the Brexit referendum; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1244","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":734,"content":"<p>Bord Bia's recent report estimated that the value of Irish agri-food and drink exports exceeded &euro;11 billion for the first time in 2016 despite challenging international conditions.  This is the seventh consecutive year of growth. Bord Bia estimated the potential impact on the value of agri-food exports to the UK last year arising from Brexit at around &euro;570m, based on the value of sterling falling by 13% relative to the euro in 2016.  In fact, exports to the UK  fell  by &euro;360 million (-8%) to &euro;4.1 billion.  By contrast, exports to other EU markets grew by 3%; while exports to international markets grew by 13%, driven by strong growth in the Chinese and US markets in particular.  Overall the value of exports grew by 2% to &euro;11.15 billion.<\/p>  <p>  While Brexit is a significant new factor, Ireland, as a small open economy which exports the vast bulk of its food production, has always been exposed to international market volatility.  We have seen significant commodity price volatility on world markets over the last few years.  However, my Department has ensured that measures are in place to help alleviate the pressures of income volatility:<\/p>  <p>  - Direct payments, estimated by Teagasc at an average of over &euro;17,000 per farm, provide a valuable source of farm income support and act as a hedge against price volatility.<\/p>  <p>  - The adjustment in Budget 2017 to the income averaging scheme for tax purposes will allow farmers to avail of an opt-out in an exceptional year.<\/p>  <p>  - The 'Agriculture Cashflow Support Loan Scheme', developed by my Department in cooperation with the Strategic Bank Corporation of Ireland (SBCI), will make &euro;150 million available to farmers throughout Ireland at low-cost interest rates of 2.95%.  This is supported by &euro;25 million being provided by my Department, including &euro;11 million in EU aid.  The SBCI is aiming to make these loans available by the end of January and I hope to make an announcement in relation to this shortly.<\/p>  <p>  In addition I have made provision for additional funding to Bord Bia both for 2016 and 2017 to address the situation. Indeed the agencies have been active in their response.<\/p>  <p>  - Bord Bia has activated a 4-pillar support strategy for Irish food companies to maintain growth in this period of volatility and over the longer term.  These activities are captured under the headings of Managing Volatility, Obtaining Consumer and Market Insight, Deepening Customer Engagement and Extending Market Reach.<\/p>  <p>  - Enterprise Ireland's initial, industry-wide, 5-point plan included provision of information (on improving competitiveness, reducing supply chain costs through the provision of LEAN and R&amp;D\/Innovation supports to clients, and accessing funding), market development support and UK market support.<\/p>  <p>  - Both agencies have also been working with individual companies in order to tailor the response in accordance with the particular difficulties being faced, and have been working together on strategic marketing initiatives.<\/p>  <p>  As a consequence of the Brexit referendum I established within my Department a task force who have engaged and will continue to engage, with stakeholders both within Government Departments and the agri food sector to support and protect our valuable food and drink export industry.  <\/p>  <p>  In light of the UK vote to leave the EU, Brexit has been included as a standard item on the agenda of each meeting of the High Level Implementation Committee for Food Wise, which I chair.  It is clear that driving the implementation of the Food Wise recommendations, particularly those related to market development, competitiveness and innovation, will assume even greater importance in the light of the UK decision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011900072#WRR03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Agencies Staff Recruitment","counter":735,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011900072#WRR03500"},{"type":"question","counter":736,"qnumday":265,"qnumall":"[2446\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011900072#WRR03600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the total number of additional staff to be taken on in all individual State agencies and bodies under his aegis in 2017, including Bord Bia, Bord Iascaigh Mhara, the National Milk Agency, Teagasc and the Marine Institute; the total cost of hiring additional staff in each individual State agency or body; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1244","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":737,"content":"<p>The staffing arrangements for State Agencies are, subject to an overall policy framework, an operational matter for those agencies.<\/p>  <p>  In the case of Bord Bia, the National Milk Agency, Teagasc, The Sea Fisheries Protection Authority and the Marine Institute, sanction to recruit permanent staff up to Principal Officer level has, subject to an upper limit on expenditure on pay, been delegated to the agencies themselves, to afford them a measure of flexibility in filling critical vacancies.<\/p>  <p>  Any proposals to exceed the sanctioned pay limits, would require the specific sanction of my Department.

The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of\u00a0the NBP\u00a0as a matter of priority.\u00a0 This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment by the telecommunications sector and a State intervention in those areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.  A key principle of the NBP is to support and stimulate commercial investment through policy and regulatory measures. Commercial investment since the publication of the NBP has considerably exceeded expectations.  To date, the commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2.5bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.<\/p><p>Currently, approximately 1.4m premises in Ireland can\u00a0get high speed broadband from commercial service providers and investment by the telecoms sector is continuing to expand this footprint.<\/p><p>The High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at <i><\/i>shows the current extent of the State Intervention area:<\/p><p>- The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or have previously indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services,<\/p><p>- The areas marked AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the target areas for the State Intervention, which are the subject of the current procurement process.  It is intended that premises within this area will\u00a0have access to services of at least 30 megabits per second when the procurement process is completed and the network\u00a0rolled out.\u00a0 <\/p><p>The map currently indicates that 100% of the townlands of Kilmainham Headfort and Kilmainham (Ed Kells rural) falls within an AMBER area and\u00a0will therefore will be included in the State Intervention procurement process under the NBP.\u00a0 Individuals can check whether their premise is in a BLUE or an AMBER area by\u00a0accessing the High Speed Broadband Map and entering their Eircode.<\/p><p>A formal procurement process is now in train to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area.  The Department will also shortly update the High Speed Broadband map and finalise this Intervention Area for bidders, taking into account any industry investments that have not materialised and potential other new investments. <\/p><p>Intensive dialogue with bidders is continuing and the three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution.  This provides a future proofed solution for the\u00a025 years of the contract and beyond.\u00a0 A fibre-to-the-home\u00a0solution\u00a0means that householders and businesses may\u00a0get speeds not just of 30 Megabits per second but much higher, potentially up to 1000 Megabits per second.  The procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years.<\/p><p>As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and\/or high demand.  This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network rollout plan.  A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. A detailed rollout plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place. <\/p><p>The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the rollout of the network once a contract is awarded.  In this regard, Minister Humphreys is leading on the establishment of two regional action groups, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices and other relevant agencies to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded.<\/p><p>In a further positive initiative, last July, I established a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce with my colleague\u00a0Minister Humphreys\u00a0to address immediate issues in relation to the quality of mobile phone and broadband coverage.

The Report makes 33\u00a0recommendations with 71 associated actions and \u00a0contains a detailed Action Plan identifying the responsible bodies and the timelines for delivery of the recommendations.<\/p>  <p>  The Report states that while neither the Minister for Finance nor the Central Bank of Ireland can direct insurance companies as to how they price their products, the Working Group believes that the implementation of the Report's recommendations will lead to greater stability in the pricing of motor insurance and will help prevent the volatility that we have seen in the market in the past (both up and down) and should also better facilitate potential new entrants to the market.<\/p>  <p>  My Department,\u00a0together with the appropriate\u00a0bodies,\u00a0will\u00a0work towards implementing the relevant Recommendations\u00a0in the Report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011900073#WRS03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Bus &Eacute;ireann","counter":781,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011900073#WRS03500"},{"type":"question","counter":782,"qnumday":280,"qnumall":"[2338\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011900073#WRS03600","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if he has arranged a meeting with Bus &Eacute;ireann in view of the leaked Grant Thornton report, which reported cuts to Bus &Eacute;ireann express routes that will have a detrimental effect on counties Cavan and Monaghan; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":783,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, Bus &Eacute;ireann is developing plans to address its financial position.

The Regulation requires that the aid is &lsquo;transparent&rsquo;.<\/p>  <p>  Specific arrangements on de minimis aid apply in the following sectors:<\/p>  <p>  road freight transport sector - the de minimis ceiling is &euro;100,000 to any industrial road freight transport operator over any consecutive three year fiscal period<\/p>  <p>  primary production of agricultural products - the de minimis ceiling is &euro;15,000 to any agricultural producer over any consecutive three year fiscal period and an overall cap for Ireland in any 3 year period of &euro;66,280,000.<\/p>  <p>  production, processing and marketing of fishery and aquaculture products - the de minimis ceiling is &euro;30,000 for any producer, processor or marketer of fishery or agriculture products  and an overall cap for Ireland of &euro;20,820,000.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the revision of the General Block Exemption Regulation (GBER) under the State Aid Modernisation Agenda, Member States and the Commission discussed a proposal to increase the de minimis threshold in 2013.  A number of Member States suggested increasing the de minimis threshold to &euro;500,000 over a three year fiscal period.  The European Commission rejected the proposal on the basis that the amount was substantial and could distort the competition in the Internal Market.  A more modest increase to &euro;300,000 was also declined.  The current State Aid framework does not allow for the re-calibration of aid intensity rates under the GBER or de minimis thresholds.<\/p>  <p>  Against the backdrop of the UK vote to leave the EU, my Department has initiated engagement with senior officials from the DG Competition to ensure Ireland can deliver the necessary supports to Irish enterprises within the EU State Aid rules.

Generally, public bodies are allowed to grant aid to a single undertaking of\u00a0up to\u00a0&euro;200,000 over a 3 year fiscal period without prior notification or approval from DG Competition.  The Regulation requires that the aid is &lsquo;transparent&rsquo;. <\/p>  <p>  Specific arrangements on de minimis aid apply in the following sectors:<\/p>  <p>  -  road freight transport sector - the de minimis ceiling is &euro;100,000 to any industrial road freight transport operator over any consecutive three year fiscal period<\/p>  <p>  -  primary production of agricultural products - the de minimis ceiling is &euro;15,000 to any agricultural producer over any consecutive three year fiscal period and an overall cap for Ireland in any 3 year period of &euro;66,280,000.<\/p>  <p>  -  production, processing and marketing of fishery and aquaculture products - the de minimis ceiling is &euro;30,000 for any producer, processor or marketer of fishery or agriculture products and an overall cap for Ireland of &euro;20,820,000.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the revision of the General Block Exemption Regulation (GBER) under the State Aid Modernisation Agenda, Member States and the Commission discussed a proposal to increase the de minimis threshold in 2013.  A number of Member States suggested increasing the de minimis threshold to &euro;500,000 over a three year fiscal period.  The European Commission rejected the proposal on the basis that the amount was substantial and could distort the competition in the Internal Market.  A more modest increase to &euro;300,000 was also declined.  The current State Aid framework does not allow for the re-calibration of aid intensity rates under the GBER or de minimis thresholds.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Against the backdrop of the UK vote to leave the EU, my Department has initiated engagement with senior officials from the DG Competition to ensure Ireland can deliver the necessary supports to Irish enterprises within the EU State Aid rules.
