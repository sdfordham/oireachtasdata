The 1926 Census is the next full set of Census records, after the 1911 returns, which is available to the State. However, current legislative provisions, as contained in the Statistics Act 1993, require that census data must be withheld for 100 years. Accordingly, it is not possible at this time to release the 1926 Census returns before the statutory period has elapsed in 2026. If the records were to be released before the expiry of 100 years, a<font color=\"#004080\"> <\/font>major<font color=\"#004080\"> <\/font>change in legislation and policy would be required to allow for the early release.  This is not currently being proposed. <br\/><br\/>A 1926 Census Working Group has been formed, comprising officials from my own Department, the National Archives and the Central Statistics Office. The Group has examined this complex project and has assessed the significant resources - in terms of additional financial, staff and infrastructural resources - that will need to be in place to move the project forward to completion. I can say that, following discussions within the Working Group, I am of the opinion that the extensive preparatory work required to prepare the 1926 Census database for processing, and eventual digitisation to facilitate the release of the data into the public domain, should continue. It must be recognised, however, that, in light of the level of additional resources that will be necessary, and of the current engagement by the National Archives on a number of other important projects, including some that form a key part of the programme for the Decade of Commemorations, it will be necessary to work over time towards building the necessary capacity to undertake and oversee the 1926 Census project.<br\/><br\/>The cost to digitise the 1926 Census could be as high as &euro;10m, as the Census has never been micro-filmed and the individual return sheets would need to be scanned and cross-indexed. <br\/><br\/>The Government agreed, as part of its capital stimulus package, to provide funding this year for phase one of a development plan at the Archives headquarters in Bishop Street.

The Habitats Directive has been transposed into national law under the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011.<\/p>  <p>  Landowners may object to the proposed designation of a site as an SAC. Following the completion of a Departmental review of an objection to the proposed designation, landowners may opt to take their cases to the Designated Areas Appeals Advisory Board, an independently chaired Board which makes recommendations to me, as Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, on such cases. The appeals process includes an oral hearing. The Board heard 17 appeals over the 2013-2014 period. In each case the recommendation of the Board was accepted.<\/p>  <p>  It is recognised that the nomination of a site for designation as an SAC may have an impact on the manner in which certain lands may be farmed. The designation of lands does not mean that the lands are subject to blanket restrictions. However, they must be managed appropriately. <\/p>  <p>  In accordance with the relevant legislation, certain activities in protected sites may only be undertaken with my consent, as Minister. Compensation may be payable where a person has been refused consent by me for a prescribed activity within a designated site that he or she had been undertaking in the five year period prior to the refusal. However, compensation schemes have generally been put in place, where required, without the need to undergo a formal process under the relevant legislation.<\/p>  <p>  While my Department has the lead role in relation to the implementation of the Habitats Directive, significant funding is provided through the rural development programme, operated by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.

The report, which can be accessed on the welfare.ie website, was undertaken by my Department working with the Central Bank and the then Pensions Board.  It gathered information on the level of pension charges levied during the pension-saving cycle from initial set-up, to on-going maintenance and to the point of retirement.  The focus of the report is on pension types utilised by the majority of pension savers in the Irish marketplace.  This amounts to almost 750,000 people who have pensions across a wide range of pension vehicles, both employer-sponsored and individual arrangements.<\/p>  <p>  The report shows that there are a wide range of different charges and their application can vary greatly, both in scale and complexity across the various pension arrangements.  Charging structures are influenced by many scheme specific factors including scheme structure, type, age and size.<\/p>  <p>  The report noted that unlike other pension structures, the cost structure in relation to Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs) is regulated and considered whether similar regulation should apply for other pension vehicles.  Having examined the issue in depth, the report concluded that the focus of recommendations should be on measures that would introduce clarity and consistency across the various products, and increase consumer\/trustee understanding to provide a better result for the consumer.  I have previously highlighted that the matter of pension charges will be kept under review with a view to considering more stringent options if necessary.  In this regard I can confirm that I have asked that the matter of pension charges be a priority item for consideration by the Pensions Council.

There are approximately 70,700 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;298 million for in 2015. Rent supplement recipient numbers by county and information on expenditure since 2008 is provided in the attached tabular statements. Rent Supplement expenditure by local authority is not available.<br\/><br\/>I am acutely aware of the difficulties people are experiencing in maintaining affordable rented accommodation in areas of high demand in the current market including areas of Cork and Clare. The Department has put measures in place to ensure that the housing needs of rent supplement customers throughout the country who are at risk of homelessness are addressed by providing for increased flexibility within the administration of the rent supplement scheme. Notices were circulated to all Community Welfare Service staff reminding them of their discretionary power to award, on a case by case basis, a supplement for rental purposes in such circumstances in July and December 2014. A National Framework has also been developed to ensure that appropriate supports continue to be provided throughout the country in a consistent manner.<br\/><br\/>The Department continues to monitor the measures in place to ensure that the appropriate supports are in place for rent supplement recipients including the Interim Tenancy Sustainment Protocol operating in Dublin, which was extended to Cork city in recent weeks. The Department&rsquo;s response will continue to be kept under review during 2015.<br\/><br\/>Where a person in receipt of rent supplement is at risk of losing their tenancy they should make contact with the Tenancy Protection Service provided by Threshold in Dublin or in Cork city or their local Community Welfare Service as soon as possible.<br\/><br\/>Concerns have been raised by advocacy groups regarding the reduced rates of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance for younger persons and homelessness. The reduced rates encourage young jobseekers to improve their skills and remain active in the labour market in order to avoid the risk of becoming long-term unemployed and will help them to progress into sustainable employment.  Where a person is in receipt of a reduced rate of jobseeker's allowance and he or she participates in a course of education or training a higher rate of &euro;160 applies.<br\/><br\/>In addition to the measures in place under rent supplement, enhanced processes to provide earlier and more intensive engagement, additional places on a number of programmes and youth-oriented variants of existing schemes are being rolled out. This will help to ensure that all of those young unemployed people who need most support, those who are assessed as having a low to medium probability of securing employment in the absence of any support, will receive a Youth Guarantee offer within four months of an initial one-to-one interview.<br\/><br\/>The Department is also actively engaging with Tusla and non-government organisations in providing the necessary support to vulnerable young people leaving care who are experiencing homelessness or in insecure situations. These cases are managed on a case by case basis and the payment of deposits and rent in advance is considered. This form of assistance is very important to those on low incomes who are at risk of, or who are homeless, or who rely on the private rented market to meet their housing needs. In 2014, the Department made a total of some 3,000 payments of rent deposits\/rent in advance at a cost of &euro;1.48 million throughout the country, of which some 850 payments at a cost of over &euro;360,000 were made to persons aged under 25 years.<br\/><br\/><b>Table 1: Rent Supplement End of Year Recipient Numbers &amp;amp; Expenditure: 2008 to

welfare and tax measures for 2015, that the most significant improvements between budget 2014 and budget 2015 were for the poorest and richest households, in view of the contradictory evidence published in its report.","asker":"1178","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":99,"content":"<p>The Department recently published the social impact assessment of the main welfare and tax measures for 2015, including the new water charges package.  Social impact assessment is an evidence-based methodology which estimates the likely effects of welfare and tax policies on households across income levels and social groups.<\/p>  <p>  The assessment was prepared by the Department, which is responsible for the welfare component of the Budget. It is based on the tax\/welfare micro simulation model SWITCH developed by the Economic and Social Research Institute. Responsibility for the analysis rests solely with the Department.<\/p>  <p>  One aspect of the assessment examines the distributive impact of the composite budgetary package for 2015 compared with the 2014 measures.  Overall, there is a marked difference in the overall distributive impact: an average gain of 0.7 per cent in 2015 compared to an average loss of 0.8 per cent in 2014.<\/p>  <p>  The contrast in distributive impact between 2015 and 2014 is greatest at the top and bottom of the income distribution, on the basis that these two quintiles experienced the greatest losses in 2014, which were then transformed into gains in 2015. Thus, a loss of 1.1 per cent for the bottom quintile in 2014 is replaced by a gain of 0.3 per cent in 2015 (a difference of 1.4 percentage points). Similarly, the top quintile goes from a loss of 1.1 per cent in 2014 to a gain of 1 percent in 2015 (a difference of 2.1 percentage points). For middle income groups, the scale of the transformation is not as dramatic, given the smaller losses experienced in 2014. The report acknowledges that over the two years combined, many households will still show an overall loss in income.<\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that certain items are not included in the assessment, for instance, additional expenditure on labour market initiatives (such as the back to work family dividend and the expansion of JobsPlus).  In addition, the assessment also does not include non-welfare expenditure measures for 2015, such as healthcare, education, social housing, and the new housing assistance payments, which will remove the barrier to full-time work for long-term recipients of rent supplement. Work is ongoing to quantify these impacts as part of the ESRI SWITCH research programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021000055#WRC01600","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Allowance Appeals","counter":100,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021000055#WRC01650"},{"type":"question","counter":101,"qnumday":171,"qnumall":"[5548\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021000055#WRC01700","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will expedite an application for a disability allowance in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Meath; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1054","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":102,"content":"<p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that the appeal from the person concerned was referred to an Appeals Officer who has decided to convene an oral hearing in this case.<br\/><br\/>Every effort will be made to hear the case as quickly as possible and the appellant will be informed when arrangements for the oral hearing have been made.<br\/><br\/>The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions in relation to social welfare entitlements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021000055#WRC01800","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"One-Parent Family Payment Applications","counter":103,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021000055#WRC01850"},{"type":"question","counter":104,"qnumday":172,"qnumall":"[5558\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021000055#WRC01900","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will arrange for an inspector to call on a person (details supplied) in county Meath; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":105,"content":"<p>As stated to the Deputy in my replies to Question No 182 on 27 January 2015  and Question No 76 on 5 February 2015, the person concerned submitted an application for One Parent Family Payment on 30 October 2014.

In light of such concerns, I asked for  a report to be prepared on the use of JobBridge by the Education Sector with a view to establishing a set of guidelines to prevent inappropriate use  of the scheme, and in particular to prevent displacement by interns of positions which should be filled by paid staff.  This report has been finalised by the review group, and is currently under consideration.<\/p>  <p>  There is no application procedure for jobseekers for the First Steps programme.  Jobseekers will be selected, brought into the activation process and referred to the programme by their case worker based upon circumstances, activation needs and meeting the eligibility criteria.<\/p>  <p>  Participation of jobseekers on the First Steps programme, once referred, will be non-discretionary and subject to conditionality and penalty rate legislation should they fail without good cause to attend in accordance with the activation process.<\/p>  <p>  Further to Parliamentary Question No. 184 of 3 February 2015, statistics matching commencement dates with advertisement dates is not routinely prepared by the Department and so is not available at present, however, on this occasion, I have asked officials to collate the data requested and send it on to the Deputy.

Such property includes all monies held in financial institutions or otherwise, the market value of shares and houses and premises owned by a claimant which may or may not be put to commercial use. However, it does not include property such as the family home or, for example, a premises used by the claimant in carrying out a business.<br\/><br\/>For assessment purposes, the current market value of the property is established as well as the amount of any outstanding mortgages on that property. The balance (market value less outstanding mortgage) is assessed by reference to the following formula in the case of most schemes (including jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and one parent family payment), as follows:<br\/><br\/><b>Capital &ndash; Assessment Formula<\/b><table><tr><th>AMOUNT OF CAPITAL<\/th><th>WEEKLY MEANS ASSESSED<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Up to &euro;20,000<\/td><td>Nil<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;20,000 - &euro;30,000<\/td><td>&euro;1 per each &euro;1,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;30,000 - &euro;40,000<\/td><td>&euro;2 per each &euro;1,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Over &euro;40,000<\/td><td>&euro;4 per each &euro;1,000<\/td><\/tr><\/table><br\/><br\/>For the purposes of the State pension non-contributory and carer&rsquo;s allowance the amounts above are doubled in the case of a couple.

Similarly, the formula does not reflect rental or other income derived from the ownership of property. <br\/><br\/>The assessment formula reflects the fact that there is an expectation that persons with reasonable amounts of capital and property are in a position to use that capital or to realise the value of property to support themselves without having to rely solely on a means tested welfare payment.  <br\/><br\/>Any changes to the current arrangements would have to be considered in a Budgetary context.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021000056#WRD01900","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":156,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 191 and 192 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Insurance","counter":157,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021000056#WRD02050"},{"type":"question","counter":158,"qnumday":193,"qnumall":"[5945\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021000056#WRD02100","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"her views on further supports for\u00a0self-employed persons who have lost their business and become unemployed; if an opt-in higher rate of pay related social insurance for self-employed persons will be considered so as to allow greater social welfare protection in the event the business fails; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1023","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":159,"content":"<p>Self-employed persons are liable for PRSI at the class S rate of 4% which entitles them to access long-term benefits such as State pension (contributory) and widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner's pension (contributory) as well as guardians payment (contributory), maternity benefit and adoptive benefit.<\/p>  <p>  Self-employed workers who have lost their business and become unemployed may access social welfare supports by establishing eligibility to assistance-based payments such as jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.  In the case of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance they can apply for the means-tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.  As in the case of a non-self-employed claimant for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, the means of husband\/wife, civil partner or co-habitant will be taken into account in deciding on entitlement to a payment.<\/p>  <p>  Self-employed people in receipt of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance have access to the full range of activation measures available through the State.  Given the scale of unemployment levels, the key objective of activation policy and labour market initiatives is to offer assistance to those most in need of support in securing work and achieving financial self-sufficiency.  This policy objective prioritises scarce resources to those in receipt of qualifying welfare payments.  Accordingly the employment services and schemes provided by the Department are focused in the first instance on this cohort of unemployed people.  However, many services are available to the formerly self-employed who are not in receipt of a social welfare payment.<\/p>  <p>  Some employment services, such as assistance with job-search activities and the use of online job search tools, are available to people if they register with the Department&rsquo;s employment services offices, regardless of their social welfare status.  Unemployed persons, including the previously self-employed, not in receipt of payments may also be eligible to avail of up-skilling opportunities but are not eligible to receive a training allowance while undertaking the course.  Springboard courses are open to people who were previously self-employed, regardless of their social welfare status.<\/p>  <p>  In September 2013, I published the report of the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare on Extending Social Insurance Coverage for the self-employed.  The Group was asked to examine and report on issues involved in extending social insurance coverage for self-employed people in order to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable, with the requirement that any proposals for change must be cost neutral.<\/p>  <p>  The Group found that the current system of means tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance payments adequately provides cover to self-employed people for the risks associated with unemployment.  In this context, the Group noted that almost 9 out of every 10 self-employed people who claimed the means tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance during the three-year period from 2009 to 2011 received payment.  Consequently, the Group was not convinced that there was a need for the extension of social insurance for the self-employed to provide cover for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit. <\/p>  <p>  On the basis of the findings of the report of the Advisory Group I am satisfied that the self-employed have access to income support in the event of business failure and I do not propose to make any changes to the PRSI system at this time.  I will keep the situation under review.<\/p>  <p>  In general the current system of social insurance operates on a mandatory basis and therefore contributors pay PRSI contributions at the rate appropriate to their PRSI class.  Allowing people a facility to opt in or opt out at their own discretion could lead to the selection of bad risks.  The whole principle of social insurance is social solidarity where everybody pays in and, if needed, cover is available. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021000056#WRD02200","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pensions Council","counter":160,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021000056#WRD02250"},{"type":"question","counter":161,"qnumday":194,"qnumall":"[5971\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021000056#WRD02300","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if the newly established Pensions Council will be monitoring the implementation of the recommendations in the report on pension charges 2012; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1026","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":162,"content":"<p>I recently established the Pensions Council to help strengthen the pensions environment and give consumers greater input into pension policy.  The function of the Pensions Council is to advise the Minister for Social Protection on matters of relevance to pensions, with a particular focus on policies to support the sustainability and adequacy of pension provision.  It will ensure that the system has a far stronger consumer focus.

The PAYE allowance, as it was then, was introduced in 1980 to improve the tax progression of PAYE taxpayers and to take account of the fact that the self-employed generally then had the advantage of paying tax on a preceding year basis. The argument was also made at the time that the general scheme of allowances for expenses discriminated against employees and in favour of other taxpayers. <\/p>  <p>  There have been some changes since 1980. For example, the self-employed now pay tax on a current year basis. In addition, the PAYE allowance has become a tax credit. However, there are other aspects to how the self-assessed are taxed which can be beneficial to them. For instance, there are significant timing benefits, depending on the accounting period used by the taxpayer, which are available to the self-assessed but which are not available to PAYE workers. In addition, the expenses regime for self-assessed taxpayers remains somewhat more liberal than that afforded to employees and therefore the self-employed can actually pay less tax when compared to a PAYE worker on the same income.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that\u00a0the changes to the Income Tax system introduced in Budget 2015 will benefit all those who pay income tax and or USC equally, regardless of whether they are PAYE or self-assessed taxpayers.<\/p>  <p>  As regards PRSI, I assume the Deputy is referring to the 10.75% rate of employers PRSI, which is payable once an employee's income exceeds &euro;356 per week. I would point out that a lower rate of employer PRSI of 8.5% applies where weekly income is &euro;356 or lower. These rates\u00a0of employer social insurance contributions are very low when compared internationally.<\/p>  <p>  As regards the encouragement of employment by the self-employed and start-up businesses, I would draw the Deputy's attention to the JobsPlus scheme operated by the Department of Social Protection.

(The factors range from 37, in respect of pension benefits accrued after 1 January 2014 and drawn down at age 50 or under, to 22 in respect of benefits drawn down at age 70 or over.)\u00a0<br \/><br \/>- Finally, the reimbursement options, introduced in Finance Act 2012, for public servants affected by chargeable excess tax are being amended and extended.\u00a0 <\/blockquote>As occurred on the occasion of the introduction of the SFT regime in 2005, and again when the value of the SFT limit was reduced to &euro;2.3m in 2010, the legislation contained in Finance (No 2) Act 2013 provides for an individual who has pension rights on 1 January 2014 in excess of the new lower SFT limit of &euro;2m, to claim a Personal Fund Threshold (PFT) from Revenue in order to protect or  grandfather  the value of those rights on that date. This is subject to a maximum PFT of &euro;2.3m, and individuals with PFTs from 2005 or 2010 retain those PFTs.  <br\/><br\/>The primary purpose of the changes made to the SFT regime is to further restrict the capacity of higher earners to fund or accrue large pensions through tax-subsidised sources in line with the commitment made in the Government programme for National Recovery 2011-2016. In addition, the introduction of higher age-related factors to value DB pension entitlements significantly improves the equity of the SFT regime as between DB and defined contribution (DC) pension arrangements and between those who retire at younger ages and those who retire later in life. <br\/><br\/>The SFT regime addresses the problem of pension overfunding and excessive pension accrual by dealing with it at the point of pension drawdown in retirement rather than by applying restrictions to pension savings or accrual upfront. The regime achieves this by imposing a significant tax charge on the value of retirement benefits above set limits (the SFT or PFT, as appropriate) when they are drawn down. In this way it acts to discourage the building up of large pension funds in the first place or unwinds the tax advantage of such overfunding by clawing back, through the tax charge, the tax relief granted. <br\/><br\/>In Finance Act 2014, I introduced further amendments to the SFT regime to deal with issues arising in cases involving Pension Adjustment Orders (PAOs) the purpose of which is to provide for a more equitable sharing of the chargeable excess tax between the parties to PAOs in affected cases where the SFT or PFT, as appropriate, is exceeded.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021000057#WRE02500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Debt Conference","counter":216,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021000057#WRE02550"},{"type":"question","counter":217,"qnumday":216,"qnumall":"[5635\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021000057#WRE02600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans to support a European debt conference; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1183","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":218,"qnumday":221,"qnumall":"[5753\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021000057#WRE02700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will request the European Union to chair a European debt conference in Dublin; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1183","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":219,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 216 and 221 together.<br\/><br\/>My view is that when countries encounter difficulties, a process of negotiation is always better than one of conflict.<br\/><br\/>Specifically in the case of euro area Member States, all programme negotiations have been conducted within the\u00a0Eurogroup\u00a0and\u00a0Ecofin, with IMF involvement as appropriate.\u00a0 My view is that these are the appropriate fora for resolving outstanding issues such as this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021000057#WRE02800","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"VAT Rate Application","counter":220,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021000057#WRE02850"},{"type":"question","counter":221,"qnumday":217,"qnumall":"[5709\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021000057#WRE02900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the amount of revenue is collected from VAT on public service obligation levies in energy bills; and if it is possible to remove this VAT.","asker":"1083","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":222,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the information furnished on VAT returns does not require the yield from particular activities or sectors of trade to be identified.

The tax is charged on the amount gifted to, or inherited by, the beneficiary of the gift or inheritance. <br\/><br\/>For the purposes of CAT, the relationship between the person who provides the gift or inheritance (i.e. the disponer) and the person who receives the gift or inheritance (i.e. the beneficiary), determines the maximum life-time tax-free threshold known as the &quot;Group threshold&quot; below which gift or inheritance tax does not arise.<br\/><br\/>There are, in all, three separate Group thresholds based on the relationship of the beneficiary to the disponer:<br\/><br\/>The Group A tax-free threshold of &euro;225,000<b><\/b>applies where the beneficiary is a child (including adopted child, stepchild and certain foster children) or minor child of a deceased child of the disponer. Parents also fall within this threshold where they take an inheritance of an absolute interest from a child.<br\/><br\/>The Group B tax-free threshold of &euro;30,150 applies where the beneficiary is a brother, sister, nephew, niece or lineal ancestor or lineal descendant of the disponer.<br\/><br\/>The Group C tax-free threshold &euro;15,075 applies in all other cases.<br\/><br\/>Where a person receives gifts or inheritances in excess of their relevant tax free threshold, CAT at a rate of 33% applies on the excess over the tax free threshold.  It should also be noted that the thresholds apply on an individual basis so that, for example, where there are two children the current Group A threshold of &euro;225,000 applies individually to each child in respect of gifts and inheritances from their parents.<br\/><br\/>The Group thresholds have been reduced over recent years, as asset prices have fallen, in order to maintain the yield from capital taxes as part of the effort to restore the public finances.  Taxes on capital are less harmful from an economic perspective than taxes on employment.<br\/><br\/>The property market continues to improve with positive developments which had been restricted to the Dublin area now manifesting in other areas of the country though not to the same extent in terms of price rises.  I recognize, of course, that there are supply issues in certain areas of the Dublin property market. <br\/><br\/>The Group tax-free thresholds are kept under review, in the same way as other relevant tax provisions, and in this regard I will bear the Deputy's comments and concerns in mind for the future.<br\/><br\/>In the details supplied with his first question, the Deputy refers to a constituent who is concerned about the CAT implications arising from being bequeathed the family home, in which I understand from the details that the constituent still resides.  I would point out to the Deputy that Section 86 of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act 2003 provides for a specific exemption from CAT in respect of a gift or inheritance of a dwelling house. <br\/><br\/>This exemption was introduced to cater for persons who had been living in the disponer's house for a substantial period prior to the gift or inheritance and who might otherwise be faced with having to sell the house (their home) to pay the CAT liability.  This would apply in particular to children who continued to reside with their parents into their old agevery often to care for them.  The following are the main conditions to be satisfied in order to benefit from the dwelling house CAT exemption:<br\/><br\/>- The recipient must have occupied the dwelling house continuously as his or her only or main residence for a period of three years prior to the date of the gift or inheritance<br\/><br\/>- The recipient must not , at the date of the gift or inheritance, be beneficially entitled to any other dwelling house or have an interest in any other dwelling house<br\/><br\/>- The recipient must continue to occupy the dwelling house for a period of six years commencing on the date of the gift or inheritance, except where the recipient was aged 55 years at that date or dies in this period.\u00a0<br\/><br\/>The Deputy's constituent may wish to contact her local Revenue Office if she needs to clarify any issue in relation to this exemption.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021000058#WRF01500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Credits","counter":247,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021000058#WRF01550"},{"type":"question","counter":248,"qnumday":226,"qnumall":"[5820\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021000058#WRF01600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"why a person (details supplied) in County Dublin was told that their full tax credits would be restored, but subsequent to that, their credits were actually reduced, as was initially indicated.","asker":"1192","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":249,"content":"<p>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that a certificate of tax credits issued to the person concerned on 28 January 2015, which incorrectly included a deduction from the tax credits entitlement. \u00a0This error was immediately rectified and a new certificate issued on 30 January 2015 restoring the person's full entitlement of tax credits. \u00a0The person concerned has been in direct contact with Revenue and the position has been explained to him.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021000058#WRF01700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":250,"content":"<p>Question No. 227 answered with Question No. 225.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Debt","counter":251,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021000058#WRF01850"},{"type":"question","counter":252,"qnumday":228,"qnumall":"[5896\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021000058#WRF01900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will provide, in tabular form, the amount of the national debt outstanding at the end of each year from 1970 to 2014; the amount of additional borrowing; the amount of debt repaid; the interest charged on the debt in respect of each year; the gross domestic product for each year; the percentage of debt to gross domestic product outstanding at the end of each of year; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

While the figures quoted by the Deputy are accurate,\u00a0it is important to understand that PAYE workers and the self-employed are taxed in different ways to reflect their differing circumstances. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, employees in the PAYE system benefit from a PAYE income tax credit worth &euro;1,650 per annum, to which the self-assessed are not entitled. The PAYE allowance, as it was then, was introduced in 1980 to improve the tax progression of PAYE taxpayers and to take account of the fact that the self-employed generally then had the advantage of paying tax on a preceding year basis. The argument was also made at the time that the general scheme of allowances for expenses discriminated against employees and in favour of other taxpayers. <\/p>  <p>  There have been some changes since 1980. For example, the self-employed now pay tax on a current year basis. In addition, the PAYE allowance has become a tax credit. However, there are other aspects to how the self-assessed are taxed which can be beneficial to them. For instance, there are significant timing benefits, depending on the accounting period used by the taxpayer, which are available to the self-assessed but which are not available to PAYE workers. In addition, the expenses regime for self-assessed taxpayers remains somewhat more liberal than that afforded to employees and therefore the self-employed can actually pay less tax when compared to a PAYE worker on the same income.<\/p>  <p>  It is true that employees are exempt from the charge to PRSI if their income does not exceed &euro;18,304. However, once PAYE income exceeds this threshold they are liable to pay PRSI on the full amount at 4%, thus equalising the\u00a0treatment of personal PRSI contributions, on all of the income,\u00a0for PAYE and self-assessed workers on incomes above that level. <\/p>  <p>  In the case of employees, their employers are required to pay a PRSI charge in respect of each employee. Thus the contribution made to the Social Insurance Fund in respect of employees is usually higher than that made by a self-assessed individual.\u00a0For instance, at\u00a0an income level of &euro;100,000, an employer would typically\u00a0be required to pay\u00a0PRSI of &euro;10,750 in respect of the employee, in addition to the &euro;4,000 payable by the employee.\u00a0Total PRSI of &euro;4,000 is payable in respect of\u00a0a self-employed individual with the same income.\u00a0Entitlement to social welfare benefits is primarily a matter for the Minister for Social Protection. However, it is worth pointing out that for individuals with incomes in excess of &euro;18,304 the total PRSI payable in respect of an employee is 14.75% of salary, while the total payable by a self-employed individual is 4%.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that\u00a0the changes to the Income Tax system introduced in Budget 2015 will benefit all those who pay income tax and or USC equally, regardless of whether they are PAYE or self-assessed taxpayers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021000058#WRF02400","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Insurance","counter":260,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021000058#WRF02450"},{"type":"question","counter":261,"qnumday":231,"qnumall":"[5952\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021000058#WRF02500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the action his Department is taking in view of the provisions of the Health Insurance (Amendment) Act 2014 which allows insurers discretion to provide a discount to young adults in the age 18 to 25 age range, but which has apparently resulted in a discrepancy; the level of tax relief at source which needs to be applied to those persons who receive the discount; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that if a person is a student, dependent on the policy holder, under 23 years of age and in receipt of a student discount, that person's tax relief is capped at the child rate of a maximum of &euro;100, but that student rates will disappear with the introduction of young persons' discounts, but tax legislation has not been amended to reflect this; if his attention has been further drawn to a technical issue (details supplied) relating to an apparent discrepancy in health insurance payment plans; the guidance his Department or the Revenue Commissioners have provided to insurers in this regard; if his attention has been drawn to the issue that is now causing concern as systems need to be changed to accommodate this change and with renewals-new business being able to be bought six weeks in advance, this means there is just over a month to resolve the problem; if his attention has been further drawn to the fact that it also leaves the insurers open to regulatory problems with the Central Bank of Ireland, as insurers may not be providing the correct net premium to customers and that notifications will need to be made to the Health Insurance Authority on what premiums are correct 30 days in advance of 1 May 2015 and it is again not clear what net premium is correct or whether the intention is that two 20 year olds are to be treated differently, based on whether they are students or not; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The Memorandum came into effect on 1 June, 2014 with an initial tranche of data provided by the OPW to Insurance Ireland in respect of 12 completed flood defence schemes (including the Tolka scheme in Dublin city) and showing the design, extent and nature of the protection offered by these works.  Since then, data on a further four completed flood relief schemes has been communicated to Insurance Ireland in the agreed format and data on further completed schemes will be provided in due course.  The arrangements set out in the Memorandum represent an ongoing process which, over time, should lead to an improvement in the availability of flood insurance cover.  The text of the Memorandum of Understanding and further information on the process is available on the OPW website at .<br\/><br\/>Since the signing of the Memorandum, contact has continued between OPW and Insurance Ireland.  The implementation of the Memorandum has been discussed at a number of meetings at both official and Ministerial level involving Insurance Ireland, the Office of Public Works and the Department of Finance.<br\/><br\/>Early indications are that flood risk insurance is widely available in areas where flood relief schemes have been completed by the OPW.  A definitive breakdown on the provision of flood risk insurance will not be available until after June of this year, when a full renewal cycle has been completed following the coming into effect of the Memorandum.<br\/><br\/>The OPW and the Department of Finance will continue contact, including meetings, with Insurance Ireland to review the operation of the Memorandum of Understanding.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021000059#WRG03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1106"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Pensions","counter":306,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021000059#WRG03300"},{"type":"question","counter":307,"qnumday":248,"qnumall":"[5748\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021000059#WRG03400","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he will report on the size of the fund that would be required to finance all Exchequer funded pensions currently in payment if they had been financed on a funded basis rather than on a current account basis; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

This compares with the previous estimate of &euro;116bn for 2009 which was arrived at by the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&amp;amp;AG).  Therefore, over the three years from 2009 to 2012 the liability has fallen by &euro;18bn or by 16%.  The main reasons for the reduction were the pay and pension cuts since 2009 and the freeze in pay and pension rates until after the Haddington Road Agreement.<br\/><br\/>This figure of &euro;98bn represents the present value of all expected future superannuation payments to current staff and their spouses in respect of service to December 2012, plus the liability for all future payments to current and preserved pensioners and to their spouses.\u00a0 The pension payments to discharge this liability will therefore be spread over the next 70 years or so.<br\/><br\/>Historically Public Service pension increases were on the basis of pay parity i.e. in line with the pay of the grade from which the public servant retired.  The figure of &euro;98bn above was based on pay parity applying in future.  An alternative accrued liability figure was also estimated; this was based on pension increases in line with CPI (after 2016) and the associated accrued liability figure was &euro;82bn.<br\/><br\/>The accrued liability figures set out above provide a broad indicator of the size of fund that would be needed to provide for Public Service pension benefits in the event that a fund were to be established for public service occupational pensions.  In contrast, future pension payments will be paid for on an ongoing basis from the State's income, which also includes\u00a0the employee pension contributions made by serving public servants.\u00a0 In assessing the affordability and sustainability of public service pension costs met on a &quot;pay as you go&quot; basis, a key measure in addition to the overall liability is the expected level of actual total annual spending on pensions in future years relative to an indicator of income like GDP.\u00a0 Latest projections are for the total expenditure on\u00a0public service pensions, if the link to pay is maintained,\u00a0to increase from 2.3% of GDP in 2015 to 2.9% in 2030 and then to fall steadily to 1.5% of GDP by 2060. \u00a0This reduction in annual costs in the longer term is largely due to the introduction by the current Government of the new Single Public Service Pension Scheme, which changed the benefits for public servants appointed from 1 January 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021000059#WRG03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"question","counter":310,"qnumday":249,"qnumall":"[5749\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021000059#WRG03700","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he will report on the level of funding that would be required to fund the pension entitlements of departmental Secretaries General, Assistant Secretaries, principal officers and Heads of State agencies, if their pensions were being financed on a funded basis rather then a current account basis; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Pensioners on &euro;12,000 per year or less are fully exempt from PSPR, with a higher exemption threshold of &euro;32,500 applying to pensioners who retired over the last three years.

Member States' entitlement to provide for audit exemption for small companies derives from EU legislation prescribing the maximum thresholds capable of being employed by Member States to determine small company size.  These thresholds relate to net turnover and balance sheet total and number of employees.Under the Fourth Company Law Directive (78\/660\/EC) Member States can provide for small companies to avail of an exemption from the requirement to have their individual accounts audited.  This exemption applies to the accounts prepared for the members.<br\/><br\/>Currently, to be eligible for audit exemption, Ireland requires, among other things, that a private limited company meet all three of the size criteria (balance sheet total, turnover and average number of employees).  The company must not be either a parent or a subsidiary.  In Ireland, companies engaged in certain activities, essentially those in the nature of financial services, cannot avail of the exemption.<br\/><br\/>The audit exemption thresholds applicable in Ireland were raised to the maxima permitted by the European Union, under Directive 2006\/46\/EC, as implemented by S.I. 308 of August 2012.  These current thresholds, which are also set out in the Companies Act 2014, are balance sheet total of &euro;4.4m, net turnover of &euro;8.8m and average number of employees during the financial year of 50.<br\/><br\/>In addition, the Companies Act 2014 extends the scope of the application of the audit exemption to a company limited by guarantee, a company that is either a parent or a subsidiary or a dormant company.  Also, to be eligible for audit exemption, the Act includes a provision that an eligible company need only meet two of the three size criteria. <br\/><br\/>The Accounting Directive (2013\/34\/EU) replaces the Fourth Company Law Directive (78\/660\/EC).  Work on the transposition of the Accounting Directive is currently being progressed by my Department and is required under the Directive to be transposed by 20 July 2015.  This Directive increases the current permissible maximum thresholds which Member States may establish for net turnover and balance sheet total to &euro;12m. and &euro;6m. respectively - the maximum permissible threshold for number of employees remains unchanged. Consideration is being given, in the context of the Department&rsquo;s transposition of the Accounting Directive, as to whether to maintain these thresholds at their current levels or to provide for increases and, if the latter, what levels it might be appropriate to establish.<br\/><br\/>If the decision is to provide for increased thresholds, this will be done by way of an appropriate amendment to the Companies Act 2014.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021000060#WRH00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Community Enterprise Centres","counter":337,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021000060#WRH00750"},{"type":"question","counter":338,"qnumday":258,"qnumall":"[5638\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021000060#WRH00800","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"when approval will be provided to the business development management programme for community enterprise centres in view of the importance of this programme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The last scheme rolled out was in 2012 and 2013 when Enterprise Ireland provided funding of &euro;2 million to support the recruitment of a total of 46 Business Development Managers.

My aim is to enhance the impact of the CEC network on continuing  job creation through this strategy.<\/p>  <p>  On the wider issue of the Centres, the success levels, occupancy levels and sustainability of jobs at the Centres varies and therefore I asked Enterprise Ireland to review the operations of the Community Enterprise Centres in the context of regional enterprise development and how the Community Enterprise Centres and the Local Enterprise Offices might work more closely in support of business start-ups before giving further consideration to the matter.<\/p>  <p>  Under the 2014 Action Plan for Jobs, my Department developed a framework for the preparation of Regional Enterprise Strategies.

The Regional Enterprise Strategies will provide new funding for enterprise support in the regions and seek to leverage and orient existing funds to target initiatives that enable regions to achieve their full employment potential.

The key objectives of the study are:<br\/><br\/>- To fill the gap that currently exists in terms of the hard data and information that is available concerning the prevalence of zero hour and low hour contracts in the Irish economy and the manner of their use.<br\/><br\/>- To assess the impact of zero hour and low hour contract on employees.<br\/><br\/>- To enable the Minister to make any evidence-based policy recommendations to Government considered necessary on foot of the study.<br\/><br\/>All sectors of the economy, both public and private, will come within the scope of the study, and a <font color=\"#2F2F2F\">wide range of stakeholders will be canvassed to contribute to it. It is expected that the study will be completed within six months of commencement.<\/font><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021000060#WRH01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Job Initiatives","counter":349,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021000060#WRH01550"},{"type":"question","counter":350,"qnumday":262,"qnumall":"[5957\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021000060#WRH01600","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if he will provide a breakdown of the funding provided to the Startup Ireland Initiative as set out under the Action Plan for Jobs; the return on investment in terms of job creation; the anticipated start-date for such prior to the Startup Gathering 2015 scheduled for October 2015; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Following on from this, Meat Industry Ireland, the representative body for the meat processors announced with effect from 1 January a &euro;3 per head bonus payment for steers and heifers from Quality Assured farms that do not qualify for the current 12c\/kg in-spec bonus.<\/p>  <p>  A number of farm organisations believe that a higher bonus payment is warranted, but welcome d the fact that the current 12c\/ kg in spec bonus had not been replaced in order to deliver the new bonus payment.

The longstanding policy of UK retailers, who buy large quantities of Irish beef, is to market British and Irish beef separately.  This means that beef must be sourced from animals originating in one country or the other, so that they can be labelled as born, reared and slaughtered in the same country.  In addition, logistical difficulties can arise when a small number of Irish-born animals are slaughtered in a UK meat plant.  Under mandatory EU labelling rules, these carcases have to be deboned in a separate batch, and packaged and labelled accordingly, thereby incurring additional costs for the processor.  These issues are a matter of commercial preference, both of slaughter plants in Britain, and of British retailers.<\/p>  <p>  While Bord Bia has repeatedly raised this issue with British retailers over the years, they are unlikely to reverse their marketing policy in the short term and face other demands from UK stakeholders to stock more British beef.  Nevertheless Bord Bia, in its ongoing interactions with British customers, will continue to pursue all opportunities to maximise the full potential of the beef and livestock trade with our largest trading partner.  In addition, Bord Bia actively supports the development of the live export trade through the provision of market information, developing market access and promotional activity.<\/p>  <p>  I have also had several meetings with my Northern counterpart, Minister Michelle O&rsquo;Neill, on this subject.  We agreed to make a joint approach to the three British retailers who stock Irish Beef, accepting that these were commercial matters, but also seeking some flexibility given that this mixed label beef is produced to the exacting standards required by British consumers. <\/p>  <p>  Minister O&rsquo;Neill also approved a voluntary beef label in Northern Ireland for cattle born in the Republic of Ireland, raised in the Republic of Ireland and\/or Northern Ireland, and slaughtered in Northern Ireland.  This label would facilitate the sale of beef from animals born in the South and slaughtered in the North under a voluntary &lsquo;Irish&rsquo; label, if retailers are willing to stock the product carrying this label.  Of course, such a label would be additional to the mandatory origin label.  The question of using such a label is now a commercial matter between processors and retailers in Northern Ireland and elsewhere in the UK.<\/p>  <p>  Following on from this, I convened a meeting with Minister O&rsquo;Neill and the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium which took place in October.  At this meeting the NIRC made it clear that their beef buyers had a preference for single origin beef, of which they had ample supply, but they would keep the situation under review.  I also met separately with Tesco where we had a useful and frank discussion on this and other procurement issues.  I will continue to pursue opportunities for exports of beef and live cattle at every opportunity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021000061#WRJ03300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Beef Exports","counter":431,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021000061#WRJ03350"},{"type":"question","counter":432,"qnumday":289,"qnumall":"[5810\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021000061#WRJ03400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his plans to work with Bord Bia to support and lead the case for the introduction of a strong single brand for Irish beef exports into the US market; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":433,"content":"<p>The opening of any major third country market for Irish beef is a very positive development for the entire beef sector given our heavy reliance on exports.

The US imports 1 2 million tonnes of beef every year and Ireland is the first EU Member State to secure access to this market.

I will be launching Irish beef at events in New York, Washington DC and Boston, and I will be meeting high-end trade buyers and promoting Irish beef to US food publications so as to <i>build awareness of the qualities of Irish Beef.  <\/i>Ireland is the first EU country to be allowed back into the United States and we must use this advantage to place Irish Beef at the forefront of the premium steak cut market.<br\/><br\/>Bord Bia&rsquo;s strategy for the US market is to position Irish beef as a premium grass based natural product so pure and so natural that you can taste the difference.  The brand positioning developed by Bord Bia is grounded in comprehensive consumer and trade research conducted in the US over the last three years.  The beef market in the US is significantly different from the consumer packaged goods market and retail sales are nearly exclusively own brand.  As a result, Bord Bia will use the visual identity of the Quality Assurance mark to communicate the defining attributes of Irish beef as a natural product sustainably farmed to internationally accredited standards. In addition Bord Bia is developing an application to the sustainbly Process Verified Program which will facilitate their endorsement of the product claims on pack.

I have received a request from aquaculture industry representatives for a package of compensation for rope mussel farming enterprises affected by these harvesting suspensions. My Department is presently finalising a new Seafood Development Programme under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) which will determine how we use the finite resources that will be available to us in the coming years in the overall best interests of Ireland and its seafood sector as a whole.

One of the key areas identified for urgent action by the EAG was the development of a manpower policy with an emphasis on lowering the age profile of Permanent Defence Force personnel. The EAG&rsquo;s report was accepted by Government in 1995.  In an effort to alleviate the situation, the Government had already decided in 1993 to enlist personnel on a five year contract basis, following consultation with Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association (PDFORRA). In 1997 agreement was reached with PDFORRA on a new manpower policy for the Defence Forces. This policy, applying to personnel enlisted after 1 January 1994, provided that service for Private Soldiers would initially be for five years with the option to be extended to a maximum of twelve years, subject to meeting standards of medical and physical fitness and conduct. Longer periods of service were envisaged for Non Commissioned Officers. <\/p>  <p>  In 2004 PDFORRA submitted a claim under the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for a further review of the terms of service applying to personnel enlisting in the Permanent Defence Force after 1 January, 1994. A set of criteria was agreed with PDFORRA to provide longer careers for those who enlisted post 1994 while continuing to address the Government&rsquo;s objective of having an appropriate age profile to meet the challenges of a modern Defence Forces.<\/p>  <p>  The criteria require that any person re-engaging after 12 years service must be able to continue to operate at their current level both at home and overseas on an ongoing basis. Re-engagement is subject to the individual soldier meeting specified criteria in regard to physical fitness, medical category, successful completion of military courses of instruction, service overseas and conduct ratings.<\/p>  <p>  The maximum service period for these personnel is as follows:<\/p>  <p>  -\tEnlisted Personnel, up to and including the rank of Corporal (and equivalent Naval Service rank), may not serve beyond 21 years service.<\/p>  <p>  -\tEnlisted Personnel, in the rank of Sergeant (and equivalent Naval Service rank), may be permitted to continue in service up to the age of fifty years.<\/p>  <p>-\tEnlisted Personnel in all higher ranks may serve to the age of fifty-six.   <\/p>  <p>  The first effects of the agreement, whereby Privates and Corporals may not serve beyond 21 years, will be felt by Permanent Defence Force members in those ranks this year. A claim has been received from PDFORRA for a further review in relation to this matter. In accordance with normal procedures the Association&rsquo;s claim is being dealt with under the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for members of the Permanent Defence Force, under which discussions are confidential to the parties involved. While there was significant progress made in recent discussions between PDFORRA and Civil and Military Management on this issue, it was not possible to reach full agreement. As a result, an adjudication hearing took place on 30 January 2015, following the exchange of submissions between the parties and the result of same is expected in the near future.In the meantime work is continuing on exit support measures to support those due to be discharged. A number of military courses and other skills courses are already accredited with various third level institutions and professional bodies. In addition, a comprehensive training course to aid transition to civilian life for these personnel, which involves a skills appraisal and review of a person&rsquo;s service history and training already provided, is currently being piloted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021000063#WRL03300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"question","counter":542,"qnumday":325,"qnumall":"[6049\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021000063#WRL03400","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"the specific roles and positions the 12 new recruits at Custume Barracks in Athlone, County Westmeath have been assigned to since their posting; if and when more recruits will be posted to the barracks; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

My Department consulted on the matter with the Law Reform Commission and it took the view that unreasonable interference caused in such circumstances was a matter in any particular case for tort law or more generally for planning or environmental law. <\/p>  <p>  In England and Wales, for example, legislation makes provision for local authorities to determine complaints by the owners or occupiers of domestic property who are adversely affected by hedges over 2 metres high.  Broadly similar legislation, i.e. the High Hedges Act (Northern Ireland) 2011, came into operation in Northern Ireland on 31 March 2012. <\/p>  <p>  The manner in which problems associated with high hedges and trees are resolved in both England and Wales and Northern Ireland demonstrates a clear preference for the resolution of such disputes at local level, preferably by mediation, with recourse to the courts only as a last resort.  This reduces the risk of prolonged and costly litigation, and the further risk that court proceedings could leave a legacy of bitterness between neighbours and ill-feeling in the local community.  The introduction of such legislation in this jurisdiction would be a matter for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and his Department.<\/p>  <p>  Depending on the circumstances of the case, a person may, under existing law, be in a position to seek damages or an injunction requiring the cutting of boundary hedges or trees under the tort of nuisance.  In order for the nuisance to be actionable, the person would have to show that an easement existed and that there had been a substantial interference with that right.<\/p>  <p>  Mediation offers a viable, effective and efficient alternative to court proceedings in many cases, including disputes over boundaries and overhanging foliage.  It can both reduce the legal costs involved and speed up the resolution of disputes.  It is my intention to bring forward a mediation Bill to promote mediation as an alternative to court proceedings.  The legislation, which is currently being drafted, will introduce an obligation on solicitors and barristers to advise any person wishing to commence court proceedings to consider mediation as a means of resolving a dispute before embarking on such proceedings.

In relation to the items listed in the Deputy's question I reply under the following headings.<br\/><br\/><b>1. A state appointed victim liaison officer for families of homicide victims<\/b><br\/><br\/>I am not satisfied that the operation of a separate scheme parallel to the existing Garda Family Liaison Officers would prove in the best interests of providing an effective service in this area.<br\/><br\/><b>2. Garda Family Liaison Officer (FLO) scheme to be extended to all districts and FLOs to be given continuous training<\/b><br\/><br\/>I understand that the Garda Family Liaison Officer scheme is available in all districts and that Family Liaison Officers receive initial  training.<br\/><br\/><b>3. Victim impact statement for all homicide victims<\/b><br\/><br\/>When an offender has been convicted of murder or manslaughter representatives of the family of the deceased victim may make a victim impact statement prior to sentence being passed. There is no requirement on a family to make such a statement and where a statement is not made no inference may be drawn by the court that the offence had little or no impact. If a judge thinks it is appropriate, the judge may allow a victim impact statement in other cases, for example a fatal road traffic incident.<br\/><br\/><b>4. Definition of manslaughter and murder to be changed to murder by degree<\/b><br\/><br\/><b>5. Minimum of 25 years imprisonment for first degree murder<\/b><br\/><br\/><b>6. Defined sentencing scales for other degree murder convictions<\/b><br\/><br\/><b>9. Revision of concurrent sentences<\/b><br\/><br\/>The mandatory sentence for murder is life imprisonment, as provided by section 2 of the Criminal Justice Act 1990. A sentence of life imprisonment means that the prisoner is subject to that sentence for the rest of his or her life. Such a prisoner has no right to be released early at any stage. If granted temporary release, the prisoner remains subject to the life sentence and can be recalled to prison at any stage. Currently a person sentenced to life is, on average, likely to spend 17-18 years in prison before receiving any extended period of temporary release.<br\/><br\/>The imposition of multiple life sentences, whether concurrently or consecutively, in a case where more than one murder is committed in the same incident, does not increase the severity of the sanction and has no such effect in practice or in law.<br\/><br\/>The offence of manslaughter does not attract a mandatory sentence but is punishable by a maximum of life imprisonment.<br\/><br\/>As the Deputy will appreciate, the courts are independent in the matter of sentencing, as in other matters concerning the exercise of judicial functions, subject only to the Constitution and the law.  The approach of the Oireachtas has generally been to specify in statute a maximum penalty for an offence, so that a court, having considered all the circumstances of a case, may impose an appropriate penalty up to that maximum.  The court is required to impose a sentence which is proportionate not only to the crime but to the individual offender, in that process identifying where on the sentencing range the particular case should lie and then applying any mitigating factors which may be present.  An important safeguard rests in the power of the Director of Public Prosecutions to apply to the Court of Criminal Appeal to review a sentence she regards as unduly lenient.<br\/><br\/>The prescription of mandatory prison terms in legislation is an exception to this general approach.  I would draw the Deputy's attention to the Law Reform Commission 2013 Report on Mandatory Sentences, which recommends the repeal of existing presumptive mandatory minimum sentence provisions for various drugs and firearms offences. I would also draw the Deputy's attention to the Report on the Strategic Review of Penal Policy, published in September, which recommended that no further mandatory sentences or presumptive minimum sentences should be introduced.<br\/><br\/>I have no plans at present to amend the law to provide for a specific minimum term of imprisonment for murder or to replace the offence of manslaughter with offences of different degrees of murder.<br\/><br\/><b>7. Bail laws to be tightened and implemented by the judiciary<\/b><br\/><br\/>A decision to grant bail in a particular case is a matter for the court, which is, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of its judicial functions. There is a constitutional presumption in favour of bail because, in the eyes of the law, a person is innocent until proven guilty.  The provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights also restrict the extent to which the right to bail can be limited.<br\/><br\/>Prior to the Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution, bail could be refused essentially only on the grounds that the accused person would be likely to abscond or interfere with witnesses or evidence.  Section 2 of the Bail Act 1997, which gave effect to the Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution, permits the courts to refuse bail to a person charged with a serious offence where refusal of bail is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person.  A &ldquo;serious offence&rdquo; is an offence listed in the Schedule to the Bail Act that is punishable by at least five years imprisonment.<br\/><br\/>As regards reform of the bail laws, I can inform the Deputy that the preparation of the General Scheme of a Bail Bill to modernise the law on bail is at a very advanced stage and I intend to bring proposals to Government on the matter in the coming weeks.<br\/><br\/>While the primary aim of the proposed Bail Bill is to consolidate and update bail law, I wish to take the opportunity to seek, as far as is possible, within the constraints of the Constitution and the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights, to focus the legislation on the protection of the individual and of the public.  The intention is that the new provisions will provide better guidance to the courts on how such protection might be provided.  The new Bill will seek to improve the operation of the bail system and make the law as effective as possible in protecting the public against the commission of offences by persons on bail.<br\/><br\/><b>8. Parole and release<\/b><br\/><br\/>In September last year I published the report of the Penal Policy Review Group which was tasked with carrying out a strategic review of penal policy.  As an initial step, the Government agreed, in principle, last November to proceed immediately with the bringing forward of legislative proposals to establish the Parole Board on an independent statutory basis.  I believe this will help to strengthen the Board and improve its functions.  My Department is currently considering the matter in more detail ahead of presenting proposals for legislation.<br\/><br\/><b>10.

Full vetting checks are conducted by the Garda Central Vetting Unit (GCVU) for each new vetting application received to ensure that the most recent data available is taken into account.<\/p>  <p>  The current procedures for Garda vetting ensure the integrity of the system.  This is because once there has been any significant lapse of time between one employment and another, the original Garda Vetting Disclosure would not include information regarding any recent criminal convictions, and the second employer could not safely rely on it.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, under the Data Protection Acts, any sensitive personal data which employers use in regard to their employees must be current, accurate and up-to-date and employers would be exposed to civil liability if they knowingly recruited staff based on out-of-date criminal records information where the person in fact had a more recent criminal conviction.  Effectively, the non-transferability and contemporaneous nature of the current process protects against the risk of fraud or forgery and is a guarantee of the integrity of the vetting service and such procedures are in line with best practice internationally.<\/p>  <p>  There are, however, certain limited circumstances where organisations can share a single vetting disclosure where this is agreed to by the vetting applicant.  For example, persons involved in voluntary work may be doing work with more than one voluntary organisation at the same time, and may agree with the vetting applicant to share a single vetting disclosure.  Similar arrangements arise in the health sector in regard to persons working as locums, agency nurses or other temporary employees in a number of different organisations, or in the education sector where substitute teachers are on panels for substitute teaching in more than one school.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, the current average processing time for vetting applications is four weeks.

It will consider the appropriate operational structure which should underpin the provision of frontline services and the necessary support for court sittings in both locations.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the consultative approach which is being adopted by the Courts Service in seeking submissions on the review from any interested parties or local interests.  The Courts Service had originally sought submissions by the end of November 2014 but they agreed to extend the timeframe for submissions to mid January 2015 to allow for the fullest possible consultation. I am informed that all submissions have now been received and there are some further consultations with key stakeholders and court users in the county to be completed. I have been assured by the Courts Service that all views received will be taken into account in the decision making process. The Courts Service anticipate that its report of the review of court services in County Tipperary will be completed by the end of March. It should, however, be noted that the final decision is a matter for the Courts Service Board.  Under the statute I have no role or function in the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021000066#WRO00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Domestic Violence Policy","counter":659,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021000066#WRO00950"},{"type":"question","counter":660,"qnumday":367,"qnumall":"[6065\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021000066#WRO01000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will amend legislation in order to enable grandparents to seek and obtain barring orders against their grandchildren where it is necessary as an alternative to an injunction; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1057","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":661,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to introduce consolidated and reformed domestic violence legislation to address all aspects of domestic violence.

If the mother agrees, the parents can jointly make a statutory declaration appointing the father as a guardian; alternatively, the father may apply to court to be appointed a guardian under Section 6A of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964. The vast majority of such court applications are successful.<br\/><br\/>The Children and Family Relationships Bill which will be published very shortly, if enacted will ensure that more fathers are automatically the guardians of their children. Where the father lives with the child's mother for more than 12 consecutive months, of which at least 3 months are with the mother and the child after the child's birth, the Bill will provide that he will automatically be the guardian of the child. This will substantially improve the position of non-marital fathers generally, including in situations such as the Deputy has outlined.<br\/><br\/>Where a father is the guardian of his children or has a court order granting him custody, including shared custody, of the children, or there are proceedings pending, the Central Authority on Child Abduction may be able to provide assistance where the children are removed from the jurisdiction in breach of those rights of custody.<br\/><br\/>The procedures for dealing with situations of international parental child abduction involving countries which are party to the 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction are set out in the Child Abduction and Enforcement of Custody Orders Act 1991.

","asker":"1065","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":700,"content":"<p>As the Deputy can appreciate, policy responsibility for homelessness, insofar as it extends to my Department, relates to children under 18 and any child welfare and protection concerns that may arise in the context of the Child Care Act 1991.  A child can only be received into the care of the Child and Family Agency where there are welfare or protection concerns.  Homelessness as part of a family group is not, in of itself, a basis for seeking to receive a child into care.  Responsibility for young adults (aged over 18 years) presenting as homeless lies primarily with the local authorities and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  In light of this, I have been advised by the Agency that it does not collect the data requested by the Deputy and cannot provide it in the format as requested.<\/p>  <p>  I would note, however, that where a child under 18 years of age presents as homeless and it is not possible to reunite them with their family, then the child may be taken into care.  In some circumstances, a child aged 16 or 17 years of age may be accommodated and supported by the Agency under section 5, accommodation of homeless children, of the Child Care Act 1991.  The Child and Family Agency does capture some information on children aged 16 and 17 years presenting as homeless and who are referred to the Agency under section 5 of the Child Care Act 1991.  The Agency advises that there were 26 children who were accommodated under section 5 of the Act in the year to the end of the third quarter of 2014.  The regional breakdown reported was 1 in Dublin Mid-Leinster, 5 in Dublin North East, 13 in the South and 7 in the West.  Figures for previous years can be found in the Review of Adequacy reports published under section 8 of the Act.<\/p>  <p>  Young adults, generally in the age range of 18 to 23 years old, who were formerly in the care of the State and presently in receipt of aftercare services will, as part of this support, have their accommodation needs identified.  As of September 2014, the Agency reported that there were 1,698 young adults aged 18 to 23 in receipt of an aftercare service and education participation in this group was on a par with the national participation rate of 56%.  In respect of homelessness, I have been advised by the Agency that it does not collect statistics on young adults (over 18 years) who present themselves as such to local authorities.  <\/p>  <p>  Last year, a protocol was established between the County and City Management Association and the Child and Family Agency in relation to the assessment of housing needs for young people leaving care. The aim of the protocol is to make the assessment and allocation of social housing, where deemed to be the most appropriate response to the young person&rsquo;s need, more efficient and seamless. It is hoped this will facilitate an improved service for those leaving care in obtaining social housing suitable to their needs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021000067#WRP00500","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foster Care","counter":701,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021000067#WRP00550"},{"type":"question","counter":702,"qnumday":383,"qnumall":"[5906\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021000067#WRP00600","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"his views on a matter (details supplied) regarding foster care; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1017","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":703,"content":"<p>As the Deputy may appreciate, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on an individual case.

I welcome the fact that the Garda&iacute; have now cleared the way so that Mr. Lynch&rsquo;s investigation can commence.  I have asked the HSE to keep me informed of progress.<br\/><br\/>Mr Lynch&rsquo;s investigation team is working independently of the HSE and will form an important input into any disciplinary process which the HSE will undertake. <br\/><br\/>A full assurance review has also been commissioned of all of the Units in the Aras Attracta facility under the independent chairmanship of Dr. Kevin McCoy, assisted by 3 independent experts within the field. The group will review the programme of work already implemented on foot of the reports from HIQA and HSE Audits to establish their effectiveness, identify the gaps that arose and make recommendations for further improvements for each unit at Aras Attracta. In addition the output from the Review Team will help to inform a system &ndash;wide programme of improvement and assurance for all residential centres, including a mechanism for input from service users and their families, staff at all levels throughout the sector and academia. <br\/><br\/>The HSE has undertaken a number of additional initiatives to ensure that quality and safe care in residential services for people with disabilities is appropriately implemented and monitored. <br\/><br\/>A six-step plan will address this in a systematic way. These steps are:<br\/><br\/>- The establishment of a National Implementation Taskforce, including a series of National Summits to improve client safety, dignity, respect and  culture; <br\/><br\/>- Implementation of the <i>National Policy &amp;amp; Procedures on Safeguarding Vulnerable Persons at Risk of Abuse<\/i>;<br\/><br\/>- Development of an Advocacy programme; <br\/><br\/>- Implementation of an evaluation and quality improvement programme in disability residential centres; <br\/><br\/>- Development of an implementation plan for any recommendations arising from the McCoy review of residential services in &Aacute;ras Attracta when complete, and <br\/><br\/>- Development of long term sustainable &amp;amp; evidence-based safeguarding practices and training programmes specific to residential settings.<br\/><br\/>I can assure the Deputy that my Department will monitor progress on the initiatives and processes commissioned by the HSE in relation to &Aacute;ras Attracta, to ensure that the learning from this incident is promulgated throughout our health system.<br\/><br\/>As the second part of the Deputy's question relates to service matters, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive (HSE) for direct reply to the Deputy.

I have asked the HSE to keep me informed of progress.<br\/><br\/>Mr Lynch&rsquo;s investigation team is working independently of the HSE and will form an important input into any disciplinary process which the HSE will undertake. <br\/><br\/>A full assurance review has also been commissioned of all of the Units in the Aras Attracta facility under the independent chairmanship of Dr. Kevin McCoy, assisted by 3 independent experts within the field. The group will review the programme of work already implemented on foot of the reports from HIQA and HSE Audits to establish their effectiveness, identify the gaps that arose and make recommendations for further improvements for each unit at Aras Attracta. In addition the output from the Review Team will help to inform a system &ndash;wide programme of improvement and assurance for all residential centres, including a mechanism for input from service users and their families, staff at all levels throughout the sector and academia. <br\/><br\/>The HSE has undertaken a number of additional initiatives to ensure that quality and safe care in residential services for people with disabilities is appropriately implemented and monitored. <br\/><br\/>A six-step plan will address this in a systematic way.

The key objective is to develop services in the community which will give people direct access to integrated multi-disciplinary teams of general practitioners, nurses, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and other allied health professionals.<\/p>  <p>  The development of the Teams is a work in progress with enhancements occurring in terms of team membership and organisational delivery over time.  At the end of December 2014, core Team staff amounted to approximately 3,000, providing services for almost 4 million of the population.<\/p>  <p>  264.5 Primary Care Team posts (Public Health Nurses; Registered General Nurses; Occupational Therapists; Physiotherapists; and Speech &amp;amp; Language Therapists) were approved in 2013.  247 posts are now filled or start dates agreed. The recruitment process is continuing regarding the remaining posts.<\/p>  <p>  On 8 October, the HSE launched the Community Healthcare Organisations Report. The Report sets out plans for a comprehensive reorganisation of health services outside the acute hospital system. The primary focus is to provide the maximum proportion of care to people in the communities where they live and to achieve joined-up, integrated services.<\/p>  <p>  The present 17 Integrated Service Areas will be replaced by nine Community Healthcare Organisations, which will be part of the HSE.  Existing resources will be reorganised into 90 Primary Care Networks, each serving about 50,000 of the population.  Each network will be headed by an identified, accountable person responsible for care delivery by professionals such as nurses, therapists and social workers so as to meet a wide range of people&rsquo;s needs in a joined-up way. There will be strong GP involvement and a focus on decision-making at local level. The new structures will also have a strong focus on building good linkages with the acute hospital system so that people&rsquo;s care pathways are appropriately planned and their needs met in the right setting.<\/p>  <p>  The implementation of the recommendations of the CHO Report, including the establishment of the CHOs and their management structures, has been listed as a key priority of the HSE&rsquo;s National Service Plan for 2015. The HSE has appointed seven of the nine Chief Officers. The process is ongoing in relation to the remaining two posts.<\/p>  <p>  There are currently 8 Community Intervention Teams (CITs) in place in Dublin North, Dublin South, Cork, Limerick, Tipperary, Clare, Carlow\/Kilkenny and Galway. CITs work in partnership with Primary Care Teams, General Practice, Community Response Beds, community nursing, home support services, acute hospitals and other professional, voluntary and external providers to deliver enhanced services and patient centred care in the most appropriate setting. The CIT provides a rapid and integrated response to an appropriate patient with an acute episode of illness who requires CIT services for a defined\/short period of time in the community\/home, thus helping to increase hospital avoidance and earlier discharge from acute hospitals.<\/p>  <p>  There are currently over 2,400 GPs providing services to 1,768,700 medical card holders and 159,576 GP visit card holders under the General Medical Services scheme.  90% of the population have access to GP out-of-hours services in 14 centres nationally, in all HSE regions, in at least part of every county.<\/p>  <p>  The development of Primary Care Centres (PCC) to accommodate the HSE&rsquo;s Primary Care Teams and GPs in the one location is a key enabler for the delivery of primary care services. There are three methods used by the HSE for the development of PCCs: Direct Build; Public Private Partnership (PPP) Programme; and Operational Lease. To-date, there are 85 PCCs in operation (42 of which have opened since March 2011). There are currently 37 locations where primary care infrastructure is under construction or at an advanced planning stage.<\/p>  <p>  In general, services provided in PCCs include: Public Health Nursing; Physiotherapy; Occupational Therapy; Speech and Language Therapy; Primary Care Social Work; Primary Care Counselling; Dietetics; and Podiatry. Some centres also provide additional services such as Minor Surgery, Mental Health services, Pharmacy and Dental services.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is committed to widening access to primary care.  This includes introducing, on a phased basis, a universal GP service without fees.  This process has commenced in respect of all children under 6 years. The objective is to have universal GP care without fees for children under 6 years in place in Quarter 2, 2015, subject to the conclusion of the present discussions with the Irish Medical Organisation and the completion of a fee-setting process.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is also prioritising GP care without fees at the point of access for persons over 70 years to coincide with the introduction of GP care without fees for children under 6.  This will be facilitated under the existing GMS contract.  <\/p>  <p>  The HSE\/Department and the IMO, under the Framework Agreement signed in June 2014, have also commenced talks on a new GP contract, with more substantive engagement scheduled for the coming weeks. A priority of these discussions will be the inclusion of chronic disease management for patients.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE has identified an initial five Integrated Care Programmes for implementation in 2015, including the Integrated Care Programme for the prevention and management of Chronic Disease.<\/p>  <p>  The National Integrated Care Diabetes Programme is being implemented on a phased basis.  In 2013, the Government approved funding for the appointment of 17 Integrated Care Diabetes Nurse Specialists to support the phased roll out of the programme.  To-date, 16.65 Whole Time Equivalent nurse specialists have been recruited.<\/p>  <p>  Work is also underway in the HSE on an implementation plan for the National Clinical Programme for Asthma&rsquo;s Model of Care.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE&rsquo;s 2015 National Service Plan (NSP) commits the HSE to roll out a pilot, to provide GP direct access to ultrasound, at approximately eight primary care sites, across the South and West, from early 2015.

I concluded that it would not be possible to introduce a full UHI system by 2019, as envisaged in the White Paper.  However, I want to emphasise my commitment to implementing reforms. In particular, I want to push ahead with key reforms in areas such as extending free GP care on a phased basis, improving the management of chronic diseases, implementing key financial reforms, including activity-based funding, and establishing hospital groups. As well as representing critical building blocks for the future health system, they are also important reforms in their own right that will drive efficiencies and bring benefits in advance of moving to a system of universal healthcare. <br\/><br\/>With regard to the introduction of universal GP care, &euro;37 million has been provided for the first and second phases of this initiative this year, which is intended to provide GP care without fees to all children aged under 6 and to all persons aged 70 years and over by Quarter 2 2015, subject to the conclusion of discussions between the Department of Health, the HSE and the IMO.<br\/><br\/>Finally with regard to the wider issue of the statutory resources required to deliver UHI, my Department is undertaking a major costing exercise, in conjunction with the ESRI, the Health Insurance Authority and others. This exercise will estimate the cost of UHI for individuals\/households and the Exchequer.  I expect to have the initial results from this exercise in April, following which I will revert to Government with a roadmap on the next steps to UHI. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021000069#WRR02500","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Reviews","counter":823,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021000069#WRR02600"},{"type":"question","counter":824,"qnumday":427,"qnumall":"[5689\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021000069#WRR02700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if and when a medical card review will be completed in the case of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":825,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>  <p>  The Health Service Executive operates the General Medical Services scheme, which includes medical cards and GP visit cards, under the Health Act 1970, as amended.

The Act provides that persons, unable without undue hardship having regard to their overall financial situation to arrange GP services for themselves and family, qualify for a medical card. The Deputy will also be aware of the publication of the Report of the Expert Panel on Medical Need for Medical Card Eligibility and the Medical Card Process Review in November 2014.  A key recommendation of the Expert Panel was that a person&rsquo;s means should remain the main qualifier for a medical card.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE has discretion, exercised in accordance with the legislation, to grant a medical card where a person's income exceeds the income guidelines. The HSE is obliged to operate within the legal parameters as set out in the Health Act, while also responding to the variety of circumstances and complexities faced by individuals who apply for a medical card.  <\/p>  <p>  In the light of the conclusions of the two reports a range of actions have been identified to improve the operation of the medical card system, particularly for people with significant medical needs. The HSE has appointed a senior manager, at Assistant National Director level, with specific responsibility for Primary Care Schemes and Eligibility, to lead the reform. A Clinical Advisory Group has been appointed and it will provide an interim report within three months on the development of guidance on assessing medical card applications involving significant medical conditions. It includes representatives of Our Children's Health and Patients for Patient Safety Ireland.  <\/p>  <p>  The HSE is also putting arrangements in place for a more integrated and sensitive processing of medical card applications involving significant medical conditions to ensure greater interaction between the central office regarding the assessment of a person&rsquo;s eligibility and the local health office regarding the person&rsquo;s medical condition and the services that they may require. Consequently, the number of medical cards issued, where the HSE has exercised discretion, has increased from approximately 50,300 at the start of 2014 to approximately 76,700 at the start of 2015.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021000070#WRS03700","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Patient Transport Provision","counter":884,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021000070#WRS03800"},{"type":"question","counter":885,"qnumday":447,"qnumall":"[5890\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021000070#WRS03900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the consideration being given to addressing the transportation issues that have arisen for patients in counties Longford and Westmeath who have to attend hospitals in the Dublin area; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1062","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":886,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly.

There are a number of options open to individuals to make a complaint about the health services at present.  Part 9 of the Health Act 2004 states that a person has the right to complain about any action of the Health Service Executive (HSE) or a service provider that they believe was not fair or had an adverse affect on them. The HSE has appointed designated Complaints Officers to ensure the effective management of complaints throughout their relevant areas of responsibility.  The HSE actively encourages and promotes consumer feedback and links with customers on a regular basis to ensure that the complaint handling processes are effective, are being communicated and are achieving outcomes that are satisfactory to the consumers. The HSE continues to seek improvements in its complaint handling ability and capacity in order to respond to the needs of patients. <\/p>  <p>  If an individual is unhappy with the way in which his\/her complaint was dealt with the National Advocacy Unit of the HSE will appoint an independent officer to review the complaint.  If an individual is still unhappy with the outcome of this process he\/she can request an independent review of the complaint from the Office of the Ombudsman or Ombudsman for Children.   <\/p>  <p> Healthcomplaints.ie is an on-line information service which was developed by the Office of the Ombudsman in cooperation with   a number of organisations including my Department and the HSE. This service provides information on how to make a complaint or give feedback about health and social care services in Ireland. This website has been developed for people who use health and social care services in Ireland, as well as for their families, care-givers and advocates.  <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, if an individual is unhappy with the level of care provided by a regulated health service professional such as a doctor, nurse or other healthcare professional, he\/she may make a complaint to that employee's professional regulatory body.<\/p>  <p>  I believe that it is paramount that both patients and their families raise queries or complaints and that they feel that those complaints will be listened to and acted upon.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, it is not possible for me to answer the specific queries raised by the Deputy based on the details supplied.

Persons in this category are entitled to full eligibility and receive a medical card as evidence of their entitlement. The applicant is only required to demonstrate to the HSE that they qualify under the EU Regulations and there is no requirement to submit income details and details of savings. The applicant must produce the appropriate E or S-form, completed by their Member State confirming the healthcare entitlement for which that state is liable.  The position regarding the UK is that, under a reciprocal agreement, the EU S form is not required, however, proof of receipt of a qualifying payment from the UK authorities should be provided with the application to the HSE.  <\/p>  <p>  The HSE has responsibility to establish if an applicant is subject to Irish social security legislation. A person is considered subject to Irish social security legislation if s\/he is in receipt of a contributory Irish social welfare payment or engaged in work in Ireland and subject to PRSI.  If a person is considered subject to Irish social security legislation, the person will not qualify for a Medical Card under EU legislation, but may qualify for a means-tested Medical Card under national legislation. An applicant under the EU Regulations may apply in respect of themselves alone if they consider they meet the above requirements even where their partner\/spouse is subject to Irish social security legislation. The dependants of the person who qualifies for a medical card under the EU Regulations who reside with him\/her are also entitled to a medical card on production of the appropriate E or S-form provided that they are not themselves subject to the Irish social security system, or in the case of children, that the spouse or person looking after the children is not also subject to Irish social security legislation. Again no form is required in the case of UK applicants provided the required evidence of entitlement is provided.<\/p>  <p>  A spouse who does not qualify under the EU Regulations may separately apply for a means-tested medical card under national legislation but will however be required to supply the information requested by the HSE in respect of the couple's means in order to permit the HSE assess if the spouse will qualify for a means-tested medical card under national legislation. <\/p>  <p>  The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.

However, the issue of pricing and reimbursement of medicines has been the subject of recent discussion at an EU level.<\/p>  <p>  The Council of the European Union issued conclusions in December 2014 on the issue of innovation for the benefit of patients which included the issue of co-operation on the pricing of medicines between Member States. The Council conclusions invited the European Commission and Member States to examine opportunities for potential co-operation on a voluntary basis in the field of pricing and reimbursement.<\/p>  <p>  I have indicated previously in discussions at an EU level on this issue that I am supportive of proposals that would deliver greater transparency in prices. However, I am mindful that this may be difficult to achieve as Member States negotiate directly with pharmaceutical companies to agree commercially confidential discounts on the price of medicines and to establish patient access schemes.<\/p>  <p>  A number of mechanisms exist at a European level to assist with the issue of pricing and reimbursement of medicines. In 2008 the network of Competent Authorities on Pricing and Reimbursement was created of which Ireland is a member. This is an informal platform which discusses the issues and challenges in the field of pricing and reimbursement of medicines. Ireland also has access to the EU Euripid Database which was launched in 2010. This is a web based database which provides up to date information on the prices of medicines which can be accessed by participating Member States. <\/p>  <p>  It is also worth noting that a Joint Procurement Agreement for medical countermeasures is in place at an EU level which enables countries, including Ireland, to procure pandemic vaccines and other medical countermeasures on a group rather than individual basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021000071#WRT01700","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"question","counter":926,"qnumday":461,"qnumall":"[5986\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021000071#WRT01800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason he and the Health Service Executive discuss the cost of medicines with the Irish Pharmaceuticals Health Care Association, instead of directly with the pharmaceutical companies; the reason he goes through a third party; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The signing ceremony was hosted at the Embassy of Ireland in Washington DC by Irish Ambassador Anne Anderson and took place in the presence of US Secretary of Labour, Thomas Perez and Richard Trumka, President of the AFL-CIO.<\/p>  <p>  The federation promises to deliver considerable benefits, especially in terms of expanding training and future employment opportunities for the members of both unions. Explaining the context of the agreement, Eamon Devoy, General Secretary of the TEEU, has pointed to the imperative that engineering workers are suitably trained and retrained to meet the demands of change based technologies that are crucial to the needs of successful business.<\/p>  <p>  He has also highlighted the TEEU&rsquo;s focus on training, quality and standards and noted that the association with the UA will be important to developing the training aspect of their activities.  Under the agreement, the TEEU will bring US trainers to Ireland to teach workers new skills under a &ldquo;train the trainers&rdquo; programme.  William Hite of the UA has also stressed the need for skills development in order to compete for high skilled jobs in a global economy and committed the UA to sharing their knowledge.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the signing of this agreement and commend the role of our Embassy in Washington in facilitating it.  In an increasingly globalised world and in an open economy such as Ireland&rsquo;s it is essential that we constantly look to enhance and improve our skills so that training opportunities arising, as the economy starts to grow again, can be availed of.  While the future development of this agreement is for the two unions concerned, I hope and expect that it will contribute to such improved training opportunities and wish the two organisations every success with its implementation and development.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021000073#WRV00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Travel","counter":1017,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021000073#WRV00950"},{"type":"question","counter":1018,"qnumday":493,"qnumall":"[6064\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021000073#WRV01000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will provide further details on his proposed trip to Palestine and Israel; if he will be visiting Gaza; and if the dates for the visit have been confirmed.","asker":"1037","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":1019,"content":"<p>I am planning to visit the Middle East next week, from 15 to 20 February inclusive.

Parents have the right to choose which school to apply to and where the school has places available the pupil should be admitted. However, in schools where there are more applicants than places available a selection process may be necessary.

For example, one of the 24 'Statements of Learning', that encompass the key knowledge and skills that students will be expected to develop during their junior cycle, requires that all students will \"value what it means to be an active citizen with rights and responsibilities in local and wider context\".

This initiative, which was launched in 2009, recognises schools that provide a quality programme for all students and promote physical activity across the whole school community. The popularity of this programme among all schools is increasing annually.<\/p>  <p>  Physical activity by pupils is not the sole remit of schools. PE in schools is designed to complement activity and other lifestyle habits outside of school. In fact, this \"whole of life\" approach is being adopted in the National Physical Activity Plan, which is currently being finalised by a cross-sectoral working group co-chaired by the Department of Health and the Department of Tourism and Sport. The Department of Education and Skills is a member of this group.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, I will shortly be issuing guidance to all schools about measures to promote healthy lifestyles generally. This guidance encompasses measures to promote P.E. and physical activity, as well as healthy eating and healthy vending. The guidance has been drafted in consultation with the Department of Health and the HSE.<\/p>  <p>  I have no plans at this time to extend the study referred to by the Deputy.   However, as part of a quality physical education programme, P.E. teachers routinely provide information, advice and guidance to students on how to improve a range of components of fitness as part of a healthy lifestyle. This would frequently include advice on the benefits of improved flexibility and the measurement of this component using basic field tests such as the sit-and-reach test.<\/p>  <p>  The authors of the study may wish to make contact with the management bodies of post primary schools, or principals' associations, should they wish to disseminate the benefits of their work more widely.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021000074#WRW02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs Service Provision","counter":1079,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021000074#WRW02300"},{"type":"question","counter":1080,"qnumday":514,"qnumall":"[5763\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021000074#WRW02400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the reason schools (details supplied) in County Carlow were not sanctioned for units for children with autism in view of the fact they have better facilities and would have 12 units rather than the six-unit classroom sanctioned for another school, and also in view of the fact that since the number of children with autism is on the increase, these schools would be able to facilitate more children; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"965","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":1081,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Deputy that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible for approving special classes\/units.

Over 11,000 resource and learning support teaching posts are now available.

Some categories of ethnic or cultural background are required for international reporting purposes and in mainstream schools for enhanced capitation payments.  The Data Protection Commissioner advises that the most equitable way to collect this type of sensitive information is to give all pupils an opportunity to identify their own ethnic and cultural background and consent to the information being passed to the Department, rather than targeting a particular ethnic or cultural group in the data collection, and so we have proceeded with the question on that basis.  The question on Ethnic and Cultural background is not compulsory and parents have the option to choose no consent to answer the question.<\/p>  <p>  We are committed to reviewing the questions asked in POD.  As part of this we have reviewed our question In POD on the collection of information on Ethnic or Cultural Background.  We feel that the question used to collect data on ethnic or cultural background should be harmonised across all the education partners and other bodies who collect this type of information.  As the CSO is the National Statistical Office, we are taking our lead from them.  However, while the question asked in POD is not the exact same as the question asked in the Census of Population, it is based on the question.  The main difference between the Census of Population question and the question asked in POD was that we also included the category of Roma as Ireland has International data reporting requirements on this group.  The Census does not have a category of Roma.<\/p>  <p>  The Department is currently working on making changes to the text of some of the response categories to Ethnic and Cultural Background question.  This includes changes to the suggested consent form for schools to collect the information for POD and to the categories as they appear on the POD database. An updated consent form (in both English and Irish) will be available for downloading from the Department's website in the coming week.  These changes will also be reflected on the POD database in the coming weeks.<\/p>  <p>  The changes that will be made to the question asked in POD are outlined as follows.  Black African will be replaced with, Black or Black Irish - African,Any other Black Background will be replaced with, Black or Black Irish - Any other Background, Chinese will be replaced with, Asian or Asian Irish-Chinese, Any other Asian will be replaced with, Asian or Asian Irish - Any other background.<\/p>  <p>  While we accept the point that not everyone is happy with the a list of categories as they are laid out, it is very difficult to agree a list of categories that can satisfy everyone when discussing such a subjective matter, particularly the range of possible categories is infinitely wider than what is outlined in our question.In this regard the Statistics Section of the Department met with the CSO's Census of Population Division to discuss concerns such as yours.  They too accept that the variant of the ethnicity question on the 2016 census may fall short of what could be expected in today's multi -racial Ireland.  Unfortunately, given the no-change' census approach being adopted for Census of Population 2016 it is not possible to change the CSO question at this stage.  However the CSO has indicated that it is considering holding a seminar to examine how the data in this area can be improved from the point of view of maximising the number of write-in responses to increase the variety of ethnic descriptions captured, the classification system used, and also looking at the nationality vs. citizenship issue and examining generally how the outputs from the census can be improved in this important area.  The Department of Education and Skills will be participating in this seminar.

Infant pupils receive 45 minutes of instruction per week while 1st to 6th pupils receive one hour instruction per week.<\/p>  <p>  Discover Primary Science is a national programme designed to foster interest in Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths (STEM) in primary schools.

It is coordinated by SFI Discover, the education-outreach programme of Science Foundation Ireland, who also help fund Engineers Week.<\/p>  <p>  Significant system developments have been introduced in the primary school system to promote teaching and learning in Mathematics for boys and girls including standardised national assessments of reading and mathematics introduced in 2007; the National strategy to improve literacy and numeracy introduced in 2011 and School self-evaluation guidelines for primary schools published in 2012.<\/p>  <p>  TIMSS (Trends in International Mathematics and Science Studies) is a project of the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA).  It is designed to assess the mathematics and science achievement of fourth class pupils.  In 2011, Ireland took part in TIMSS for the first time since 1995.  Ireland's mean score of 527 is significantly above the TIMSS mathematics centre of 500.  Ireland is in 17th position in the TIMSS mathematics table.  In Ireland, girls averaged 526 and boys averaged 529.  The 3-point gap is not statistically significant, and is broadly similar to the overall international average gender age gap.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland is shown as 22nd position in the TIMSS science table.  In ireland, boys and girls obtained identical mean scores (516).<\/p>  <p>  The evidence from TIMSS indicates that girls are performing as well as their male counterparts in Science and Mathematics in primary schools.  The promotion of STEM subjects to girls only does not appear necessary.<\/p>  <p>  In January this year, I launched the performance report on the 2014 National Assessments of English and Reading and Mathematics which was prepared by the Educational Research Centre.  Their study of 8000 pupils in 150 primary schools found that overall performance in reading and maths in second and sixth classes was significantly higher than for the 2009 assessments.  These are the first significant improvements in over 30 years. Such improvements are to be welcomed.<\/p>  <p>  The NCCA has recently provided me with new specifications for Leaving Certificate Physics, Chemistry and Biology.  The NCCA has notified the Department that before the specifications made available to all schools that it, working with the SEC and my Department, will trial, in particular the proposed new practical examination.  It is expected, for example, that the new Physics specification, when it is introduced, will not attract more higher level students but it is hoped that it will also attract more girls and more students to study Physics at Ordinary level.  Work is underway on revising Leaving Certificate Applied Mathematics.  One of its aims would be to broaden the possible content so that it will be attractive to a wider cohort, especially for girls.<\/p>  <p>  The new Junior Cycle Science specification has been submitted to me, by NCCA, this month, for approval.  This will form a firm foundation for the sciences at senior cycle.  There is a significant overlap between the developments in the sciences at Junior Cycle and Senior Cycle.  Thus the CDP provided for Junior Cycle Science will also start to prepare science teachers for the changes which will follow in the Leaving Certificates sciences.  There will be many synergies between the two and there is a natural progression.  Of course there will be dedicated CPD provided to Leaving Certificate science teachers to prepare them to introduce the new specifications not only in Physics but also in Chemistry and Biology.  A unified CPD strategy will support a consistent experience of teaching and learning in the science curricula throughout post-primary education.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021000076#WRY00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Policies for Smaller Schools","counter":1168,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021000076#WRY00800"},{"type":"question","counter":1169,"qnumday":545,"qnumall":"[5997\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021000076#WRY00900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"her views on the introduction of cluster policies for small schools as set out in the Irish Primary Principals' Network's report entitled New Horizons for Smaller Schools.","asker":"984","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":1170,"content":"<p>Ireland has a high number of primary schools by international standards and a high number of these schools are small schools.

It is an area of spending which has been prioritised above most other areas by this Government, despite the enormous pressures on all areas of public spending.<\/p>  <p>  Some &euro;1.37 billion will be spent in support of children with Special Educational Needs this year, which represents approximately 15% of my Department's budget.<\/p>  <p>  365 new Special Needs Assistant (SNA) posts and 480 resource teaching posts have been provided to support children with special educational needs in schools in 2015, bringing the total number of SNAs available for allocation in 2015 to 11,330 posts and the total number of resource teaching posts to 6,705.  Over 11,000 resource and learning support teaching posts are now available.  This is the highest level of SNA and resource teaching allocations that we have ever had, and will ensure that children with special educational needs can continue to participate in education and be supported in a manner appropriate to their needs.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act, a number of sections have been commenced, including those establishing the National Council for Special Education and those promoting an inclusive approach to education of children.<\/p>  <p>  The NCSE report on 'Supporting Students with Special Educational Needs in Schools' which was published in 2013 and is available on the NCSE website www.ncse.ie, recommends that the EPSEN Act be fully implemented as soon as possible.  The report also states that the NCSE recognises that the current economic climate makes it unlikely that the Government will be able to implement this recommendation in the short to medium term.<\/p>  <p>  It is intended to bring into effect many of the good ideas contained in the EPSEN Act, on a non-statutory basis initially, through policy developments across a range of areas, in conjunction with NCSE policy advice.<\/p>  <p>  This includes the National Council for Special Education's (NCSE) Report on a Proposed New Model for Allocating Teachers for Students with Special Educational Needs, published on 18th June 2014.<\/p>  <p>  The report recommends that a new allocation model should be developed, based on a schools educational profile, while providing a baseline allocation to every mainstream school to support inclusion.<\/p>  <p>  I hope to make an announcement in relation to this matter shortly, in order to give clarity to schools regarding the allocation process for the coming school year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021000076#WRY02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Council Accreditation","counter":1186,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021000076#WRY02600"},{"type":"question","counter":1187,"qnumday":551,"qnumall":"[6102\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021000076#WRY02700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the involvement she and her Department have had with the request for Medical Council accreditation from the Royal College of Surgeons, Bahrain; if her attention has been drawn to concerns that have been expressed by Members of the Oireachtas and human rights bodies regarding the hospital environment in which the Royal College of Surgeons, Bahrain students have to complete their placements; her views on these concerns; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1054","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":1188,"content":"<p>Section 88(2)(a) of the Medical Practitioners Act 2007 requires that the Medical Council consult with the Minister for Education and Skills before approving, or otherwise, basic medical programmes and the bodies that deliver them.  The Act makes clear that my role in relation to this matter is to be consulted and that the ultimate decision regarding approval of programmes of medical education and the providers of those programmes rests with the Medical Council.<\/p>  <p>  On 4 December 2014 I received, in accordance with section 88(2)(a), correspondence from the Medical Council setting out the recommendations of a Committee established to perform the relevant functions under the Act in respect of a number of institutions, including the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, Bahrain.<\/p>  <p>  The Government's position has been articulated by successive Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Trade.  Ireland was also one of 47 United Nations Member States who participated in a joint statement at the UN Human Rights Council expressing serious concern regarding the protection of human rights in Bahrain and calling on the Bahraini Government to expedite the implementation of the recommendations received from the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry.  The issues involved have also been the subject of detailed consideration by the Oireachtas Committee on Education and Social Protection.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has always sought to draw a clear distinction between the wider human rights situation and the involvement of Irish institutions in the education and training of Bahraini medical personnel.  In that regard, I regard the process set out under Section 88 of the Act as a vital part of the quality assurance architecture for medical education and training in Irish institutions, ensuring compliance with relevant national and international standards.<\/p>  <p>  Therefore, while the Government will continue to use all appropriate diplomatic avenues to express its concerns regarding the human rights situation in Bahrain, it was important to ensure that the Medical Council's consultation with me remained focused on the matters which have been properly identified by the Medical Council under both the Act and other relevant national and international standards.<\/p>  <p>  In the context of the above, in responding to the Medical Council, I noted that it was proposed that \"the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland Bahrain's six year programme of basic medical education and training should be approved for a period of five years under the terms of Section 88(2)(a)(i)(I) of the Act.

Evidence from candidates' scripts under previous examination arrangements indicated that some parts of the course were not being addressed in teaching and learning.  The removal of choice in the examinations from 2003 sought to ensure that the whole course was studied.

Given the inter-relatedness of the various syllabus strands and the requirement for students to integrate knowledge and skills from across the syllabus when solving problems &ndash; of a mathematical nature, as well as problems set in both familiar and unfamiliar contexts &ndash; it is important that all topics on the course are studied by all students, regardless of syllabus level.

However, this does not mean that small schools can stand still or never have their staffing levels changed to something that is more affordable and sustainable.  All public servants are being asked to do more with less and the teachers in our small schools cannot be exempt from this requirement.  As part of the Budget 2012 decisions, the number of pupils required to gain and retain a classroom teaching post in small primary schools was gradually increased between September 2012 and September 2014.

The remaining 20% will be re-distributed to provide top-up funding to certain local authorities that have lower property tax bases due to the variance in property values across the State.  Local Property Tax was introduced to provide an alternative, stable and sustainable funding base for the local authority sector, providing greater levels of connection between local revenue raising and associated expenditure decisions.  Given that local authorities vary significantly from one another in terms of size, population, public service demands, infrastructure and income sources, the Government has decided that no local authority will receive less income from LPT in 2015 than they received for General Purpose Grants (GPGs) from the Local Government Fund in 2014.  Certain local authorities, with stronger property bases, will receive greater levels of funding from local retention of LPT in 2015 than they received from the Local Government Fund in 2014.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has decided that these latter local authorities will use this surplus funding in two ways, with a portion available for their own discretionary purposes and the remainder, if any, to fund some local services in the Housing and Roads areas for which they currently receive Central Government funding.  The portion that will be retained for discretionary purposes by these authorities will be an amount equal to 20% of the total expected LPT income in the relevant local authority area (before any decision to vary rates) or, in the case where that surplus will be less than 20%, the full amount.<\/p>  <p>  Accordingly, 10 local authorities will receive higher levels of LPT income in 2015 compared to GPG funding in 2014 that will enable them to fund local services of up to &euro;131.7m in the Housing and &euro;21.7m in the Roads areas, respectively, and, therefore, free up some Central Government funding for other purposes. Those local authorities are - Clare, Cork County, D&uacute;n Laoghaire Rathdown, Dublin City, Fingal, Galway City, Kildare, Meath, South Dublin and Wicklow.  I have advised all local authorities of their individual provisional LPT allocations, totalling &euro;458.9m, for 2015, of which up to &euro;153.4m is ring fenced to fund   local services in the Housing and Roads areas by the 10 local authorities as outlined above.  Further details in relation to the specific obligations that my Department will seek to be satisfied from these self-funding levels in the Housing area will be provided as part of the overall Housing grant allocations process for 2015, which will be completed in due course.  It is a matter for the individual local authorities to decide how to spend the remaining &euro;305.5m,   in the context of the annual budgetary process having regard to both locally identified needs and available resources.<\/p>  <p>  The decision to allow local authorities to retain 80% of LPT locally and the power to vary LPT rates will facilitate further implementation of the overall objective of the local government reform programme, which is to achieve greater devolution to the local government sector, through supporting enhanced local decision making on spending priorities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021000077#WRZ00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Commercial Rates Valuation Process","counter":1220,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021000077#WRZ00500"},{"type":"question","counter":1221,"qnumday":562,"qnumall":"[5554\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021000077#WRZ00600","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"his views on setting up an expert group to examine ways to rebalance and update the commercial rate structure, to make it fairer.","asker":"968","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":1222,"content":"<p>Local authorities are under a statutory obligation to levy rates on any property used for commercial purposes in accordance with the details entered in the valuation lists prepared by the independent Commissioner of Valuation under the Valuation Act 2001.  The Commissioner of Valuation has sole responsibility for all valuation matters, including the method of valuation.  The Valuation Act 2001 comes under the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p>  <p>  The annual rate on valuation (ARV), which is applied to the valuation for each property determined by the Valuation Office to obtain the amount payable in rates, is decided by the elected members of each local authority in the annual budget and its determination is a reserved function.<\/p>  <p>  The Commissioner of Valuation, who has sole responsibility for all valuation matters, is conducting a programme of revaluation of all commercial and industrial properties throughout the State on a county by county basis.  The national revaluation programme is the first general valuation since the middle of the 19th century, and it is a significant undertaking.    If there is to be a fair distribution of the rates burden then valuation should be based on modern rental values.<\/p>  <p>  I am informed by my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, that, following the completion of the revaluation of the four local authority areas in Dublin, the three former local authorities in Waterford and the revaluation of Limerick, over 48,000 properties have been revalued.  While this represents in excess of 33% of all rateable properties, it constitutes about 57% of the valuation base for levying rates.  The Valuation Act 2001 provides that the valuation be carried out on a rolling basis.  This means that each rating authority area will be separately valued as part of a planned sequential valuation of the whole country.  The sequence is decided by the Commissioner of Valuation, who is independent in carrying out his function.  Valuation Orders for the revaluation of further Local Authority areas are expected to be made by the Commissioner in the near future.<\/p>  <p>  The Valuation (Amendment) (No.2) Bill 2012, which was initiated in the Seanad, was passed by that House on 20th November 2014 and   is scheduled to be introduced in the D&aacute;il shortly.  The primary purpose of the Bill is to introduce measures that will enable the Commissioner of Valuation to accelerate the national programme of revaluation of all commercial and industrial properties across the State.

individual borrowers between 1982 and May 1986.  The Housing Finance Agency (HFA) advanced the associated funds to local authorities.<br\/><br\/>A total of &euro;403 m was advanced by local authorities under the pre - May 1986 income-related loan scheme for 15,571 mortgages.  On 30 June 2014, 286 \u00a0of these loans were still outstanding with a corresponding total loan balance of &euro;10.5 m (i.e. an average loan amount of less than &euro;37,000).  Current interest rates are as listed in Schedule 1 A and 1 B of Circular HFA 236 which can be found on the HFA website at: <font color=\"#1F497D\">.<\/font><br\/><br\/>Overall, the Scheme has successfully funded over 15,000 homes for families who would, otherwise, not have obtained a house loan.  No new loans have issued under this Scheme since 1986 and there are no plans to alter this position. Individual local authorities administer the Scheme and deal directly with borrowers.<br\/><br\/>As with all local authority mortgages, evidence of having been refused a loan by two financial institutions was necessary in order to apply under the Scheme. Less than 2% of borrowers under the Scheme have outstanding loans.  In some pre-May 1986 loan cases, the income related repayment did not fully cover the interest charges on the loan and, as a result, the loan values appreciated.  The outstanding loan balance, in most cases, relates to a property whose value greatly exceeds the outstanding debt.<br\/><br\/>Since the extension of the Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) Scheme to pre-May 1986 income-related loans in 1996, a borrower availing of SWA who has a loan balance that has increased since the time of advance can have the interest on the increased portion of the loan, less any arrears, provided for by the HFA.  The interest on the original advance amount is covered by the SWA scheme through the Department of Social Protection, subject to borrower eligibility.This arrangement operates through local authorities.<br\/><br\/>To assist local authority borrowers in financial distress, my Department issued revised guidelines to local authorities for dealing with mortgage arrears within the local authority sector in June 2014.  <i>Dealing with Mortgage Arrears &ndash; A Guide for Local Authorities<\/i>is available on my Department&rsquo;s website by clicking on the following link:<br\/><br\/>.<br\/><br\/>The Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP), already in place in respect of commercial mortgages, is now being implemented across all local authorities.  In cases of acute mortgage distress, homeowners also have the option of seeking to avail of the legal process now also in place to deal with personal insolvency.  The most important step any family in arrears can take is to engage early with the Arrears Support Unit of the local authority.  Solutions are available and advice should be sought as early as possible.<br\/><br\/>In addition, the Local Authority Mortgage to Rent (LAMTR) scheme was rolled out nationally in February 2014.  The Scheme allows local authorities to offer the mortgage to rent scheme to local authority mortgage holders with unsustainable mortgages.  This enables families to stay in their home and their established community.  Surrendering the ownership equity in a home is a very difficult decision for a family; however, the mortgage to rent option does provide families with stability and continuity, after an often long period of financial turmoil.  Ownership of the home transfers to the local authority and the family pays a differential rent.  LAMTR is just one of a range of short term and long term solutions available to local authority mortgage holders in arrears.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021000077#WRZ04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Water and Sewerage Schemes Provision","counter":1256,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021000077#WRZ04100"},{"type":"question","counter":1257,"qnumday":574,"qnumall":"[5564\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021000077#WRZ04200","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the number of contracts which were put out to tender by the local authorities in 2011, 2012 and 2013 for water services, that is for waste water treatment, water treatment, bore holes, pumping stations and so on; if he will provide a breakdown of these figures per each individual local authority; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1198","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":1258,"content":"<p>The <i>Water Services Investment Programme 2010 &ndash; 2013<\/i>, which is available in the Oireachtas Library, lists the water services schemes and contracts that were to be progressed under the programme.

as it is commonly known) was first introduced in Dublin in 1990 in response to severe episodes of winter smog that resulted from the widespread use of smoky coal for residential heating.  The ban proved very effective in reducing particulate matter and sulphur dioxide levels in Dublin.  As well as bringing air quality levels into compliance with the then EU standards, the ban also had the effect of significantly improving human health in the capital. Research indicated that the ban in Dublin has resulted in over 350 fewer annual deaths.  The ban was subsequently extended to other urban areas.<\/p>  <p>   In August 2012, following a public consultation process, new solid fuel regulations were introduced with the aim of ensuring that the smoky coal ban remains fit for purpose in safeguarding air quality by limiting harmful emissions of air pollutants arising from the use of certain residential solid fuels.  The ban now applies in 26 urban areas nationwide, including all Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) designated towns for the purpose of air quality management under the EU Cleaner Air for Europe Directive 2008\/50\/EC.   <\/p>  <p>  The ban has not previously been applied in Midleton, as it is not an EPA designated urban air quality management zone.  However, the local authorities may at any time write to me to propose new towns for consideration for inclusion under the ban, if it is considered necessary to protect local air quality.  It is suggested that, if a local authority is considering such a proposal, then this should first be debated as a Council motion and subject to a period of local consultation.  This was the approach taken in relation to the recent consolidation of ban area boundaries in Celbridge\/Maynooth and Wexford. <\/p>  <p>  Air quality monitoring by the EPA has indicated that air quality is poorer in towns where the smoky coal ban does not apply, although smaller smoky coal ban areas may be more difficult to enforce.  The further extension of the ban to smaller towns on an individual basis may not be the most effective solution to addressing the problem of emissions from residential solid fuel use in these areas.  However, it is recognised that having different regulations between urban and rural locations is not ideal, as it results in different levels of environmental protection and clean air benefits for citizens in different locations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021000077#WRZ04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1262,"content":"<p>Question No. 576 answered with Question No. 564.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rural Development Policy","counter":1263,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021000077#WRZ04800"},{"type":"question","counter":1264,"qnumday":577,"qnumall":"[5656\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021000077#WRZ04900","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will provide a long-term strategic plan for rural economic development; the number of rural enterprises that have been set-up in 2014 and a breakdown per county; if he will provide an update on the establishment of a rural innovation and development fund; if he will provide an update on any pilot community-based broadband initiatives to provide adequate provision of next generation broadband services to rural areas; the future funding allocations and provisions per county, in tabular form, for community enterprise centres; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

In relation to the Rural Innovation and Development fund, which the Deputy refers to, an amount of &euro;1 million has been allocated for this purpose in 2015 and I am currently examining ways to distribute this funding in order to maximise its impact at local level.<br\/><br\/>A number of the recommendations contained in the CEDRA report relate to the provision of broadband infrastructure in rural areas and form part of the work programme of the IDG.  The Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources is represented on the IDG and I am advised that the Department has recently launched a new website entitled , which sets out the importance of all citizens having access to high speed broadband no matter where they live or work.  The national broadband plan , which is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, is an ambitious initiative that will take time to implement but I am confident will deliver for rural areas.<br\/><br\/>The LEADER element of the Rural Development Programme (RDP) 2007-2013 which falls under my Department&rsquo;s remit did provide support to both new and already established enterprise in rural areas.

LEADER has also provided support in the past to Community Enterprise Centers in the context of the requirement for such centers having been identified in the needs analysis of the area concerned.  As LEADER is a community led approach to development there are no allocations specifically for community enterprise centres; however, they are eligible for funding if the need for them is identified by the community concerned.  LEADER is not the only avenue for funding to rural enterprise related activity, and in this context the information above should be supplemented by information from other relevant Departments.<br\/><br\/>It should be noted that support for rural enterprise development will also be available through the LEADER elements of RDP 2014-2020 where a total of &euro;250 million euro will be available over the next 5-6 years to support the development of sustainable rural communities.  LEADER is delivered through the medium of Local Development Strategies (LDS) by Local Action Groups and I hope to be in a position to launch the selection process for LDSs very shortly, with a view to having strategies operational towards the end of 2015.<br\/><br\/>The resources available through the LEADER elements of the RDP are critical to the future economic development of rural Ireland.  However, it is also essential to ensure that these resources are working in a complementary way at a local level.

The implementation of the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) is a key Government priority and a major pillar of the Social Housing Strategy 2020.  The HAP scheme will bring all social housing supports provided by the State under the aegis of local authorities.  The scheme will remove a barrier to employment by allowing recipients to remain in the scheme if they gain full-time employment. HAP will also improve regulation of the rented accommodation being supported and provide certainty for landlords as regards their rental income.<\/p>  <p>  The statutory pilot phase of HAP commenced in September 2014 and is now in effect in 7 local authority areas, which are Limerick City and County, Waterford City and County, Cork County, Louth, Kilkenny, South Dublin and Monaghan.  Some 800 households are in receipt of HAP at present across these 7 local authority areas.  Dublin City Council is also part of the statutory HAP pilot with a specific focus on accommodating homeless households, as provided for in the Action Plan to Address Homelessness.  Dublin City Council is implementing the HAP pilot for homeless households in the Dublin region on behalf of all 4 Dublin local authorities.<\/p>  <p>  Section 43(2)(a) of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014 provides for the making of Regulations to prescribe the maximum rent limits for different household classes that will apply in each local authority where HAP has been commenced.

These limits are based on the current rent supplement limits as set out by the Department of Social Protection, in advance of the introduction of a national differential rents framework for local authorities, as provided for under section 31 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, later this year.  I understand that the Department of Social Protection is currently finalising a review of maximum rent limits.<\/p>  <p>  There is evidence of a growing pressure on rents in the lower segment of the market in some high demand areas.

Firstly, environmental noise must be assessed through the preparation of strategic noise maps for areas and infrastructure falling within defined criteria.  This is undertaken by prescribed noise mapping bodies, which includes Dublin Airport Authority (DAA) and local authorities.  Secondly, based on the results of the mapping process, the Regulations require the preparation of noise action plans for each area concerned, which is undertaken by the relevant local authority, the prescribed noise action planning body.  The fundamental objective of action plans is the prevention and reduction of environmental noise.<br\/><br\/>The Regulations require the review and revision of strategic noise maps and noise action plans on a five year cycle.  A new round of noise mapping was conducted during 2012.  Following the noise mapping exercise, the four Dublin local authorities prepared a new Noise Action Plan for the period 2013 &ndash; 2018.  This plan sets out an approach to the strategic management and control of environmental noise.  The plan is available on the Dublin City Council website at the following link - <br\/><br\/>.<br\/><br\/>The most recent noise mapping exercise found that 200 people are exposed to undesirable night-time levels above 55 dB(A) from aircraft using Dublin Airport.  As compared to the previous mapping exercise in 2007, there has been an overall reduction in the number of people exposed to undesirable night-time noise levels.<br\/><br\/>In 2008, Dublin Airport Stakeholders Forum set up an Environmental Working Group that works closely with Fingal County Council.  This group provides an effective forum for the discussion of all environment matters concerning the development and operation of the airport that have an impact on users, customers of the airport and on people living and working in the surrounding communities.<br\/><br\/>The management of noise abatement of operational procedures at Dublin Airport is shared by the airport operator, the DAA, and the airlines operating at the airport.  Under the European Communities (Air Navigation and Transport Rules and Procedures for Noise Related Operating Restrictions at Airports) Regulations 2003, the Irish Aviation Authority has the responsibility of ensuring that the airport operator has in place a system of noise monitoring. <br\/><br\/>I am informed by my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, that, in recognition of its responsibilities in this area, the DAA has introduced, and continues to evaluate, a number of initiatives to monitor aircraft noise levels and to mitigate their impact.

It is designed to compensate electricity suppliers for the additional costs they incur by purchasing electricity generated by these producers.  The PSO levy is also vital to enable Ireland to meet its 2020 40% target for electricity generated from renewable sources by 2020, which in turn is important for the achievement of Ireland's 16% EU 2020 target for renewable energy.  <\/p>  <p>  The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) determines the PSO levy which is a charge on all electricity customers without exception.  The legal basis for the PSO levy and its method of calculation are set out in Regulations made under the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 (S.I. 217 of 2002).  The annual PSO levy amount for 2014\/2015 is &euro;335.4 million.  This equates to &euro;64.37 per annum for residential customers, &euro;221.66 per annum for small to medium sized business customers and &euro;34.20\/kVA for medium and large customers.<\/p>  <p>  The biggest driver for the levy rise for this year is the lower predicted wholesale market electricity price, which is estimated to be around 10% lower than last year.  This results in lower predicted market income for the PSO plants and, therefore, a higher levy is required to cover their allowed costs.  The lower wholesale electricity price is currently being driven by lower international gas prices in evidence since mid-2013.  This drives up the proposed PSO levy.  However, if these lower gas and wholesale prices are sustained, the lower wholesale prices would reduce the wholesale cost of electricity that suppliers pay.  In turn, suppliers would be in a position to reduce their retail prices and potentially offset the PSO levy increase.  Increased competition in the retail electricity has led to some suppliers reducing their retail prices.  The CER is tasked with retail market monitoring and executes this role vigorously to ensure competition leads to the fairest prices for customers.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021000079#WRBB02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Telecommunications Infrastructure","counter":1358,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021000079#WRBB02650"},{"type":"question","counter":1359,"qnumday":612,"qnumall":"[5956\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021000079#WRBB02700","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if he will provide a guarantee for the extension of the fibre optic cable (details supplied) from Ballinaboy, County Roscommon to Belmullet, County Mayo.

As part of this overall programme, the Department of Education and Skills is planning a number of specific events to mark the centenary of 2016 across primary, post-primary and third level sectors.<br\/><br\/>It is very important to me that the arts are made more accessible. Immersing school students in the arts through a targeted strategy will benefit future generations and give young people a greater understanding and appreciation of the arts as they progress to adulthood.  I have met my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, on a number of occasions to discuss the Arts in Education Charter.  The Arts in Education Implementation Group has been proactive in meeting many organisations from both the arts and education sectors and progressing a number of initiatives. Of particular interest is the current development of a portal, which will form a key communications and information channel for both the education and arts sectors. <br\/><br\/>The National Cultural Institutions include a diverse range of cultural institutions and agencies, which are involved in a wide number of initiatives with a view to engaging with a wide range of stakeholders, including schools, both primary and post-primary.Each of these cultural institutions has a range of education initiatives, including exhibitions, events and school outreach programmes, through which  schools can explore and engage in our rich cultural heritage.<br\/><br\/>Another important priority for me is to deliver Ireland's first national cultural policy. Last June, the Government agreed to the drafting of a national cultural policy - <i>Culture 2025<\/i>&ndash; which will set out high-level policy for the period up to 2025. I intend to initiate a wide-scale consultation process shortly to ensure all interest groups, including the education sector, can make their views known.<br\/><br\/>There are many other ways in which my Department is supporting arts, cultural and heritage initiatives in conjunction with local groups and communities including schools. These include:<br\/><br\/>- The St. Patrick's Day celebrations;<br\/><br\/>- Culture Night;<br\/><br\/>- The Heritage in Schools scheme, one of many heritage programmes of the Heritage Council, which is supported by funding from my Department.<br\/><br\/>- The Archaeology in the Classroom initiative.<br\/><br\/>- The National Architects-in-Schools Initiative, funded by my Department under the Government Policy on Architecture 2009-2015.  <br\/><br\/>- Funding Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann for the promotion of the Irish traditional arts;<br\/><br\/>- The development of web-based projects by my Department and others to promote greater appreciation and understanding of Ireland's culture and heritage for schools; and<br\/><br\/>- Funding by my Department to support the work of National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals (NAPD) in developing <i>Creative Engagement<\/i>an arts and culture programme in post primary schools.<br\/><br\/>Details on many of the events surrounding these initiatives are available to view on <i>Culturefox,<\/i>the free online arts events guide developed by the Arts Council.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021000082#WREE01500","answer":true,"speaker":"973"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Film Industry Promotion","counter":1493,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021000082#WREE01550"},{"type":"question","counter":1494,"qnumday":658,"qnumall":"[6080\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021000082#WREE01600","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the extent to which she expects this country to be used as a film location in the current year; the extent to which she expects new enquiries from overseas in this regard; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"973"},{"type":"question","counter":1495,"qnumday":662,"qnumall":"[6084\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021000082#WREE01700","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the number of films in respect of which this country was used as a film location in each of the past five years to date; her expectations in this regard for the future; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"973"},{"type":"speech","counter":1496,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 658 and 662 together.<br\/><br\/>Primary responsibility for the support and promotion of film-making in Ireland, in respect of both the indigenous sector and inward productions, is the responsibility of the Irish Film Board (IFB).
