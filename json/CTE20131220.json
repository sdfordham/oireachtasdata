This committee is the appropriate forum for us to address these issues and to be subject to public scrutiny, as is appropriate.  The chairman and I intend to be as open as possible this morning.  However, we have been strongly advised not to say anything that could prejudice the outcome of investigations under way by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Our comments today are made in the context of that advice.<\/p><p>  This week NAMA has been the focus of some very serious allegations, yet those making and circulating the allegations have made no attempt to address them directly to us.  I will outline to the committee the facts as they are known to me but I am somewhat at a disadvantage in that some members of the Oireachtas may have more information on the allegations than we have.  Last weekend, NAMA was informed by a journalist that allegations of purported wrongdoing involving NAMA were in circulation.  The journalist did not provide NAMA with any specific information which would enable us to investigate the claims further.  Since then, we have read in certain media outlets of a number of apparently serious but unsubstantiated allegations about NAMA which are in circulation.  We have also learned that a number of Deputies and Senators have been provided with documents which apparently have been circulated on a phased, drip-feed basis and which apparently purport to show evidence of wrongdoing in NAMA.  There has been a carefully orchestrated operation targeted at a small number of media outlets and Oireachtas Members and its intended purpose is clear: to damage NAMA and thereby undermine the financial interests of the State.<\/p><p>  As I mentioned, for all the extensive press coverage, NAMA was not given access to the detail of the allegations.  For that reason, it was not possible for NAMA to comment on them.  Only late on Wednesday evening, 18 December, did NAMA become aware of certain allegations.  NAMA understands that these new allegations have been made by an ex-employee, Mr. Enda Farrell, who is the subject of investigation by the Garda bureau of fraud investigation, GBFI, following a referral to it by NAMA in September 2012.  NAMA understands that the allegations being made by Mr. Farrell have been circulated to certain Members of the Oireachtas and to certain media outlets.  NAMA also understands that among the documents circulated were documents which were provided by NAMA during the legal discovery process as part of English High Court litigation in 2012.<\/p><p>  Regarding the allegations of which it has become aware, NAMA is satisfied that they are unfounded.  If they are submitted to us formally and in sufficient detail, I assure the committee that we will deal with them individually and robustly.  We have no tolerance for misdemeanour or any form of wrongdoing.  It is not clear to me who owns the various documents which are currently swirling about and therefore I am not sure whose responsibility it is to submit them to NAMA.  Under section 19 of the Criminal Justice Act 2011 there is a legal obligation on persons having evidence of any impropriety to bring it to the immediate attention of the Garda.  Some of the allegations that have been advised to us seem to revolve around personal grievances of Mr. Farrell.  Others appear to be the personal views of Mr. Farrell on various organisational matters on which he would not have a complete perspective nor could he expected to have, given the position he held.  We understand that Mr. Farrell has now made a claim of unauthorised disclosure by him.  He apparently alleges that he provided a so-called \"full file\" of personal information relating to Mr. Patrick McKillen to a particular third party.  This new disclosure by Mr. Farrell directly contradicts his previous sworn statements.<\/p><p>  NAMA, over the last 36 hours, requested its own internal auditors to review all electronic communications between Mr. Farrell and this third party.  There is no evidence from the search to date that any information relating to Mr. McKillen was transmitted electronically.  With regard to this so-called \"full file\", NAMA has very little information relating to Mr. McKillen.  Financial information would ordinarily be expected to include sworn statements of affairs, lists of unencumbered assets, borrowings with non-NAMA institutions and so on.  NAMA has never possessed this information about Mr. McKillen because, as the committee will be aware, NAMA's board took a decision in July 2011 not to acquire Mr. McKillen&rsquo;s loans.  Such information is usually provided as part of a debtor&rsquo;s business plan submission and in this case, as we did not acquire the loans, no business plan was submitted.<\/p><p>  Before I move on from the allegations regarding disclosure of information, a second case was referred to the Garda by NAMA in February of this year.  It relates to a complaint made to NAMA of a possible unauthorised disclosure of a single document by another ex-employee.  The matter was brought to NAMA&rsquo;s attention shortly after the employee left NAMA and it was immediately referred to the Garda.  No electronic record exists of the transmission of this document.  NAMA provided further information requested by GBFI in July of this year and we understand the investigation is ongoing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013122000003#B01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan McDonagh","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1387537800,"counter":20,"content":"<p>On behalf of the NAMA board, I thank the committee for agreeing to our request to address it this morning and deal publicly with the allegations levelled against the agency.

The Department is responsible for ongoing monitoring of NAMA's performance.  As part of the checks and balances, a robust series of financial information must be prepared and delivered to the Minister in advance of presentation to the Oireachtas.  Therefore, staff in the Department participate in a review of that information and, if required, have conversations with Mr. McDonagh and his team in respect of clarifications required in the giving of advice to the Minister to whom the NAMA board and CEO directly report.<\/p><p>  On the freedom of information request commentary, the Department finds itself in a difficult position with respect to the documentation concerned.  First, as I recall it, reference was made to 19 documents.  It was stated the Department had refused to release 13 of these documents, three of which were already in the public domain by way of responses to parliamentary questions.  I am happy to answer further questions in that regard for those who do not have copies of the replies in their possession.  The other documentation relates to a number of offers received by the Department from parties with respect to loans, in which one particular individual had an interest.  These offers were considered by the officer with responsibility in this area to be commercially sensitive.  Following the procedure of the Freedom of Information Act is essential in the interests of protecting the Department.  If we do not follow this procedure correctly, we do not have the ability to protect the Department from civil and criminal liability for unauthorised disclosure of documentation.  <\/p><p>  The series of documentation requested falls into a number of categories, some of which contain specific descriptions of offers made in respect of assets held at the time by the IBRC or contain email exchanges between officials in the Department relating to these offers.  A key ingredient of whether documentation can be disclosed is that of commercial sensitivity.  It is certainly the case that with the passage of time what was sensitive information at the time of the freedom of information request may well not be so in the future.  In that sense, it is welcome that these documents have been submitted to the commissioner for urgent adjudication on whether they are still commercially sensitive.  The committee may recall that the FOI requests were made prior to the liquidation of the IBRC and, therefore, the scenarios being used to determine such sensitivity are different than they are today.  The departmental officials are happy to engage in a conversation on what information is now less sensitive and could be released.  Although some may be less sensitive now than previously, I cannot release the documentation because to do so would not be in accordance with the Act and would, in my view, expose the Department to an unnecessary risk of litigation by parties who might describe disclosure of that information as being inappropriate.  It would be helpful if in the fullness of time these documents were disclosed as I believe the information therein would get to the basis of the allegations made against the Department in regard to the reason these conversations were taking place and would explain the reason my officials felt it was absolutely necessary for them to do what they were doing in the interests of protecting the taxpayer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013122000005#D00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Moran"},{"type":"speech","time":1387538400,"counter":28,"content":"<p>Does Mr. Moran believe those documents might me helpful in the work of the Committee of Public Accounts on this issue and will he clarify the suggestion there was inappropriate contact by him with people wishing to purchase properties?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013122000005#D00800","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1387538400,"counter":29,"content":"<p>I am happy to comment on that issue.

The flavour of the allegations consists of questions about whether NAMA systematically undervalued loans and manipulated the price it paid banks for bad loans that staff were encouraged to deliberately undervalue.  Some of the other allegations are that former employees of NAMA - I will not mention anybody - said publicly that they were among many people in NAMA to undervalue loans, meaning that many were doing this.  One claim by a Member of the Oireachtas was that NAMA sold performing loans at a discounted rate to preferred bidders and that leaking of information was common.  A key part of Mr. McDonagh's statement for me is that the person who was at the centre of these allegations had, in Mr. McDonagh's words, \"no valuation role whatsoever\".  Effectively, he is saying that not only did it not happen, it could not happen, because that person had an administrative role and not a key role in respect of the valuation process.  Perhaps he would deal with that.  That is the central matter given what Mr. McDonagh said in the statement and the allegations that have been made in the press over the last few days.  Not only did it not happen; it also could not happen.  I ask him to elaborate on that.<\/p><p>  Yesterday, I asked the Comptroller and Auditor General to give his opinion with regard to the reviews he has done in respect of loans and the valuations on those loans.  He provided a comprehensive answer and I will ask him to come back to the process he and his office undertook with regard to this and his knowledge about the reviews that were undertaken by people and offices other than himself and his office and in the European Commission and in Northern Ireland for the sake of clarity.  Perhaps Mr. McDonagh will comment on those allegations again, and I will then refer it to the Comptroller and Auditor General.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013122000006#E00500","speaker":"1091"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1387539000,"counter":35,"content":"<p>With regard to the valuation process, as I outlined in my statement, the first people who did the property valuations, which were a key input into the loan valuations, were the financial institutions.  They got their own valuers to value each of the properties.  They submitted these to NAMA and NAMA sent the valuations to a property firm on our panel.  That property firm, which was obviously different from the bank's firm, looked at the valuation and had to form an opinion on whether it agreed with the valuation and give the basis for the opinion, in accordance with the Red Book, which is the standards of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors.  If the firm agreed with it, as happened in 88% of cases, we accepted it.  If the firm disagreed with it, the next key step was taken.  We set up a process, which we agreed up-front with the European Commission, whereby if there was a dispute between a bank and NAMA where one valuation firm said 100, for example, and another valuation firm said 80, we would refer it to a third valuation firm to make a final determination.  Therefore, the bank's original valuation and our valuer's opinion were sent to the third valuation firm.  The third valuation firm had all the facts from both sides and it either agreed with the bank or with our original assessing valuation firm and gave its own opinion on what it thought the value of the property should be.  That was submitted to NAMA and accepted.  That fed into the loan valuation process and it was audited all along the stages.<\/p><p>  The reality is that this particular individual did a huge job under a great deal of pressure.  I must acknowledge that he worked very hard.  However, he was a recipient of the property valuations from the banks and he referred them to our valuation firms to review the valuations.  If there was a dispute, he referred it to the third independent valuation firm.  He was a key man in the processing of the information but neither he nor anybody else was involved in the valuation process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013122000006#E00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan McDonagh","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1387539600,"counter":37,"content":"<p>One thing worth bearing in mind is the background to the loan acquisition process.  When NAMA was set up, one of the key problems and one of the key objectives was to remove uncertainty about the value of loans in the banks, so that was in the background.  There was a sense that banks were overvaluing the loans they had on their books.  One of the objectives was to take them out of the banks, bring them into NAMA, clean up the thing and remove that uncertainty about the value in the banks.<\/p><p>  Mr. McDonagh has described the property valuation process exactly the way it was when we examined it.  When we came to this, we recognised that we would need independent assistance with the valuation and legal aspects of it - the due diligence process around title and so on in regard to properties.  We sought the assistance of the Valuation Office and a former Commissioner of Valuation for Northern Ireland.  That is why there is a reference to Northern Ireland in the report.  The former commissioner was acting on our behalf and was not acting in Northern Ireland or carrying out a separate exercise.  It was part of the process we undertook.<\/p><p>  We also brought in legal expertise to examine the legal process.  We approached it from the point of view of looking at the system of valuation and understanding the system in place.  As Mr. McDonagh has described, there was a long audit trial and several stages of assessment in that.  KPMG was there as a form of process auditor to confirm that all the steps set down in the process had been implemented in each valuation.  We examined that process to see if the control was working, and we found it was.<\/p><p>  Separately, and to provide further assurance in that regard, we examined samples of the valuations to see whether the process expected was actually carried out.  Our legal people looked at the due diligence in sample loans and were satisfied the processes followed the system described.<\/p><p>  Yesterday, I described the uplift that was added to the market valuation of individual properties.  Ultimately, as Mr. McDonagh said, it had to satisfy the European Commission that the process was appropriate and that there was not an undue element of state aid being paid to the banks as a result of the process.  As I understand it, the Commission has approved three tranches.  We examined the methodology it used and estimated that the element of state aid was about one fifth extra on top of the market value of the properties.

When Mr. McDonagh attended the committee in September, we spoke at length about the fact that one of the biggest deterrents to passing on information is the threat of prosecution under the Official Secrets Act as well as the NAMA legislation and contractual arrangements and so on.  It is fair to say many civil servants are covered by the Official Secrets Act, but most of these do not deal with billions of euro.  I accept that every mid-sized company runs the risk of an employee leaving and passing on information to a competitor.  NAMA is described as the largest property management company in the world, but its senior staff seem to be leaving in considerable numbers.  Mr. McDonagh gave the reasons he thinks that is the case the last day he appeared before the committee.  Some people are asking whether these staff members are being head-hunted for their experience or their information - essentially, being poached by people who might gain adverse advantage from this knowledge.<\/p><p>  I understand that under the National Asset Management Agency Act there is a lifetime prohibition on passing on information relating to the agency.  I have been a Member of the D&aacute;il for a while, however, and one has to ask how many civil servants have ever been prosecuted under the Official Secrets Act.  I am not aware of too many since the Act was promulgated in 1963.<\/p><p>  In the D&aacute;il earlier this week, I spoke about transparency in the planning process.  In my opinion, one of the problems we had in local authorities was that those adjudicating on one-off housing one day were adjudicating on developments worth tens of millions of euro the next.  In some cases, those individuals, character-wise, were unsuitable to be dealing with such planning permissions, which we found out to our cost.  I am not casting any aspersions whatsoever on NAMA staff but the question must be asked about the safeguards in place with regard to information that could be leaked.  <\/p><p>  At the last meeting, I remember Mr. McDonagh saying that the cooling-off period for people who left the agency would be extended from three to six months.  Does he have any concerns with regard to the safeguards, particularly considering the amounts of money involved and the risks and temptations that might emerge?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013122000007#F00700","speaker":"1091"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1387539600,"counter":43,"content":"<p>I have to be completely honest with the Deputy.

Access for staff is now confined and limited only to the information the individual needs to do his or her work day to day.  There is very limited access to widespread information.  There is also an extensive audit trail right across the whole IT system in respect of e-mails, documents and interventions.  It is even possible to trace documents that are printed back to the individual who printed them.  These are processes and systems that we continually improve.  Four years ago I could not have said our systems are as good as they are now.  We have worked on them and in my opinion they are now state of the art, but we are never satisfied with them.

To put this in context, NAMA as a financial entity has had an enormous impact on Ireland Inc.  Our role as a committee is to examine the use of taxpayers' money.  I note in his statement that Mr. Mc Donagh said that he and his colleagues built the organisation, but it was built with taxpayers' money.<\/p><p>  When NAMA was established, the level of discounts taken in respect of the individual banks was up to 60%.  The <i>Financial Times<\/i> ran an editorial at that time questioning whether one bank could bring down a country.  When the markets saw the level of discounts being applied in the case of Anglo Irish Bank, they determined that if that was replicated across the entire banking sector, Ireland would not be able to shoulder the burden and our bond yields shot up overnight.  That gave rise to the bailout.  It had a monumental impact.  The valuations put on the loans that went into NAMA had a monumental impact.<\/p><p>  I remember when the NAMA legislation was going through the D&aacute;il.  The two underlying principles were that NAMA would help to improve the balance sheets of the banks and would determine the long-term economic value of the loans rather than their market value.  In one way, I am surprised that 88% of the valuations of the banks stood up.  That is very high.  Why was that the case?  On average, what did the loan valuations end up being above the market value?  The issue of loan security was a major one at the time of the establishment of NAMA.  My understanding of the loans in NAMA was that they were to be given a long-term economic value as distinct from a market value.  As time went on, they veered increasingly towards market value.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013122000008#G02000","speaker":"1060","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1387540800,"counter":65,"content":"<p>Let me assure the Deputy that nobody knows that more than I.

The average discount across the five banks that transferred loans to NAMA was 57%.  The losses ranged across the banks from 44% up to 61%.  The Deputy is correct that there were losses of &euro;42 billion.  The reality is that NAMA did not create these losses.  They were created as a result of decisions on lending that were not sensible.  The banks overlent on assets as part of an asset bubble in the mid-2000s.  The markets had already decided that the banks had made losses and that it was just a question of quantifying them.  We were charged with taking certain loans from the banks and the evaluation process agreed with the European Commission ensured the banks had to apply a certain valuation standard to the assets.  That is the reason 88% of the valuations were accepted because they had met that standard.  Some 12% did not.  That proves there were checks and balances in the system.<\/p><p>  On long-term economic value, in a previous report the Comptroller and Auditor General estimated that if NAMA had not bought the assets from the banks - it paid &euro;32 billion for &euro;74 billion worth of loans - a market participant would only have paid &euro;26 billion.  The log-term economic value is the difference between &euro;32 billion and &euro;26 billion.  If the banks had sold on the loans to third party private equity firms, they would probably have only received &euro;26 billion at most.  That is the quantification of the long-term economic value.  Again, an EU process determined this for state aid purposes and it is subject to rigorous audit.<\/p><p>  On the question of a debtor being able to buy back his or her loans from NAMA, there is a specific provision in the NAMA legislation, section 172, which prevents NAMA from selling an asset back to a defaulting debtor.  If a debtor is not servicing the principal and interest on his or her loans in full, he cannot buy them back.  We are legally prohibited from selling to him or her.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013122000009#H00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan McDonagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1387540800,"counter":68,"content":"<p>What controls are in place to prevent an individual from going to NAMA, purporting to act for himself or herself, to buy the loan and subsequently selling it on to the previous debtor?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013122000009#H00500","speaker":"1060"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1387540800,"counter":69,"content":"<p>The board of NAMA has put in place a legal declaration whereby a purchaser of assets has to complete a section 172 declaration that he or she is in compliance with the law of the land.

The answer is in our statements.  It is because of events that occurred in the past week in particular.  There was the media commentary and then people were saying to us there was a dossier about NAMA in the media, which had been given to some Members of the Oireachtas and some members of the public and that it contained all sorts of allegations.  Principally, it comes down to two sets of allegations, one of which was the valuations issue.  That was a very serious issue so far as we were concerned because it was designed to undermine totally the credibility of the organisation.  As we have gone into the valuation of the loans in detail earlier today I will not repeat it.  Any suggestion left unchallenged and unchecked that NAMA had manipulated the valuations would have been a very serious issue for everybody in the organisation, for the board, for me as chairman and for Mr. Brendan McDonagh as CEO.  That was one issue we wanted to get the opportunity to speak about.  We did not want to just issue a statement and we did not want to hold a press conference.  We thought the Committee of Public Accounts was the appropriate forum in which to address the issue.  We also wanted to address the issue of the so-called leaking of information of which, when one strips away much of the verbiage and repetition, there have been only two instances in our four-year history in which we have reported individuals to the Garda for a breach of that legislation.  That is under active investigation.<\/p><p>  I will make the point I made earlier.  We seem to be one of the few groups in Dublin that has not had seen this dossier or whatever it is.  There are other allegations in it, all of which seem to stem from Mr. Farrell, an individual whom NAMA reported to the Garda and who is being investigated for a criminal offence.  We did think it extraordinary that nobody was questioning the source of all of that misinformation.  We owed it to the taxpayers.  We had a discussion earlier during which it was stated that the taxpayers own NAMA.  We work for the taxpayer.  We had a discussion at the board yesterday and we felt that taxpayers need to understand and to have confidence in the organisation.  They may not agree with every decision we make but they need to have confidence in the integrity and the propriety within the organisation.  We owed it to our staff, the 300 people working in NAMA.<\/p><p>  Again, I refer to the point I made in my opening statement.  By definition we are collecting money on behalf of the taxpayers and in doing that we are taking it from debtors.  Understandably, there are many people out there who do not like us.  The job that our staff do every day is very difficult.  It is stressful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013122000011#K02600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Daly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1387542600,"counter":147,"content":"<p>Mr. Daly refers to an orchestrated campaign being run against NAMA.

I go back to the questioning we have had internally.  What is the motive?  It must be in some way to undermine NAMA or perhaps indirectly try to influence our decision-making and intimidate us.  That is why the issue is very serious.  To return to Deputy O'Donnell's point, it is serious because NAMA is owned by the taxpayer and what the agency does has direct implications for taxpayers.

As the Deputy inferred, we have been over this ground at considerable length in earlier sessions.

I could go into all of the oversight relating to the Comptroller and Auditor General, etc., but I will no do so because it is there for the record.<\/p><p>  I understand that we will be subject to freedom of information requirements when the new legislation is passed.  We have never objected to being accountable to this committee or anybody else.  In fact, our annual report contains a plethora of information about the organisation.  The one area where we have sensitivities is that which relates to commercial information.  This goes to the heart of what we are, namely, a State body which is working on behalf of taxpayers but which is operating in the commercial arena.  We need to do the best we possibly can and very often the debate regarding freedom of information and lack of transparency seems to return to matters relating to loans and debtors.  We are asked, for example, what we paid for loans, their value, who were the debtors involved and  to whom we sold the loans and at what price.  In the past I have pointed out that there is a need for a reality check in respect of a commercial organisation operating in the commercial arena.  We cannot put our cards on the table and indicate what we paid for individual loans or assets we are trying to sell.  If we did so, we would be telling people about our pricing.
