Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth and the availability of productive employment for young people.  This strategy has been succeeding; by the third quarter of 2016 the number of people in employment was up by 200,000 from the lowest level reached in 2012.  The youth unemployment rate has fallen from 31.1% in July 2012 to 13.5% in January 2017.  The actual number of young unemployed has fallen from 70,000 to 27,500 over this period.  Having being far above typical EU levels, Irish youth unemployment is now significantly below the EU average &ndash; which was 18.6% at the end of 2016.<\/p>  <p>  Policies to reduce youth unemployment, framed in the context of the EU Recommendation on a Youth Guarantee, concentrate assistance to young people in finding and securing sustainable jobs.  To this end there is monthly engagement by case officers with all young unemployed to facilitate their return to employment.  For those who do not find employment, additional offers are provided for.  Most such offers (over 70%) are in further education or training.  Others are in community-based employment programmes such as CE, Gateway and Tus, or through the JobsPlus employment subsidy for private employment. <\/p>  <p>  Places on most of these programmes are demand led, and take-up by young people has fallen in line with the substantial fall in youth unemployment.  The number of young people entering the programmes was 23,000 in 2014 and 19,000 in 2015.  Final figures for 2016 are not yet available, but are expected to show a further fall on the 2015 level. <\/p>  <p>  I am confident that the measures taken under the Youth Guarantee, together with the continuing economic recovery, will support further reductions in youth unemployment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100056#WRA00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":10,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 32 to 38, inclusive, answered orally.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Benefits Reviews","counter":11,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100056#WRA00850"},{"type":"question","counter":12,"qnumday":39,"qnumall":"[8478\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100056#WRA00900","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the status of the review being carried out on the effects that cuts to relevant social protection payments have had on seasonal workers in counties such as Donegal; when the review is likely to be completed and published; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1366","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":13,"content":"<p>During the D&aacute;il report stage debate on the Social Welfare Bill 2016, I agreed that I would ask my officials to examine the issue of jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit and the treatment of part-time and seasonal workers, including those categorised as having subsidiary employment.

Expenditure on pensions is approximately &euro;7 billion per annum.  Due to demographic changes, my Department&rsquo;s spending on older people is increasing year on year at an approximate rate of &euro;1 billion every 5 years.  Maintaining the rate of the State pension and other payments is critical in protecting people from poverty. <\/p>  <p>  It is estimated that reverting the contributory pension rate bands, to the percentages effective from 2000-2012, would cost &euro;60 million next year, and this annual cost would rise at a rate of approximately &euro;10 million per annum.  If such a change was introduced, it would mainly benefit pensioners with additional income above the State pension, and not those solely dependent upon it.  It would also significantly reduce the funds available for across-the-board pension increases, which were instead introduced in the 2016 and 2017 Budgets, and which benefit all pensioners, including the most vulnerable.  <\/p>  <p>  Reforms and increases in the pension age have safeguarded the pension system and its core rates, despite huge demographic pressures and the economic crisis.  By achieving this, even in such difficult circumstances, the Government has shown its commitment to supporting older people, as evidenced by CSO figures which show pensioners far less likely to experience consistent poverty than the general population.<\/p>  <p>  Where someone does not qualify for a full rate contributory pension, they may qualify for an alternative payment.  If their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension.

The scheme is generally available to people whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and do not have alternative accommodation available. Rent supplement is subject to a means test which is normally calculated to ensure that a person, after the payment of rent, has an income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) appropriate to their family circumstances less a minimum contribution which recipients are required to pay.  The standard weekly minimum contribution is &euro;30 for a single adult household and &euro;40 for coupled households. Many recipients pay more than this amount because recipients are required, subject to income disregards, to contribute any additional assessable means that they have over and above the appropriate SWA rate towards their accommodation costs.  As part of the means test, a capital assessment is completed which includes savings, investments, property and any monies realised following a settlement as outlined by the Deputy. The combination of the means test and awarding differentiated rates of payment is premised on ensuring that social welfare payments are paid to those most in need and reflects the position that persons with reasonable amounts of capital and property are in a position to use that resource to support themselves.

This has been due to volatility in the stock markets, increasing liabilities arising from the demographic pressures of increasing life expectancy, low interest rates, and regulatory requirements.  Essentially the cost of providing benefits has increased at a rate that has not been covered by the level of employer and employee contributions to pension schemes and the investment returns earned.  In addition, accountancy standards, which make pensions liabilities very apparent on a company's balance sheet, contribute to the pressures under which DB schemes are operating.  During the financial crisis the decline of such schemes accelerated to the extent that the whole sector was at risk.  At that stage a series of legislative amendments was brought forward to alleviate the situation.  Whilst a very significant number of DB schemes have closed in recent years, in most cases they are replaced by Defined Contribution (DC) schemes, generally by agreement between employer and employee representatives.  However, and for those in the workforce more generally who may find themselves without supplementary pension coverage, I have highlighted my support for the introduction of a new auto-enrolment based retirement savings system.  I believe such a system is necessary because the rate of supplementary pension coverage in Ireland, estimated at just 35% of private sector workers, has, for considerable time now, been lower than is needed.  If measures are not taken to address this low rate of coverage, many future retirees will suffer unwanted and potentially significant reductions in their living standards on reaching retirement.   Pensions reform will continue to be a key priority for my Department.  To this end, earlier this year, I confirmed an intention to develop, publish and commence the implementation of an Action Plan for the reform of pensions during 2017.  This Action Plan will include a road map for the reform of the State pension, reforms to improve the current  Defined Benefit and Defined Contribution pension landscape, transposition of the EU &lsquo;IORP&rsquo; Pensions Directive and the development of an auto-enrolment supplementary pension system for working people without coverage.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100057#WRB02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Benefits Data","counter":42,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100057#WRB02800"},{"type":"question","counter":43,"qnumday":50,"qnumall":"[8417\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100057#WRB02900","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the refusal rates for those applying for carer&rsquo;s allowance and disability allowance; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1252","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":44,"content":"<p>Carer's Allowance (CA) is a social assistance payment made to carers who are providing full-time care and attention to someone who has a disability such that they require that level of care.

The decision was communicated by the Board to all CIS and MABS Boards and to all staff on 15th   February 2017.  <\/p>  <p>  Under the new governance arrangements, the number of individual local CIS and MABS company boards will reduce from ninety three (93) to sixteen (16).  The new regional board structure will comprise eight (8) CIS boards and eight (8) MABS boards.  <\/p>  <p>  The restructured governance arrangements are being implemented at local company board level only.  The forthcoming changes in the service delivery partner company governance structure will bring the CIS and MABS organisations more into line with modern public service governance guidelines and requirements where significant State funding is involved.  <\/p>  <p>  A more streamlined governance structure will result in a more targeted use of valuable staff resources, re-directed to increased front line service delivery, made possible by reduction in the current significant administrative burden associated with maintaining ninety three (93) individual companies nationwide.   <\/p>  <p>  In 2017, CIB is set to receive State funding of &euro;54 million, of which &euro;15 million is allocated to CIS services, and &euro;24 million is allocated to the network of MABS services. <\/p>  <p>  Following on from the decision of the Board, a Restructuring Implementation Group is being set up to examine all aspects of implementing the new sixteen (16) board model.

As part of its free services, MABS provides help and advice to those in mortgage arrears.<\/p>  <p>   The role of MABS was expanded in 2015 with the establishment of a Dedicated Mortgage Arrears MABS service (DMA MABS) across the MABS network, to help people specifically with home mortgage arrears.  There are now 32 specialist DMA advisors working across 27 locations countrywide, assisting borrowers to assess the options available to them and, where required, negotiating with lenders on their behalf.  To date, the DMA service has helped almost 3,000 such borrowers.  <\/p>  <p>  Additionally, MABS provides a national network of court mentors who attend each listed repossession Court hearing countrywide.  The mentors provide support to distressed borrowers who are facing the loss of their home and signpost them to the appropriate services.  To date, over 1,300 borrowers have been referred onward to MABS advisors through the court mentor service.  <\/p>  <p>  In 2016, an additional initiative was announced by Government.  The scheme, known as Abhaile, further extends the free services already available to borrowers through the DMA MABS service and the court mentor service.   The new voucher based scheme, for which MABS is the gateway, provides access for people, who are insolvent and in home mortgage arrears, to defined levels of independent expert financial and\/or legal advice and assistance, free of charge.  Qualification for help under the scheme is based on the borrower being (a) in mortgage arrears on their home; (b) insolvent; (c) at risk of losing their home because of their mortgage arrears; and (d) reasonably accommodated. <\/p>  <p>  The new services are provided by professionals drawn from one or more panels of solicitors, personal insolvency practitioners or accountants.

Entitlement is banded, with the maximum rate payable to those with a yearly average of 48-52 contributions, and the minimum rate payable to those with a yearly average in the range of 10-14 contributions per year.  Even if someone has only 10 years (520 weeks) of paid reckonable contributions between their 16th and 66th birthdays, they would generally qualify for a State pension (contributory), although the rate payable would vary depending on their circumstances, and it will not always be their most advantageous payment to claim, particularly if they qualify for a full-rate State pension (non-contributory).<\/p>  <p>  The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme was introduced in 1994 to make qualification for State pension contributory (SPC) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  <\/p>  <p>  The scheme allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age, or incapacitated people, to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being calculated for pension purposes.  The effect of this is to reduce the number of years by which the person&rsquo;s contributions are divided, thereby increasing their yearly average, making it easier for them to qualify for a maximum rate SPC.  It does not involve the award of credits.  My Department reviews these and other provisions on an ongoing basis and has estimated that the cost of extending the Homemakers scheme to allow people to avail of the full 20 years currently allowed under the scheme, encompassing periods prior to 1994, could cost &euro;290m in 2017.  This figure would increase in subsequent years.<\/p>  <p>  When the Green Paper was published in 2007, the expenditure on the State pension (contributory) amounted to &euro;2.75 billion.  The authors were asked to estimate the cost of backdating Homemakers at that point, and in doing so, noted that <\/p>  <p>  &ldquo;it is extremely difficult to estimate with any degree of certainty what the likely impact of backdating will be. Accordingly, the following estimates are extremely tentative&rdquo;.<\/p>  <p>  While there are a number of challenges involved, perhaps most notable are (a) estimating the level of take-up by fathers, and (b) the likely movements from one scheme to another, e.g. current non-contributory pensioners who would as a result have a higher contributory pension entitlement instead, and the net cost to the State in such cases.<\/p>  <p>  The estimate arrived at in 2007 was &euro;160 million (with reduced costs where the backdating was limited), which amounted to 5.8% of State pension contributory expenditure.  The scheme did not apply to the State pension (transition), and has no impact upon the State pension (non-contributory).<\/p>  <p>  There are now significantly more pensioners than there were in 2007, and the rate of payment has also increased significantly, and so the cost of both the pension, and of awarding higher percentage payments to former homemakers, is more substantial.  The State pension contributory has a provision for &euro;4.844 billion in 2017.  A recent exercise by the Department, based on up-to-date data, estimated that cost of backdating the Homemakers scheme in 2017 would be approximately &euro;290 million, with similar caveats about the degree to which it could be estimated.  This amounts to just under 6% of state pension (contributory) expenditure.<\/p>  <p>  There are a number of reasons which would be expected to increase the relative cost of backdating the homemakers scheme, but the main one is that the PRSI records of those retiring is evolving over time.  Women qualifying for a pension today were less than 22 years old when the &lsquo;marriage bar&rsquo; was ended, and were more likely to return to work following a few years out of the workforce than those who started families a decade earlier.  Indeed, many of the earlier cohort would have little or no PRSI contribution record at all, if they started their families when relatively young.  While many, in both cohorts, would qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult (IQA) or a non-contributory pension, an increasing number, particularly those who had significant personal means such as a private or occupational pension, now qualify instead for a reduced rate contributory pension, of say 85% of the maximum rate.  Such women would benefit very significantly from backdating of the scheme, whereas women with no means who continued to receive an IQA or a non-contributory pension would receive no benefit were such backdating to be introduced.  It would be expected that this would continue to increase the annual cost of such a measure, were it to be introduced, over the coming years.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100057#WRB05100","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Poverty","counter":66,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100057#WRB05200"},{"type":"question","counter":67,"qnumday":59,"qnumall":"[8357\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100057#WRB05300","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"his plans to address child poverty; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1227","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":68,"content":"<p>The CSO Survey on Income and Living Conditions (SILC) for 2015 shows that 11.5 per cent of children were in consistent poverty.

Under this Framework, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in collaboration with my Department and other relevant Departments is taking a whole-of-government approach to tackling child poverty. <\/p>  <p>  Social transfers play a crucial role in alleviating poverty and inequality and Ireland is among the best in the EU for reducing poverty through social transfers.  <\/p>  <p>  Budget 2017 increased the weekly rates of payment for working age schemes and also raised the income disregard for one-parent family payment and jobseeker&rsquo;s transition payment recipients.

Expenditure on pensions, at approximately &euro;7 billion, is the largest block of expenditure in my Department in the Estimate for 2017, representing approximately 35% of overall expenditure.  Due to demographic changes, my Department&rsquo;s spending on older people is increasing year on year.  Maintaining the rate of the State pension and other payments is critical in protecting people from poverty. <\/p><p>As a result of this demographic change, the number of State pension recipients is increasing by approximately 17,000 annually.  This has significant implications for the future costs of State pension provision which are currently increasing by close to &euro;1 billion every 5 years. The purpose of changes to the State pension age is to make the pension system more sustainable in the context of increasing life expectancy.  The conditions for the State pension (contributory) are reviewed on an ongoing basis, and there have been a number of changes over the years which impact upon whether someone qualifies or not.  <\/p><p>One of the conditions of the State pension (contributory) is that a person needs a minimum of 520 weekly contributions (i.e. 10 years) paid since entering insurable employment.  If a person does not have this minimum number of contributions paid, they will not generally have an entitlement to this particular pension, either at a full or reduced rate.  Since 1961, when contributory pensions were introduced, the average contributions test has been used in calculating the rate of pension entitlement. <\/p><p>As provided for in Budget 2012, from September 2012, new rate bands for State pension (contributory) were introduced.  These bands replaced the previous structure, introduced in 2000.  These bands more accurately reflect the social insurance history of a person, and ensure that those who contribute more during a working life benefit more in retirement than those with lesser contributions, subject to the safety nets in place for those with no other means.  Prior to the change in rate bands a person  reaching retirement age with a yearly average of 47 contributions qualified for the same rate of payment (98% of the maximum rate) as someone with a yearly average of 20 contributions, despite generally their much more significant PRSI record, and regardless of their means.  A person with an average of 48-52 PRSI contributions per year over their working life received a weekly State pension of only &euro;4.50 more than someone with a yearly average of 20 PRSI contributions. <\/p><p>Entitlement is banded, with the maximum rate payable to those with a yearly average of 48-52 contributions, and the minimum rate payable to those with a yearly average in the range of 10-14 contributions per year.  Even if someone has only 10 years (520 weeks) of paid reckonable contributions between their 16th and 66th birthdays, they would generally qualify for a State pension (contributory), although the rate payable would vary depending on their circumstances, and it will not always be their most advantageous payment to claim. <\/p><p>Reversing the rates of these bands to the same percentages as were in place during the period 2000-2012 in the next Budget would carry a cost of at least &euro;60 million in 2018, and this would rise at a rate of &euro;10 million per annum.  Rather than use those funds in this manner, which would generally benefit pensioners with other means over and above the state pension itself, and who contributed less into the Social Insurance Fund, it was decided that the increases in pension rates in 2016 and 2017 would be across the board, pro-rata, to the benefit of every pensioner.This positively impacted upon many more people than a reversal of the rate-bands, and unlike that approach, it was to the benefit of those pensioners with no other means.  Any policy change, which saw the rate-bands reverting to 2000-2012 percentages, would result in significantly less money being available to increase the general rate of the pension. <\/p><p>The home-makers scheme makes qualification for a higher rate of State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties. The scheme, which was introduced in and took effect from 1994, allows up to 20 years after that date spent caring for children under 12 years of age (or caring for incapacitated people over that age) to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes, subject to the standard qualifying conditions for State pension contributory also being satisfied. This has the effect of increasing the yearly average of the pensioner, which is used to set the rate of their pension. <\/p><p>Where people who were unattached to the labour market during most of their adult lives cannot qualify for a contributory pension in their own right as they have paid few or no contributions, or cannot qualify for a full rate as a result of an intermittent PRSI record, the social protection system provides alternative methods of supporting such pensioners in old age. Therefore, if their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension, which by default is paid directly to them. Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State Pension (non-contributory), amounting up to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate. <\/p><p>The National Pensions Framework (2010) proposed that a &ldquo;Total Contribution Approach&rdquo; (TCA) should replace the yearly average approach, for new pensioners from 2020.  The aim of this approach is to make the rate of contributory pension more closely match contributions made by a person.  Officials of my Department are currently working on the detailed development of the TCA.  This is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative, and technical elements in its implementation.  An important element in the final design of the scheme the position of gender and gaps in contribution records will be considered very carefully in developing these proposals.  The forthcoming independent Actuarial review of the Social Insurance Fund will provide data that will allow officials to accurately cost and project various options under the TCA reform.  Following the analysis of that data, it is intended to have a public consultation later this year.  Once that is completed, proposals on the final details of the scheme will be made by the Government to the Oireachtas before the end of the year. <\/p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100057#WRB06100","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Poverty","counter":76,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100057#WRB06200"},{"type":"question","counter":77,"qnumday":62,"qnumall":"[8451\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100057#WRB06300","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"if consideration has been given to implementing an anti-poverty strategy with a specific focus on children (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":78,"content":"<p>Government policy around tackling poverty for children and families is articulated in Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures (BOBF): The national policy framework for children &amp;amp; young people 2014-2020, published by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs in 2014.

This is due to volatility in the stock markets, increasing liabilities arising from the demographic pressures of increasing life expectancy, low interest rates, and regulatory requirements.  Essentially the cost of providing benefits has increased at a rate that has not been covered by the investment returns earned by pension schemes.  In addition, accountancy standards, which make pensions liabilities very apparent on a company's balance sheet, contribute to the pressures under which DB schemes are operating.<\/p>  <p>  During the financial crisis the decline of such schemes accelerated to the extent that the whole sector was at risk.

It is important to note, that under the service jobseekers have access to a personal adviser (PA) who works with them over two phases.  The first phase, of 12 months duration, the PA provides practical assistance in searching, preparing for, securing and sustaining employment.  The second phase starts if the jobseeker is successful in finding work. During this phase the PA continues to work with the jobseeker for a further period of at least three months, and up to 12 months.

The suitability of employment is therefore a key factor in ensuring that jobs are sustainable.  If people are placed into unsuitable jobs they are less likely to remain in employment and as a consequence the provider&rsquo;s fees will be reduced.  In addition the department has built in a number of controls related to the service, for example should one of the companies fall below the standards expected by the department in terms of performance, customer satisfaction or quality of service delivery the department can retain fees due to the companies.

Where that context changes, the social welfare code is examined for appropriate changes, e.g., the scheme was introduced for widows on 1st January 1936; it was extended to widowers on 28th October 1994 in light of gender equality issues that had not been considered in the 1930s; and extended to surviving civil partners from 1st January 2011 following the introduction of civil partnership.  Entering into a marriage or civil partnership is a legal act, which confers both rights and obligations on both parties, which do not exist in a legal sense between co-habiting couples. Widows, widowers and surviving civil partners, who become bereaved, therefore, in addition to their personal loss, also lose someone who had legal duties towards them.  In some cases those legal duties were, in part, financial in nature, and the social welfare code recognises that potential loss by providing a pension to them, subject to certain conditions. <\/p>  <p>  A surviving cohabitant who was not married to their deceased former partner may be entitled to other social welfare payments if he or she has an income need, e.g., One-Parent Family Payment, Jobseekers Benefit or Allowance or Family Income Supplement.  Payment of Child Benefit would continue, where applicable. <\/p>  <p>  In terms of other income supports, supplementary welfare allowance is a means tested weekly payment, subject to certain terms and conditions, which provides a basic income support to eligible people whose means are insufficient to meet their needs. <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100058#WRC00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Pensions Reform","counter":98,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100058#WRC00950"},{"type":"question","counter":99,"qnumday":71,"qnumall":"[8418\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100058#WRC01000","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"his plans to reform the pension system which it is perceived currently discriminates against persons, mainly women, who took time out of the workforce prior to 1994 to care for children or elderly relatives; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":100,"content":"<p>The State pension contributory is a very valuable benefit and is the bedrock of the Irish pension system.  Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension, all contributions paid or credited over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement.<\/p>  <p>  Since 1961, when contributory pensions were introduced, the average contributions test has been used in calculating the rate of pension entitlement.  Entitlement is banded, with the maximum rate payable to those with a yearly average of 48-52 contributions, and the minimum rate payable to those with a yearly average in the range of 10-14 contributions per year.  Even if someone has only 10 years (520 weeks) of paid reckonable contributions between their 16th and 66th birthdays, they would generally qualify for a State pension (contributory), although the rate payable would vary depending on their circumstances, and it will not always be their most advantageous payment to claim, particularly if they qualify for a full-rate State pension (non-contributory).<\/p>  <p>  The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme was introduced in 1994 to make qualification for State pension contributory (SPC) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age, or incapacitated people, to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being calculated for pension purposes.  The effect of this is to reduce the number of years by which the person&rsquo;s contributions are divided, thereby increasing their yearly average, making it easier for them to qualify for a maximum rate SPC.  It does not involve the award of credits.  My Department reviews these and other provisions on an ongoing basis and has estimated that the cost of extending the Homemakers scheme to allow people to avail of the full 20 years currently allowed under the scheme, encompassing periods prior to 1994, could cost &euro;290m in 2017.  This figure would increase in subsequent years.<\/p>  <p>  It is worth noting that the most recent Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund in 2012 confirmed that the Fund provides better value to female rather than male contributors.  This is due to the redistributive nature of the Fund.<\/p>  <p>  Where people who were unattached to the labour market during most of their adult lives cannot qualify for a contributory pension in their own right as they have paid few or no contributions, or cannot qualify for a full rate as a result of an intermittent PRSI record, the social protection system provides alternative methods of supporting such pensioners in old age.  Therefore, if their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension, which by default is paid directly to them.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State Pension (non-contributory), amounting up to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate. <\/p>  <p>  The National Pensions Framework (2010) proposed that a &ldquo;Total Contributions Approach&rdquo; (TCA) should replace the yearly average approach, for new pensioners from 2020.  The aim of this approach is to make the rate of contributory pension more closely match contributions made by a person.  Officials of my Department are currently working on the detailed development of the TCA with a view to making proposals for consideration later in the year.  This is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative, and technical elements in its implementation.  An important element in the final design of the scheme will be the position of people who have gaps in their contribution records for various reasons, and this factor is being considered very carefully in developing this reform. <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100058#WRC01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Poverty Data","counter":101,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100058#WRC01150"},{"type":"question","counter":102,"qnumday":72,"qnumall":"[8359\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100058#WRC01200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"his views on the recently published SILC, survey on income and living conditions, data which showed that the at risk of poverty rate, the deprivation rate and the consistent poverty rate actually increased for those persons not at work due to illness or disability; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1227","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":103,"content":"<p>The latest CSO Survey on Income and Living Conditions (SILC) results for 2015 show that the consistent poverty rate, for people in households headed by a person who was unable to work due to illness or a disability, was 22.4% in 2015.

However, these figures (like other statistics for very small groups in the survey) have been volatile in recent years.  This is due to smaller sample sizes.  It is not possible to say with certainty whether the changes over the year are statistically significant and indicative of a sustained trend.  Given the continuing economic recovery throughout 2016 and measures introduced in Budgets 2016 and 2017, it is reasonable to expect future figures to show improvements.  I will continue to work with my Government colleagues to ensure that the economic recovery is experienced in all regions and by all families, households and individuals.  The Government&rsquo;s strategy for addressing poverty and social exclusion is set out in the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion.  The Plan identifies a wide range of targeted actions and interventions to achieve the overall objective of reducing consistent poverty.  The Department will review the Plan this year, as it reaches the end of its current term, with a view to developing an updated plan for future periods.  The Department will also review the national social target for poverty reduction.  This review will be undertaken in consultation with relevant stakeholders.<\/p><p>The Government is committed to increasing the employment opportunities for people with a disability.  The Comprehensive Employment Strategy for people with disabilities adopts a cross-government approach that brings together various measures, to be taken by different Departments and State agencies, in a concerted effort to address the barriers and challenges that impact on the employment of people with disabilities.  The six strategic priorities are to: build skills, capacity and independence; provide bridges and supports into work; make work pay; promote job retention and re-entry into work; provide co-ordinated and seamless support; and engage employers.  These priorities are incorporated into the Pathways to Work Strategy and this ensures that there is an integrated focus on supports that enable people with disabilities to participate in employment where they have the capacity to do so.<\/p><p>My Department provides a range of specific income, activation and employment supports for people with a disability.  For instance, the partial capacity benefit scheme enables recipients of invalidity pension and illness benefit to take-up employment, on a voluntary basis, while continuing to receive income support.  The Department manages a supported employment service (EmployAbility) which provides a dedicated job-coaching service for people with disabilities.  Intreo services are also available to provide employment support services for people with disabilities who wish to engage with the service on a voluntary basis.  There is also a focus on supports available to employers who employ people with disabilities such as the Wage Subsidy Scheme and the Workplace Equipment Adaption Grant Scheme<b>.<\/b><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100058#WRC01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Bereavement Grant","counter":104,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100058#WRC01350"},{"type":"question","counter":105,"qnumday":73,"qnumall":"[8439\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100058#WRC01400","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"if he will reinstate the bereavement grant and make additional funds available to the exceptional needs payment, which were cut in January 2014; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1299","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":106,"content":"<p>In recent Budgets the Department has protected primary social welfare rates.

These include a weekly-paid widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s (contributory and non-contributory) pensions, which are based on contributions or a means test, and a once-off widowed or surviving civil partner grant of &euro;6,000 where there is a dependent child.  A number of social welfare payments, including State pension, continue in payment for six weeks following a death.

This began in January 2014 with the abolition of the State pension (transition) available from 65 for those who satisfied the qualifying conditions, thereby standardising State pension age for all at 66 years, which is the current State pension age.  This will increase to 67 in 2021 and to 68 in 2028.  In most cases, it is hoped that workers will continue to work up to the new State pension age.  Where this is not possible, and where they are available for work, there are specific measures which apply to someone claiming Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit from a date after their 65th birthday.  Where qualified, these recipients may continue to be eligible for that payment until reaching pension age.  Reversing this measure would have a significant Exchequer cost.  In 2013, the cost of the State pension (transition) was &euro;137 million. Its abolition was not expected to save that amount of expenditure in full, as some people who were affected would alternatively claim working age payments such as Jobseeker's Benefit (albeit at a lower rate than the rate of the State pension), or may claim an Increase for a Qualified Adult in respect of their spouse&rsquo;s pension.  However, it is anticipated that well over half of that cost has been saved each year as a result of this measure, and this would be expected to increase as (a) the number of 65 year olds increases, (b) the change results in a higher percentage of people working while aged 65, and (c) there have been two Budget increases in the rate of the State pension since then.  It is estimated that the net saving in 2017 is likely to be in the region of &euro;80 million, and this is expected to increase over time. <\/p>  <p>  Each year more people are living to pension age and living longer in retirement.  As a result of this demographic change, the number of State pension recipients is increasing year on year.  This has significant implications for the future costs of State pension provision which are currently increasing by close to &euro;1 billion every 5 years.  The purpose of changes to the State pension age is to make the pension system more sustainable in the context of increasing life expectancy.  This sustainability is vital, if the current workers, who fund State pension payments through their PRSI, are to receive a pension themselves when they reach retirement age. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy should note that there is no statutory retirement age in the State, and the age at which employees retire is a matter for the contract of employment between them and their employers.  While such a contract may have been entered into with a retirement date of 65, in the context of the previous State pension arrangements, there is no legal impediment to the employer and employee agreeing to increase the duration of employment for one or more years, if both parties wish to do so. <\/p>  <p>  In January 2016, an Interdepartmental Group on Fuller Working Lives, chaired by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, was established specifically to examine the implications arising from prevailing retirement ages.  The final report of the Group made a number of recommendations to support working and retirement practices.  This included a request to the Workplace Relations Commission to prepare a Code of Practice under Section 42 of the Industrial Relations Act, 1990 to help manage the engagement between employers and employees regarding retirement issues and longer working.

The contract for the safety camera service, which was awarded following a public procurement competition, is with Road Safety Operations Ireland, trading as GoSafe.  The new safety camera contract is an agreement between the Minister for Justice and Equality, the Commissioner of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Road Safety Operations Ireland, trading as GoSafe.  <\/p><p>The Minister for Justice and Equality authorised the awarding of the services agreement for the provision and operation of safety cameras on a managed service basis for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in accordance with Section 81(7) of the Road Traffic Act, 2010.  Section 81(7) of the Road Traffic Act 2010 provides for persons, other than members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to make recordings, which can be used as evidence of an offence under the Road Traffic Acts, when authorised to do so by means of an agreement with the Minister for Justice and Equality. <\/p><p>The duration of the new contract is 6 years, with the option to extend the contract for an additional 12 months. Under the new contract, GoSafe will provide an annual minimum of 90,000 hours of monitoring and surveying vehicle speed across 1,031 designated safety camera zones.  This equates to a minimum of 7,400 monitoring hours and 100 survey hours a month.  This represents an annual increase of 300 hours on the existing contract.  The new contract also contains provisions for up to 1,500 additional monitoring hours within any calendar month and the option to avail of fixed, temporary fixed and average speed safety camera systems.  <\/p><p>The role of the Garda Safety Camera Contract is to improve road safety by changing driver behaviour in order to reduce road traffic fatalities and serious injuries by reducing the incidence of drivers exceeding stipulated speed limits, in circumstances where speeding is known to be a significant factor behind serious collisions. <\/p><p>The Government's current Road Safety Strategy (2013 &ndash; 2020) sets the task of making Ireland's roads as safe as the best performing countries in the European Union and beyond.  The strategy aims to reduce road collisions to 25 road deaths per million of population by 2020.  The recent increase in road deaths (188 road traffic fatalities in 2016) highlights the need to continue to deploy all effective measures to reduce speeding, and therefore road traffic collisions.  Speed enforcement is a key component in Garda road safety enforcement strategy and the introduction of a safety camera network has been central to this strategy for several years.  The network also releases Garda resources for other road safety enforcement and the speed surveying function it provides informs road policing operations generally. <\/p><p>The overall impact of the cameras can be seen in the number of fatal collisions in the designated safety camera zones, referred to as speed enforcement zones.  The designation of specific sections of road as speed enforcement zones is based on an analysis of collision data by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The locations of these speed enforcement zones are available on the Garda website www.garda.ie.  In the years 2004 to 2009 (the 6 years before the introduction of the safety camera network began), approximately 3 out of 10 (30%) fatal collisions occurred in these zones.  Following the introduction of monitoring, this collision rate dropped to less than 2 in 10 (17%) in 2013 and to approximately 9% to April 2015. <\/p><p>After reaching a low of 165 in 2015, the 2016 increase in road fatalities strengthens the argument for all agencies to maximise their road safety efforts so as to reverse this development.

The Bill, as proposed, will update all existing laws on the regulation of gambling, including betting and gaming but excluding the National Lottery.  It will provide for the licensing of all forms of on-line gambling.<\/p><p>  It is the intention to proceed with this legislation at the earliest opportunity. In support of these efforts the Government has delegated powers of the Minister for Justice and Equality under the gaming and lotteries legislation to me as Minister of State. <\/p><p>As the Deputy will recall, the General Scheme was referred to what was at the time the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality for consideration and observations.  The Joint Committee received 29 submissions and held public hearings following which it issued a report on 6 November 2013 which contained 8 conclusions and was laid before the Houses.<\/p><p>The 2013 General Scheme provides for the conferring of responsibility for all regulatory matters in this area on the Minister for Justice and Equality, including licensing, inspections and prosecutions, and it envisages that these functions would be carried out by a body located within the Department of Justice and Equality.  The General Scheme also provides for a dedicated inspectorate to ensure compliance by licence holders with the terms of their licences and with the new legislation generally.<\/p><p>  The Gambling Control Bill will have consumer protection generally as one of its core principles, and it is envisaged that it will include several measures aimed at the protection of vulnerable persons, including children, from risks to their well-being arising from gambling.  The 2013 Scheme includes measures that will require licence holders to act in a socially responsible way.  These measures include controls on advertising, promotions and sponsorship.<\/p><p>Pending the bringing forward of the main Bill, which is a major undertaking, I have also asked my Department to examine whether there are any individual pressing areas of concern, intended to be dealt with in the Bill, which could be dealt with early this year by separate legislative measures.  A number of such measures are, therefore, under active consideration and will be included in the Scheme of the forthcoming Courts and Civil Law Miscellaneous Provisions Bill which is, under the Government Legislation Programme, to be submitted for legislative scrutiny early this year.

Under this programme, the Government has pledged to accept a total of 4,000 persons into the State, 2,622 through the EU relocation mechanism established by two EU Council Decisions in 2015 to assist Italy and Greece, and 1,040 (519 by the end of 2016 and the remainder in 2017) under the UNHCR-led refugee resettlement programme currently focussed on resettling refugees from Lebanon. <\/p><p>In a further gesture of humanitarian assistance towards the most vulnerable caught up in the migration crisis and following a debate in the D&aacute;il, the Government also committed to taking up to 200 unaccompanied minors from France who were previously resident in the migrant camp at Calais.  These initiatives therefore leave just a small residual balance to be allocated from the Government decision to take 4,000 persons.<\/p><p>Resettlement strand of the programme<\/p><p>Taking account of the situation in the Middle East, and the plight of the refugees, the T&aacute;naiste announced that Ireland would accept 520 persons for resettlement over an 18-month period to the end of 2017.  This was almost double the figure proposed for Ireland by the European Commission and was delivered a year ahead of the Commission deadline.  <\/p><p>In addition, the Government recently announced that it is extending the resettlement programme to take in a further 520 refugees from Lebanon in  2017, most of whom are of Syrian origin.  260 refugees have already been selected during a selection mission to Lebanon in October 2016 and are expected to arrive in Spring 2017.  Most of these refugees are also Syrian.  A further selection mission to Lebanon will be arranged in the coming months to select the remaining refugees due to come to Ireland in 2017 under the resettlement programme. <\/p><p>Relocation strand of the programme<\/p><p>Despite initial delays outside of Ireland's control in respect of the operation of the 'hotspots' on the ground in Greece, Ireland has to date taken in a total of 320 people from Greece under relocation, another 78 people have been formally accepted and are awaiting transport arrangements, and a further 155 have been assessed and are awaiting clearance.  A monthly schedule has been agreed with the Greek authorities which will sustain the pace of intakes throughout 2017 at the levels required to allow Ireland to meets its commitments to Greece within the time frame envisaged by the  Programme. <\/p><p>As regards Italy, the relocation mechanism from Italy has yet to commence for many countries, including Ireland, due to issues with the Italian authorities surrounding the security assessment of migrants assigned to other Member States.  Intensive efforts are ongoing to resolve this, both bilaterally with Italian counterparts at official, diplomatic and Ministerial level, and at EU level, including through the European Commission.<\/p><p>The total target for relocation to Ireland in the Council Decisions also includes a further 910 persons but the country of origin for this cohort has not yet been assigned at EU level.  <\/p><p>The following table sets out the position regarding the assignment of the 4,000. <\/p><p>Table of Total Numbers under Government Decision<table><tr><th>Relocation Strand<\/th><th>Numbers<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Council Decision 2015\/1523<\/td><td>600<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Council Decision 2015\/1601<\/td><td>2,022<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total Relocation<\/td><td>2,622<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Resettlement Strand<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Government Decision 09\/06\/15<\/td><td>520<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Government Decision 06\/07\/16<\/td><td>260<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Government Decision 29\/11\/16<\/td><td>260<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total Resettlement<\/td><td>1,040<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total Unaccompanied Minors Calais (Government Decision 10\/11\/16)<\/td><td>200 (up to)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Mechanism as yet undecided<\/td><td>138<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Grand Total<\/td><td>4000<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>Unaccompanied minors<\/p><p>In announcing the IRPP, the Government recognised the importance of prioritising family groups and addressing the position of unaccompanied children.

Such minors are placed in the care of Tusla.  Unaccompanied minors that Ireland takes from Greece are additional to the commitments made by Ireland in respect those previously resident in the migrant camp in Calais.<\/p><p>In summary, under the Irish Refugee Protection Programme 519 refugees have arrived in Ireland under resettlement and 320 persons have arrived in Ireland under relocation.

In the coming months, persons admitted under the relocation programme and who have been granted refugee status, subsidiary protection or permission to remain will begin the process of resettlement into local communities.  Preparatory work is ongoing in this regard.  <\/p><p>Resettlement has been ongoing in Ireland since 2000 when the first refugees were admitted under the resettlement quota programme.  Over the years, programmes have been developed to support refugees, known as &quot;programme refugees&quot;, post arrival to assist refugees to adjust and to prepare for independent living.  A separate programme, building on the work started during the Reception phase, begins in local receiving communities approximately nine months before the refugees move into the local community.<\/p><p>The Resettlement Programme is coordinated at the national level by the Office for the Promotion of Migrant Integration (OPMI), Department of Justice and Equality, and is overseen by an Inter-Departmental Working Group which has representation from mainstream Government Departments, the HSE, and SOLAS.  This Inter-Departmental Working Group at a national level is a key driver of the resettlement programme.<\/p><p>Key elements of the post arrival programme are:<\/p><p>- Staff from the OPMI Resettlement Team, accompanied by interpreters, meet the refugees airside on arrival and accompany them to an Emergency Reception and Orientation Centre where they are accommodated for approximately 8 to 12 weeks.<\/p><p>- During the days post arrival the refugees are registered with the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) where they are issued with a Registration Certificate.<\/p><p>- Refugees are registered with the Department of Social Protection for a public services card and to be assessed for a social protection income.<\/p><p>- Refugees are assisted to apply for a medical card.<\/p><p>- An 8 to 10 week Language Training and Cultural Orientation programme is provided by the Education and Training Board.  During this programme, refugees hear about their rights and responsibilities.  They have time to ask questions, build confidence and rest.  Speakers are invited from various organisations to provide information about their services.  Interpretation is provided to ensure a full understanding of the content on the part of the refugees.<\/p><p>- Local Service Providers, volunteers and NGOs visit the Emergency Reception and Orientation Centres to provide services, to provide information and to support and befriend the refugees.<\/p><p>- The period of 8 -10 weeks allows newly arrived refugees to rest and acclimatise to their new environment and culture before being moved to independent living in the community.<\/p><p>- A GP is assigned and refugees have the opportunity to deal with their emergency medical needs.  Adults and children who may not have had access to medical services for some time are referred for Dental and Optical assessments.<\/p><p>- Interpreter\/Translator\/Cross Cultural workers are currently being interviewed to work in the EROCs to facilitate better understanding between service providers and the refugee clients  to promote better outcomes for the refugees.<\/p><p>- Childcare is  provided free of charge to allow the adults to attend the Language and Orientation programme.<\/p><p>- Education provision is made for school age children by the Department of Education and Skills.<\/p><p>- Refugees are individually assisted to apply for a medical card.<\/p><p>- Emergency medical matters are followed up while resident in the Emergency Reception and Orientation Centres.<\/p><p>- Once the refugees have completed their post arrival Orientation and Language Training programme, and when housing is available, the refugees are transferred to the Local Community with the support of the resettlement team from the OPMI and supported at a local level by service providers and volunteers in the local community. <\/p><p>The Language and Orientation Training that began while resident in the Emergency Reception and Orientation Centre continues post resettlement in the community.<\/p><p>Key elements of the resettlement programme in the Community are:<\/p><p>- The programme is coordinated at local level by a Resettlement Inter-agency Working Group comprising of representatives of all local mainstream Service Providers which is established in each receiving community.  The local Inter-agency Working Group is chaired by the Local Authority and supported by the Office for the Promotion of Migrant Integration.<\/p><p>- Work in preparation for the arrival of refugees begins nine months in advance of resettlement.<\/p><p>- Services to refugees are provided on the basis of mainstream model of service provision, while recognising that targeted initiatives may be required during the first year post resettlement as the newly arrived refugees adapt to independent living, a new language and culture.<\/p><p>- Each Service Provider representative on the Inter-Agency Working Group plays a role in the preparation for receiving the refugees. <\/p><p>- GPs, school placement, housing, social protection income and English language training, links with the local NGOs and the Community and Voluntary sector are organised, in so far as possible, in advance of the refugees' arrival in the community.  <\/p><p>- Programme refugees admitted for resettlement purposes have, in general, the same rights and entitlements as an Irish citizen in relation e.g. to employment, education and training, medical care, social welfare, access to the courts etc. <\/p><p>- OPMI provides interpretation where required and assists in the resolution of issues arising during the first two weeks post arrival. <\/p><p>- OPMI provides funding to employ a Resettlement Support Worker who works closely with the refugee community to help them to resolve issues arising thus building capacity towards independent living.  The Resettlement Support Worker provides day to day support, identifies gaps in services and issues arising relating to accessing services, and brings these to the attention of the Service Provider.<\/p><p>- Language training is provided in the receiving community by the Education and Training Board for a period of 12 months post arrival.  Where a person has adequate levels of English, that person is placed in mainstream courses by the Education and Training Board.  The person may also be referred to the Department of Social Protection for inclusion in their activation programmes.<\/p><p>- Childcare is provided under mainstream Childcare schemes funded by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  This facilitates participation by adults in language and other training programmes.<\/p><p>- Children are placed in local schools.  Funding is provided through OPMI grants to organise after-schools clubs and to encourage children to participate in school outings, sporting and other activities at a local level.<\/p><p>- Funding is provided by the OPMI to support engagement by adults in local events and activities such as promoting participation in men's shed, women's groups, involvement in the arts and sporting activities, organising intercultural events promoting participation in volunteering at a local level. <\/p><p>- Local NGOs and the Community and Voluntary Sector work in cooperation with the local Resettlement Support Worker to include newly arrived refugees in local activities.<\/p><p>- Local volunteers are encouraged and facilitated to engage with newly arrived refugees at a local level.

Political agreement was reached on the draft Directive in December 2016.  The text was endorsed by the European Parliament&rsquo;s Internal Market Committee on 26 January 2017 and is due to be voted by the full Parliament in March, and if passed, will then formally be approved by the Justice and Home Affairs Council.<\/p>  <p>  The Firearms Directive allows the Commission to adopt standards and rules on the deactivation of firearms.  The Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015\/2403 of 15 December 2015 (Deactivation Regulation) establishes common guidelines on deactivation within the EU with the objective of addressing problems due to the illegal re-activation of firearms by using pieces of other deactivated arms, home-made pieces or pieces acquired via the internet. <\/p>  <p>  This Regulation sets out common and strict minimum criteria for the way EU countries must deactivate weapons so that they are rendered irreversibly inoperable. This Regulation came into effect on 8 April 2016 and has direct application within this jurisdiction.  It is important to note that the Regulation permits both firearms owners and registered firearms dealers to carry out the work required to render the firearm irreversibly deactivated in accordance with the regulation.  The firearm must then be submitted to any one of the current [46] national competent authorities within the EU for verification and certification.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has not appointed a Competent Authority to verify the deactivation of firearms in accordance with this Regulation because there is no significant firearms manufacturing industry in this country and no formal training for a gunsmith is recognised by the State.  However, the Department of Justice and Equality has received statements of interest from twelve interested parties who wish to be assessed to be appointed as a Competent Authority for the verification of the deactivation of firearms under the regulation.  As the Regulation is currently being revised by the European Commission, these interested parties have been advised that the Department does not propose to progress their applications until the amended text has been agreed and approved by the  Commission.  In the meantime, the Birmingham Proof House has been approved by UK authorities to verify the deactivation of firearms in accordance with the Regulation and they have indicated their willingness to undertake such verification work for Irish customers. <\/p>  <p>  The possession of any firearm, even after deactivation, will continue to require authorisation by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100059#WRD01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Strength","counter":173,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100059#WRD01500"},{"type":"question","counter":174,"qnumday":99,"qnumall":"[8351\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100059#WRD01600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the Garda numbers for the Malahide Garda station in north Dublin for each of the years 2005 to 2010, inclusive; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1228","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":175,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will appreciate, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the distribution of resources, including personnel, among the various Garda Divisions and I, as Minister, have no direct role in the matter.

In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

The Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Act 2016, the purpose of which is to address issues relating to bail and sentencing for prolific burglars of dwellings, provides that persons awaiting trial for burglary of a dwelling who have recent convictions or pending charges for domestic burglaries can be denied bail in appropriate cases. <\/p>  <p>  The Act also provides for consecutive sentences for prolific burglars.  Section 2 of the Act inserts a new section 54A into the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001.  This provision requires a court which decides to impose custodial sentences for multiple domestic burglary offences committed within a 12 month window to impose such sentences consecutively.  The provisions apply to adults previously convicted of a domestic burglary committed in the five years before the burglary offence for which they are being sentenced.<\/p>  <p>  The Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001 provides that  a person guilty of burglary is liable on conviction on indictment to a fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 14 years or both and section 13 of the Act provides that a person convicted of aggravated burglary is liable on conviction on indictment to imprisonment for life.  <\/p>  <p>  In addition, section 26 of the Criminal Justice Act 2007 provides that a court may make a monitoring order for persons convicted of aggravated burglary.  The court may also make a Protection of Persons Order which prohibits the offender from engaging in any behaviour that would be likely to cause the victim of the offence fear, distress or alarm.  That Act also provides that where a person has been convicted on indictment of a specified offence (which includes aggravated burglary) and sentenced to a term of imprisonment of at least 5 years and commits another specified offence within 7 years of the first conviction, the court must impose a minimum term of imprisonment which is at least three quarters of the maximum sentence provided by law for that offence, or at least 10 years imprisonment if the maximum sentence is life imprisonment, unless to do so would be disproportionate in all the circumstances of the case.<\/p>  <p>  The case for any further strengthening of the law will be kept under review, and the Justice and Equality Joint Committee could play an important role in this regard. However, it must also be borne in mind that the Strategic Review of Penal Policy report published in 2014 made a number of recommendations in relation to sentencing.  Adopting an approach similar to the Law Reform Commission in its Report on Mandatory Sentences published in June 2013, the Review Group recommended that no further mandatory sentences or presumptive minimum sentences be introduced and that existing provisions should be reviewed.  An Implementation and Oversight Group was established in 2015 to oversee implementation of these recommendations.  <\/p>  <p>  Finally, it is important to also mention the activities of Operation Thor which was established to tackle burglary and related crimes, in both rural and urban areas.  Since the launch of the operation in November 2015, the burglary figures have shown a significant downward trend and the most recent crime statistics for Q3 of 2016 show a decrease of 31% in burglary for the twelve months ending 30 September 2016 compared to the previous twelve month period.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100059#WRD03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Court Judgments","counter":189,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100059#WRD03100"},{"type":"question","counter":190,"qnumday":105,"qnumall":"[8562\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100059#WRD03200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her views on the overturning on appeal of the ruling in her favour and the subsequent removal of a judgment mortgage by order of the Court of Appeal with respect to civil litigation in which she was a defendant (details supplied); her further views on whether this mortgage was reprehensible; and if she will issue an apology or statement.","asker":"1259","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":191,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, the courts are subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions.

The Act provides for the introduction of a single procedure which enables all grounds for seeking international protection and permission to remain in the State for other reasons to be examined and determined in one process.  The new procedure brings the State into line with protection processing arrangements in all other EU States and gives effect to one of the main recommendations of the McMahon report.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Act, the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner (ORAC) has been abolished and responsibility for the investigation and determination of applications for international protection and related permission to remain matters has transferred to a new International Protection Office (IPO) in the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service.  The IPO is statutorily independent in the performance of its international protection functions. <\/p>  <p>  A comprehensive information process has been put in place by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service and the new International Protection Office to ensure that applicants and their legal representatives are aware of the provisions of the new legislation and particularly how it will impact on applicants who are affected by the transitional arrangements.  The transitional arrangements apply to certain applications for refugee status and subsidiary protection which were made before the commencement date and were not finalised for processing by the ORAC and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal (RAT).<\/p>  <p>  I am informed by the Chief International Protection Officer that, as is required by the 2015 Act, in late January\/February 2017 the IPO, in addition to placing advertisements in the national media, wrote to approximately 3,000 applicants whose cases were not finalised by the ORAC or the RAT to inform them of the relevant provisions of the 2015 Act and how the transitional provisions would affect their applications.  This information was made available in some 17 languages.  All applicants received the following documents with the mailshot<\/p>  <p>   - Information Note - Transitional Arrangements (IPO 12),<\/p>  <p>   - Information Booklet for Applicants for International Protection (IPO 1) and,<\/p>  <p>   - Application for International Protection Questionnaire (IPO 2).<\/p>  <p>  On 30 January 2017, the IPO wrote to all legal representatives on record providing information on the new legislation.  The legal representatives received copies of the main template letters sent to the applicants along with the Information Note on transitional arrangements (IPO 12).  In addition, notices were circulated to Direct Provision centres in relation to the mailshot.  <\/p>  <p>  I am also informed by the Chief International Protection Officer that he has held a number of meetings with Non-Governmental Organisations and the UNHCR, through the IPO Customer Liaison Panel, to brief them on the arrangements for the commencement of the Act and for the notification of applicants in relation to the transitional provisions and how these will be operated in practice.<\/p>  <p>  I understand also that additional resources have been provided to the Legal Aid Board to provide advice and assistance to applicants with their applications.<\/p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that the letters sent to applicants in January\/February 2017 made clear that the Application for International Protection Questionnaire (IPO 2) should be returned \"if possible, no later than 20 working days from the date of the covering letter\".  However, this is purely an administrative deadline and flexibility is being provided by the International Protection Office if extra time is required for its completion and the receipt of legal advice, where required.  I understand the IPO has again written to the members of the Customer Liaison Panel to remove any doubt on that score.  The IPO, however, remains anxious to re-commence the processing of international protection applications under the 2015 Act on a comprehensive basis and the return of completed Questionnaires and accompanying documents as soon as possible by applicants will assist this process.  There is also provision for supplementary information to be provided subsequent to the completion of the questionnaire.  Any such additional information should be provided not later than two weeks before the applicant's scheduled interview, if possible.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the availability of the questionnaire, under the 2015 Act applicants are required to apply in person for international protection either at the frontier or within the State. At that time and in line with the requirements of the 2015 Act, applicants in the IPO are fingerprinted, photographed, issued a reference number and a Temporary Residence Certificate. Normally at that time, the IPO provides the International Protection Questionnaire and an accompanying information pack.  In order to maintain the integrity of the Questionnaire and the application process generally, it has never been the practice to make the questionnaire available publicly or online.  Such publication would leave the process open to abuse by non-applicants and those who are not at the frontier or within the State as required by law.  Additional copies of the questionnaire are, however, provided to applicants and their legal representatives, on request, once their application reference numbers have been assigned.<\/p>  <p>  You will appreciate that the commencement of the International Protection Act 2015 represents the most fundamental reform of the International protection process in the State for nearly two decades.  The single procedure process, which should be compared with the previous multi-layered process involving multiple bodies and procedures, will result in the determination of status for applicants at a much earlier stage than has been the case to date, and consequently, shorter stays in the Direct Provision system. <\/p>  <p>  While it is recognised that, for a transitional period, applicants will be required to become familiar with the new arrangements, I can assure the Deputy that support will be provided by the International Protection Office and other relevant State authorities to ensure that clarity is available to applicants on the new arrangements and how they will impact on individual cases.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100059#WRD05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Parental Leave","counter":212,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100059#WRD05600"},{"type":"question","counter":213,"qnumday":114,"qnumall":"[8733\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100059#WRD05700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if her Department has any means of monitoring the uptake of parental leave across all employment sectors; if so, the details of the uptake rates across sectors; and if she will provide the rates in relation to gender, socioeconomic profile and any other categories.","asker":"1222","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":214,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, parental leave is unpaid.

This plan contains a significant volume of responses to the current crisis, of which the Help to Buy initiative is one.<\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that the scheme is not a broad based relief available for the purchase of any home by any buyer. It is instead a targeted response that is aimed at first-time buyers, buying (or building) new residences. This targeting is designed to help encourage the building of new homes, thereby increasing supply, by turning notional demand into real demand.

The contributions were tax-relieved at the individual's marginal rate on the way in and were taxed at the individual's marginal rate on withdrawal. This was a measure designed to enable rather than incentivise individuals to access part of their pension savings beyond their regular or compulsory pension contributions.<\/p>  <p>  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the most up to date figures for the AVC access\u00a0scheme\u00a0are that\u00a018,682 individuals availed of the early access facility over the 3 year period to the amount of just over &euro;202 million gross in drawdowns, on which tax of some &euro;79 million was paid (the exact figure is &euro;79,029,232 million).<\/p>  <p>  It is important that individuals continue to provide for their retirement and, it would appear, most individuals with AVCs decided to preserve their AVC pension savings.

According to the Savills report referenced by the Deputy, the take-up of office space exceeded 200,000 sq.m for the third successive year in 2016. Given the sustained level of demand and the increase in prime office rents, the construction of commercial office space has significantly picked up following a near cessation in activity over 2011 to 2015. Approximately 388,000 sq.m of office space is currently under construction, equivalent to 9 per cent of the stock of office space in Dublin. According to CBRE, approximately 77,000 sq.m of office space was constructed in 2016 alone. Together with a strong granted planning pipeline, this should help to address the current scarcity of office space, particularly in the Dublin region.<\/p>  <p>  The proportion of pre-let office space as a share of overall lettings accelerated significantly in the second half of 2016, a trend which is consistent with two characteristics of our office market: (1) the pent-up demand resulting from a lack of development during crisis years; and (2) the increased discipline in financing construction and development reflecting lessons learned through the financial crisis.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding pent-up demand from a lack of development during crisis years, it is well understood that there was no new development nor demand for such development - during Ireland's financial crisis years, which were marked by low property prices and high vacancy levels.  The success of our economic recovery has brought with it an increased demand for office space.  It is the nature of property markets that construction typically lags demand due to the time needed to plan and develop a building once the demand for that building has been identified.  In the meantime, price and vacancy levels absorb the impact of such increases in demand.  These dynamics are evident in the report which notes the current low vacancy rate in prime office space as reflecting the extent of pent-up demand for space and the construction lag.  As an open economy, it is in our interest to minimise the construction lag for buildings for which there is proven demand so that we can prevent excessive pressures from building up within the market's price and vacancy response.  To this end, the Government has identified a number of initiatives in the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan which seek to improve the market's ability to respond to demand more quickly both in the commercial and the residential markets.<\/p>  <p>  Turning to the increased discipline in our financing markets, I understand that pre-letting agreements are increasingly becoming a characteristic of office development activity.  Securing a pre-let for a development significantly reduces the risk associated with that development, which increases the availability of senior debt finance, significantly reducing the financing costs of the development.  One of the factors that contributed to the collapse of the property market and the wider economic crisis was the inappropriate use of debt financing for speculative development.  We have learned that only development with proven demand should attract significant levels of debt finance.  It is appropriate that these risks of speculative development are not financed by a predominance of senior bank debt, but rather by equity investment, more appropriate for such speculation.  As the market adjusts to equilibrium, the use of pre-lets to demonstrate proven demand is likely to be a permanent feature of our market which will help to unlock continued sources of funding.<\/p>  <p>  It is this dynamic, driven by the proper risk-based financing of development, that brings discipline to our development market.  Requiring that a high proportion of a building be pre-let helps to curb the risks of speculative development, encourages sustainable lending practices in the commercial real estate market and allows funding providers to manage risk appropriately.<\/p>  <p>  I am encouraged that these market metrics are being captured, analysed and discussed. I wish to assure the Deputy that my Department will continue to monitor these and other developments in the commercial real estate market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100060#WRE04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Banking Sector Remuneration","counter":277,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100060#WRE04050"},{"type":"question","counter":278,"qnumday":138,"qnumall":"[8189\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100060#WRE04100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will be monitoring proposed regulations in the UK on payments to bank executives; if he will introduce similar measures after reports showed that 26 bankers received &euro;50 million in salaries and bonuses in 2015; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1304","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":279,"content":"<p>The Capital Requirements Directive IV (CRD IV),\u00a0has introduced a European wide framework governing remuneration for bank executives.

This followed a recommendation in the 2009 report by the Commission on Taxation that rent relief should be discontinued. The view of this independent commission\u00a0was that, in the same manner in which mortgage interest relief increases the cost of housing, rent relief increases the cost of private rented accommodation. Accordingly, the result of reintroducing this relief would be a transfer of Exchequer funding directly to landlords, which would not have the intended effect of reducing the pressure on tenants.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, a tax credit of this nature would be of little benefit\u00a0to lower-income workers, the unemployed and students, who may not receive the benefit of the relief as they may not be paying sufficient levels of income tax.

The purpose of the tapered extension is to avoid a sudden significant increase in mortgage repayments for those losing the relief, but instead to withdraw the relief gradually, allowing the mortgage holder time to adjust to the change in mortgage repayments.<\/p>  <p>  At\u00a0present,\u00a0Section 244 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides for tax relief in respect of interest paid on qualifying home loans taken out on or after 1 January 2004 and on or before 31 December 2012, with relief being available until 31 December 2017.\u00a0 Mortgage interest relief has been abolished for homes purchased since 1 January 2013.<\/p>  <p>The Deputy will also be aware that, on foot of a change I introduced in Budget 2012, first time buyers who bought at the height of the property boom between 2004 and 2008 receive a rate of mortgage interest relief of 30%. This compares favourably to the rates available to other remaining recipients of MIR which reduce on a gradual basis from 25% in years 1 and 2 of the mortgage to 15% in the 8th   and subsequent years.<\/p>  <p>  Single individuals and\u00a0married couples\u00a0\/ civil partners that are first-time buyers qualify for mortgage interest relief for the first seven years of their mortgage up to a maximum ceiling of &euro;10,000 and &euro;20,000 respectively. Thereafter relief is restricted to\u00a0ceilings of &euro;3,000 and &euro;6,000 respectively.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The system of mortgage interest relief is designed and targeted in such a way that the relief is of greater value in the early years of a qualifying loan where the interest represents a greater proportion of the repayment. First-time buyers who purchased between 2004 and 2008 when the property market was at its peak also receive an enhanced rate of relief.\u00a0 Mortgage interest relief is of lesser value to individuals whose repayments are made up of a higher proportion of principal than interest, as would generally be the case for those who move in to the eighth and subsequent years of their loans.

The 12.5% rate\u00a0is for trading income unless the income is from an excepted trade in which case the rate is 25%.\u00a0 Excepted trades include certain land dealing activities, income from working minerals and petroleum activities.  Ireland also has a 25% corporation tax rate for non-trading income (e.g. investment income, rental income).\u00a0 Additionally, our regime\u00a0has a 33% rate which is applicable to chargeable gains.<\/p>  <p>  The Knowledge Development Box also provides an effective 6.25% rate of corporation tax on profits from certain qualifying assets that are earned by a company, chargeable to corporation tax in the State, to the extent that the assets relate to R&amp;D undertaken by that company. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I assume that the question\u00a0refers to the taxation of Irish collective investment funds.  The normal tax treatment afforded to Irish collective investment funds is that the funds invested are allowed to grow on a tax-free basis within the fund.\u00a0 The income is taxed at the level of the investor rather than the fund, as is standard international practice.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In order to ensure that the appropriate tax is collected from Irish investors, funds are obliged to operate an exit tax regime and remit the tax deducted in this manner to Revenue.\u00a0 This charge to tax does not apply in the case of unit holders who are non-resident.  In the case of non-resident investors, their liability to tax on gains from the fund will be determined in their home jurisdiction.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The broad rationale for exempting such funds from direct taxation is to facilitate individuals to invest collectively, without suffering double taxation (that is, taxation both within the fund and in the hands of the investor on distribution).\u00a0 Most OECD countries now have a tax system that provides for neutrality between direct investments and investments through a Collective Investment Vehicle\/Fund.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  It is worth noting that due to the changes that I made in Finance Act 2016 this does not apply to collective investment vehicles where 25% or more of the fund derives its value from Irish real estate assets.

model for allocating Special Education Teaching Resources to mainstream primary and post primary schools will be introduced from September 2017. <\/p>  <p>  The basic aim of this new model is to deliver better outcomes for children with special educational needs.  Large amounts of research, analysis, consultation with service users and stakeholders, and piloting have gone in to the development of this model and all the evidence points to the fact that this new system will deliver better outcomes for children. <\/p>  <p>  No school will lose supports as a result of the implementation of the new model.  In addition, no school will receive an allocation, for the support of pupils with complex needs, less than the allocation they received to support such pupils during the 2016\/17 school year.  No allocation made for such pupils\u00a0by the NCSE will be removed from schools as long as that pupil remains in the school. <\/p>  <p>  I\u00a0also announced that an additional 900 teaching posts will be provided to support the introduction of this new allocation model.  The provision of an additional 900 teaching posts is a very significant investment in the provision of additional\u00a0teaching support for pupils with special educational needs in our schools.  This is additional to an increase of 41% in the number of resource teachers allocated to schools annually by the NCSE since 2011, when 5265 teachers were allocated, as opposed to\u00a0provision for 7452 posts in the current school year.<\/p>  <p>  The additional funding will provide additional supports to over 1000 schools who are identified as needing additional supports as a result of the new model.  Supports for children with special educational needs is a huge priority for this Government.  We currently spend &euro;1.5billion, or one fifth of the total education budget, on supports for children with special educational needs. <\/p>  <p>  It will ensure that all schools receive a sufficient allocation\u00a0of special education needs resources to provide additional teaching support to all pupils in their school who require such support.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Under the new allocation model schools\u00a0will be\u00a0provided with total allocation which includes\u00a0a baseline allocation for the school and an allocation based on the school profile. <\/p>  <p>  The provision of a profiled allocation will give a fairer allocation for each school which recognises that all schools need an allocation for special needs support, but which provides a graduated allocation which takes into account the actual level of need and pupils in each school. <\/p>  <p>  Schools will be frontloaded with resources, based on each schools profile, to provide supports immediately to those pupils who need it without delay. \u00a0This will\u00a0reduce the administrative burden on schools as schools will no longer have to complete an application process annually and apply for newly enrolled pupils who require resource hours.  Children who need support can have that support provided immediately rather than having to wait for a diagnosis.<\/p>  <p>  Schools will therefore no longer have to make applications, for newly enrolled pupils for whom resource teaching hours\u00a0may have been provided under the old model, as school will now receive\u00a0a single allocation for all of their special education teaching needs, based on their school size and profile.\u00a0 This includes provision for junior infants who are newly\u00a0enrolling to the school or pupils who may transfer from another school. <\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that this is a brand new model of allocation and is not comparable to the existing model.  By using a broad range of attainment and socio-economic criteria, it is expected that generally, a school&rsquo;s profile will remain relatively constant from year to year.\u00a0 Each year, some students\u00a0with additional teaching needs will\u00a0leave and others will\u00a0enrol, broadly balancing the school profile.  Resources allocated under this model will not normally\u00a0be adjusted between allocations. <\/p>  <p>  The model\u00a0will, however,\u00a0allow for some additional provision for exceptional circumstances\u00a0or where a school&rsquo;s enrolment levels increase very\u00a0substantially prior to the next review of the model.  The Inclusion Support Service,\u00a0established under the National Council for Special Education will support schools in managing their special education teaching allocations in the first instance.

Details of the allocations for each school will also be provided to schools.<\/p><p>Schools will also be provided with Guidance\u00a0on how to manage and deploy their resources under the new allocation model, in order to ensure that they can provide additional teaching support for all pupils who need support in their school, taking into account their individual learning needs.<\/p><p>In addition my officials\u00a0and officials from the National Council for Special Education have engaged extensively with school management bodies, teacher and parent representative bodies and school principals to provide information on the model and how it will apply within all schools from September 2017.  Over the coming weeks my officials will host a number of regional seminars which will provide information directly to principals and school leaders on the new model and on the guidance materials which will be made available. <\/p><p>The Deputy will also be aware that my Department implemented a pilot of the proposed new Resource Teacher allocation model over the course of the 2015\/2016 school year.<\/p><p>A review of this pilot has been completed and has been published on my Departments website <i>www.education.ie<\/i>.<\/p><p>The review has indicated that the new model has been positively received by schools and parents.\u00a0<\/p><p>Schools indicated that they welcomed the increased flexibility and autonomy provided by the model to allocate resources based on need.  Most schools believe the model allows more scope for team teaching, targeted interventions, mix of in-class and group work, with less focus on withdrawal and one to one teaching.  Schools welcome the move away from the unnecessary labelling of children in order to secure resources.  Schools also welcomed that they no longer need to wait for diagnosis and that this facilitates intervention at an earlier stage based on the schools identification of need. <\/p><p>In addition schools indicated a belief that they were broadly well supported in meeting the needs of children with Special Educational Needs. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100063#WRH04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"question","counter":467,"qnumday":208,"qnumall":"[8500\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100063#WRH04500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he will address concerns that the NCSE is not accepting applications from schools for SEN supports for children with complex needs in 2017; and the way the NCSE expects to be informed in decisions made over resource teaching allocations without information submitted by schools on individual students' complex needs.","asker":"1225","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":468,"content":"<p>On 18th January last,\u00a0I announced that a new model for allocating Special Education Teaching Resources to mainstream primary and post primary schools will be introduced from September 2017. <\/p>  <p>  The basic aim of this new model is to deliver better outcomes for children with special educational needs.

Children who need support can have that support provided immediately rather than having to wait for a diagnosis.<\/p>  <p>  Schools will therefore no longer have to make applications, for newly enrolled pupils for whom resource teaching hours\u00a0may have been provided under the old model, as school will now a single allocation for all of their special education teaching needs, based on their school size and profile.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Accordingly, the NCSE advised schools that there was no longer a requirement for schools to make applications for special education teaching supports for individula\u00a0pupils with\u00a0special education teaching\u00a0needs, as resources\u00a0would be provided for schools by the\u00a0profiled allocation.<\/p>  <p>  For the introduction of the new allocation model, from September 2017, the NCSE &lsquo;Low Incidence&rsquo; allocations which had been made for each school during the preceding year 2016\/17 school year, have been used to establish the complex needs component of the new allocation model for each school.<\/p>  <p>  A model for the identification of pupils with complex needs in future is being devised by the NCSE, in consultation with the Health Service Executive and National Educational Psychological Services (NEPS).  This model will take account of the qualification criteria for the selection of children for access to HSE Children Disability Network Teams. <\/p>  <p>  For the next re profiling of the model, the pupils with newly identified Complex Needs will be included in this revised allocation, less any school leavers included in this category.<\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that this is a brand new model of allocation and is not comparable to the existing model.  By using a broad range of attainment and socio-economic criteria it is expected that allocations made to school will be\u00a0sufficient to meet both current and future needs as they arise until the next review. <\/p>  <p>  Currently most schools' educational profiles\u00a0remain relatively constant from year to year.\u00a0 Each year, some students\u00a0with additional teaching needs will\u00a0leave and others will\u00a0enrol, broadly balancing the school profile. <\/p>  <p>  The model will provide, from this year, additional resources to schools where it is expected that there will be additional needs.  In protecting resources in schools where the profiles indicate that the levels of need are\u00a0lower than are currently provided for some additional capacity is also provided for in those schools.  Accordingly, all schools should have the capacity to meet the needs of additional children enrolling in the school in the following school year without the need for additional or new resources. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The model\u00a0will, however,\u00a0allow for some additional provision for very\u00a0exceptional circumstances\u00a0or where a school&rsquo;s enrolment levels increase very\u00a0substantially prior to the next review of the model.  The Inclusion Support Service,\u00a0being established under the National Council for Special Education will support schools in managing their special education teaching allocations in the first instance.

Students with complex special educational needs. <\/p>  <p>  2. Percentages of students performing below a certain threshold on standardised test results<\/p>  <p>  3. Social context of school which includes gender, primary school location and educational disadvantage. <\/p>  <p>  The NCSE working group report considered that standardised test data provides a broad and objective basis to establish differences between schools in levels of relative overall student educational achievement. <\/p>  <p>  The report recommended that standardised test results should be used in building the educational profile of schools, as they link directly to the educational achievement of students in schools.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The use of standardised test scores will ensure that the school&rsquo;s educational profile includes students with low achievement in literacy and numeracy including those students whose special educational needs affect their learning achievement levels.<\/p>  <p>  The previous generalised allocation model, which was based primarily on school size, did not take account of the learning needs of pupils, or of the profile of pupils in the school.<\/p>  <p>  It was for this reason that the NCSE recommended that a profiled allocation be made for schools, which included consideration of standardised test scores.<\/p>  <p>  In calculating this element of schools&rsquo; educational profile\u00a0an aggregate of primary school standardised test results over 2013\/14 and 2014\/15 has been used for the first phase of the introduction of the new allocation model. <\/p>  <p>  For future re-profiling of the model, updated data will be used to create an aggregate of the school&rsquo;s learning support needs, which will ensure that an accurate picture of a school's profile over a period of time is developed. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In order to ensure that schools are not penalised for improving performance generally, no resources provided to\u00a0schools under the current model will be removed from the school on the introduction of the new model.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The use of standardised test data means that the school profile considers not just the number of pupils in the school, but also the learning needs of those pupils in that school who are performing at a level represented in the bottom 16% of the population, as evidenced by national attainment data.<\/p>  <p>  In this context, schools with strong performance on standardised tests should have no concerns on the impact of this on their profiles.  In calculating values for this component, no consideration is given to scores above Standard Ten scores 1 to 4.  Effectively, values are only accorded to the 16% of\u00a0students who would ordinarily fall within, or on the margins of, the learning support needs category.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  It should also be noted that the consideration of standardised test data forms only one part of the special educational needs profiled allocation for schools and there will not therefore be an over reliance on standardised test scores.<\/p>  <p>  A\u00a0new Circular and Guidance will be issued to schools in the coming weeks which will provide details of how the scheme will operate while details of the allocations for each school will also be provided to schools<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100063#WRH04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"question","counter":473,"qnumday":210,"qnumall":"[8502\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100063#WRH05100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he will address concerns that under the new NCSE allocation model for resource teaching hours, allocations will be based on socioeconomic background, which is not directly related to assessed conditions such as dyslexia, dyspraxia, ADHD, ASD or speech and language difficulties.","asker":"1225","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":474,"content":"<p>On 18th January last,\u00a0I announced that a new model for allocating Special Education Teaching Resources to mainstream primary and post primary schools will be introduced from September 2017. <\/p>  <p>  The basic aim of this new model is to deliver better outcomes for children with special educational needs.

The literature suggests that the diagnostic model itself has many shortcomings as a way of identifying students for additional resources.<\/p>  <p>  The NCSE recommended the development of a new model for the allocation of additional resource teaching supports for schools, based on the profiled needs of schools, as opposed to being based primarily on assessments of special educational needs for individual children attending the school.<\/p>  <p>  On 18th January last,\u00a0I announced that a new model for allocating Special Education Teaching Resources to mainstream primary and post primary schools will be introduced from September 2017.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The new allocation model is intended to ensure that schools can be resourced to provide support to all students who need additional help &ndash; whether the student has a professional assessment or is on a waiting list for a professional assessment.<\/p>  <p>  Schools will be frontloaded with resources, based on each school's profile, to provide supports immediately to those pupils who need it without delay.\u00a0 This will\u00a0reduce the administrative burden on schools as schools will no longer have to complete an application process annually and apply for newly enrolled pupils who require resource hours. <\/p>  <p>  Children who need support can have that support provided immediately rather than having to wait for a diagnosis.  A child may receive additional teaching support under the new allocation model if the school, using its school based assessment and the NEPS Continuum of Support, identifies that the child has learning needs<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100063#WRH05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects Status","counter":481,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100063#WRH05900"},{"type":"question","counter":482,"qnumday":213,"qnumall":"[8509\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100063#WRH06000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"when the letter of intent to the successful contractor for the building of a school (details supplied) will be issued; when the contracts will be signed and building works will commence; the estimated time from commencement of building works to completion of the project; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1324","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":483,"content":"<p>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that a comprehensive examination of the Tender Report for the project to which he refers\u00a0has been\u00a0completed by my Department&rsquo;s Professional and Technical staff.\u00a0 Currently, matters are in hand to complete the necessary Financial Robustness element of the tender process and to update the Cost Benefit Analysis Report with the tender figures for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.\u00a0 A Letter of Intent to the preferred bidder can issue as soon as these requirements under Public Procurement Procedures have been met and assuming that no issues arise from them.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Construction can begin\u00a0when the preferred bidder meets the conditions of the Letter of Intent.\u00a0\u00a0The contract for the project will have a 24 month duration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100063#WRH06100","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Accommodation Provision","counter":484,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100063#WRH06200"},{"type":"question","counter":485,"qnumday":214,"qnumall":"[8536\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100063#WRH06300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the serious lack of primary school places in Swords, County Dublin, where hundreds of children cannot gain access to junior infants; the steps he and his Department are taking to address this situation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1228","askee":"1293"},{"type":"question","counter":486,"qnumday":215,"qnumall":"[8537\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100063#WRH06400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he will provide the necessary school accommodation and resources to meet the additional demand for primary school places in Swords, County Dublin; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1228","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":487,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 214 and 215 together.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is currently reviewing the demographic data for the school planning area referred to by the Deputy as part of the overall demographic analyses of all school planning areas nationwide.\u00a0 My Department also has been\u00a0in direct contact with a number of primary schools in the area in respect of their junior infant capacity.

much lower than that in some schools not included within DEIS.\u00a0 If this turns out to be the case, then we must consider whether it is fair that those schools continue receiving these additional

The actions relating to well-being and mental health include: <\/p>  <p>- Delivery of a national programme to support all schools to implement the national Wellbeing in Post Primary Schools Guidelines for Mental Health Promotion and Suicide Prevention (2013) and Wellbeing in Primary Schools Guidelines for Mental Health Promotion (2015).\u00a0   This will involve collaboration of the HSE and DES support services. <\/p>  <p>- Introduction of Wellbeing as a subject at Junior Cycle:   Guidelines on Wellbeing in Junior Cycle have been developed by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) to support the Framework for Junior Cycle 2015.\u00a0\u00a0 The guidelines will be introduced to post-primary schools in September this year.\u00a0\u00a0 The Junior Cycle team are currently planning the support that will be in place for the implementation of the well-being Curriculum.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>- Increasing the capacity of NEPS: It is planned to enhance educational psychological service to schools, through the appointment of an additional 10 educational psychologists this year and an additional 65 in total by 2019.\u00a0   The focus of this year's additional support will be on extending the delivery of training to teachers in two specific evidence-informed programmes &ndash; the Incredible Years Teacher Programme and the Friends programmes. The Friends programmes when delivered by trained teachers, reduces anxiety and promotes coping, resilience and school-connectedness in children and young people, while the Incredible Years Teacher Programme strengthens the social and emotional competence of primary school children whose teacher has completed the programme.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>- Enhancing Guidance Counselling provision at post-primary level:   Recent budgets saw improvements in guidance allocation to schools, with Budgets 2016 and 2017 together seeing the allocation of the equivalent of 400 ex-quota\u00a0guidance posts, following budget measures in 2012 which removed the ex-quota provision for guidance posts (which amounted to some 600 posts). \u00a0The 400 guidance posts which have now been restored will be allocated separately and transparently and once again<\/p>  <p>- Responding to Critical Incidents Guidelines and Resource Materials  : These guidelines have been revised and re-issued to schools. Support in implementation and development of a Critical Incident Management team will be offered to schools in the 2017\/2018 academic year.<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0Interdepartmental collaboration<\/p>  <p>At Central Government level the Pathfinder Project: Youth Mental Health   has been initiated. This is led by the Department of Health. Finding new ways of tackling policy issues that are not the sole responsibility of any one Government Department or Agency has been prioritised by Government. Youth mental health and suicide prevention is one of three Pathfinder projects under Action 5 of the Civil Service Renewal Plan (2014) and agreed by the Civil Service Management Board.\u00a0 This Pathfinder Youth Mental Health Project is an initiative to innovate and improve whole-of-Government working on cross-cutting policy issues and improve the delivery of shared whole-of-Government projects to strengthen the prioritisation, management and accountability of cross-cutting projects that involve multiple Departments, Offices and Agencies. The project aims to ensure that policies that are not the priority or responsibility of a single body are effectively managed, supported and resourced. <\/p>  <p>  This project focuses \u00a0on the work of three Departments &ndash; DOH, DES, and DCYA &ndash; and the HSE.\u00a0 The DES has nominated a representative to work for one day each week with the DOH on this Youth Mental Health Pathfinder project.\u00a0 The Pathfinder will work and report within the parameters of Connecting for Life Irelands Strategy to Reduce Suicide (2015\/2020). <\/p>  <p>  It is anticipated that by end 2016 Pathfinder will have:<\/p>  <p>- developed an implementation plan to coordinate and give effect to identified actions relevant to youth mental health in Connecting for Life   and any other actions necessary to support and advance youth mental health and well-being;<\/p>  <p>  - determined new approaches to the implementation of these actions in conjunction with relevant delivery partners, which may involve small scale testing or piloting;<\/p>  <p>  - initiated implementation of priority youth mental health actions and<\/p>  <p>  - reported progress on a quarterly basis to the Civil Service Management Board and participated in sharing learning with other pathfinder and\/or cross-government projects.<\/p>  <p>In addition Minister McEntee has initiated a Taskforce on Youth Mental Health   as part of the programme for Government and my Department is represented on this Taskforce. \u00a0One of the challenges of providing a coordinated, streamlined approach to promoting well-being and mental health is of course the fact that there are so many statutory and voluntary agencies\/services\/NGOs involved.\u00a0 The Taskforce will consider how best to introduce and teach resilience, coping mechanisms, greater awareness to children and young people, and how to access support services voluntarily at a young age.\u00a0 It is intended that an action plan for addressing youth mental health will be the outcome of the Taskforce. \u00a0It is likely that in this context recommendations will be made with regard to community mental health services and agencies tasked with delivering services. My Department is actively involved in this work.\u00a0 <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100064#WRJ01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Education Grants","counter":516,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100064#WRJ01750"},{"type":"question","counter":517,"qnumday":225,"qnumall":"[8585\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100064#WRJ01800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the hardship being imposed on students that apply for a higher education grant through SUSI, whereby they are only granted an adjacent rate of grant due to the fact that the distance calculations used use road routes which are the shortest in distance but the most inaccessible (details supplied); and if he will review the distance calculations method in view of upgraded road networks.","asker":"1278","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":518,"content":"<p>The current qualifying distance of 45km for the higher non-adjacent rate of student grant, takes into account a reasonable radius within which students may commute on a daily basis. <\/p>  <p>  The measurement of the distances relating to the award of adjacent or non-adjacent rates of student grant is a matter for the relevant grant awarding authority.

Over the lifetime of the Plan, 50,000 people will be registered on apprenticeship and traineeship programmes which represents a doubling of current activity. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, a campaign to promote apprenticeship is currently being developed by SOLAS in consultation with key partners, including the Apprenticeship Council.  The campaign will raise awareness and promote the value of apprenticeship for individual apprentices and for employers and it will cover both existing apprenticeships and the new apprenticeships now coming on stream.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100065#WRK00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1351"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Funding","counter":576,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100065#WRK00750"},{"type":"question","counter":577,"qnumday":245,"qnumall":"[9097\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100065#WRK00800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the public funding supplied to trade unions and representative bodies in 2015 and 2016 from his Department, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1341","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":578,"content":"<p>The information sought by the Deputy is currently being compiled by my Department and will be forwarded shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100065#WRK00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","counter":580,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100065#WRK01000"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Agencies Data","counter":579,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100065#WRK00950"},{"type":"question","counter":580,"qnumday":246,"qnumall":"[8736\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100065#WRK01000","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"the status of the Docklands oversight and consultative forum, including membership, meetings to date and its workplan for the year.","asker":"1259","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":581,"content":"<p>The Dublin Docklands Development Authority (Dissolution) Act 2015, which facilitated the wind-up of the Authority, provided in Part 5 for the establishment of a Docklands Oversight and Consultative Forum on a statutory basis.

Currently, the MTR scheme relies on AHBs to purchase from lenders properties that have been voluntarily surrendered by eligible borrowers. <\/p>  <p>  It is a clear priority of the Government to maximise delivery of social housing to cater for the greatest level of need, while also achieving value for money.  The provision of social housing is carried out by local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) through a range of delivery methods, including construction, acquisition, leasing and other approaches, which allow local authorities, as housing authorities, to respond flexibly to meet local demand and operate within local property circumstances. Significant Exchequer support has been provided by Government to support this endeavour.  While there are obvious social and economic benefits to be derived from the MTR scheme, most significantly by facilitating individual households in mortgage arrears to remain in their home, detailed consideration needs to be given to the impact on the capacity of local authorities and AHBS to meet the ambitious targets around new social housing supply in respect of any proposal to intensify their investment and involvement in the MTR scheme. <\/p>  <p>  In parallel, the Government has been actively exploring potential mechanisms that would facilitate investment in the housing market, in particular social housing, in a manner that does not impact on the General Government Balance.  A number of  private equity firms have expressed an interest in purchasing mortgage debt portfolios from commercial banks with a view to exploring the potential for them to access the MTR scheme model for the borrowers in occupation of the mortgaged property.  They are seeking an alternative arrangement that would see the mortgaged property staying in the funding firm&rsquo;s ownership and the property itself leased back to the local authority in circumstances where the borrower is eligible for MTR and the borrower would therefore remain in their own home. <\/p>  <p>  One of the outcomes of the Review is that in order to test the operability of alternative funding models for the scheme, the Housing Agency will work with a number of financial entities who have come forward with an interest in working with the MTR scheme to progress a number of pilot alternative lease arrangements.  The objective is to explore what is available within the current market and to determine if this alternative model will benefit a greater number of households.      <\/p>  <p>  A detailed financial assessment of the structure of the funding of the MTR scheme will be undertaken in advance of the budgetary process for 2018.  The assessment will be informed by the early impact of the other actions proposed by the review, as well as the outcome of the experience with the pilot lease arrangements, and the availability of financial resources overall, including in the context of the significant investment currently being made by Government through local authorities and AHBs in terms of developing new social housing supply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100065#WRK03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rent Controls","counter":614,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100065#WRK03350"},{"type":"question","counter":615,"qnumday":259,"qnumall":"[8329\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100065#WRK03400","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"the penalties applicable to landlords that violate the maximum allowable rent increases in rent pressure zones, the way this will be policed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1254","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":616,"content":"<p>Where a landlord carries out a rent review, a notice of new rent must be served on the tenant.

Currently, the MTR scheme relies on AHBs to purchase from lenders properties that have been voluntarily surrendered by eligible borrowers.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has been actively exploring potential mechanisms that would facilitate investment in social housing, including the off-balance sheet potential of private institutional investment. A number of private equity firms have expressed an interest in purchasing mortgage debt portfolios from commercial banks with a view to exploring the potential for them to access the MTR scheme model for the borrowers in occupation of the mortgaged property. <\/p>  <p>  One of the outcomes of the Review is that in order to test the operability of alternative funding models for the scheme, the Housing Agency will work with a number of financial entities who have come forward with an interest in working with the MTR scheme to progress a number of pilot alternative lease arrangements. In advance of these pilots, a targeted market testing exercise is currently underway by the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA), on behalf of my Department, to test the suitability of the proposed enhanced leasing arrangements to ascertain if they would be viable for a mortgage to rent cohort. <\/p>  <p>  The agreed Programme for a Partnership Government recognises the potential role that credit unions can play in housing finance and supports the efforts of the Registrar of Credit Unions at the Central Bank to gradually lift current lending restrictions as appropriate, including for housing. The Programme further provides that we will investigate with all stakeholders how credit unions can support the delivery of social housing.  <\/p>  <p>  Conscious of the independence of the Central Bank in its regulatory role in respect of credit unions, bilateral engagement has taken place between my Department and the Department of Finance to consider the potential regulatory and legislative implications of credit union involvement in the social housing sector. I acknowledge the willingness of credit unions to actively seek a role in financing the delivery of social housing. I and my Department have had ongoing contact with the credit union movement to contribute to this process by providing necessary technical advice and support.  <\/p>  <p>  In the context of the expressed interest of credit unions in providing finance for the delivery of social housing, the potential scope for credit union involvement in the planned new MTR pilot projects is being examined. My colleague, Minister of State Damien English and my Department are currently consulting with credit union representatives in this regard. <\/p>  <p>  Overall, these pilot projects are in a developmental stage and my Department is working with the Housing Agency to scope out the necessary terms and conditions that should apply. It is my intention that this scoping, together with the market testing being undertaken by the NDFA and consultation with other Government Departments responsible for policy and regulation relevant to the operation of the scheme, will be concluded in the coming weeks. At that point, I will be in a better position to set-out in more detail how the pilots will operate and how the private investors will be selected.  <\/p>  <p>  The Review of the MTR also included a commitment to undertaking a detailed financial assessment of the structure of the funding of the MTR scheme in advance of the budgetary process for 2018. The assessment will be informed by the early impact of the other actions proposed by the review, as well as the outcome of the experience with the pilot lease arrangements, and the availability of financial resources overall.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100066#WRL00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Planning Framework","counter":645,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100066#WRL00700"},{"type":"question","counter":646,"qnumday":269,"qnumall":"[8513\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100066#WRL00800","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"the nature and detail of the relationship between existing regional planning frameworks and guidelines and the new national planning framework; and if existing regional plans will have to have regard to the national planning framework and thus could be altered by the Office of the Planning Regulator if they are not deemed to be in line with the new national plan if the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2016 is passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas.","asker":"1217","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":647,"content":"<p>The National Planning Framework, titled Ireland 2040 - Our Plan, will set a new strategic planning and development framework for the co-ordination of a range of national, regional and local authority policies and activities, planning and investment including new Regional Spatial and Economic Strategies (RSES) to be prepared by the three Regional Assemblies established under the Local Government Act 2014 and which strategies will succeed the current Regional Planning Guidelines prepared by the now defunct Regional Authorities which the Assemblies have replaced.

Its objective is to avoid the significant effects of social isolation and limiting of opportunities that can occur with large mono - tenure estates, frequently necessitating the irregeneration and remediation at a later stage with consider able cost exposure to the State.  This policy approach was reaffirmed in the Social Housing Strategy 2020 published in November 2014 which further defined sustainable neighbourhoods as &ldquo;areas where an efficient use of land, high quality urban design and effective integration in the provision of physical and social infrastructure such as public transport, schools, amenities and other facilities combine to create places people want to live&rdquo;.<\/p><p>My Department has produced considerable planning guidance, including <i>Sustainable Residential Development in Urban Areas <\/i>(2010) and the <i>Manual for Urban Roads and<\/i><i>Streets<\/i>(2013) to assist local authorities to promote Sustainable Communities.

Indeed, a range of measures have already been taken to reduce the monthly repayments of these borrowers. <\/p><p>An innovative Shared Ownership Restructuring Option has been available to Shared Ownership borrowers from 1 April 2016. This new restructuring option for SO borrowers involves rolling up all outstanding debt under a SO arrangement into a single annuity loan-i.e. the new restructured loan principal will comprise any outstanding annuity loan balance, rental equity balance, plus any arrears - with an all-sums-owing mortgage charge applying to the property. The term of the annuity loan will be determined by the amount of the monthly repayment deemed to be affordable and sustainable for each SO borrower. This restructuring option allows the borrower to have a regularised, restructured repayment solution which is more easily understood. The restructuring option can lead to full home ownership for the borrower and as such allows for up\/down sizing to suit household needs. This arrangement may be of particular benefit to those SO borrowers who are nearing the end of their annuity term but who have not made sufficient provision for the repayment of their rental equity balance. The option may not be appropriate in all cases.  For example, in some instances, continuing with the current SO arrangement may be the best option for both the SO borrower and the local authority, or in other cases where the outstanding debt may not be sustainable for the borrower in the long-term, the Local Authority Mortgage to Rent (LAMTR) option might ultimately be the appropriate solution.  <\/p><p>Details on the measures available to borrowers with Shared Ownership arrangements are available from their local authority. <\/p><p>Overall, local authority borrowers are encouraged to engage with their local authority at the earliest opportunity if they are having difficulty making the repayments on their Shared Ownership arrangement.

This compared to 14.4% the year before.  The at-risk-of-poverty rate increased from 25.2% to 34.8% and basic deprivation rose from 51.3% to 53.2% for this group in 2015.  However, these figures (like other statistics for very small groups in the survey) have been volatile in recent years.  This is due to smaller sample sizes.  It is not possible to say with certainty whether the changes over the year are statistically significant and indicative of a sustained trend.<\/p>  <p>  Given the continuing economic recovery throughout 2016 and measures introduced in Budgets 2016 and 2017, it is reasonable to expect future figures to show improvements.  I will continue to work with my Government colleagues to ensure that the economic recovery is experienced in all regions and by all families, households and individuals. <\/p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s strategy for addressing poverty and social exclusion is set out in the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion.  The Plan identifies a wide range of targeted actions and interventions to achieve the overall objective of reducing consistent poverty.  The Department will review the Plan this year, as it reaches the end of its current term, with a view to developing an updated plan for future periods.  The Department will also review the national social target for poverty reduction.  This review will be undertaken in consultation with relevant stakeholders.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is committed to increasing the employment opportunities for people with a disability.  The Comprehensive Employment Strategy for people with disabilities adopts a cross-government approach that brings together various measures, to be taken by different Departments and State agencies, in a concerted effort to address the barriers and challenges that impact on the employment of people with disabilities.  The six strategic priorities are to: build skills, capacity and independence; provide bridges and supports into work; make work pay; promote job retention and re-entry into work; provide co-ordinated and seamless support; and engage employers.  These priorities are incorporated into the Pathways to Work Strategy and this ensures that there is an integrated focus on supports that enable people with disabilities to participate in employment where they have the capacity to do so.<\/p>  <p>  My Department provides a range of specific income, activation and employment supports for people with a disability.  For instance, the partial capacity benefit scheme enables recipients of invalidity pension and illness benefit to take-up employment, on a voluntary basis, while continuing to receive income support.  The Department manages a supported employment service (EmployAbility) which provides a dedicated job-coaching service for people with disabilities.  Intreo services are also available to provide employment support services for people with disabilities who wish to engage with the service on a voluntary basis.  There is also a focus on supports available to employers who employ people with disabilities such as the Wage Subsidy Scheme and the Workplace Equipment Adaption Grant Scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100067#WRM00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"question","counter":722,"qnumday":296,"qnumall":"[7023\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100067#WRM01000","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"his views on the latest CSO survey on income and living conditions, SILC, report which shows that over 390,000 children are living in households experiencing deprivation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1367","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":723,"content":"<p>I welcome the latest CSO Survey on Income and Living Conditions results for 2015, showing improvements in living conditions and at tackling poverty.  The CSO Survey on Income and Living Conditions (SILC) for 2015 shows that 31.4 per cent of children experienced deprivation. While this is higher than the national rate, this is a reduction on the 2014 figure of 36.1 per cent or 51,000 children.  The full impact of the recovery is not yet reflected in these figures. Ireland has returned to strong economic and employment growth.<\/p>  <p>  Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures: The national policy framework for children and young people, published by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs in 2014, includes a target to reduce child poverty by two-thirds by 2020.  Under this Framework, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in collaboration with my Department and other relevant Departments is taking a whole-of-government approach to tackling child poverty.<\/p>  <p>A key driver in preventing poverty among children is social transfers, such as welfare payments and child benefit. Using Eurostat data, social transfers (excluding pensions) reduced the at-risk-of-poverty rate for children from 42% to 18%, a poverty reduction effect of 58%. Ireland is among the best in the EU for reducing poverty through social transfers; well above the EU average of 39%, ranking 2nd of the 28 member states.<\/p>  <p>  The monthly unemployment rate in January 2017 announced by the CSO was 7.1%, down from a peak of 15% in 2012. As unemployment is strongly linked to poverty, we can expect further decreases in poverty as the figures for 2016 and 2017 become available. The Government continues to focus helping people back into the workforce. <\/p>  <p>  Budget 2017 increased the weekly rates of payment for working age schemes and also raised the income disregard for one-parent family payment and jobseeker&rsquo;s transition payment recipients.  These measures will help to tackle child poverty. <\/p>  <p>  Continued economic recovery, together with Government action to sustain and develop the social welfare system, will support further reductions in poverty over the coming years.<\/p>  <p>  However, reducing child poverty is not just about income supports and welfare.  Rather it is also about supporting parents to make the transition into employment and assisting families through the provision of quality and affordable services in areas such as childcare, education and health.<\/p>  <p>  That is why one of the most important measures contained in Budget 2017 for tackling child poverty was the announcement that the Department of Children and Youth Affairs will implement next year the new Single Affordable Childcare Scheme.  This scheme is a step change in State support for childcare in Ireland.  It is an important scheme as it will significantly reduce the cost of childcare for low income parents and will provide further substantial support for families to lift themselves out of poverty by taking up employment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100067#WRM01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"question","counter":725,"qnumday":297,"qnumall":"[7024\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100067#WRM01200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"his views on the levels of constant poverty of children living in households headed by one parent, in the recent EU survey on income and living conditions, SILC, report; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1367","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":726,"content":"<p>It is assumed that the Deputy is referring to the consistent poverty rate of children living in households headed by one parent.<\/p>  <p>  The latest CSO Survey on Income and Living Conditions (SILC) for 2015 shows that the consistent poverty rate for lone parent households is 26.2%, up from 25% in 2014. The deprivation rate for lone parent households fell from 58.7 per cent in 2014 to 57.9% in 2015.  The at-risk-of-poverty rate for lone parent households is largely unchanged in 2015 at 36.2%, compared to 36.5% in 2014.  The data also shows that the consistent poverty rate for children fell from 12.7% in 2014 to 11.5% in 2015.<\/p>  <p>  This SILC data for 2015 also shows that being at work reduces the consistent poverty rate for lone parents by three-quarters, highlighting that the best way to tackle poverty among lone parents is to assist them into employment. <\/p>  <p>  The full impact of the recovery is not reflected in these 2015 figures. Macro-economic and labour market indicators have shown continued economic and employment growth since then.  Unemployment has fallen from 9.5% in mid-2015 to 7.1% in January 2017.  The number of people in receipt of working-age income and employment supports continues to fall.  The full impact of the reforms to the one-parent family payment (OFP) and the positive impact of recent Budgets on lone parents are also not reflected in these figures. <\/p>  <p>  In Budget 2016 lone parents benefitted from a number of measures including increases in child benefit, changes to the means test on the jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment to align it with the more generous means test on the one-parent family payment, and increases in the family income supplement thresholds.  In Budget 2017 all lone parents on OFP, the jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment (JST) and jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance (JA) will benefit from the &euro;5 increase in the weekly rates of payment from March. A new &euro;500 annual Cost of Education Allowance will be made available to Back to Education Allowance participants with children from the next academic year in September. In addition, the income disregards for OFP and JST have risen by &euro;20 from January this year, from &euro;90 to &euro;110 per week, reversing in part previous reductions, to encourage one parent families to stay in, and return to, work.  During that time the national minimum wage was increased from &euro;8.65 to &euro;9.25 per hour.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Social Protection&rsquo;s social impact assessment of Budget 2017 showed that average household incomes increase by 1%. Non-earning lone parents were the biggest beneficiary of Budget 2017 with gains of 4.5%. Working lone parents also experienced above average gains at almost 1.2%.  This represents a cumulative increase across Budgets 2015, 2016 and 2017 almost &euro;27 per week for working lone parents and of over &euro;24 per week for lone parents who are not working.<\/p>  <p>  One of the most important measures contained in Budget 2017 for tackling child poverty was the announcement that the Department of Children and Youth Affairs will implement next year the new Single Affordable Childcare Scheme.  This scheme is a step change in State support for childcare in Ireland.  It is an important scheme as it will significantly reduce the cost of childcare for low income parents and will provide further substantial support for families to lift themselves out of poverty by taking up employment.<\/p>  <p>  Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures: the national policy framework for children and young people, published by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs in 2014, includes a target to reduce child poverty by two-thirds by 2020.  Meeting this target means lifting 102,000 children out of poverty.  Under this Framework, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in collaboration with the Department of Social Protection and other relevant Departments is taking a whole-of-government approach to tackling child poverty.<\/p>  <p>  Eurostat data shows that social transfers (excluding pensions) reduced the at-risk-of-poverty rate from 34.9% to 16.9%, an absolute reduction of 18 percentage points.  In relative terms, this represents a poverty reduction effect of 52%.  Ireland continues to be consistently among the best performing EU countries in reducing poverty through social transfers.  But we also know that, reducing poverty for lone parents is not just about income support.  It is also about supporting lone parents to make the transition into employment and assisting these families through the provision of quality services in areas such as activation including education, training and employment supports, and childcare.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the OFP reforms the Department has begun engaging with lone parents whose youngest child is seven years and older, on a proactive and supported basis. To date over 9,000 lone parents, of the 14,500 lone parents who are on the jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment, have been selected for engagement.  It will take time to see the full impact of these activation engagements as it will take time for lone parents to complete the education, training or employment support programmes.<\/p>  <p>  Data from the latest Quarterly National Household Survey also shows that there has been a significant increase in the percentage of lone parents in employment in the year since the end of June 2016. This increase relates to all lone parents in the State and reflects the increase in economic and employment growth generally. The magnitude of the increase for lone parents specifically, however, is clearly significant. <\/p>  <p>  Continued economic recovery, together with the actions outlined above will support further reductions in poverty over the coming years.  The independent review of the one-parent family payment reforms, once completed, will also assist with discussions in my Department on measures for lone parents in Budget 2018. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100067#WRM01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Treatment Benefit Scheme Eligibility","counter":727,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100067#WRM01350"},{"type":"question","counter":728,"qnumday":298,"qnumall":"[8475\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100067#WRM01400","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"when access to the treatment benefit scheme will be extended to the self-employed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1318","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":729,"content":"<p>As announced in Budget 2017, the treatment benefit scheme is being extended to cover self-employed contributors for the first time from March 2017.

Overall, 58.8% of the 25,406 appeals which were finalised in 2015 had a favourable outcome for the appellant, i.e. were either allowed in full or in part, or resolved by way of a revised decision by a Deciding Officer\/Designated Person.  59.2% of the 23,220 appeals finalised in 2016 had a favourable outcome for the appellant.<\/p><p>Of the 18,913 appeals which were finalised by Appeals Officers in 2015, 6,886 (36.4%) were determined following an oral hearing.  4,444 (64.5%) of these had a favourable outcome for the appellant.  Of the 16,990 appeals finalised by Appeals Officers in 2016, 6,527 (38.4%) were determined following an oral hearing.  4,251 (65.1%) of these had a favourable outcome for the appellant.<\/p><p>There are a number of reasons why a decision which was refused at first instance might be successful on appeal and it is not necessarily the case that the first decision was wrong. <\/p><p>Where new evidence is provided with an appeal, the original decision may be revised by the Deciding Officer or Designated Person. This was the case in some 35% of favourable appeal outcomes in 2015 and some 37% of favourable appeal outcomes in 2016. Where the decision is not revised in the Department in light of the appeal contentions, further evidence is often provided by the appellant as the appeal process proceeds. In addition, the Appeals Officer may gain insights when they meet the appellant in person at oral hearing which may also influence the outcome of the appeal.<\/p><p>Social Welfare legislation provides that an Appeals Officer may determine an appeal without an oral hearing where s\/he is of the opinion that it can be determined fairly on the basis of the documentary evidence provided.  In general, where there is a conflict in the documentary evidence presented, an Appeals Officer will convene an oral hearing in order to explore the evidence and seek to resolve any conflict.<\/p><p>In addition, where an appellant requests an oral hearing, the request is generally granted unless the Appeals Officer is of the opinion that the appeal can be allowed on a summary basis, or where there is clearly nothing to be gained by granting an oral hearing. An example of this would be where the appeal question relates to PRSI contribution conditions or means and the underlying PRSI contribution figures or means are not disputed.  <\/p><p>I trust this

the overall improvement in the labour market, youth unemployment continues to fall with a rate of 13.5% (27,500 persons) in January 2017 estimated by the CSO, as compared to 18.1% (33,800) persons in January 2016 and a peak of over 31% (70,600 persons) in 2012.<\/p>  <p>  While systemised data is not readily available on employment outcomes on all programmes specifically for those jobseekers under 25, some indicative figures are available.  For example:<\/p>  <p>  - The evaluation of JobBridge by Indecon (report published October 2016) shows on the basis of self-reported survey results that 61% of interns aged 20 to 24 years (and 53.8% of those aged 15-19) were currently in employment at the time of the survey.  Overall, individuals similar to those who participated in JobBridge had a 36.6% probability of securing employment within one year, whereas the JobBridge interns&rsquo; probability of securing employment within one year increased to 48.4% (an 11.8 percentage point difference and a 32% increase in the probability of becoming employed).<\/p>  <p>  - JobsPlus provides subsidies to employers for the full-time employment of those formerly long-term unemployed on the Live Register.  In October 2016 there were 4,323 participants benefitting from JobsPlus, 765 (17.7%) of whom were under 25.<\/p>  <p>  - In 2015 the level of satisfaction among under 25 year old Intreo clients with getting on to course, training or getting a job was very high at 4.27, of a possible maximum of 5.<\/p>  <p>  - 2016 results from the Customer Satisfaction Survey will be published shortly and show a similar high level of satisfaction among under 25 year olds Intreo clients with getting on to course, training or getting a job.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Government&rsquo;s policies to support the young unemployed, the first intervention is to provide case officer support to help newly unemployed young people find and secure sustainable jobs.  There is monthly engagement with all young jobseekers by a case officer, and a Personal Progression Plan is developed to chart the steps to be taken to facilitate a return to employment, which may include further education and training or other opportunities.<\/p>  <p>  For those who do not find employment, through the process just described, additional offers are provided for.  Most such offers (over 70%) are in existing further education or training programmes.  Others are in existing community-based employment programmes\/workplace based interventions such as CE, Gateway and T&uacute;s and First Steps; or in subsidies to employers, through JobsPlus Youth.  Long-term unemployed jobseekers under 25 are also referred to JobPath, a contracted, payment-by-results employment services that provides additional resources and supports to those long-term unemployed.<\/p>  <p>  Pathways to Work 2016 to 2020 sets additional targets in relation to addressing youth unemployment: 1) increase the relative share of workplace-based interventions (Gateway, T&Uacute;S, Positive to Work etc.) for youth unemployed; 2) to ensure the frequency of engagement with all young unemployed people is a minimum of one case officer meeting per month; 3) restructure the First Steps programme for young unemployed people to improve take-up by offering a higher level of support to jobseekers and employers &ndash; these consolidate reforms undertaken in previous Pathways to Work strategies; the fourth action, to implement the Defence Forces Skills for Life employment support programme, is a new programme.  The First Steps Programme has now been restructured and the pilot Skills For Life programme has been completed.<\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that these policy measures, together with an improving labour market, will continue to address youth unemployment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100068#WRN00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Community Welfare Services Provision","counter":787,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100068#WRN00500"},{"type":"question","counter":788,"qnumday":318,"qnumall":"[8789\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100068#WRN00600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the extent to which community welfare services remain readily accessible in all areas throughout County Kildare with particular reference to meeting out-of-hours emergency needs when necessary; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":789,"content":"<p>In Co. Kildare, the restructured Community Welfare Service which was formerly available two mornings per week at walk-in clinics is now available at all times through initial telephone contact, which means the service can be delivered without the need to attend a clinic.  Telephone calls are followed by appointments or home visit if necessary, or application by post for non-urgent claims.  All calls are returned within 1 working day and emergency calls are prioritised.  Where any customers are not able, for reasons of illness or disability, to attend an appointment, arrangements will be made to see them in their home.<\/p><p>Prior to the restructuring, several changes to the operation of the Supplementary Welfare Allowance Scheme (SWA) in Kildare had already been made.  All claims for Rent Supplement were centralised to a dedicated unit.  A system of Integrated Decisions was put in place in Newbridge Local Office in order to expedite claims for Jobseekers Allowance, Jobseekers Benefit and One Parent Family payment and thus minimise the recourse to SWA in these cases.  The result of these initiatives has been to greatly reduce the dependence on SWA, and the local Community Welfare Service, in local areas.  The main business now transacted locally is applications for Exceptional Needs Payments.<\/p><p>All services are monitored on an ongoing basis to ensure adequate services continue to be available.

Both the jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit and the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance schemes provide significant support to unemployed persons so that they can work up to 3 days a week and still retain access to a reduced jobseeker&rsquo;s payment.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the two jobseeker&rsquo;s schemes my Department&rsquo;s main in-work support is the family income supplement (FIS), which targets families with children on low incomes and who work at least 19 hrs per week.  The payment effectively preserves the incentive to take up or remain in employment in circumstances where the employee might only be marginally better off than if s\/he were claiming other social welfare payments.<\/p>  <p>  Where a long term unemployed jobseeker is offered employment of more than 3 days but less than 24 hours a week, they may be eligible for the part-time job incentive scheme.  Under this scheme they can receive a weekly payment of &euro;119 per week if they are single or &euro;193.90 if they have an adult dependent.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is also currently analysing incentives to work in the social welfare system for jobseekers with children with a view to developing the Working Family Payment.  The two main principles guiding the development of the Working Family Payment are to make work pay and to reduce child poverty.<\/p>  <p>  This analysis is supplemented by research from the ESRI, which shows that people are better off in work than on welfare.  The ESRI research, based on an analysis of current incomes, benefits and taxes, demonstrates that more than eight out of ten unemployed jobseekers would see their income increase by at least forty per cent upon taking up employment.  Fewer than three per cent would, in the short-term, be financially better off not in work.<\/p>  <p>  The risk of facing weak financial incentives to work is higher for unemployed persons with a spouse and children, as the income support goal of the welfare system means that they tend to have higher welfare payments.  However, even among that group, fewer than one in fifteen would be financially better off not working.  With the introduction of the Back to Work Family Dividend (BTWFD) scheme, that figure drops to one in twenty.<\/p>  <p>  The combination of jobseekers, FIS, BTWFD and the part-time job incentive schemes provides considerable income support for individuals who have part time employment by allowing them retain access to a social welfare payment.<\/p>  <p>  Reflecting the impact of government policy, and the overall improvement in the labour market, long term unemployment continues to fall.

As a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, the Government is determined that all aspects of the Agreement are fully respected in the context of the Brexit process.<\/p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s priority is to ensure that the Good Friday Agreement and the overall balance of the settlement is not in any way disturbed by the UK&rsquo;s exit from the European Union.  The potential impacts on the Good Friday Agreement are being considered from legal and other perspectives as part of this ongoing work, with advice and assistance by the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office and my own Department&rsquo;s Legal Division as required.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach and Prime Minister May have reaffirmed that the Agreement remains the basis for the two Governments&rsquo; approach to Northern Ireland.  It is important to underline that the legal obligations and political commitments of both the Irish and British Governments under the Good Friday Agreement remain unchanged, regardless of the status of the UK within the EU.<\/p>  <p>  As we look to protect and preserve the gains of the peace process through the challenges of Brexit, the crucial importance of achieving the full promise of the Good Friday Agreement is further underlined.  The Government&rsquo;s firm position is that the Good Friday Agreement and the successor Agreements must be implemented in full, and this is reflected in the Programme for Partnership Government.  The Agreements, and the principles and values underpinning them, are at the core of the Government&rsquo;s approach to peace, reconciliation and prosperity on this island.  The Government will continue to work tirelessly for that full implementation in both letter and spirit.<\/p>  <p>  Achieving the full potential of the Good Friday Agreement was a key theme in the very productive Sectorial Dialogue on Human Rights under the Good Friday Agreement that I convened on 13 February, as part of the All-Island Civic Dialogue on Brexit.  As co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, the Government takes very seriously its responsibility to safeguard its institutions and principles including in the area of human rights.  Human rights are central to the peace process and must be protected and sustained, regardless of the UK&rsquo;s status in the EU.  The Government will continue to work closely with the British Government and the Northern Ireland Executive to ensure that the protection of human rights remains at the heart of civic life, politics and ongoing societal change in Northern Ireland.  This includes the continued incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights in Northern Ireland law as provided for in the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p>  <p>  The interlocking political institutions represent the heart of the Good Friday Agreement.  It is therefore critical that the devolved Assembly and Executive are promptly re-established after the forthcoming elections.  There is an indispensable role for the devolved power-sharing institutions in Northern Ireland in managing the implications of Brexit.  This includes the very good work and cooperation at the North South Ministerial Council, which the Government is keen to see resumed at the earliest possible opportunity after the upcoming elections.<\/p>  <p>  Effective devolved Government, underpinned by a genuine spirit of partnership, is what the people of Northern Ireland voted for in 1998 and what they expect their politicians to deliver.  After the election, it will therefore fall to the parties to form a power-sharing Executive and this will require the parties to find a way forward on issues which contributed to the calling of the election.  In this regard, it is of the utmost importance that all parties bear in mind the principles of mutual respect, partnership and equality, which underpin the Good Friday Agreement.  The Government is of course always ready to support and assist the parties in any way we can - our commitment as a co-guarantor of the Agreement is a constant one.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100068#WRN05900","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Israeli Settlements","counter":842,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100068#WRN06000"},{"type":"question","counter":843,"qnumday":337,"qnumall":"[5774\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100068#WRN06100","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if the most recent settlements in Israel will be discussed at the next European Council meeting; and if he plans to speak on the issue.","asker":"1224","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":844,"content":"<p>The agenda for the next meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council is decided by the High Representative.

Accordingly, I share the concerns of other EU partners regarding this development.  I have noted the clarification issued by the Embassy of the United States in Dublin on 31 January, 2017, to the effect that the Executive Order in question does not restrict the travel of dual nationals to the United States, so long as they hold the passport of an unrestricted country and possess a valid US visa, if required.  Since then, the US courts have intervened and imposed a temporary suspension on the implementation of the Executive Order.<\/p>  <p>  Both the recent Executive Order and the question of immigration reform were high on the agenda during my visit to Washington DC from 31 January to 2 February.  I had a number of engagements with the Administration and Congressional leaders, including the Speaker of the US House of Representatives, the House majority leader and the House minority leader, among others.<\/p>  <p>  In my meetings with Congressional leaders, as well as with the &ndash; now former &ndash; US National Security Advisor, General Flynn, I expressed Ireland&rsquo;s deep concerns with regard to the nature and impact of the recent Executive Order.  In response, General Flynn outlined to me the rationale - in terms of US immigration policy - for these temporary measures, while I pointed out their damaging consequences in humanitarian terms, as well as for the international reputation of the United States.<\/p>  <p>  Achieving relief for the undocumented Irish citizens in the United States and securing greater legal pathways for migration to the United States remain key objectives for the Government.  These priorities featured in all of my meetings in Washington, DC &ndash; including with General Flynn, with Speaker Ryan and with other Congressional leaders.<\/p>  <p>  Both the Administration and members of Congress are fully aware of the importance of this issue for Ireland and appreciate our strong and continuing interest in securing immigration reform.  The Taoiseach&rsquo;s forthcoming visit to Washington, DC, for St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day will provide a key opportunity to raise the issue of immigration reform &ndash; especially the plight of our undocumented &ndash; directly with the US administration at the highest levels.<\/p>  <p>  During my recent visit, I also met with members of the Irish community in Washington, DC, and re-assured them of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to immigration reform.  I emphasised that, while the political context in Washington may have changed, the Government&rsquo;s objectives remain constant: relief for the undocumented and finding greater pathways for legal migration.  I noted that we can only advance these objectives if we engage and articulate our views with key policymakers in the Administration and Congress.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to stress the fact that the Embassy in Washington, DC, and our Consulates across the United States, continue to work with Irish Immigration centres on a daily basis in providing support to Irish citizens in the United States.<\/p>  <p>  Our Ambassador to the United States, Anne Anderson, held a workshop with key immigration stake-holders from across the United States at the Embassy on 12 January last.  The Government and my Department is committed to providing practical support to undocumented Irish citizens across the US, while also continuing to advocate for immigration reform.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100068#WRN07000","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Issues","counter":853,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100068#WRN07100"},{"type":"question","counter":854,"qnumday":340,"qnumall":"[5894\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100068#WRN07200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his views on the comments of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland on ruling out special status for Northern Ireland in view of the fact that it would weaken its position within the United Kingdom.","asker":"1224","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":855,"content":"<p>Protecting the peace process and Northern Ireland is one of the Government&rsquo;s four headline priorities in dealing with the UK decision to leave the European Union.  The Government has made clear that we will be working for special arrangements which take account of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s unique circumstances.  Our priority is to ensure that the Good Friday Agreement and the overall balance of the settlement is not in any way disturbed by the UK&rsquo;s exit from the European Union and of course to maintain the open border on the island of Ireland and the Common Travel Area.  The hard-won peace on the island must be protected.<\/p><p>The established framework for all engagement on Northern Ireland is the Good Friday Agreement.  This has been strongly reaffirmed by the Government and the British Government following the UK decision to leave the European Union.  The Good Friday Agreement is an international treaty, registered with the United Nations and it provides for a unique political and constitutional settlement in Northern Ireland, which is the foundation of the peace process.  This is something the European Union as a whole has long recognised and supported.  From my engagement with all of my EU counterparts, as well as with the EU institutions, most notably my recent discussions with Michel Barnier, Chair of the European Commission Taskforce on Brexit, and Guy Verhofstadt, Brexit lead for the European Parliament, there is deep appreciation of the EU&rsquo;s role and contribution in support of the peace process and a wish to continue that support, regardless of the challenges and impacts of Brexit.<\/p><p>At their meeting in Dublin on 30 January, The Taoiseach discussed with Prime Minister May the serious implications of Brexit for Northern Ireland and the imperative of retaining the open border on the island of Ireland.  There will be a need for the British Government to reflect the unique challenges Brexit poses for Northern Ireland in the position they adopt in the negotiations with the EU27.  I reinforced this message in my meeting with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland James Brokenshire in our meeting on 14 February.<\/p><p>The UK&rsquo;s exit from the EU will be a complex and lengthy political negotiation, involving all EU Member States and EU institutions as appropriate.  The Government&rsquo;s focus in relation to Northern Ireland is the substantive outcome on each of the key issues, rather than the label ascribed to the overall package.  The Government will maintain its focus on pursuit of specific, effective, and realisable measures that address each of the issues of concern under Brexit.  We will continue to do this in cooperation with our European partners and as a clear and committed EU Member State, as the best means of protecting the interests of all of the people on the island.<\/p><p>The Government has been clear that there are entirely unique circumstances in respect of the island of Ireland that must be taken account of in the negotiations for the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the European Union and the future EU-UK relationship.  The Good Friday Agreement, an international treaty, registered with the United Nations, provides for a unique political and constitutional settlement in Northern Ireland, which is the foundation of the peace process.<\/p><p>It is worth recalling that the Good Friday Agreement recognises the &ldquo;birthright of all the people of Northern Ireland to identify themselves and be accepted as Irish or British, or both&rdquo;.  This means that virtually everyone born in Northern Ireland can of right choose to be an Irish citizen, and therefore a citizen of the European Union, with all of the attendant rights and obligations of both.  There is no parallel for this anywhere in Europe &ndash; a point I have been highlighting to all my EU foreign ministerial colleagues.  The Agreement also contains very important provisions on the constitutional status of Northern Ireland.  The Government has been clear that Brexit causes no legal impediment to the mechanism set out in the Agreement for a united Ireland, in accordance with the principle of consent.<\/p><p>&ldquo;Special status&rdquo; for Northern Ireland is taken to mean a specific request for Northern Ireland to remain within the EU with a special status post Brexit.  While the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the European Union is something that the Irish Government strongly opposed, our task now is to face up to the unwanted result and outcome with all of the challenges that brings, in order to secure the best outcome for the island of Ireland as a whole.<\/p><p>While the Irish Government is actively seeking recognition and accommodation of the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland, our extensive discussions with partner governments across the EU &ndash; including the UK - have made clear that concepts and terms like &ldquo;special status&rdquo; give rise to serious concerns for other EU partners about precedents that might be set elsewhere.<b><\/b>This would risk undermining the Government&rsquo;s efforts to specifically address and mitigate the very real impacts facing our island &ndash; and the people of Northern Ireland in particular - due to Brexit.  While I entirely understand the rationale of those seeking a &ldquo;special status&rdquo; designation, the fact is that such a proposal would unnecessarily distract from work to secure arrangements which reflect the genuine uniqueness of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s situation, founded in the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement, as well as its geographic status as the only land border between the UK and the EU27.<\/p><p>Last week I outlined to the House the need for specific, effective, and realisable measures that could address the major issues of concern under Brexit, whether these relate to the border, or to the citizenship, constitutional and human rights provisions of the Agreement, or otherwise.  The Government will also be advocating for the continuation of the range of EU policy supports to Northern Ireland and the peace process, including in relation to EU funding and is looking at existing precedents and potential innovative approaches in this regard.<\/p><p>The Government will continue to work with our EU partners and prepare comprehensively in support of our overall objectives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100068#WRN07300","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Travel","counter":857,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100069#WRO00200"},{"type":"question","counter":858,"qnumday":342,"qnumall":"[7361\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100069#WRO00300","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if a Minister will be visiting Russia as part of the St. Patrick's Day celebrations.","asker":"1224","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":859,"content":"<p>As the programme of Ministerial travel for St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day is currently being finalised it is not possible to indicate if a Minister will be visiting Russia.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100069#WRO00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"International Agreements","counter":860,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100069#WRO00500"},{"type":"question","counter":861,"qnumday":343,"qnumall":"[7360\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100069#WRO00600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the way in which the EU Council is monitoring activities in Turkey on the EU-Turkish immigration deal done on refugees.","asker":"1224","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":862,"content":"<p>The core intention of the EU-Turkey Statement agreed between EU leaders and Turkey last March was to break the business model of the people smugglers profiting from the suffering of the vulnerable and to discourage migrants from risking their lives in dangerous sea journeys.

It is the principal vehicle for implementing the EU Floods Directive and national flood policy.   <\/p>  <p>  The Programme, which is being undertaken by engineering consultants on behalf of the OPW working in partnership with the local authorities, involves the production of predictive flood mapping for each location, the development of preliminary flood risk management options and the production of flood risk management plans. <\/p>  <p>  The Careysfort Maretimo catchment is within the Dublin City AFA of the Eastern CFRAM programme.  The preferred option developed by the CFRAM Study, to protect at risk properties along the Carysfort Maretimo watercourse, consists of five offline storage areas in combination with flood defence walls.  The proposed storage areas will reduce the flow along the Carysfort Maretimo watercourse, while the hard defences provide additional protection against the 1% Annual Exceedance Probability (AEP) flood event.  Approximately 250 meters of hard defence is required with an average and total height of 0.8 meters and 1.4 meters respectively.<\/p>  <p>  The Carysfort Maretimo Stream Improvement Scheme works were previously completed along this watercourse.

The open season for deer operates generally from 1 September to 28 February, depending on the species and gender of deer.  My Department carries out localised annual deer counts on State lands such as the National Parks.  Where appropriate, and depending on the annual count and instances of damage caused by deer to habitats, especially woodland, culls may be carried out to ensure that deer populations do not reach levels that would have negative ecological consequences.<\/p>  <p>  Control of deer on private property is the responsibility of landowners, who may apply to my Department for a permission under section 42 of the Wildlife Acts to cull deer where this is necessary outside the annual open seasons.  These permissions offer a facility whereby a person can obtain a permit, on a case by case basis, to prevent serious damage caused by individual deer on specific lands.  Permissions are only issued where there is evidence of such damage.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to preventing road accidents involving deer, my Department is of the view that improving sight lines for motorists as well as improved (and possibly larger) signage is likely to be the most effective measure to assist motorists to be vigilant when driving through areas where populations of deer can be expected. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to deer policy in general, my Department, together with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, published Deer Management in Ireland &ndash; A Framework for Action in 2015, which recommends a series of actions on deer management and conservation in a number of areas, including addressing the impact of deer in places where they are widespread.

As a result of investment, we made some progress but there is much more to do to provide the level service that is needed.  <\/p>  <p>  I recently met with the CEO of the Children&rsquo;s Hospital Group and of Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital Crumlin (OLCHC) to discuss immediate action that can be taken to reduce waiting times for children and adolescents with scoliosis.  <\/p>  <p>  While the new theatre in OLCHC was commissioned in 2016, it is only now being used for scoliosis surgery due to challenges with recruiting nurses.  The hospital has undertaken an aggressive recruitment drive to attract new theatre nurses with the necessary paediatric training.  As a result four new nurses will be in place by April.  A further 16 international nurses have been offered posts, and have commenced the registration process.  The recruitment of these nurses means that the new theatre will be used to provide the additional capacity for scoliosis procedures in OLCHC from April.  This will allow an additional day of procedures to be carried out in the medium term.  I am advised by OLCHC that an orthopaedic surgeon post in the hospital will also be filled by June.  This means that from July, the hospital expects that the theatre use will be further increased.  In addition I will receive an Action Plan for Scoliosis from the HSE by the end of February which will take on board the concerns of the advocacy groups.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the specific issue raised by the Deputy regarding the waiting list and waiting times for children for scoliosis surgery and activity levels in hospital across the country, as this is a service issue, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100071#WRQ03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Orthodontic Services Provision","counter":1055,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100071#WRQ03350"},{"type":"question","counter":1056,"qnumday":408,"qnumall":"[8154\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100071#WRQ03400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a person (details supplied) will be scheduled for an appointment for braces.","asker":"1250","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1057,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the HSE for reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100071#WRQ03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ambulance Service Provision","counter":1058,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100071#WRQ03550"},{"type":"question","counter":1059,"qnumday":409,"qnumall":"[8156\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100071#WRQ03600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the fact that there was no ambulance or rapid response car in east Cork available to respond to an emergency involving a suicide on 11 February 2017 and local fears that the second ambulance in Midleton, County Cork, which operates on a 12-hour basis only, will be removed soon; if this is planned, the rationale for same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1279","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1060,"content":"<p>I wish to express my sympathies to the family of the person concerned.

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their income and assets while the State pays the balance of the cost.  The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings. <\/p>  <p>  A financial assessment is carried out by the HSE to determine how much a participant in the Scheme will contribute to the cost of their care.  Participants in the Scheme contribute up to 80% of their assessable income and a maximum of 7.5% per annum of the value of assets held. In the case of a couple, the applicant&rsquo;s means are assessed as 50% of the couple&rsquo;s combined income and assets.  The first &euro;36,000 of an individual&rsquo;s assets, or &euro;72,000 in the case of a couple, is not counted at all in the financial assessment.  The capital value of an individual&rsquo;s principal private residence is only included in the financial assessment for the first three years of their time in care.  This is known as the three year cap.<\/p>  <p>  Importantly, a farm (or relevant business) can also qualify for this three year cap where unexpected health events prevent early succession arrangements.  This applies where:<\/p>  <p>  a) The applicant has suffered a sudden illness or disability which caused them to require care services and<\/p>  <p>  b) A substantial part of the working day of the applicant or their partner was regularly and consistently applied to the farming of the farm or carrying on of the relevant business until the onset of the sudden illness or disability, and<\/p>  <p>  c) A family successor certifies in writing that he or she will on a consistent and regular basis apply a substantial part of his or her working day to the farming of the farm or the carrying on of the relevant business.<\/p>  <p>  When the NHSS commenced in 2009, a commitment was made that it would be reviewed after three years.  The Review was published in July 2015.  A number of key issues have been identified for more detailed consideration across Departments and Agencies, including the treatment of business and farm assets for the purposes of the financial assessment element of the Scheme.  <\/p>  <p>  An Interdepartmental\/Agency Working Group has been established to progress certain recommendations contained in the Review.  This Group is chaired by the Department of Health and includes representatives from the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the HSE, the Revenue Commissioners and, when required, the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  The IFA made a submission to the Working Group on the treatment of farms for the purposes of the Scheme.  These proposals are currently being considered.  An initial report on progress was submitted to the Cabinet Committee on Health in September 2016.  The Programme for a Partnership Government has also committed to reviewing the NHSS to remove any discrimination against small business and family farms.<\/p>  <p>  The Fair Deal Scheme operates under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act, 2009.  There are no provisions in the Act to reimburse family members for out of pocket expenses for visiting relations in nursing homes.  Under the Scheme, the choice of nursing home lies with the applicant, who can choose any public, voluntary or approved private nursing home.  The home must have availability and be able to cater for the applicant's particular needs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100072#WRR07600","answer":true,"speaker":"1337"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Services for People with Disabilities","counter":1158,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100073#WRS00150"},{"type":"question","counter":1159,"qnumday":442,"qnumall":"[8322\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100073#WRS00200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the national policy on the provision of transport for school leavers with special needs who are participating in an adult day service; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1160,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives, provide greater independence in accessing the services they choose, and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.  This commitment is outlined in the Programme for Partnership Government, which is guided by two principles: equality of opportunity and improving the quality of life for people with disabilities.  <\/p>  <p>  The provision of transport to adults with a disability attending HSE-funded day services is not a core health service, and the HSE endeavours to ensure that all service users access public transport, including rural transport services, if possible.  This is in keeping with the principle of mainstreaming with a clear focus on ensuring persons with a disability have access to the normal range of services and participate in community life as far as possible.  In general, day service users are in receipt of disability allowance and are automatically entitled to the Free Travel Pass, so there should be no additional cost burden at an individual level. <\/p>  <p>  However when all other options are exhausted, and a person cannot avail of a day service because they do not have transport to attend, some transport is provided by disability service providers on a case by case basis as resources allow.  Service providers are continuously reviewing their transport arrangements to ensure that they are used as effectively and equitably as possible within available resources.  This may result in the provision of a reduced quantum of service to the service user, and the HSE does its best to provide transport in certain cases without reducing services.  Service providers continue to keep the matter of transport under review.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE has committed to establishing a high level cross divisional working group this year to rationalise the provision of transport and to maximise equitable access and efficiencies.  The HSE also intends to liaise with the National Transport Authority and disability service providers to explore ways in which the Authority&rsquo;s services could assist people with disabilities.  The National Transport Authority has a total of 17 Transport co-ordinating units called Local Link which provide safe secure and reliable Public Transport services in local and rural areas of Ireland through a combination of scheduled Public Transport services and door to door services.  The HSE plans to explore the opportunities these units may provide to people with disabilities to access day services and participate in the social, educational and economic life of their local communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100073#WRS00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1359"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Delays","counter":1161,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100073#WRS00350"},{"type":"question","counter":1162,"qnumday":443,"qnumall":"[8325\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100073#WRS00400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will assist in having an admission date arranged for a person (details supplied) in County Cork.","asker":"1278","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1163,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

An Interdepartmental Working Group, chaired by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, was established in early 2016.

This review is currently underway and is expected to be completed by Q2 2017.<\/p><p>In relation to the specific matter of the recruitment and retention of nursing staff there are many initiatives currently underway to improve nursing and midwifery staffing levels throughout the country.

The HSE is continually running open recruitment campaigns with no closing date to ensure that all eligible applicants for nursing posts can apply at any time to work in public hospitals around the country.  The number of nursing and midwifery staff increased by 1,650 whole time equivalents between December 2013 and December 2016, notwithstanding intense global competition for our nurses and midwives and the HSE is committed to increasing the number of permanent nursing and midwifery posts by over 1,200 in 2017.  <\/p><p>Given recruitment difficulties in psychiatric nursing special arrangements were introduced last summer to enable retiring nurses return to employment at the rate of pay at which they had retired, rather than the 1st point of the scale rule that generally applies across the public service.

The Government decision in 2012 to locate the hospital on St James&rsquo;s Hospital campus was made in the best interests of children from a clinical perspective.  St. James's has the broadest range of national specialties of all our acute hospitals, in addition to a strong and well-established research and education infrastructure, making it the hospital that best meets the criteria to enable the children&rsquo;s hospital achieve our vision of excellence in modern paediatric practice. <\/p><p>A major milestone was achieved in this long awaited, much needed project when An Bord Plean&aacute;la granted planning permission in April 2016 to build a state of the art hospital on a campus shared with St. James&rsquo;s Hospital, together with two Paediatric Outpatients and Urgent Care centres at Tallaght Hospital and Connolly Hospital.  The first phase of construction (site clearing works) on the site of the new children&rsquo;s hospital began in August 2016 and will be substantially completed within a matter of weeks.  Following decades of discussions and debates, Ireland is about to get the new children&rsquo;s hospital that it badly needs and deserves.  A world class design, with child-friendly, high spec, modern interiors and acres of outdoor space has been completed.  Hundreds of staff from the three children&rsquo;s hospitals continue to input into the fit out and internal design to ensure that the children, young people and their families can be treated in the best possible environment &ndash; helping to improve clinical outcomes as well as overall well-being and patient experience.  <\/p><p>The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board was appointed in 2013 to design, build and equip the new children&rsquo;s hospital for children, young people and families in Ireland.  An internationally recognised design team supported by an experienced Board and Project Team are in place, have followed best international design, planning and procurement process at each stage of the project and are now in a position, subject to Government approval, to appoint a contractor to deliver this long awaited hospital.  The new children&rsquo;s hospital will open and provide services to children and young people in Ireland in 2021, and the Urgent Care Centres at Tallaght Hospital and Connolly Hospital will open on a phased basis from 2018.<\/p><p><b><\/b>The Project Team, during the design, planning and tendering phases, has constantly monitored the external environment &ndash; tracking construction inflation and market costs.  The cost estimate for the core construction elements of the new children&rsquo;s hospital and the Paediatric Outpatients and Urgent Care centres at Tallaght and Connolly Hospitals was prepared in early 2014.  This estimate, prepared at a time when annual construction inflation predicted at 3% per annum, was &euro;650m.<\/p><p>The recently concluded tendering process for the main construction works determined the actual market cost of the construction elements of the project.  Due to annual construction inflation rising from 3% in 2013 to more than 9% in 2017 and the lengthened project timeline in the planning, design and procurement process, the cost of the core construction of the hospital and Paediatric Outpatients and Urgent Care Centres has increased from the original estimate.  The increase reflects the increasing volume of activity in the Irish construction industry which is having a significant impact on construction inflation.  However, I understand that the final construction elements of the project compare favourably to the costs of international projects of a similar size and scale. <\/p><p>The NPHDB and the Children&rsquo;s Hospital Group Board continue to work closely with the HSE and the Department of Health to deliver this much-needed world-class hospital.  My priority, as I have stated before, is to make progress on the new hospital as soon as possible so we can ensure children, young people and their families have the facilities they need and deserve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100074#WRT02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Status","counter":1254,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100074#WRT02300"},{"type":"question","counter":1255,"qnumday":474,"qnumall":"[8570\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100074#WRT02400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a person (details supplied) in County Donegal will receive a date for a spinal operation at Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1256,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

Last year saw the launch of the first Action Plan for Education by the Department of Education.  This included a section on Mental Health and Wellbeing.  The aims in this section were to roll out a national programme to support the implementation of Well-being Guidelines to all primary and post-primary schools; to implement Well-being at Junior Cycle; and to publish the 2015 Lifeskills survey, providing information on how schools cater for the well-being of their students.  This plan outlines hundreds of actions and sub-actions to be implemented across 2016-2019, with timelines and lead responsibility assigned.  I will be working closely with my colleague the Minister for Education on this issue to ensure these actions are implemented. <\/p>  <p>  The Department of Health and the Department of Education have a strong history of working together to support youth mental health.  In 2013, the Department of Education and Skills, the HSE, and the Department of Health jointly developed Well-Being in Post Primary Schools Guidelines for Mental Health Promotion and Suicide Prevention.  This was followed in 2015 by the publication of Guidelines setting out a framework for mental health promotion in primary schools.  <\/p>  <p>  In 2015, the Government launched Connecting for Life, Ireland's National Strategy to Reduce Suicide with the aim of reducing suicide and self-harm over 2015-2020.  The Strategy sets out a vision where fewer lives are lost through suicide, and where communities and individuals are empowered to improve their mental health and well-being.  It will provide community-based organisations with guidelines, protocols and training on effective suicide prevention. <\/p>  <p>  One of the main goals in Connecting for Life is to target approaches to reduce suicidal behaviour and improve mental health among priority groups, including young people.  Several key actions have been identified to further this goal in the Education sector, including:<\/p>  <p>  - Support the implementation of the relevant guidelines for mental health promotion and suicide prevention across primary and post-primary schools;<\/p>  <p>  - Guide and encourage the implementation of the relevant policies and plans in schools, including support for Student Support Teams and for critical incident management;<\/p>  <p>  - Work with the HSE to develop national guidance for higher education institutions in relation to suicide risk and critical incident response;<\/p>  <p>  - Implement the National Anti-bullying Action Plan including online and homophobic bullying;<\/p>  <p>  - Support all junior and senior schools to implement a new Wellbeing programme; and<\/p>  <p>  - Deliver early intervention and psychological support service for young people at primary care level. <\/p>  <p>  These actions are part of the overall policy objectives of the Department of Education and Skills.  They are supported by my Department and the HSE through the inter-agency implementation arrangements provided for in Connecting for Life and overseen by the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy and Public Service Reform.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100074#WRT03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1337"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1263,"content":"<p>Question No. 477 answered with Question No. 413.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1264,"content":"<p>Question No. 478 answered with Question No. 465.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medicinal Products Availability","counter":1265,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100074#WRT03700"},{"type":"question","counter":1266,"qnumday":479,"qnumall":"[8602\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100074#WRT03800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"for the position regarding the negotiations with a company (details supplied) over the provision of Orkambi; when a decision will be made by the HSE in respect of the latest proposal from the company; the timeframe he envisages the negotiations will go on; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

It was submitted to the HSE in June 2016.  The NCPE determined, following an evaluation of the economic dossier, that the manufacturer failed to demonstrate cost-effectiveness or value for money from using the drug.  The NCPE have confirmed that all relevant costs were included in the analysis.  In line with the HSE's assessment process, the HSE Drugs Committee considered the NCPE recommendation, the manufacturers submissions and commercial offer and other information.  Following this consideration the Drugs Committee did not recommend reimbursement at the current price.  The HSE Directorate considered the Drugs Committee&rsquo;s recommendation in December and the Directorate took the decision not to reimburse at the current price offered by the company. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE has since re-entered into negotiations with Vertex, the manufacturer of Orkambi, with a view to significantly reducing the cost of Orkambi.  A meeting was held in December and again in early January.  Following completion of the negotiation process, I am advised that the HSE&rsquo;s Drugs Committee met at the end of January and considered the manufacturer's latest price offerings.

The Government is focused on protecting and advancing Ireland's interests before, during and after the negotiations.  Our priorities are clear; minimising the impact on trade and the economy, protecting the Northern Ireland Peace Process, maintaining the Common Travel Area, and influencing the future of the European Union.  A critical part of our work is in ensuring that our priorities are heard and understood across Europe, therefore engagement with our EU partners and with the EU institutions is critical.  A programme of intense engagement at political and official level is continuing to ensure that the EU&rsquo;s position for the forthcoming negotiations reflects our priorities.  The Taoiseach has stated that we will make a strong case at EU level that Ireland will require support that recognises where Brexit represents a serious disturbance to the Irish economy.  Accordingly, our preparations for Brexit include detailed engagement with the European Commission, where we have made them aware that Brexit is already having an impact on the Irish economy, and of the disproportionate consequences posed by Brexit to the Irish economy overall in comparison to other Member States.  <\/p>  <p>  The Department of Health has and will continue to access a range of EU funding and will seek to maximise opportunities in this context.  The Department of Health is the Accountable Department for the health theme of the cross border INTERREG V Programme, which is managed by the Special EU Programme&rsquo;s Body (SEUPB). The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has overall responsibility at central level for the INTERREG and PEACE programmes and the SEUPB is an agency under its remit.  These cross border Programmes are 85% funded by the EU.  I am pleased to note that following intensive discussions by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform with the Department of Finance in Northern Ireland and the Welsh European Funding Office, agreement was reached at the end of October on a safeguard clause that has enabled funding agreements to be put in place and Letters of Offer to issue to programme beneficiaries for both PEACE and the two INTERREG Programmes including the INTERREG V Programme.  Now that the short term objective has been achieved, the medium term objective is to ensure the full and successful implementation of the programmes to 2020, during a period in which the UK may leave the EU and the UK allocation of European Regional Development Fund funding may no longer be available.  The long term objective is to secure agreement to successor programmes post-2020 in the context of not just Brexit but also the next Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF).    <\/p>  <p>  In addition, European Investment Bank (EIB) funding is being provided to a Public Private Partnership (PPP) project to develop Primary Care Centres, in the form of an EIB loan taken out by the PPP company.<\/p>  <p>  A range of supports are also being provided in the field of eHealth.

The CAP has evolved considerably and very effectively in recent years, in response to changing market, consumer and environmental demands.\u00a0 It also plays a central role in delivering the smart, sustainable and inclusive growth sought under the Europe 2020 strategy.<\/p>  <p>  It is important that the CAP continues to\u00a0evolve in a way that supports the achievement of European priorities, particularly in the context of securing a strong CAP budget for the post 2020 period.\u00a0 This can only be achieved by reinforcing the relevance and effectiveness of the policy in helping to achieve broader societal goals.\u00a0 This is something that I strongly believe in and will actively pursue at Council level as the debate on the future CAP and its budget\u00a0intensifies over the coming months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100075#WRU07300","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"GLAS Payments","counter":1377,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100075#WRU07400"},{"type":"question","counter":1378,"qnumday":516,"qnumall":"[8076\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100075#WRU07500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when a person (details supplied) in County Donegal will receive their outstanding GLAS payment for 2016; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":1379,"content":"<p>The person named has been paid in full for 2015 and 85% of his 2016 payment issued in December 2016.\u00a0 The balancing 15% will issue in the second quarter of 2017.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100075#WRU07600","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agri-Environment Options Scheme Payments","counter":1381,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100076#WRV00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1382,"qnumday":517,"qnumall":"[8082\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100076#WRV00300","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will review the case of a person (details supplied); the status of the payment that was due in December 2016; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":1383,"content":"<p>The person named commenced their AEOS 2 contract on 1st September 2011.

I am advised that the practice of pair trawling in inshore waters and estuaries around Ireland is confined to fishing for sprat.  The Irish Wildlife Trust also identifies sprat as the target species for this activity.<\/p>  <p>  Sprat in Irish waters is not a species subject to fishing quotas or Total Allowable Catches established under EU regulation.  The International Council of the Exploration of the Seas (ICES) considers sprat to be a data limited stock which means that more detailed data is required in order to form a full understanding of the state of the stock.  In order to address that paucity of accurate information in respect of sprat stocks in the waters around Ireland, a three year research project, partially funded by industry, began in October 2014 under the auspices of the Marine Institute in cooperation with Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology.<\/p>  <p>  Through the Birds and Habitats Directive, among other instruments, Ireland is committed to ensuring the conservation of biodiversity of the sea birds and mammals around our coast.  Regarding fish by-catch in sprat fisheries, I am advised that the most likely by-catch is of herring but that catches of juvenile mackerel cannot be ruled out.  It should be noted that by-catch is a feature of a number of the fisheries around our coast given the mixed nature of many of our stocks.  All catches of quota species are  logged and landed and taken in to account by ICES (International Council for the Exploration of the Sea) when providing stock advice.<\/p>  <p>  The Marine Institute are working on adding sprat to the species covered under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund Marine Biodiversity Scheme in 2017.  This would allow for more intensive data collection to enhance scientific knowledge and underpin any future  management actions for the stock.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, I have asked the Marine Institute to work in conjunction with the National Parks and Wildlife Service to consider how we can improve our knowledge, through observer programmes, of the possible impacts of these fisheries on by-catch of other fish, sea birds and mammals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100077#WRW01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fish Farming","counter":1467,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100077#WRW01400"},{"type":"question","counter":1468,"qnumday":546,"qnumall":"[8490\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100077#WRW01500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"further to Parliamentary Question Nos. 439 and 440 of 9 June 2015, the progress made on overstocking since his predecessor stated on 15 June 2015 that his Department had identified the issue of overstocking as a key operational priority over the next 12 months for the monitoring and compliance unit of his Department's aquaculture licensing division.","asker":"1259","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":1469,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware a number of aquaculture sites operated by one company have been the subject of ongoing examination by my Department in respect of possible overstocking.<\/p><p>In the case of two of these sites - Lough Altan Hatchery and Inishfarnard, my Department&rsquo;s examination has concluded.<\/p><p>In relation to the Lough Altan Hatchery, I have determined that an amendment to the licence held by the company in respect of this site would be appropriate.

The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of\u00a0the NBP\u00a0as a matter of priority.\u00a0 This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment by the telecommunications sector and a State intervention in those areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.<\/p><p>A key principle of the NBP is to support and stimulate commercial investment through policy and regulatory measures.  Commercial investment since the publication of the NBP has considerably exceeded expectations.  To date, the commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2.5bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.<\/p><p>There has been significant progress in relation to broadband rollout so that today, approximately 1.4m or 61% of premises\u00a0in Ireland can\u00a0get high speed broadband of\u00a0a minimum of 30 Megabits per second.  The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging\u00a0investment by the telecoms sector, which is\u00a0continuing to expand this footprint.<\/p><p>The High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at<i>www.broadband.gov.ie<\/i>, shows the current extent of the State Intervention area:<\/p><p>- The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or have previously indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services,\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>- The areas marked AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the target areas for the State Intervention, which are the subject of the current procurement process.  It is intended that premises within this area will\u00a0have access to services of at least 30 megabits per second when the procurement process is completed and the network\u00a0rolled out.\u00a0 <\/p><p>The company referred to by the Deputy is in the Blue area that will be served by commercial operators. <\/p><p>Approximately 71,000 of the\u00a0circa 133,000 premises in County Galway are located in the BLUE area \u00a0and will be served by commercial operators while the remaining 62,000 premises represent the target areas for the State Intervention.<\/p><p>Individuals can check whether their premises is in a BLUE or an AMBER area by\u00a0accessing the High Speed Broadband Map and entering their Eircode.<\/p><p>My Department is actively monitoring commercial deployment plans in the BLUE areas to ensure that all\u00a0households and businesses can get access to the services.\u00a0 My Department is also actively monitoring developments of commercial operators that might impact the Intervention Area.\u00a0 This is being done in accordance with procedures set out by my Department in December 2015. <\/p><p>I should add, however, that the provision of telecommunications services, including broadband services, is\u00a0primarily a matter for the service providers concerned who operate in a fully liberalised market, regulated by the independent regulator, the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg).\u00a0 I do not have a statutory authority to require\u00a0commercial companies to rollout services to particular locations.  The specific query on timelines for upgrade of\u00a0commercial broadband services to specific premises is\u00a0best targeted at the\u00a0service provider.\u00a0 <\/p><p>A formal procurement process is in train to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area.\u00a0 My Department will shortly update the High Speed Broadband map\u00a0to finalise the Intervention Area for the Procurement process, taking into account industry investments that have not materialised in Blue areas, together with new industry investments within the proposed State Intervention Area, along with concrete and credible commitments by industry for further new investments within the Intervention Area.<\/p><p>The procurement process is being intensively managed to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland for at least 25 years.  Intensive dialogue with bidders is continuing and the three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution.  This provides for a future proofed solution for the 25 years of the contract and beyond.\u00a0 A fibre-to-the-home solution means that householders and businesses may get speeds not just of 30 Megabits per second but much higher, potentially up to 1000 Megabits per second.\u00a0 <\/p><p>The timeframe for the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders, during the procurement process.  During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated a 3-5 year timeline to rollout a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP. <\/p><p>As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and\/or high demand.  This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network rollout plan.  A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  A detailed rollout plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100078#WRX04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fisheries Protection","counter":1589,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100078#WRX04050"},{"type":"question","counter":1590,"qnumday":587,"qnumall":"[8437\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100078#WRX04100","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the position regarding the practice of trolling in a lake (details supplied) in County Donegal; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1244","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":1591,"content":"<p>The lake in question is\u00a0open for Catch and Release angling\u00a0under the Conservation of Salmon and Sea Trout (Catch and Release) Bye-law No. 945 of 2016.\u00a0 This Bye-law provides for catch and release in respect of salmon (and sea trout over 40 cm) and also provides for the use of\u00a0hooks and baits which are conducive to survival of fish\u00a0captured and released.<\/p><p>The concern arising with regards to trolling\u00a0is the potential for fish targeted by this fishing method to be deeply hooked or injured, thereby hindering\u00a0the\u00a0potential survival of\u00a0fish which are required, by law, to be released.<\/p><p>The public consultation process regarding the proposed Bye-law\u00a0was advertised locally in the press and on IFI&rsquo;s website <i>www.fisheriesireland.ie<\/i>and closed at 5pm on 22 July 2016. <\/p><p>Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI) met with\u00a0the local angling club,\u00a0referred to by the Deputy, on 25 November 2016, to give\u00a0the club\u00a0an opportunity to discuss the proposal and highlight their written submissions to the\u00a0 consultation process. <\/p><p>The matter is currently under consideration by\u00a0senior management\u00a0at IFI and their advice is\u00a0awaited prior to a final determination.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100078#WRX04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1314"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Information and Communications Technology","counter":1592,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100078#WRX04250"},{"type":"question","counter":1593,"qnumday":588,"qnumall":"[8609\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100078#WRX04300","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the number of Departments, State bodies and-or agencies using the Eircode system; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1234"},{"type":"question","counter":1594,"qnumday":589,"qnumall":"[8628\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100078#WRX04400","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the cost of upgrading information technology systems and-or databases to incorporate the use of Eircode; if the use of Eircode is mandatory in his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1234"},{"type":"question","counter":1595,"qnumday":590,"qnumall":"[8647\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100078#WRX04500","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"his plans to encourage an increase in usage of the Eircode system; and if any consideration has been given to amending the current system for this purpose.","asker":"1232","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":1596,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 588 to 590, inclusive, together.<\/p>  <p>  Capita Business Support Services Ireland, trading as Eircode, was awarded a 10 year contract in December 2013 to develop, implement, maintain and promote the use of the National Postcode System \"Eircode\". <\/p>  <p>  The contract provided for a programme of public sector database encoding with Eircodes\u00a0for 15 public sector bodies who have frequent interaction with the public.  Prior to the Eircode launch approximately\u00a080 million public sector database records were encoded with Eircodes, costing &euro;11.5m (VAT inclusive).<\/p>  <p>  Public sector bodies have used their regular on-going ICT software upgrades to incorporate Eircodes as part of other changes to their systems.  Therefore, public sector bodies with large number of complex ICT systems have implemented Eircodes on an incremental basis as systems come up for change or renewal.  This has resulted in no significant cost to those bodies. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Staff in my Department when communicating with households include Eircode on outgoing mail, on department publications, application forms, headed paper, e-mail signatures, complementary slips and on the website.  In all correspondence with the Department, staff request and use Eircodes.  My Department continues to identify opportunities to realise the benefits integrating Eircodes will bring within the various areas of the Department and agencies under our aegis.<\/p>  <p>  Eircodes are being used by the large public sector bodies, including, Revenue, Department of Social Protection, Department of Agriculture, Food\u00a0and Marine, and the Health Service Executive.  Many other state bodies and agencies that have interaction with the public have also incorporated the Eircode into their systems.  These include the Department Transport, Tourism &amp;amp; Sport; Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade; Local Government Management Agency;\u00a0Central Statistics Office; Department of Education &amp;amp; Skills;\u00a0Residential Tenancies Board; Companies Registration Office; Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland; Ordnance Survey Ireland; An Post; National Treasury Management Agency; Electric Ireland and ESB Networks. <\/p>  <p>  Some examples of how the Eircode has been successfully implemented in public sector bodies are described below: \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  - National Ambulance Service (NAS) have integrated Eircodes into their Computer Aided Dispatch system (CAD).  This means that the patient&rsquo;s address and the position of the nearest available ambulance can be accurately pinpointed on a digital map, enabling an ambulance to be quickly and accurately\u00a0routed to someone in need of medical help.  This is of particular benefit to rural Ireland with 35% non-unique addresses which caused significant operational challenges in the past;<\/p>  <p>  - Student Universal Support Ireland (SUSI) has integrated Eircodes into its educational grants award system which\u00a0assists students apply for the correct rate of grant; <\/p>  <p>  - Central Statistics Office (CSO) utilises Eircode as part of their core data and launched the new Residential Property Price Index\u00a0covering all market purchases of houses and apartments, including in rural Ireland.\u00a0 Eircodes provide the necessary addition of better quality location information, allowing the register measure prices with greater accuracy by using the Eircode Routing Key;<\/p>  <p>  - National Broadband Plan. Currently Eircodes are in use on the Department&rsquo;s High Speed Broadband Map 2020.  Users simply enter the Eircode of the residential or commercial premises and the map indicates whether the premises falls within the Blue area that is being served by commercial operators or within the Amber area which will be covered by the State intervention; <\/p>  <p>  - National Transport Authority (NTA) has incorporated Eircodes within the National Journey Planner app for use by the public.  The app provides journey planning, timetable and travel information from all licensed public transport providers across Ireland; <\/p>  <p>  - Waterford City and County Council have incorporated the Eircode into customer management systems, used by members of the public to report incidents to the Council; and <\/p>  <p>  - The\u00a0HSE have incorporated Eircodes into the Individual Health Identifier (IHI) system.  The IHI system is a key enabler for the Governments eHealth strategy. <\/p>  <p>  Increasing numbers of the public are looking-up Eircodes on the free to use Eircode Finder website, which remains very popular, with just under 10m searches since the finder went live at launch.  In addition, Capita provide regular updates to Google who have now integrated Eircodes within Google Maps.<\/p>  <p>  Capita have\u00a0run a number of national advertising campaigns on television, radio and online to raise public awareness of using Eircodes for deliveries and during emergency situations.\u00a0 Capita will continue to promote and market the use of Eircodes in the coming year to increase uptake and usage of the Eircode system among members of the public and businesses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100078#WRX04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Funding","counter":1597,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100078#WRX04650"},{"type":"question","counter":1598,"qnumday":591,"qnumall":"[8802\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100078#WRX04700","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the EU funds his Department accesses; the plans he is putting in place to access these funds to a greater degree in view of Brexit; if he will outline initiatives he is pursuing to establish access to new funds in view of the challenge of Brexit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":1599,"content":"<p>The Government has a coordinated approach to Brexit managed centrally by the Department of An Taoiseach.<\/p>  <p>  As outlined in An Taoiseach&rsquo;s speech on 15 February, as a direct response to Brexit, the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform have been asked to prepare an ambitious multi-annual 10-year capital plan that will make Ireland a far better place in which to live and work.<\/p>  <p>  That plan will make prudent and effective use of our own resources, as well as resources available to Ireland as a member of the European Union.<\/p>  <p>  Discussions with the European Investment Bank, which recently opened an office in Dublin, have already taken place and are likely to lead to significant further investments in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  There are a number of streams of EU funding which my Department accesses.<\/p>  <p>  In September 2015, the Government published its 6 year Capital Plan, Building on Recovery, which included an allocation of &euro;275m for the National Broadband Plan.

In preparing its Transport Strategy, the NTA is required to have regard to a number of matters, including the National Spatial Strategy and local authority development plans.  The Act also specifically requires the NTA to ensure the Strategy is consistent with the GDA's regional, spatial and economic strategy, including any relevant regional planning guidelines.  The Strategy itself is subject to update and review every six years and at each review point, adjustments can be made to reflect relevant prevailing circumstances.

The European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) forms one component of the wider European Structural and Investment (ESI) Fund.  Within Ireland the Minister for Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform has overall responsibility for EU Cohesion Policy and primary responsibility for the ERDF.  Two agencies under the aegis of my Department (Science Foundation Ireland and Enterprise Ireland) are key contributors to two Operational Programmes (OPs) to implement the strategic priorities set out in our Partnership Agreements with the European Commission.  These OPs are co-funded by the ERDF under the auspices of the Department of Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform - one for the Southern region and one for the Northern and Western region.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The focus of these programmes is on jobs and growth; combatting unemployment and social exclusion; promoting research, technological development and innovation (RTDI) and information and communications technology investment and the competitiveness of the business sector; and promoting an environmentally friendly and resource-efficient economy.<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0The total programmed expenditure for the ERDF operational programmes will be &euro;818 million, with an ERDF contribution of 50%, i.e. &euro;409 million.  My own Department has responsibility for &euro;406.2 million (&euro;177m from SFI and &euro;229.2m from EI) of this programmed expenditure with a return of &euro;203.1 million.  Total programme expenditure is broken down as follows:<\/p>  <p>  Southern &amp;amp; Eastern NUTS II Region - total expenditure of &euro;498 million (ERDF contribution of &euro;249 million); and <\/p>  <p>  BMW NUTS II Region &ndash; total expenditure of &euro;320 million (ERDF contribution of &euro;160 million).\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The current ESI phase which is scheduled to run between 2014 and 2020 has been agreed with the Commission and is not open to amendment.  No additional funding mechanisms under the ESI are anticipated during this period.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The activities of the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) are funded through the Irish Exchequer, and up to 50% co-funded by the EU European Regional Development Fund on a retrospective basis. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  As set out in the Action Plan for Jobs 2017, the LEOs will be focused on supporting companies in navigating the challenges presented by Brexit, including:  <\/p>  <p>- Technical assistance support for exporting microenterprises;<\/p>  <p>- Roll out of a national Lean for Micro initiative to drive firm level competitiveness;<\/p>  <p>- Targeted mentoring and training initiatives; and <\/p>  <p>- Local level awareness raising and information sharing.<\/p>  <p>  The EU Programme for the Competitiveness of Enterprises and Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (COSME) runs from 2014 to 2020, with an overall budget of &euro;2.3bn.<\/p>  <p>  COSME's objective includes facilitating access to finance for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) and to increase the sustainable competitiveness of EU companies and help small businesses operate outside their home countries.  It is also hoped that COSME will create an environment which is favourable to business creation and growth, and encourage an entrepreneurial culture in Europe.<\/p>  <p>  One of the means by which this objective can be achieved is through the use of EU financial instruments, which are a key component of the COSME programme.  The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI), which comes under the remit of the Department of Finance has recently signed the first COSME agreement in Ireland with the European Investment Fund.  This transaction is guaranteed by the European Fund for Strategic Investment (EFSI), the heart of the investment plan for Europe.  This agreement will allow SBCI to support &euro;100m of loans to SMEs in Ireland over the next three years and support attractive loans to around 2,000 SMEs through risk sharing initiatives.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is currently working with the SBCI utilising the terms of the Credit Guarantee (Amendment) Act 2016 to see if there are other mechanisms by which we can leverage additional EIB\/EIF funds through risk sharing instruments.  I am confident that this work will lead to the development of additional products to facilitate the flow of credit to Irish SMEs.  In addition, Microfinance Ireland benefits from a guarantee funded by the European Union under the Programme for Employment and Social Inclusion (EASI) Programme.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is actively involved with our Northern Ireland counterpart in the Research and Innovation strand of the EU's INTERREG VA Programme, a cross border initiative which will benefit colleges and companies in Ireland, Northern Ireland and, in some cases, Western Scotland.  The two Departments contribute the 'match funding' required, i.e. 15% of the total, with the EU contributing 85%.  Arrangements have been put in place which will ensure that this programme can continue despite the closure date of 2023 being after the likely date at which the UK will leave the EU.  The overall financial envelope for the full\u00a0 programme (the total EU allocation for this Research and\u00a0 Innovation strand is &euro;60m), was settled by the EU quite some time ago, being part of their wider Territorial Cooperation initiative, so the level of funding for this programme cannot be increased at this stage. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100080#WRZ04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1247"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Funding","counter":1731,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100080#WRZ04350"},{"type":"question","counter":1732,"qnumday":640,"qnumall":"[9099\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100080#WRZ04400","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the public funding supplied to trade unions and representative bodies in 2015 and 2016 from her Department, in tabular form; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1341","askee":"1247"},{"type":"speech","counter":1733,"content":"<p>Improved industrial relations are a key factor in enterprise development and greater expertise and professionalism in the industrial relations arena contributes to more efficient use of the State&rsquo;s industrial relations and dispute resolution machinery.

In 2011 this scheme was closed to new entrants while under the remit of the Family Support Agency.  The scheme came under the remit of Tusla upon its establishment in 2014. <\/p>  <p>  Tusla has informed me that the School Completion Projects have until April to complete the Annual Retention Plan for the School Completion Programme.  This provides an opportunity, within the return, for the Projects to inform Tusla of its counselling needs.<\/p>  <p>  Tusla recognises the necessity for bereavement and loss counselling in schools and those schools in receipt of funding under the School Completion Programme may utilise up to &euro;5,000 of this funding for such services.  In addition Tusla provides child counselling through the Agency&rsquo;s Family Support Services funding.  In 2016 funding for child counselling was increased under this scheme by &euro;154,000 to &euro;680,000.  In particular child counselling funding to approximately 70 Family Resource Centres around Ireland was increased to &euro;242,000. <\/p>  <p>  Tusla is the main funder of Barnardos Children&rsquo;s Bereavement Service, which works to support children and families coping with bereavement.  Funding of &euro;154,600 was provided to this service in 2016.  The Agency is also committed to the funding of Rainbows Ireland, which provides group based support to children dealing with loss following parental separation\/divorce or a death.  The Rainbows programme is currently delivered in over 250 schools and community based centres around the country.  Funding in 2016 was increased by &euro;15,000 to &euro;250,000 annually.

Because childcare costs to parents in Ireland are one of the highest in the OECD, we need to address affordability and quality at the same time.  My Department is not an employer of childcare workers but it is a significant funder of childcare services.  I am very conscious that there is an issue with regard to the pay and conditions of workers in the sector and my Department is engaging with the early years sector to explore how this can be addressed in the short, medium and long term. <\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits to carrying out an independent review of the cost of providing quality childcare.  This commitment aligns closely with work on the design and development of a new Single Affordable Childcare Scheme, and we are progressing this work in that context.  The review will feed into future policy development, including in relation to levels of payments to services.<\/p>  <p>  I am pleased that the last two budgets delivered a 35% increase each year in funding for childcare.  In Budget 2017, this amounted to an increase of &euro;121.5m for Early Years, increasing investment from &euro;345m per annum to &euro;466.5m.  This represents an additional &euro;86m for the full year 2017 costs of the extension of ECCE, the further roll out of the Access and Inclusion Model (AIM) within ECCE and, &euro;35.5 for further measures to address affordability and quality.  For the first time, total early years spending (including spending on infant classes in primary schools) will now exceed &euro;1 billion per year.  We need to continue to invest and I will be arguing for further increase in funding in Budget 2018. <\/p>  <p>  To go some way towards addressing cost pressures faced by providers in the sector, I have secured &euro;10m to enable providers to be paid for non-contact time, where they will have no children present and they will be able to pay staff to concentrate on administrative workload.  Services themselves can decide how to use the payment when it is received.  For the average ECCE service with 25 children, this will mean an additional annual payment of approximately &euro;2,400 per annum.  We are also giving additional funding to CCS and TEC providers on a pro-rata basis to acknowledge their administrative burden. <\/p>  <p>  The Affordable Childcare Scheme, when introduced, will replace CCS and TEC and will have recognition of non-contact time built into its cost base.  In addition, I made provision under Budget 2017 for a fund of &euro;1m to assist in the investigation of sustainability issues being faced by childcare providers, and to develop a policy to guide any future interventions. <\/p>  <p>I want to reiterate my respect for childcare professionals, and I am committed to addressing these issues effectively.  As the Deputy may know, I established the Early Years Forum shortly after my appointment, and my Department and I will continue to engage with the sector on these important matters.  The next meeting of the Forum is scheduled to take place on March 6th, 2017.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100081#WRAA00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Youth Strategy","counter":1741,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100081#WRAA00500"},{"type":"question","counter":1742,"qnumday":643,"qnumall":"[8100\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100081#WRAA00600","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if she will provide a list of the members of the taskforce for the LGBT youth strategy, their title and their organisation.","asker":"1287","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1743,"content":"<p>The following table names the members of the Oversight Committee and the organisations they represent:<\/p><p><table><tr><th>Organisation<\/th><th>Name<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Independent Chair<\/td><td>Una Mullally<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Transgender Equality Network Ireland<\/td><td>Catherine Cross, Family Support and Education Officer<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Gay and Lesbian Equality Network<\/td><td>&Aacute;ine Duggan,CEO<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>TUSLA <\/td><td>Cormac Quinlan, Interim Director of Policy and Strategy<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>BeLonG To<\/td><td>Moninne Griffith, Executive Director BeLonG To<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dept. of Justice and Equality<\/td><td>Deagl&aacute;n O&rsquo;Briain, Principal Officer, Equality and Human Rights<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Irish Congress of Trade Unions<\/td><td>Fiona Dunne, Programme Manager<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>National Youth Council of Ireland<\/td><td>Mary Cunningham, Director<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>National Youth Council of Ireland<\/td><td>Siona Cahill,Vice President for Equality and Citizenship, Union of Students Ireland<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Sport Ireland <\/td><td>Dr Una May, Director of Participation and Ethics <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dept. of Children and Youth Affairs <\/td><td>Olive McGovern, Assistant Principal,Youth Affairs<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dept. of Children and Youth Affairs<\/td><td>Mary Robb,Quality Standards Officer<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Health Service Executive<\/td><td>Diane Nurse,National Lead,National Social Inclusion Office<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dept. of Education and Skills<\/td><td>Gavan O&rsquo;Leary,Principal Officer, Central Policy Unit Alternate: Grainne Morrissey, Assistant Principal,Central Policy Unit<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>Una Mullally, Independent Chair is a journalist, broadcaster, producer, author, activist and spoken word artist.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100081#WRAA00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Discipline","counter":1744,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100081#WRAA00800"},{"type":"question","counter":1745,"qnumday":644,"qnumall":"[8173\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022100081#WRAA00900","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the post-primary student population by individual school in County Louth for the school year 2013-2014; the number of post-primary pupil suspensions by individual school in County Louth for the school year 2013-2014; the number of post-primary pupil expulsions by individual school in County Louth for the school year 2013-2014; the post-primary student population nationally for the school year 2013-2014; the total number of post-primary pupil expulsions nationally for the school year 2013-2014; and the total number of post-primary pupil suspensions nationally for the school year 2013-2014.","asker":"1333","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1746,"content":"<p>Tusla has advised that the Agency does not hold data in relation to school populations.

In addition the programme provides for shared funding with the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority of &euro;5.5 million, of which &euro;4.95 million is EU funded, for the renewal of technologies as well as for training and compliance promotion.  In addition, the Department of Defence is also accessing EU funding through the Horizon 2020 programme.

It is through this engagement that the Defence Forces and the Department of Defence has been involved in accessing EU funds under the Horizon 2020 programme.  Horizon 2020 is an EU Research and Innovation programme with nearly &euro;80 billion of funding available over 7 years (2014 to 2020).  The Defence Forces has been involved, as a consortium member, in a number of proposals for Horizon 2020 funding since the launch of the programme and enjoyed their first success in 2016 as a consortium member of the ROCSAFE project.

The Commission has proposed that the fund would have a research and capability windows.<\/p>  <p>  Under the \"research window\", &euro;90m in funding would be made available for collaborative defence research projects over the period 2017-2020 in what is known as the &ldquo;Preparatory Action&rdquo;.  The Commission also propose that post 2020, a European Defence Research Programme will be established with funding of &euro;500m per annum.
