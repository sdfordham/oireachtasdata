This <\/p><p>Commission proposal has yet to go through the wide ranging and extensive EU procedures before any part of it becomes a reality.<\/p><p>The aim of the Plan is to explore how EU policies and instruments can ensure that the EU&rsquo;s industrial and skills base will be able to deliver required defence capabilities in view of current and future security challenges.  As part of this Plan, the Commission has proposed the creation of a European Defence Fund.<\/p><p>The purpose of the Defence Fund is to promote research and innovation and contribute to the strengthening of the European defence technology and industrial base, and to further stimulate the development of key defence capabilities.  The Commission has proposed that the fund would have research and capability windows.<\/p><p>In the <i>research window<\/i>, it is proposed that &euro;90 million in funding will be made available for collaborative defence research projects over the period 2017-20 in what is known as the &quot;preparatory action&quot;.  The Commission also proposed that, post 2020, a European Defence Research Programme will be established which will require funding of &euro;500 million per annum.  It should be noted that this has yet to be negotiated as part of the post 2020 multiannual financial framework, the negotiation of which has not yet commenced.<\/p><p>Under the <i>capability window<\/i>, the establishment of a fund is proposed.  The fund would facilitate Member States in purchasing capability platforms together through the pooling of national contributions, where possible supported by the EU budget.  The Commission estimates that this fund would be in the region of &euro;5 billion per year.  It is important to highlight that this would depend on individual Member States agreeing to initiate joint projects which they would co-fund from national resources.  To date, no such ambition on pooling resources across the union has been realised.<\/p><p>For certain Member States in the EU, defence is a significant contributor to their economies, representing an EU industry of &euro;100 billion with 1.5 million direct and indirect employees.  Ireland does not have an issue with funding of defence research.  As I have stated previously to the House, for Ireland to have a well-equipped and capability driven Defence Forces we must support the funding of defence research.  Ireland may not have a defence industry but this does not stop Ireland tapping into funding through our well established companies in the dual-use product and technology sectors.  However we will have to look at how these proposals evolve in the context of the next multi-annual financial framework and where Ireland&rsquo;s best interests lie in that regard, particularly in relation to research funding in general. <\/p><p>I am also satisfied that the proposals in the Action Plan fully acknowledge and reaffirm that Defence remains a Member State prerogative.  Decisions about expenditure, military capabilities, Research and Technology are and remain matters for individual Member States in the first instance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900071#WRA00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Overseas Missions Data","counter":8,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900071#WRA00700"},{"type":"question","counter":9,"qnumday":10,"qnumall":"[15525\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900071#WRA00800","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the number of members of the Defence Forces who are currently serving overseas; the missions they are on; if he expects that number to rise or fall in 2017; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1301","askee":"1245"},{"type":"speech","counter":10,"content":"<p>As of 01 March 2017, Ireland is contributing 585 Defence Forces personnel to 9 different missions throughout the world and also to a range of international organisations and National representations.<\/p><p>The main overseas missions in which Defence Forces personnel are currently deployed are the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) with 378 personnel and the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) in Syria with 136 personnel. <\/p><p>The 378 personnel in UNIFIL serve alongside Finnish Armed Forces as part of a joint Battalion of which Ireland took over command in November 2016.

The Air Corps has experience retirements of highly experienced personnel and these retirements are outstripping the recruitment and training of replacement personnel.  The loss of experienced personnel is driven by a range of factors, including the availability of attractive job opportunities in the private and commercial semi-state sectors.

In non-crisis situations, the main focus will be on training to prepare for this role.  The White Paper on Defence also noted that members of the RDF continue to play an important role in contributing to state ceremonial events and that the Government values this contribution and decided that it should be assigned as a formal role for the Reserve. <\/p>  <p>  My Government colleagues and I recognise the important role that the Reserve Defence Force has played in contributing to Ireland&rsquo;s defence capability, and we recognise the voluntary service which has been the hallmark of the Reserve.  The Government appreciates the service of the members of the Reserve and the White Paper on Defence is clear that there is a continued requirement to retain and develop the Reserve. <\/p>  <p>  Under the current phase of implementation of White Paper actions, two relate specifically to the RDF i.e. attracting recruits from all backgrounds and conducting a skills survey with a view to establishing a Specialist Reserve.  Over the course of the lifespan of the White Paper, other projects relating to the development of the Reserve will be examined and developed by the Defence Organisation.  These include proposals to be brought forward for the operation of a scheme for opportunities for paid service by members of the Reserve.  Recruitment to both the PDF and RDF remains a priority in 2017.  Membership of the RDF is voluntary and unpaid and the quest for recruits must compete with the other organisations within the voluntary sector.  These conditions along with the unique demands of military service make the issue of attracting recruits a challenging one.  In the context of both finite resources and personnel, it is necessary to strike an appropriate balance in terms of PDF and RDF recruitment, so as to deliver the desired effects of maintaining the capacity of the Defence Forces to undertake all roles assigned to it by Government and to advance the single force structure.<\/p>  <p>  It is anticipated the next RDF recruitment campaign will commence in the second half of 2017.  Until then the RDF will continue to induct from the 2015\/2016 panel.  The Defence Forces are reviewing the 2015\/2016 RDF competition and as part of this process are examining the competition model to be used in 2017.  I am anxious to accelerate the rate of recruitment to the Reserve within means and resources.   <\/p>  <p>  With regard to funding, a budget of &euro;2.15m from the Defence vote is allocated to the Reserve with &euro;2.068m of that figure to support paid training of RDF members.  Financial support to the Reserve Defence Force Representative Association (RDFRA) is also included in the budget provision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900071#WRA02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":25,"content":"<p>Question No. 16 answered with Question No. 7.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Air Corps Strength","counter":26,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900071#WRA02500"},{"type":"question","counter":27,"qnumday":17,"qnumall":"[15402\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900071#WRA02600","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"his plans to undertake an independent cost-benefit analysis of the cost of contracted air services as against a fully staffed and resourced Air Corps; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1316","askee":"1245"},{"type":"speech","counter":28,"content":"<p>I should say at the outset that, as Minister with Responsibility for Defence, I remain open at all times to considering more efficient and effective approaches to provision of Defence services and, whilst I would never rule out the possibility of seeking an independent review of particular aspects of how the Defence Forces is managed and operates, I have no plans, for reasons that I will outline, to have the type of cost-benefit analysis suggested in the Deputy&rsquo;s question undertaken.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, I also wish to state, in relation to the reference to a fully staffed Air Corps, that it is acknowledged that, as with other areas of the public service, challenges have arisen in relation to the recruitment and retention of personnel, including pilots and Air Traffic Control staff.  I want to assure the House that there is significant work underway in the Defence Organisation, both civil and military, aimed at improving the capacity of the Air Corps.  This includes work on a range of actions to improve pilot retention, whilst recruitment of new personnel is also taking place.  Actions are also underway to return a full level of Air Traffic Control services to the Air Corps.  Air Traffic Control training is taking place and options to ensure the longer-term sustainability of such services in Baldonnel are being identified. <\/p>  <p>  As regards resourcing generally, the White Paper on Defence contains a number of commitments in relation to aircraft replacement, including replacement of the Cessna fleet with three larger aircraft, suitably equipped for Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance tasks.  The two CASA Maritime Patrol Aircraft will also be replaced, with consideration given to their replacement with larger more capable aircraft.<\/p>  <p>  The White Paper on Defence was approved by Government in 2015 and followed an extensive consultation process and a comprehensive examination of all Defence requirements over a ten year planning horizon.  On this basis, the White Paper set out the various roles assigned by Government to the Defence Forces.  These roles are varied, but include providing for the military defence of the State from armed aggression, provision of aid to the civil power - meaning in practice to assist, when requested, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, who have primary responsibility for the internal security of the State, and also to contribute to national resilience through the provision of specified &lsquo;aid to the civil authority&rsquo; supports to lead agencies in response to major emergencies.<\/p>  <p>  The Air Corps contributes to the fulfilment of these, and indeed to all of the other roles assigned to the Defence Forces, and clearly has and will continue to have a significant contribution to make in this regard, which is also reflective of the need for the Defence Forces to operate jointly.  The various roles assigned are mutually supporting and the capacity of the Defence Forces to undertake these fully has a multiplier effect.  To look at one service in isolation would fail to capture the value that the services provide through joint approaches to the roles assigned.   <\/p>  <p>  In contributing to meeting the roles assigned to the Defence Forces, it is currently the case that various aspects of the provision of aviation services are out-sourced by the Air Corps, principally in the areas of aircraft maintenance, pilot training and technician training.  The reasons for this are because the cost of in-house provision of such niche expertise and equipment required would be prohibitively expensive in the context of the number of airframes operated by the Air Corps.  Indeed, I understand that this is normal practice internationally. <\/p>  <p>  My Department and the Defence Forces continue to keep an open mind in relation to the possibility of out-sourcing generally, but it must be acknowledged that there are clearly limits to how far this can go, given the security sensitive nature of many Air Corps&rsquo; operations provided to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Revenue Customs Service which means that an in-house capacity is critical.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900071#WRA02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Remuneration","counter":29,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900071#WRA02800"},{"type":"question","counter":30,"qnumday":18,"qnumall":"[15267\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900071#WRA02900","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"when the Public Service Pay Commission analysis on the most appropriate pay levels for the public service, including the Defence Forces, will be completed; and if the recommendations will be made public.","asker":"1258","askee":"1245"},{"type":"speech","counter":31,"content":"<p>You will be aware that the Public Service Pay Commission, announced by my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, has been tasked with providing analysis and advice on remuneration for the public service, including the Defence Forces, in the context of the FEMPI Acts 2009 - 2015.<\/p>  <p>  The Public Service Pay Commission is expected to report in the coming months.

Such awards are made on the recommendation of a Military Board appointed by the Chief of Staff for the purpose of examining and reporting on every recommendation for an award.<\/p>  <p>  The issue of the award of medals to the men of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company, 35th Infantry Battalion was comprehensively addressed in 1965.  A properly constituted Medals Board considered the various cases presented and made a decision that no medals would be awarded.  The Chief of Staff of the day considered the decision of the Board and was satisfied with the findings.  Subsequently, the question was raised again in a letter to a newly appointed Chief of Staff.  He forwarded the letter to the original Medals Board and asked that they reconvene and review their decision. <\/p>  <p>  The Board indicated that the issues raised had received due consideration and that they were not prepared to alter their findings.<\/p>  <p>  The review conducted in 2004 was not conducted by a Board established to consider the award of medals, but for the purpose of a broader examination of the Jadotville case.  This Board of Military Officers recommended that the events of Jadotville and the contribution of the 35th Battalion be given recognition.  In this context, in November 2005, a plaque was unveiled in Custume Barracks Athlone to commemorate the events at Jadotville and the very significant contribution of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company and of the 35th Battalion, as a whole, to the UN Peace Support Mission in the Congo.<\/p>  <p>  Further recognition of their contribution over subsequent years was as follows:<\/p>  <p>A. There was a pre sentation of scrolls in 2006.<\/p>  <p>B. Portraits of Lt Col McNamee (35th Battalion Commander) and Comdt Quinlan (Company Commander &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company) were commissioned.  On the 23 rd February 2007 these portraits were unveiled at the Military College and now hang in the Congo Room in the United Nations Training School in the Curragh.<\/p>  <p>C. In July of 2010 the 50th anniversary of the first deployment to the Congo was commemorated in a highly publicised and well attended event in Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel.  A Congo photographic book was also produced for the occasion; a section of which was dedicated to the events at Jadotville in 1961.<\/p>  <p>D.

I organised and hosted a ceremony in Custume Barracks, Athlone on Saturday 17 September 2016 at which a Unit Citation was presented to the Company in recognition of their collective heroism and professional performance during the Siege of Jadotville whilst cut-off from support and reinforcements.  During the ceremony I presented a copy of the Citation to each member of the Unit or next-of-kin in the case of deceased members.

As I previously advised the House, there have been proposals around for some time, that the EU should establish a joint operational headquarter capacity to support the planning and conduct of its civil and military operations.  A permanent joint civil-military operational headquarters, appropriately configured, could potentially deliver more effective and responsive CSDP operations in support of the UN and international peace and security, a position which Ireland supports drawing together the civil and military aspect of crisis management operations in the comprehensive approach.<\/p>  <p>  The proposal currently being advanced is the development of civil\/military planning and conduct capabilities, coordinated through a joint coordination cell, to improve the EU's capacity to react in a faster, more effective and more seamless manner.  The proposal is to build on existing structures with a view to enhancing civilian-military synergies to support the effective planning and operation of civilian and non-executive military CSDP missions, as part of the EU's Comprehensive Approach.<\/p>  <p>  In effect this means the creation of a Military Planning and Conduct Capability (MPCC), within the existing EU Military Staff structures in Brussels, which will be responsible at the strategic level for the operational planning and conduct of non-executive military missions working under the political control and strategic guidance direction of the Political and Security Committee.  Non-executive military missions are capacity building, training and advisory missions.   <\/p>  <p>  This newly created MPCC will work in parallel and in a coordinated way with the Civilian Planning and Conduct Capability (CPCC) supported by a Joint Support Coordination Cell which brings together the civilian and military expertise in key mission support areas.

The decision was taken because it was clear that the three brigade structure was no longer viable, particularly when compared to international norms.<\/p>  <p>  Key aspects of the re-organisation included the consolidation of under-strength units into a smaller number of full strength units, a reduction in the number of headquarters and the associated re-deployment of personnel from administrative and support functions to operational units.<\/p>  <p>  The White Paper on Defence, which was published in 2015, resulted from a comprehensive examination of Defence requirements over a ten year planning horizon and it specifically provides for the retention of the Army&rsquo;s two Brigade structure.<\/p>  <p>  The re-organisation has maintained the operational capacity of the Defence Forces to the greatest extent possible within the available resource envelope and has improved the deployability and sustainability of the Defence Forces, both at home and overseas.  There are no plans to return to a three brigade structure which would cause a range of unnecessary inefficiencies, such as an increased administrative burden arising from the need to re-introduce a layer of non-operational middle management, and a return to under-strength units.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Given the unique and demanding nature of military life, there is understandably a very high level of turnover among Defence Forces personnel.  However, this is not new and pre-dates the 2012 re-organisation.  The Defence Forces have always had a large turnover of approximately 500 personnel on an annual basis.  Moreover, a certain level of turnover is of course desirable as a human resources and organisational objective in order to maintain an appropriate age profile across the Defence Forces and to retain an approach to regular revitalisation. <\/p>  <p>  In order to ameliorate the challenges associated with the turnover of personnel, a continuous yearly recruitment drive is operated by the Defence Forces and in 2017 it is planned to recruit 860 personnel across all services.<\/p>  <p>  Additionally, the Defence Forces operates a scheme of voluntary exit interviewing of personnel of all ranks and from all services to ascertain any potential trends or future challenges.  The reasons provided are many fold and can range from economic factors, to family circumstances, lifestyle, and a desire for a change in career.   <\/p>  <p>  One of the key policies supporting personnel retention is the opportunity for extensive personal and professional development offered by the Defence Forces through accredited courses, and a unique range of careers.  But it is also the case that the extensive professional training they receive makes them very attractive to the private sector.  It is acknowledged that the resurgence in the private sector jobs market is impacting on the Defence Forces at this time. <\/p>  <p>  In terms of pay, the position is that the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts of 2009-2015 and the Public Service Stability Agreement 2013-2018 (Lansdowne Road Agreement) define current pay policy across the public service.<\/p>  <p>  The Defence Forces Climate Survey published in 2016 was conducted in order to inform consideration of the ongoing human resource and strategic needs of the Defence Forces.  The Survey findings clearly point to challenges for the Defence Forces, particularly in the areas of leadership, communication, organisational culture, the working environment and active management of personal expectations.  However, many positives also emanated from the Survey, especially in relation to the commitment of personnel to the values and mission of the Organisation, high levels of work satisfaction, pride in the Organisation and positive views on culture and work support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900072#WRB03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Operations","counter":94,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900072#WRB03800"},{"type":"question","counter":95,"qnumday":46,"qnumall":"[15263\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900072#WRB03900","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"if the Army was called on to perform aid to the civil power duties at Shannon Airport on 23 and 24 January 2017; and if aid to the civil power duties were requested for a plane (details supplied).","asker":"1259","askee":"1245"},{"type":"speech","counter":96,"content":"<p>The Department of Justice and Equality and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have primary responsibility for the internalsecurity of the State.

The Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau leads out the policing strategy for tackling drugs supply and works closely with dedicated Divisional Drugs units and other national units, including the Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB) in targeting persons involved in the illicit sale and supply of drugs.

The CSO publish figures for recorded incidents involving discrimination.  I expect to receive the final figures for 2016 today, which I will make available to the Deputy, but, in the meantime, I can inform the Deputy that up to the end of quarter 3 of 2016, there were 153 recorded incidents with a discrimination motive.   <\/p>  <p>  I would like to assure the Deputy that there are mechanisms in place to deal with hate motivated crime.  Where a criminal offence such as assault, criminal damage or a public order offence is committed against a person based on their race, religion, colour, ethnicity or some other ground, the offence is prosecuted through the wider criminal law.  It is also accepted that such an offence is more serious on account of the hate or prejudice motivating the crime and Irish courts do consider evidence of a crime being motivated by hate or prejudice as an aggravating factor at sentencing.  <\/p>  <p>  With respect to legislation establishing hate crime as a specific and punishable crime, it is important that any legislation which is introduced will allow for effective prosecution of these type of offences.  I would also remind the Deputy of the second stage debate in this House in October last year with respect to a Criminal Justice (Aggravation by Prejudice) Bill which is a Private Member's Bill introduced by Deputy O'Loughlin and Deputy Murphy O'Connor.  While there was support for the principle of the Bill, there were a number of concerns raised in respect of the approach proposed and the Deputies sponsoring the Bill undertook to further engage in respect of the proposals therein.  I recently received further correspondence from Deputy O'Loughlin in respect of that Bill and I intend to further engage with the Deputies in relation to their proposals.  <\/p>  <p>  I would also like to draw the attention of the Deputy to the 2016 Annual Report of the EU Fundamental Rights Agency which found that to address racism and xenophobia, EU Member States should ensure that any case of alleged hate crime or hate speech is effectively investigatied, prosecuted and tried.  The Garda Racial Intercultural and Diversity Office (GRIDO) has responsibility for coordinating, monitoring and advising on all aspects of policing Ireland's diverse communities.  GRIDO monitors the reporting and recording of hate and racist crime on a continual basis.  Garda Ethnic Liaison Officers (ELOs) are appointed to work with minority communities at local level throughout the country.  These officers combined with GRIDO play a fundamental role in liaising with minority groups and work in partnership to encourage tolerance, respect and understanding within communities in the pursuit of preventing the commission of hate and racist crime. GRIDO and ELOs provide advice and assistance to victims of hate or racist crime where required or deemed necessary. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Office for the Promotion of Migrant Integration, an Office of my Department, is the focal point for the Government's commitment on anti-racism as a key aspect of integration, diversity management and broader national social policy.  The Office continues to work with all the relevant sectors to further progress the integration and diversity management agenda. <\/p>  <p>  Following the completion of a review of our approach to the integration of migrants the Migrant Integration Strategy was published on the 7th of February, 2017.  The Integration Strategy includes an anti-racism component and is available at www.integration.ie.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900073#WRC01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service Administration","counter":134,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900073#WRC01400"},{"type":"question","counter":135,"qnumday":60,"qnumall":"[15610\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900073#WRC01500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the total spend on translation services used to translate the new application form for international protection, IPO2.","asker":"1259","askee":"1214"},{"type":"question","counter":136,"qnumday":61,"qnumall":"[15611\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900073#WRC01600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if free online translation services were used to translate the new application form for international protection, IPO2, into any language; and if so, the languages for which a programme (details supplied) was used.","asker":"1259","askee":"1214"},{"type":"question","counter":137,"qnumday":62,"qnumall":"[15612\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900073#WRC01700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if persons who submitted completed application forms for international protection in the midst of confusion in February 2017 over the deadline for submission of the form, and did not, consequently, receive legal advice before submission, will be permitted to resubmit those application forms, not just submit supplementary information following receipt of legal advice.","asker":"1259","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":138,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 60 to 62, inclusive, together.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised by the Chief International Protection Officer (CIPO) who, under the International Protection Act 2015, is independent in the performance of his functions, that translation services for the International Protection Office (IPO) of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) are provided on the basis of a public procurement process and subsequent contractual arrangements entered into between a service provider and INIS.<\/p>  <p>  The current service provider, Word Perfect Translation Services Ltd, is contractually obliged to provide such services in a professional manner and in accordance with industry standards.

In particular, my concerns stem from the fact that sizeable numbers of the general public have interacted and will interact with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the context of road traffic enforcement, including at a Mandatory Alcohol Testing checkpoint.  As such, it is critical that there is public confidence in the operation and oversight of these vital enforcement systems. <\/p><p>The Deputy will be aware that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has confirmed that it has put solutions in place to deal with the procedural and practice issues that have been detected to ensure that such errors do not recur.  Specifically, in the case of breath tests\/Mandatory Alcohol Testing, I am informed that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na initially put in place new paper based recording and verification processes, and, in November 2016, a new specific data recording IT upgrade was installed on the Garda PULSE system.  The net effect of the new IT upgrade was that personnel now have to record the serial number of the device used for each breath test plus the meter reading before and after the checkpoint was concluded.  Data from the device is now used to verify the total number of breath tests conducted at each checkpoint.<\/p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the Garda Commissioner has announced the creation of a dedicated team under newly-appointed Assistant Commissioner Michael O&rsquo;Sullivan to investigate in detail the MATs issue, including with a view to identifying and holding responsible for their actions any Garda members, whether at junior, supervisory or management level, who acted improperly; and committed to forwarding the report of this investigation to the Policing Authority and Department of Justice and Equality when completed.  <\/p><p>Notwithstanding any internal review, the Government believes that an external investigation into these two specific matters needs be carried out.  The Government believes the level of public concern is now so profound that it may now be time to conduct a thorough, comprehensive and independent root-and-branch review of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That is clearly a proposal that will require further detailed consideration by the Government.  The Government also believes that any such proposal should command widespread support in the Oireachtas and accordingly be the subject of consultation with the Opposition, and ultimately approval by the Oireachtas. <\/p><p>Assistant Commissioner Finn outlined new arrangements agreed this week with the Medical Bureau on Roads Safety to the effect that that body would supply An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with its data on breath-testing devices on a quarterly basis, in order to ensure an independent benchmark against which Garda data can be measured.  The MBRS will shortly be tendering for new breath testing equipment.

The 1987 Regulations also contain provisions governing the treatment of children in Garda custody and these are consistent with the requirements of the 2001 Act. <\/p>  <p>  A key protection for children is the requirement on the member in charge of the station where the child is in custody to inform an appropriate adult that the child is in custody and to request that adult to attend at the station.  In circumstances where the member in charge is unable to communicate with a parent or guardian, or where the parent or guardian indicates that he or she cannot or will not attend at the station, the child is entitled to have an adult relative or other adult reasonably named by him or her informed that he or she is in custody and be requested to attend at the Garda station.  Failing this, the member in charge must ensure that an appropriate adult, other than a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, attends.<\/p>  <p>  A child may not be questioned or requested to make a written statement unless he or she is in the presence of a parent, guardian or other appropriate adult. <\/p>  <p>  There are also specific rules governing searches.  For example, a person in custody cannot be searched by a person, other than a doctor, of the opposite sex.  Where a search involves removal of clothing, other than outer garments, no person of the opposite sex can be present unless either that person is a doctor or the member in charge considers that the presence of that person is necessary by reason of the violent conduct of the person to be searched.  Where a search involves the removal of underclothing, it will normally be carried out by a doctor.<\/p>  <p>  Every person in custody is provided at the outset with a document explaining the custody processes and setting out the rights of the persons including in relation to:<\/p>  <p> - legal advice;<\/p>  <p> - medical treatment;<\/p>  <p> - telephone calls and personal visits;<\/p>  <p> - searches; provision of meals;<\/p>  <p> - the taking of photographs, fingerprints and other bodily samples.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900073#WRC04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Visa Applications","counter":162,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900073#WRC04200"},{"type":"question","counter":163,"qnumday":72,"qnumall":"[15728\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900073#WRC04300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the documentation and other requirements a Syrian national would be required to provide in order to obtain a category C visitor's visa for 90 days to visit family here, in tabular form; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1341","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":164,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that visa application procedures for a short-stay visa (category C) for Syrian nationals are the same as applies to all other visa required nationalities.

Knowledge Transfer Ireland (KTI) now has responsibility for setting direction for research performing organisations (RPOs) best practice to enable compliance with IP policy and procedures.<\/p><p>The publication of the national IP protocol in 2012, and its subsequent refresh in 2016, sought to establish policy and guidelines on the interactions between industry and Ireland&rsquo;s Higher Education Institutes, including the treatment of intellectual property.\u00a0 It provides guidelines and sets expectations for the RPOs and for industry.<\/p><p>The national IP Protocol 2016 comprises two volumes:<\/p><p>- the National IP Protocol policy document which sets out the framework underpinning research collaboration and access to intellectual property from state-funded research<\/p><p>- the IP Protocol Resource Guide which provides an overview of the national IP management guidelines and links to resources and template documents, available for industry and RPOs.\u00a0 It also provides an overview of the knowledge transfer structures in Ireland and the kinds of agreements that can be used to formalise research-industry engagements.<\/p><p>The protocol explains the National IP Management Requirements and requires that RPOs have in place and operate internal IP management systems that meet or exceed these.\u00a0 The protocol also includes &ldquo;good practice&rdquo; that will normally be followed.\u00a0 However, industry and RPOs are free to adopt a different approach where this is in the best interests of successful relationships and research commercialisation.\u00a0\u00a0Practices are also highlighted that may be followed if industry\/RPOs choose to do so.<\/p><p>The IP Protocol is a key reference source for Ireland&rsquo;s HEIs and research funders.  HEIs have developed IP policies that are in line with national guidelines and good practice.\u00a0\u00a0These will include policy on spin-out formation.\u00a0 The detail of policies will differ amongst institutions. <\/p><p>The research funding agencies for the publicly funded research system all require that the higher education institutions own the intellectual property arising from research projects that they fund.  Each University and IoT has a set of policies that cover how they will govern the use of that IP.<\/p><p>The national IP Protocol explains that commercialisation may benefit HEIs and provide incentives to the researchers involved in creating IP.  IP may include protectable IP and know-how.  Furthermore, the national IP management requirements make provision for HEIs to have in place a system for sharing of income from commercialising within the organisation, including with relevant researchers.<\/p><p>It is international practice that researchers may hold shares in spin-out companies.  The national IP Protocol makes it clear that HEIs should have policies and procedures in place that minimise or manage potential or actual conflicts of interest concerning the commercialisation of IP.<\/p><p>The IP Protocol (National IP Management Requirements) refers to conflict of interest as it applies to commercialisation of IP.\u00a0 <\/p><p>The national IP Protocol is clear on the policy and processes to identify, protect and commercialise IP that arises in HEIs.  This includes guidance on licensing of IP.  A suite of Model Agreements, available for use if HEIs and companies choose, covering a range of IP licensing scenarios is available on the KTI website.<\/p><p>In addition, all HEIs are requested yearly as part of their governance statements to state that a code of conduct for Governing Body members and a Code of Conduct for Employees has been adopted and is being monitored.\u00a0\u00a0Guidelines for these codes are included in the IOT and University Codes of Governance (section 3.2).<\/p><p>The University Code of Governance has been implemented since 2007 and was updated in 2012.\u00a0 A copy of the code is available here:<\/p><p>The Institutes of Technology Code of Governance published in 2012 replaces an earlier document published in 2003.\u00a0 A copy of the code is available here:<\/p><p>At institutional level, the Code of Conduct for employees and members of governing authorises would include statements related to conflict of interest and outside employment.\u00a0<\/p><p>In addition to the national framework set out in the IP Protocol, each of the research funding bodies has contracts and agreements which set out the requirements on HEIs, including in relation to knowledge transfer.<\/p><p>As I have previously indicated to the Deputy, I have not been informed of occasions where breaches of policy have occurred.<\/p><p>As the Deputy is aware, a review\u00a0is underway in Waterford Institute of Technology.\u00a0 The purpose of the review is\u00a0to establish if\u00a0the institution's interests have been appropriately represented and protected, that all relevant policies, protocols and procedures have been complied with and satisfactory governance processes have been applied.

The YEI allocation for Ireland of &euro;68m is matched by equal amounts from our ESF allocation and from the Exchequer, giving an overall allocation of &euro;204m.  <\/p>  <p>  The ESF Regulations provide for initial pre-financing\/advances of EU support at 1% (or 1.5% for Member States under financial assistance in 2014 and 2015) of the full programme support, payable for each year from 2014 to 2016, together with annual pre-financing of between 2% and 3% payable from 2016 to 2023.  In May 2015 an amendment to the relevant EU Regulations resulted in an unprecedented increase in the YEI advances to be paid to Member States.  The Commission subsequently released pre-financing payments from the dedicated YEI budget line, worth 30% of the YEI budget, to provide additional financial liquidity to support YEI implementation.  However, the relevant Regulations specified that where a Member State did not submit an interim payment application by 23 May 2016 for at least 50% of the additional pre-financing amount, that the Member State must reimburse the Commission the total YEI pre-financing contribution.  The ESF regulations also provide that annual pre-financing for any year in which an interim payment application is not made in that year must also be reimbursed.<\/p>  <p>  As work on the designation of the relevant ESF authorities, including the provision of a national computerised accounting and information system for EU funds to meet the 2014-2020 functionality requirements is continuing, Ireland did not comply with the requirement to submit an interim YEI payment application by the due date.  Accordingly, &euro;19.8m additional pre-financing received was reimbursed to the Commission.  Furthermore, as there was no ESF application made in 2016, the &euro;11.6m annual pre-financing for 2016, including &euro;1.36m for the YEI, will be offset against the 2017 pre-financing due. <\/p>  <p>   The reimbursement of these amounts has not resulted in any loss of EU monies to the Exchequer.  The YEI funding is available for drawdown before the end of 2018 and while a claim for funding has not been made to date it is expected that the funding will be fully drawn down.  The ESF Managing Authority and the Operational Programme Monitoring Committee (PMC) maintain an ongoing overview of the funding allocations under the PEIL and will re-allocate the available funding as required, in accordance with the EU Regulatory provisions.  The PMC has agreed in principle to the inclusion of the Community Training Centres, which are funded by the ETBs in consultation with SOLAS, as an approved activity under the YEI with effect from 1 January 2017.  The other actions originally selected for YEI funding, are the Back to Work Enterprise Allowance; JobBridge; JobsPlus Incentive Scheme; T&uacute;s; Youthreach, Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme and Momentum.  As the activities concerned are fully funded up-front by the Exchequer there is no resulting reduction or delay in the funding available to those activities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900074#WRD03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1351"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Properties","counter":223,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900074#WRD04000"},{"type":"question","counter":224,"qnumday":96,"qnumall":"[15599\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900074#WRD04100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the status of his Department's ownership of a school (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1242","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":225,"content":"<p>The\u00a0property to which the Deputy refers is in my ownership.

Substantial research, analysis, consultation with service users and stakeholders, and piloting have gone in to the development of this model and all of the evidence points to the fact that this new system will deliver better outcomes for children. <\/p>  <p>  No school, including the school to which the Deputy has referred, will lose supports as a result of the implementation of the new model.  In addition, no school will receive an allocation, for the support of pupils with complex needs, less than the allocation they received to support such pupils during the 2016\/17 school year. <\/p>  <p>  For the introduction of the new allocation model, from September 2017, the NCSE &lsquo;Low Incidence&rsquo; allocations which had been made for each school during the preceding 2016\/17 school year, have been used to establish the complex needs component of the new model for each school.  This has ensured that the most up to date data on the distribution of pupils in this category accross the school system has been used.<\/p>  <p>  No allocation made for such pupils\u00a0by the NCSE will be removed from schools as long as that pupil remains in the school. <\/p>  <p>  An\u00a0additional 900 teaching posts\u00a0have been provided to support the introduction of this new allocation model.  The provision of an additional 900 teaching posts is a very significant investment in the provision of additional\u00a0teaching support for pupils with special educational needs in our schools.  This is additional to an increase of 41% in the number of resource teachers allocated to schools annually by the NCSE since 2011. <\/p>  <p>  The additional funding will provide additional supports to over 1000 schools who are identified as needing additional supports as a result of the new model.  Supports for children with special educational needs is a key priority for this Government.  The new funding will ensure that all schools receive a sufficient allocation\u00a0of special education needs resources to provide additional teaching support to all pupils, including pupils who have yet to enrol in their school, who require such support.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the particular school referred to by the Deputy in his question, this school had a General Allocation Model allocation\u00a0of 50 hours for the 2016\/17 school year, which combined with 30.18\u00a0resource teaching hours allocated to the school by the National Council for Special Education,\u00a0gave\u00a0a total allocation to the school of 80.18 additional teaching hours for the 2016\/17 school year.<\/p>  <p>  As the profiled allocation for the school did not indicate an increased allocation requirement for the school for 2017\/18, the school has maintained its existing level of allocation.<\/p>  <p>  The special education teaching allocation for this school for 2017\/18 is 80.18 hours.<\/p>  <p>  There has therefore been no reduction to the special education teaching allocation for this school.<\/p>  <p>  Schools must notify the Department on Form S.E.T.Cluster 2017, Appendix D of the primary Staffing Schedule,\u00a0of their clustering arrangements for their new Special Education allocation. <\/p>  <p>  Completed forms should be returned to the Department&rsquo;s Primary Teacher Allocations Section as soon as possible but no later than close of business on 30th March 2017. <\/p>  <p>  S.E.T. hours that are clustered into new full-time permanent posts and received before this deadline will be automatically approved by the Department.  Schools that do not return the completed form within the above timeframe or where all of a school&rsquo;s S.E.T hours are not clustered into full-time posts will be included, as appropriate, in the Department led clustering process. <\/p>  <p>  Guidelines for schools on the organisation, deployment and use of their special education teachers to address the need of pupils with special educational needs are also being prepared and will be published shortly.<\/p>  <p>  The Guidelines will support schools to reflect on how they can review and manage their timetabling practices to ensure the timetable is sufficiently flexible to meet the needs of all pupils in their school who have special needs.  The Guidelines encourage schools to ensure they deploy their resources appropriately to meet the needs of all of the children in their school who require additional teaching support, including pupils with emerging needs, or new entrants. <\/p>  <p>  The NCSE has announced the commencement of an independent appeals process through which schools may appeal the allocation made to their school\u00a0if they believe the data upon which the allocation is based is incorrect or has been incorrectly used.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900074#WRD05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Site Acquisitions","counter":242,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900074#WRD05900"},{"type":"question","counter":243,"qnumday":102,"qnumall":"[15671\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900074#WRD06000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the status of plans to secure a site for a school (details supplied).","asker":"1259","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":244,"content":"<p>Officials in my Department are currently liaising with the school authorities in relation to the provision of a permanent\u00a0accommodation solution for the school to which the Deputy refers.\u00a0 Once a preferred solution has been identified, my Department will work to advance the project as expeditiously as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900074#WRD06100","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":245,"content":"<p>Question No. 103 answered with Question No. 101.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Educational Psychological Service","counter":246,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900074#WRD06300"},{"type":"question","counter":247,"qnumday":104,"qnumall":"[15710\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900074#WRD06400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"when a NEPS assessment in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kerry will be carried out; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1318","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":248,"content":"<p>I\u00a0can inform the Deputy that my Department's National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) provides educational psychology service to all primary and post primary schools through an assigned NEPS psychologist and in some cases through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA), full details of which are on the Department's website.  Under this scheme schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.<\/p>  <p>  In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service.  The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring.  Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximize positive outcomes for these pupils.  NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties.  Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process.  Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. <\/p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.

This declined to 68 admissions in 2016, out of a total of 380 admissions of child and adolescents, despite increasing demands overall.  The number of  admissions  does not necessarily equate to the actual number of children involved, as an individual child may be admitted on more than one occasion in any given year.  There has to be some operational flexibility surrounding emergency placements in Adult Units, particularly where very short-term placements occur,  and where full account is taken of all relevant factors such as the preferences of all those involved, or geographical factors relating to access or visiting.  The HSE closely monitors on a weekly basis all child admissions to adult units, with a view to minimising these.<\/p>  <p>  Additional resources over recent years means that we now have 67 CAMHS teams, and 3 Paediatric Liason Teams, supported by 66 operational CAMHS beds across the country.  A lack of funding for the mental health care programme is not a difficulty at present for the HSE, but there are acknowledged staff recruitment and retention difficulties across the health care system, including CAMHS, that the Executive is addressing.  A new Standard Operating Procedure introduced in June 2015 has provided greater clarity and consistency on how this specialist mental health service for children should be delivered nationally.  Despite increasing demands overall on CAMHS, irrespective of the source of referrals, individual cases professionally assessed as requiring urgent access to services receive priority.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE Service Plan 2017 provides for further development of the CAMHS service, including better out-of-hours liaison and seven-day response cover, against a background where the population of children is expected to increase by around 8,500 over 2016-17.  Around 18,500 children will attend the HSE CAMHS service this year, including around 14,000 referrals.  Detailed activity data on CAMHS is published by the Executive in its monthly Performance Reports available on the HSE website.  This shows, for example, 68% of children referred are seen within twelve weeks.  My objective, and that of the HSE, is to further improve all aspects of mental health care nationally for those under age 18, including those relating to age appropriate care settings.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900076#WRF05400","answer":true,"speaker":"1337"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Services Provision","counter":370,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900076#WRF05500"},{"type":"question","counter":371,"qnumday":146,"qnumall":"[15591\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900076#WRF05600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans for further investment at a training centre (details supplied); the services available there at present; the number of staff working at this facility currently; the staff that have been allocated in the past 12 months; his plans to increase staff at this facility; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":372,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives, provide greater independence in accessing the services they choose and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.

As already mentioned, I have also created a Stakeholder Consultative Committee, which is complemented by frequent contact with representative organisations and companies on an ongoing basis.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Last October, as part of Budget 2017, I announced measures aimed at alleviating the pressures of\u00a0exchange rate\u00a0volatility associated with\u00a0Brexit.\u00a0 These measures included the introduction of the &lsquo;Agri Cashflow Support Loan&rsquo; fund of &euro;150 million; enhanced taxation measures and an additional\u00a0allocation of &euro;1.6m in 2016 and &euro;2m in 2017 to Bord Bia to ensure that they are in a position to provide Brexit-related supports to affected companies.\u00a0 I also provided for increased funding under the Rural Development Programme and Seafood Development Programme.<\/p>  <p>  I recently awarded over\u00a0&euro;1.8 million in grants to 19 seafood enterprises under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund Operational Programme for the seafood sector.\u00a0 The aim of these grants is to incentivise seafood innovation and new product development as a means of meeting the Brexit challenge.<\/p>  <p>  I am also involved in a series of bilateral meetings with my EU counterparts which is aimed at building alliances to ensure that agri-food and fisheries issues are at the top of the EU negotiation agenda.\u00a0 I want to discuss and get a sense of the importance of Brexit for them and of the degree to which they could support Ireland&rsquo;s efforts to have these issues specifically and adequately taken account of in the negotiations. <\/p>  <p>  I have just returned from a series of such bilaterals in Germany, Netherlands and Denmark, and most recently in\u00a0Estonia and Poland.\u00a0 I have plans to meet other EU Ministers next month.<\/p>  <p>  I am also in regular communication with Commissioner Hogan, and my officials have taken part in meetings with the Commission and the Barnier Task Force.<\/p>  <p>  In all of these engagements I am making clear our demand for continued unfettered access to the UK market, without tariffs and with minimal additional customs and administrative procedures, as well as keeping the UK market viable for Irish producers by minimising the risk from UK trade agreements with third countries.

Equipment priorities for the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps are being considered in the context of the lifetime of the White Paper on Defence as part of the capability development and equipment planning process.<\/p>  <p>  In this context the White Paper provides that the Army will continue to retain all-arms conventional military capabilities.  The principal aim over the period of the White Paper will be to replace and upgrade, as required, existing capabilities in order to retain a flexible response for a wide range of operational requirements both at home and overseas.   <\/p>  <p>  There is focus on the essential force protection provided by armoured vehicles, and in this regard a maintenance and upgrade programme has commenced for the current fleet of 80 Armoured Personnel Carriers (APCs) which will seek to ensure viability of the fleet out to 2030.  A small number of armoured logistical and utility vehicles are also being procured for force protection. <\/p>  <p>  The White Paper underpins the ongoing replacement of the Naval Service fleet.  A significant investment over recent years has been on the procurement of new Off-Shore Patrol Vessels for the Naval Service.  The third ship in the programme, L&Eacute; William Butler Yeats, was commissioned in to service in October 2016.  A contract for an additional sister ship was placed with Babcock International in June 2016 at a cost of &euro;54.3m, bringing investment in the new ships programme to over &euro;250 million since 2010.  The fourth ship is scheduled for delivery in mid 2018. <\/p>  <p>  Future Naval Service capabilities are being planned as part of the White Paper project planning process which will determine the Defence Organisation&rsquo;s maritime capability requirements.<\/p>  <p>  The White Paper provides that the Air Corps will see the Cessna fleet replaced with three larger aircraft suitably equipped for Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance tasks.  The aircraft specification is currently being prepared, and it is expected that the tender competition will be initiated and advertised on the e-tenders website in the near future.  The White Paper also provides for the replacement of two CASA 235s Maritime Patrol Aircraft by 2019, with consideration of their replacement with larger more capable aircraft.  This would enhance maritime surveillance and provide a greater degree of utility for transport and cargo carrying tasks.<\/p>  <p>  A decision was made in 2016 to replace a PC-9M aircraft which was written off following a fatal crash in 2009.  The replacement PC-9M aircraft, scheduled for delivery this year from Pilatus Aircraft in Switzerland at a cost of &euro;5m plus VAT, will bring the fleet up to 8 and will assist in a required increase in pilot training in the Air Corps.<\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the current provisions, together with the courses of action in the White Paper, will continue to ensure that the Defence Forces is suitably equipped, in line with international best practice, to fulfil all roles assigned by Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900079#WRJ04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Overseas Missions","counter":580,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900079#WRJ05000"},{"type":"question","counter":581,"qnumday":217,"qnumall":"[15707\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032900079#WRJ05100","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the extent to which he has had discussions at EU and UN level with regard to future deployment of the Defence Forces overseas; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1245"},{"type":"speech","counter":582,"content":"<p>As of 01 March 2017, Ireland is contributing 585 Defence Forces personnel to 9 different missions throughout the world and also to a range of international organisations and National Representations.
