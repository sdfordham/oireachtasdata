It is important to point out that nobody knows how the Brexit process will proceed and end.  We are entering a period of intense uncertainty that will be fraught with political difficulty.  My advice to interested stakeholders in Ireland, be they at a policy or sectoral level, is that they should operate on the basis that Brexit will happen and that it will be a hard Brexit.  We should plan on that basis.  If it turns out to be better, that would be a bonus, but we need to plan for the most negative eventuality. <\/p> <p>  The British Prime Minister, Ms Theresa May, has committed to invoking Article 50 by the end of March 2017, prior to which she will outline Britain's position.  Once Article 50 is invoked, presumably before the end of March, it will set the ball in motion and bring to fruition all of the issues and concerns surrounding the process.  However, it will take much longer to provide solutions.  In theory, once Article 50 is invoked, a two-year period of negotiation will begin among the other 27 EU countries to determine what trading relationship the European should have with the United Kingdom.  If agreement is not reached in that two-year period, the United Kingdom will have to apply for an extension, subject to the approval of the other 27 member states, or failing that, it will have to adopt WTO trade arrangements, with tariffs on trade between Britain and the European Union.  It is important to point out that once Article 50 is invoked, the power in the relationship will shift very firmly to the European Union and away from the United Kingdom.  Politically, the negotiation process will be extremely difficult and complicated because every member state will have strong vested interests, as well as strong objectives.  It will be very difficult politically for the Prime Minister to deliver a settlement that will be satisfactory to her electorate and the political system in the United Kingdom.  <\/p> <p>  It is important to remember that at EU level there will be very strong motivation to make the exit process as difficult as possible for the United Kingdom, not least to dissuade other EU countries from following a similar path.  In other words, if an exit from the European Union is made remotely easy, it will create a very dangerous precedent to which EU policymakers will be reluctant to expose themselves.<\/p> <p>  The long-term issue which will arise at the end of the negotiation process is what trading relationship the United Kingdom will have with the European Union.  A soft Brexit describes a situation where the United Kingdom would have access to EU markets and make some contribution to the EU budget but where, significantly, it would have to accept the terms and conditions of the Single Market, in particular one of four key pillars of the European Union - the free movement of people.  The result of the referendum on 23 June was very heavily influenced by the notion that, in order for Britain to protect its borders against immigration, leaving the European Union was a necessity.  The problem with a soft Brexit is that if the Prime Minister was to go back and say they had agreed to access to the single European market but had to accept the free movement of people, it would be incredibly difficult to sell politically.  From the perspective of the European Union, there will be a very strong reluctance to make any concession on the free movement of people, not least because it is one of the key pillars of the Union but also because it would create a dangerous precedent for some member countries such as Hungary, for example, which has a very strong anti-immigration attitude, as demonstrated for many years. <\/p> <p>  A hard Brexit describes a situation where the United Kingdom would not be part of the customs union of the European Union and where trade between the United Kingdom and the Union would be subject to trade barriers such as tariffs and quotas.  Inevitably, this would impact negatively on the United Kingdom's trade with the European Union.  Ultimately, Britain would have to explore other export markets, but that would be easier said than done.  The reality of trade theory is that geography is the key driver.  Countries in close proximity to each other tend to trade with each other.  We should never forget this fact.  <\/p> <p>  They are the options - a soft Brexit and a hard Brexit.  I find it difficult to see compromises between these two extremes.<\/p><p>A soft Brexit will be incredibly difficult to achieve, hence my opening suggestion we plan on the basis that there will be a hard Brexit.<\/p><p> As regards the United Kingdom's economic performance since the vote on 23 June, contrary to some expectations, particularly in the economics profession in the United Kingdom, including the Treasury, the UK economy has not died.  In fact, it continues to perform strongly.  One of the key reasons for this is that Brexit has not yet happened and consumer sentiment has not yet been adversely affected.  The big issue in the slightly longer term will revolve around the attitude to business investment in the United Kingdom.  If companies investing there believe they will not have free access to the EU market, the incentive to invest in the United Kingdom will be questionable.  Nissan was going to be a key case study in this regard.  There was a distinct possibility that it was going to transfer its manufacturing activities from Sunderland because it sells most of its cars produced in Britain into the EU market.  In the event, however, it has committed to continue manufacturing the three marques it currently manufactures in Sunderland because it has obtained agreement from the Prime Minister that it will not be disadvantaged if Britain leaves the European Union.  I find that promise incredibly strange because it will be difficult to deliver on it and it also creates a dangerous precedent for other companies. <\/p><p> Looking specifically at the agrifood sector, there are two aspects to consider, the first of which is the performance of sterling.  Up to mid-November it had lost almost 30% of its value against the euro in the preceding 12 months.  A lot of that weakness occurred since the vote on 23 June.  In the past three or four weeks, for reasons related to the weakness of the euro rather than the strength of sterling, we have seen sterling regain ground.  That largely reflects problems to do with the euro, particularly the Italian vote and the political agenda in Europe next year, rather than the inherent strength of sterling.  From an Irish perspective, this obviously is of significant importance.  A couple of issues arise from the weakness of the currency, one of which is the advent of cross-Border shopping.  The last time there was a sterling crisis in 2008-09, there was massive damage was done to the agrifood and retail sectors south of the Border owing to the flow of shoppers across the Border.  We have seen that happen again in the past two or three months.  I recently conducted a price survey which suggested that, on a basket of groceries, one would make a saving of around 7%.  If one builds in the cost of travelling and fuel, plus the time involved, it makes no sense whatsoever to shop north of the Border.  It is a hugely significant issue for the retail sector in the South, particularly the agrifood sector.  While it is not directly related to the Brexit issue, the reality for the retail grocery sector in Ireland is since the sterling crisis in 2008 and 2009 the grocery environment has become incredibly competitive.  We have seen serious price compression which has squeezed margins for the agrifood sector.  The margin of compression to which it has been exposed is one of the biggest issues facing it.<\/p><p> The longer term issue is the trading relationship the European Union and, by implication, Ireland will have with the United Kingdom.  Some 60% of what indigenous Irish industry produces is exported, of which 40% goes to the United Kingdom.  For the agrifood sector specifically, 41% of exports in 2015 were to the UK market.  Therefore, the indigenous economy, including the agrifood sector, is incredibly exposed to what happens in the UK market.  In the event that there will be trade barriers post an EU exit, it will create serious difficulties for the agrifood sector.  There is no getting away from this fact.  Last year our food exports to the United Kingdom were worth &euro;5.1 billion, while we imported &euro;3.8 billion worth of goods from the United Kingdom.  A recent ERSI paper examined the tariffs applied between the European Union and non-trade agreement countries based on WTO trading arrangements.  They range from 0% to 70%.  In the food sector many of the tariffs run at between 30% and 50%.  Therefore, if Britain was to leave without some trade deal, tariffs of between 30% and 50% could be applied to food exports to the United Kingdom.  Obviously, that would create serious difficulties for the agrifood sector.  On the other hand, an opportunity would be presented for the sector by the fact that tariffs would also be applied to imports of food from the United Kingdom.<\/p><p> It is clear that the Brexit process is uncertain.  It will be difficult both at UK and EU level.  A soft Brexit with compromises will be virtually impossible to achieve.  As I said, we have to operate on the basis that there will be a hard Brexit and plan accordingly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016121300002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Power","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481644800,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Power for his opening statement.

How feasible and practical would it be for Britain to conduct such negotiations?  Will that be a consideration in a post-Brexit scenario?  If there were to be alternative proposals, for example, in the case of products such as beef, it could have a significant impact on domestic prices here.  It has been said that, potentially, the outcome of Brexit could be more harmful to the Irish economy than to the British economy owing to its size and the ability of the United Kingdom to do other deals and also our exposure to it.

Teagasc published a report in June this year on the implications of Brexit and the potential offered by it.  The report outlined the worst case scenario as being a hard Brexit with WTO trading arrangements.  In terms of the impact on exports from the agrifood sector, the figure given was about &euro;800 million.  The best case scenario involved a figure of &euro;145 million.  In Mr. Power's opinion, are these figures accurate?<\/p> <p>  There is also the possibility of the displacement of food imports from the United Kingdom.  When they appeared before the committee, representatives of Bord Bia said the nature of the products imported from the United Kingdom was very different from what was produced here; as such, there would not be much of an opportunity for displacement.  Does Mr. Power have a view on this and do Bord Bia's views concur with his own?<\/p> <p>  In his presentation Mr. Power said the tendency of the European Union would be to make the process as difficult as possible for the United Kingdom.  However, the European Union has a huge trade surplus with the United Kingdom.  For example, Germany has a trade surplus of &euro;55 billion to &euro;60 billion with the United Kingdom.  Therefore, it will not really be in Germany's interests to make the process as hard as possible.  I am sure this will come into play at some point in the negotiations.

I was very interested to hear his comments on the UK economy and how it had reacted since the vote last May.  It is unique that there was an initial dip and that it then picked up.  There were thoughts initially that food price inflation in 2017 would be a big issue in the UK market and that, depending on to whom one talked, prices would jump by 4% to 8%.  Taking into consideration the bounce in sterling in the last few weeks and months, does Mr. Power think there will still be food price inflation?  Does he consider that there will be a jump in prices of 4% to 8% or that, as a result of the change in sterling, it will not be an issue?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016121300002#F00100","speaker":"1386"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1481644800,"counter":13,"content":"<p>On the specific issue of WTO tariffs, there are 5,200 items included in the EU-WTO trading arrangements.  In the food sector they typically average between 30% and 50%.  My understanding is that the highest is on commoditised products such as beef and dairy products and could be in excess of 50%.  One way or the other, depending on the tariff applied, the elasticity of demand would be strong; therefore, if one was to have a 30% to 50% tax added to any commodity exported, it would have a huge impact on the demand for it.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Thomas Pringle asked a question about Teagasc's estimate of &euro;800 million.  That is a conservative estimate of what the damage could be, but it would obviously depends on what trading arrangement was agreed to.  If it is a hard Brexit and WTO rules are applied, the figure will be in excess of &euro;1 billion at least, but it is a number that is very difficult to calculate because one is talking about so many products and markets.  It would, however, be north of &euro;1 billion, which would be a serious hit to the agrifood sector.<\/p> <p>  One of the other big questions is, outside the European Union, will Britain seek to import cheap lamb from New Zealand?  Will it import beef from Argentina and Brazil?  My understanding is 10% of beef imports to the United Kingdom come from South America; clearly, therefore, there will be a massive push to try to increase these imports.  One of the reasons there will be a massive push is one of the problems with food policy in the United Kingdom for decades - it was instrumental in the BSE crisis - is that there has been a very strong cheap food policy.  That has been the position for years and I do not see it changing.  Rather than accepting higher food prices, as a result of the application of tariffs in the European Union, Britain will aggressively pursue cheaper sources in South America, New Zealand and other places.  That is a very real threat.  <\/p> <p>  There is a significant opportunity for the displacement of imports from the United Kingdom.  If one goes into an Irish supermarket and looks at the products on the shelves imported from the of imports from the United Kingdom - yoghurt, cheese and many basic branded products that we produce in this country - there is not too much that we import from it that we do not already produce or could not produce here.  That is the opportunity presented, but it is not, by any stretch of the imagination, an opportunity that would be sufficient to offset the damage caused by tariffs on our exports and by having reduced access to the UK market.  <\/p> <p>  There is debate about whether it would be in the interests of Germany and other EU countries to make the process as difficult as possible.  I could give the committee 100 different answers to that question because not only will the other 27 EU member countries have their own unique interests, within these countries different sectors will also have their own unique interests.  For example, car manufacturers in Germany, including BMW, that sell a lot of cars in Britain will obviously want to have as easy access as possible to the UK market.  The fundamental issue is that if one makes leaving the European Union remotely easy, it will open up a very dangerous can of worms.  Down the road one could certainly see other countries pursuing a similar path.  In the next couple of years the European Union is facing into its most difficult period since its beginning back in 1958-1959.  Much of it has to do with politics at EU level and the anti-EU sentiment coming through in the political system.  Against that backdrop, the European Union will be very reluctant to open any door that might make leaving the system easy because that would have a house of cards effect.  If one looks at the issue from a currency perspective, the reason Greece is still part of the eurozone is not that it is an incredibly important part of it but symbolically if one country was to leave the system, the house of cards could come crumbling down.  Politics will dictate that the process be made as difficult as possible.<\/p> <p>  Since the vote, the UK economy has held up very well.  To me, the key aspect at which to look at is the level of business investment in the of imports from the United Kingdom, particularly by companies that service the EU market.  That will be the real test in the next couple of years.  Given how much food the United Kingdom imports, these currency moves - we have seen the weakness of sterling - will increase food price inflation, at least initially, but it will actually intensify the efforts made by the United Kingdom to source cheaper food and that will push the agenda of exploring South America and New Zealand as potential markets for cheaper food.  The overriding point we need to remember is the attitude of the United Kingdom towards food prices and cheap food and also the total antipathy towards providing support for the UK agriculture system.  That is a big challenge for the United Kingdom.  If it leaves the European Union, it will lose CAP funding.  What will British agricultural policy be like?  It will be a lot less supportive of the UK agriculture system and perhaps that will provide another opportunity for Ireland to fill some of the gap.  It will be an incredibly difficult and complicated process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016121300002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Power"},{"type":"speech","time":1481644800,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and compliment Mr. Power on his presentation.  He has made a number of points which, if they come to pass, will prove extremely difficult.  I agree with him that it looks like a hard Brexit will be the outcome.  How will it work in practice, given the volume of trade between the two countries?  On the milk processing side, the United Kingdom does not have enough capacity to process the milk it produces.  Some 3 million litres a day crosses the Border.  How would things work with trade tariffs in place?  If having a source of cheap food is the reason it did it, it will be extremely disappointed because, leaving beef products aside, virtually everything is traded on a world market.  It will not source dairy products more cheaply than it does from this country.  If it thinks there is a rainbow of cheap food available for it, it is in for a huge disappointment.  Will the United Kingdom just leave its farmers to go bust?  The British farming sector has been under pressure for a number of years.  The attitude of British farmers to the single farm payment is a lot different from the attitude here.  The record of the British ministry in getting payments out is derisory.  Leaving that issue aside, we have seen the red tractor and protectionism of British farmers grow in recent years, with the British consumer having a preference for a UK product.<\/p><p>I cannot see that changing.  Scottish beef has been seriously promoted.  We have seen organisations push the consumption of British milk, especially on the liquid milk side.  The British are large exporters of lamb to France.  Regarding the suggestion that the United Kingdom will look to New Zealand for a cheaper source of lamb, the British will have a serious job in finding a home for all the lamb they produce.  I cannot see them making a decision to let their farmers go to the wall.  I would be worried that the United Kingdom would adopt a more protectionist attitude towards its farmers rather than the other way round, that its attitude would be one of circling the wagons, that England has to survive on its own and that it has to protect its producers.  If the United Kingdom goes down the road that Mr. Power has suggested, that will lead to land abandonment very fast because UK farmers cannot take any more punishment.<\/p><p> On our side there will be a &euro;10 billion net deficit in terms of the United Kingdom's contribution to the general EU budget and the consequences that will have for us.  I do not know how a hard deal in the context of the internal relationships between the two countries could work in practice.  There is no doubt that our beef sector would definitely be vulnerable.  The United Kingdom can source cheaper beef in other parts of the world.  Mushroom growers have said that if they had a period of six to seven months, they would be able to renegotiate their deals and compensate for the fall in the value of sterling.  They have said that they are getting increases in their product from the retailers.  As Senator Tim Lombard said, food price inflation will become more of a factor in the United Kingdom.  I believe the reverse could happen in the United Kingdom in that rather than having a cheap food policy, the British could pay more for their food with the depreciation in the value of sterling.  All this is being discussed in a vacuum but the adoption of a protectionist attitude by the United Kingdom towards its farmers would be foreign to what it has done in the past, but if it does not do that, its industry will disappear off the map.  I know we are in unknown territory, but I cannot see the United Kingdom or its consumers completely abandoning its farmers.  The Tescos of this world have built their platform on selling British food for the British consumer and I do not see that changing just because of this decision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016121300002#F00500","speaker":"1350","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481644800,"counter":16,"content":"<p>Mr. Power is welcome to the committee.  Is he aware of any analysis or research that has been done on brand loyalty among the British public?  There has been a strong cheap food policy in the United Kingdom for a long time but the British are used to the taste of the Irish food products that they have been consuming for whatever number of years.  If such research has not been concluded, it would be important to know the extent to which there is brand loyalty among the British public towards the products they know and are used to, whether that would involve Bord Bia, the multinationals, Glanbia or the Kerry Group.  It would be good if some analysis were done to explore what could be done to hold on to market share beyond price considerations.  It is not all about price.  There is a large middle class market in the United Kingdom who do not shop in Iceland, the supermarket store that sells frozen goods.

He is right in saying that given that the European Union will clearly adopt and negotiate a stance that will send out a significant signal to any other member state that might contemplate leaving the Union, the United Kingdom will be in for a rough ride.  How does Mr. Power believe we can influence Mr. Barnier, all his colleagues and fellow negotiators to reach an accommodation with us on the issues that are important here, namely, the common travel area, the free movement of goods, services and people and employment relationships?  As Deputy Jackie Cahill said, more than 1 billion litres of milk are purchased south of the Border, processed and sold as value-added products.  How can we argue for our case when 26 other member states will be arguing the toss as well?  We have a special relationship with the United Kingdom, but those member states will be watching their corner.  Mr. Barnier will have to satisfy everybody.<\/p> <p>  What would the scenario be in Mr. Power's view if tariffs were imposed and if they were combined with a weak sterling currency?  Would that not be a nightmare scenario?  That would be the ultimate sinking feeling.  Has he made any assessment of the impact of this on agriculture, especially on the beef sector?  It will be the sector that will be extremely vulnerable on foot of Mercorsur, the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP, agreement, the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA, and other such agreements.  I agree with Mr. Power that the United Kingdom certainly will not be found wanting in reaching out to trade deals that suit its market, given that it has imports of 10% Brazilian and South American beef, but those import levels were 18% or 19% only 11 years ago.  Therefore, the United Kingdom already has a record and a history of dealing in that way; therefore, that could be significant.  Mr. Power is right that we need to face up to this.  If something more benign is achieved, that would be great, but it will certainly not be easy.  Anyone here pontificating that this will be easy, given our special relationship with the United Kingdom, should realise that it will be a hard sell.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016121300002#G00300","speaker":"1370"},{"type":"speech","time":1481644800,"counter":18,"content":"<p>Mr. Power has a good few questions to answer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016121300002#G00400","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1481644800,"counter":19,"content":"<p>Deputy Jackie Cahill highlighted the dairy sector and milk processing.  A total of 800 million litres of milk come over the Border every year for processing in County Cavan and around the Border area.  In the event of a hard Brexit that would effectively stop.  The result would be that milk processing plants in County Cavan would shut down.  They would have to build milk processing plants north of the Border.  That is just one tiny example of just how serious this is.  We have lived through a dramatic recession and recessions are cyclical by nature.  They happen every six to seven years globally.  I believe Brexit is a much more fundamental structural change in an incredibly important trading relationship that Ireland has; therefore, I do not believe it should be looked at in the same light as we would look at a recession.  It is a structural change.<\/p> <p>  I hope the Deputy is correct that Britain will protect its farmers and that they will try to adopt a very supportive attitude and move away from a cheap food policy, but the track record would suggest there is little likelihood of that happening.  The UK consumer wants cheap food and that has been the reality for decades.  One of Ireland's big problems is a good deal of what we export to the United Kingdom is dominated by commodities and unbranded food products; therefore, I believe they are the ones that are very exposed because they are very sensitive to price.  Perhaps it is the case that there will be some customer loyalty to brands and to the branded products we sell.  <\/p> <p>  Deputy Michael D'Arcy raised the question of brand loyalty among the British public.  That will help the branded products to some extent, but I believe it will to a very limited extent.  At the end of the day, price will be the determining factor.  If we get a combination of sterling weakness and tariffs on trade, that will have a massive impact, of that there is no doubt.<\/p> <p>  A total of 49% of our beef exports go to the UK market.  That is by far the sector that is most exposed.  As we move up from commoditised type products to branded products, the impact starts to lessen, but it is the commoditised products that make up the bulk and that is the part that is most seriously exposed.  I skipped through my opening statement because it was too long but one of the statistics in it shows that between January 2008 and October 2016 average food prices in this country declined by 9.9%.  There is a trend towards cheap food and it is being driven by competition in the groceries sector.<\/p><p>That is why I believe there is no logic or reason for cross-Border shopping at present based on price differentials.  However, similar trends are evident in the United Kingdom and I do not envisage that changing.  Cheap food will continue to be the mantra and that will really complicate Ireland's situation <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>the United Kingdom.  I strongly advocate that organisations such as Bord Bia be given increased resources and funding to build other non-UK markets for Irish food exports.

Many of the issues have been dealt with.  Produce moving back and forth across the Border is a big issue.  I come from a Border area and many dairy products that originate in the North are processed in the South.  Likewise, in the case of cattle, many farmers from the North buy their weanlings in the South and move them back to the North.  That movement of product back and forth is a serious issue as people are finding it difficult to anticipate what will happen to it.  The broader issue is the movement of goods in general.  Much of the stuff that leaves Ireland, even if it is not going to Britain, has to go through Britain to get to the Continent.  I have spoken to a number of hauliers and they are extremely concerned about what will happen in that regard.  The price of getting not only agricultural goods but any goods out of Ireland to other places in the world will increase dramatically because of this.  Much of the talk about Brexit in this country has been focused on the agricultural sector, but that sector was the least of the worries during the debate on Brexit in Britain because agriculture represents such a small portion of its overall economy.  While there is a notion that perhaps there will be loyalty to the British farmer and so forth, I concur with Mr. Power in doubting that there will be anything of that nature.  I believe people will be more inclined to stick to their line of trying to find exports of other goods to other places around the world.  There are other major industrial concerns in Britain.<\/p> <p>  While we are trying to grapple with what Brexit will mean, there is the broader issue of the European project, the problems there and the politics of fear, anger and resentment that we see not just in Europe but also in America and throughout the world.  It might bring us to a place where we could be facing perhaps the euro being in a crisis and collapsing.  Should we be preparing for that?  As regards the EU project in general and where it will go, in ten to 15 years we could be confronted with more countries seeking to leave.  How can we prepare or what can we do about that?  I am not saying these things will happen, but it is becoming more likely that they will and it is something we must examine.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Power referred to the drop in the price of food in this country over the past eight years.  Cheap food becoming the norm is the high expectation of consumers.  That is the biggest problem we have globally.  As long as consumers think that food should be cheap there will be a problem for the producers of food and for society, because as food gets cheaper its quality will go down and usually there will be more profiteering in the middle.  I realise these issues are slightly removed from Brexit, but I believe we should be examining and trying to deal with them.  Clearly, food is vital for life.  It should be at a reasonable cost for people in order that they can have good food and a reasonable chance of living a long and healthy life.  However, that must be reflected in the payment that the primary producer and the people who work in the industry get for it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016121300002#H00400","speaker":"1345"},{"type":"speech","time":1481644800,"counter":24,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Power for his excellent presentation.  Some of the questions I had intended to ask have been dealt with already, but there is one issue on which I wish to hear his views.  He mentioned the drop in the value of sterling already seeing something of a rush to the Border even though it may not make economic sense.  His opinion appears to be strongly in the direction of a hard Brexit.  What are his opinions from an economic perspective on the Border after a hard Brexit?  We are all aware that a land border between different economies lends itself to rogue trade, smuggling and so forth.  How does he think it might affect us economically if his prediction of a hard Brexit with a hard Border comes to pass?  I am not referring to the policing of it but to the economic perspective.

That organisation was formed in response to the pressure on the agrifood sector from cross-Border shopping during the previous currency crisis in 2008 and 2009.  A year ago I was starting to question its reason for being because of the compression of grocery prices and so forth and the fact that cross-Border shopping was not much of an issue.  I wondered if it had a role to play, but in the past 12 months that question has been answered firmly for me.  Now, more than ever, we should be focusing on the value our agrifood sector contributes to the economy at the primary and processing levels.  I firmly believe in balanced regional economic development.  I am not an economist who believes that all economic activity should be centred in Dublin and that the rest of the country should be allowed to make its own way.  Hence I believe we should support our agrifood sector as much as possible.  I will shortly answer the Chairman's question about what else we should be doing.<\/p> <p>  Last year, our exports of agrifood to the United Kingdom were &euro;5.1 billion while our imports were &euro;3.8 billion.  Those imports of &euro;3.8 billion include products such as cheese, milk, biscuits and the like which we either produce or have the capability of producing.  If tariffs go up on the trade from the United Kingdom into Ireland, we definitely must start focusing domestically on producing those.  I could carry out research and identify everything in that regard, but looking at the UK produce on the typical supermarket shelf, it is broadly based and widespread.<\/p><p>Importantly, we already produce much of it or have produced in the past.<\/p><p> I describe myself as an economic nationalist and believe in supporting domestic business.  That is the key motivator behind Love Irish Food and my involvement in it.  I introduced the whole question of price compression in the grocery and agrifood sectors in my presentation, despite the fact it is not directly relevant to Brexit.  However, it is a fundamental issue around Ireland's agrifood sector.  I opposed the abolition of the groceries order back in the day as I thought it was a bad idea.  State intervention is necessary when there is market failure.  The groceries order provided a reasonable level of support for the agrifood industry.  The only thing its removal actually achieved was below-cost selling of alcohol.  It is highly unlikely we will see a reversal of this.<\/p><p> On the question of cross-Border product trade, hauliers and Senator Mark Daly's question on the Border, I am not a political expert but I find it difficult to envisage a situation where if Britain, including Northern Ireland, were to leave the European Union that we would not have a border between the South and the North.  I cannot envisage a situation where a frontier between an EU country and a non-EU country would not have a border.  To have otherwise is going to be incredibly difficult to achieve.  From a political and economic perspective, this will be disastrous.  Most of the issues around Brexit are disastrous in any event.  From a UK or an Irish perspective, I cannot see the upside.  The question is about the magnitude of the downside.<\/p><p> Clearly Ireland is a special case but I am not sure that at EU level there will be much acceptance of Ireland as such.  We found out during the collapse of the banking system how much support we will get from the European Union when the chips are down.  We were hung out to dry on the whole bank bailout situation by the European Union.  I would expect similar treatment on the question of a hard Brexit.<\/p><p> Before 1999, I argued strongly that the whole European project and the euro was not a good idea and it did not make economic sense.  That got me into quite a bit of difficulty with my employer at the time.  The euro was a victory of politics over economics.  Ultimately, when one gets a victory for politics over economics, economics will come back to bite.  Since the great recession began in 2007-08, the whole European Union, particularly the euro structure, has totally failed to deal with the crisis.  The structures are not in place.  Europe is now muddling through again but there are significant challenges ahead.  With German, French and Dutch elections in 2017, it is not difficult to envisage a political scenario which could be disastrous for the future of the European Union.  Even if we do get through 2017, Europe is just waiting for the next crisis.<\/p><p> What can a country like Ireland do about this?  We should diversify our trading relationship as much as possible, as well as the economy, so as not to be overdependent on any single sector.  There is not much we can do to influence these external developments or soft or hard Brexit.  At the end of the day, we will be a small player in all of those negotiations.  We need to ensure our economy is as competitive and as sustainable as possible.  When I talk about competitiveness, I am not talking about a race to the bottom in wages and prices.  I am talking about infrastructure, IT capability and the quality of the labour force.  I am straying off on this, but if one wants to look at the long-term challenges, what will differentiate Ireland when facing all these external challenges will be the quality of the workforce.  That is why investment in education has to be the priority.  That is what will make our economy sustainable in the events of the shocks.<\/p><p> The next euro crisis is just around the corner.  We have not come out of the last one yet.  Joseph Stiglitz's latest book on the euro crisis is not easy reading and is incredibly boring.  However, it paints a difficult picture of where Europe is at the moment.  Fundamentally, it is difficult to disagree with it.<\/p><p> Bord Bia has done a fantastic job in marketing Ireland as a food island.  The challenge for it will become much more intense over the coming years in the event of a hard Brexit.  We need to build other markets and consider if Bord Bia has the resources to deal with those challenges, as well as Enterprise Ireland, another State agency which builds up the export potential and capability of Irish businesses.  What else can we do?  Again, we need to make sure the economy is as sustainable and competitive as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016121300002#H00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Power","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481644800,"counter":28,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Jim Power for his thought-provoking conversation and we have learned much from it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016121300002#J00200","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1481644800,"counter":29,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 5.25 p.m. and resumed at 5.30 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"speech","time":1481644800,"counter":30,"content":"<p>I welcome the members of the deputations.

As we all know, 2016 was a difficult year for Irish farming with low product prices across almost all sectors, bad weather conditions early in the year for all and again for many tillage farmers in recent months.  The UK vote to leave the European Union in June this year has contributed to greater economic uncertainty.  This has impacted on Irish agriculture and will continue to do so in the year ahead.<\/p> <p>  As the previous speaker said, with 40% of our exports destined for the UK market it is clear that the Irish farming and agrifood sectors are being seriously impacted from the fallout from the UK vote.  A total of &euro;5 billion worth of our agrifood exports go to the United Kingdom.  This includes 50% of our beef &ndash; the figure was 54% in 2015 - 60% of our cheese, over &euro;350 million worth of pigmeat and in excess of &euro;120 million worth of mushrooms.  This trade is undertaken within the EU Single Market.  In other words, with no tariffs applied or other regulatory barriers to trade, such as border checks, health certification checks, etc.  Ireland is the only member state to share a land border with the United Kingdom.  We are singularly integrated with the UK in the areas of trade, culture, language and free movement of people.<\/p> <p>  The United Kingdom is a high-value market, sharing similar consumer preferences to Irish consumers, and is generally the first export destination for Irish small and medium-sized enterprises.  Farmers and processors have developed systems of production and specifications to match market requirements in the UK market.  Major work has been done and considerable resources have been employed in terms of standards and quality assurance.<\/p> <p>  The sudden and sustained weakening of sterling that has occurred as a direct result of the UK vote and subsequent political declarations has had a negative impact on the price returned to producers whose product is being exported to the United Kingdom.  This is primarily the case for beef and mushrooms farmers, who have been hit with severe price cuts since June this year.  This has left them in a loss-making situation.  Our mushroom growers made a presentation to the committee last September outlining the turmoil into which the industry has been thrown and demonstrating that growers are in continuous and unsustainable loss-making territory resulting from the sudden and significant weakening of sterling.  We recognise that exchange rate volatility cannot be controlled in the short term.  Since Ireland is a member of the Single Market, there are significant limits on the direct support that can be given to exporting agricultural businesses without breaching state aid rules.<\/p> <p>  In the run-up to budget 2017, the IFA identified practical steps that the Government could take to mitigate some of the worst income effects of the exchange rate uncertainty.  I will outline these steps.  First, the provision of increased funding for farm schemes in October's budget.  These schemes support farm incomes and output and have a positive knock-on impact in the wider rural economy.  Funding for farm schemes increased by over &euro;100 million in budget 2017, with new and increased funding for the sheep, GLAS, TAMS and knowledge transfer programmes.  Another step is the provision of direct support to farmers and other SMEs through lower-cost and more flexible short-term and long-term credit options.  The outcome of the IFA pressure throughout 2016 on this issue has resulted in the announcement by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine of credit to farmers at a rate of 2.95%.  This will be available across all agriculture sectors from January and can be used to convert merchant credit into a more sustainable loan structure as well as to purchase inputs at a competitive cash price.  The IFA also highlighted the need for additional support to exporters in the form of increased promotional funding to diversify and grow our export share in the non-UK market.  Increased funding in the budget for Bord Bia in this area is welcome.  In addition, the market access unit of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine must be strengthened as we need to see new markets for our processed and live export trade.<\/p> <p>  As I have already stated, in our beef sector over 50% of exports go to the United Kingdom.  Consequently, the weakening of sterling presents a major challenge.  The IFA has a clear understanding that exchange rate volatility is not the only determinant of price returns.  Demand for beef in the United Kingdom remains strong.  We have been in the high-demand Christmas procurement period for the last month or more.  Trade and market returns have picked up and cattle prices should have risen far more.  Clearly, the lack of competition in the beef sector is a major factor.  At the recent beef forum, we made it clear to the Minister and the factories that prices must be restored to feasible levels.  It is simply not acceptable for processors to return a practicable price to our farmers at this time.  Farmers cannot continue to produce beef at a loss.  Many more cattle are in the pipeline for 2017.  We need more market access and in particular we need more live exports to drive competition and add additional market outlets.<\/p> <p>  The IFA has also made it clear that factories must demand higher prices from their British retailer customers to reflect the devaluation and pass these increases directly to farmers.  That is what should happen in a normal functioning market.  However, as producers we well know the imbalance of power in the farmer, processor and retail relationship in the food chain and we are cognisant of the need for further regulation and an ombudsman in this area.<\/p> <p>  At EU level, the IFA has looked for direct support to be provided to affected producers through CAP market support measures.  The decline of sterling arising from the UK vote is a market disturbance that has occurred swiftly and unexpectedly and has resulted in significant price falls.  We believe the European Commission must look seriously at providing exceptional support for sectors in respect of which an external political event has had an immediate and negative economic impact.<\/p><p>We are again calling on the Government to pursue this at EU level.  We are also asking for the support of this committee on these issues.  <\/p><p> In the longer term, the future trading relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union is a great concern for the agrifood sector.  A move by the United Kingdom away from the Single Market will result in increased trading costs and barriers.  The imposition of barriers to trade, in the form of tariffs, border checks and additional certification requirements, would add to costs and undermine the competitiveness of our agrifood exports.<\/p><p> The significant cross-Border trade of agricultural produce for final processing also presents a significant challenge if we are to maintain and grow our high-value export markets.  Over 350,000 lambs are imported from Northern Ireland into the Republic of Ireland annually for further processing, with 500,000 pigs from the Republic being processed in Northern Ireland.  Between 800,000 and 1 billion litres of milk are imported from Northern Ireland every year, much of which is processed and then exported out of Ireland as a high-value product.  Barriers to this trade, in the form of tariffs, additional certification or labelling issues, will all add to costs and may make this continued trade simply uneconomic.<\/p><p> Our concerns in this area are best illustrated by examining the position of countries that trade with the European Union outside the Single Market.  The average EU tariff on agricultural products imported from outside the European Union is almost 15% for WTO countries.  It is much higher for certain products.  It is up to 30% higher for dairy products and 50% higher for some meat products.  In other words, if the United Kingdom were to leave the European Union and no agreement were to be reached through a bilateral trade arrangement, it would face significant tariffs on its food exports to the European Union.  The likely development is that the United Kingdom would inherit the European Union's tariff commitments, with the result that Irish exporters to the United Kingdom could have tariffs placed on their products.  This is the reality of the hard Brexit scenario.<\/p><p> A recent ESRI report highlighted the devastating impact on EU-UK trade in the agrifood sector in this scenario, with trade in dairy products potentially falling by 60% and in some meat products by over 80%.  It simply cannot be overstated, therefore, how important it is for the Irish agrifood sector that market access to the United Kingdom that is as free as possible be maintained, with the minimisation of any barriers to trade.  The potential economic damage to the agrifood sector that would arise from a hard Brexit is too serious to ignore.<\/p><p> Our first position is that the United Kingdom should remain a full member of the European Union's Single Market, including free trade on agricultural products.  This is also the position represented by our farming colleagues in the NFU in the United Kingdom, with whom we have remained in regular contact since the vote and with whom we work closely in Brussels through COPA.  If this proves unworkable, the IFA is clear that the agreement of a comprehensive free trade agreement between the European Union and the United Kingdom, with favourable access for agricultural products and mutual recognition of standards, must be a priority at EU level.  This must include the agreed sharing out of tariff-free imports into the European Union on agricultural products, many of which, such as New Zealand lamb and butter imports, were brought into the European Union by the United Kingdom on its accession to EU membership.<\/p><p> Why is an UK-EU free trade agreement important?  If the United Kingdom were to pursue a trade agenda that resulted in the unilateral reduction of import tariff barriers for agricultural imports from all exporting countries into the United Kingdom, this would be very negative for Irish agriculture.  It could result in a very significant reduction in the price of UK food, and consequently the price that Irish farmers receive.  The IFA is clear that, in the negotiations between the European Union and the United Kingdom, there must be a strong commitment on both sides to achieve a positive trading relationship.<\/p><p> Another issue I wish to highlight is the concern of Irish farmers over the impact on the EU and CAP budget of the departure of the United Kingdom, a net contributor to the EU budget.  In the short term, Ireland's basic payment and rural development envelopes are fixed up to 2020, through the 2013 CAP regulations and under the terms of the EU budget.  Changes to these would require agreement by the EU Council, the Parliament and the Commission.  The IFA is clear that there must be no changes to farm payments before the current CAP reform concludes in 2020, even if this requires additional contributions from the remaining member states.  Ireland must be very clear and lead the way in highlighting the need for a strong CAP budget.  This is critical for farm incomes, farm output and wider economic activity in the rural economy.  <\/p><p> As we are all aware, farmers source the majority of their inputs locally.  A reduction in spending power for Irish agriculture would have a significant and negative knock-on impact on the demand for goods and services in the rural economy.<\/p><p> Analysis undertaken by Teagasc shows the potential farm level impact of Brexit.  It has estimated the potential impact on farm income of a 10% drop in CAP payments and a significant liberalisation of the UK market, with large volumes of imports from third countries.  The figures are stark.  In this scenario, farm incomes would fall in all sectors, with the income drop ranging from 20% on dairy farms to 37% on beef farms.  Another key concern is what will happen with agricultural supports for farmers in Northern Ireland and for farms on both sides of the Border.  They are all part of the CAP right now, but there is no assurance on the level of support that will be provided to these farmers after the UK exit.  As identified in the NFU study in advance of Brexit, a reduction in supports for UK farmers will have a negative impact on their income.  This is a major concern for these farms in respect of farm income and viability.  <\/p><p> The shared land border between Ireland and Northern Ireland presents a unique challenge in regard to maintaining and improving herd health standards.  The risk is that differences in regulations and standards that may emerge could have implications for animal health status in either of the economies due to the spread of disease across the land border.  Continued co-operation between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland on animal health standards, as currently applied, must be maintained.  Coherence in regulations and standards is critical.  The IFA will continue to work closely with the UFU and the NFU on this and other issues as part of our long-established relationship irrespective of the final outcome to the Brexit discussions.  <\/p><p> The IFA is clear that it very important that free movement of goods and services be retained as far as possible, and also the free movement of people.  People living near the Border work on either side of the Border, farm on either side of the Border and have family on either side of the Border.  We all have family and friends who live and work in Britain and Northern Ireland.  Disruption to this relationship would be a very negative step, economically and socially.  <\/p><p> I thank the committee again for the opportunity to highlight for it the key issues concerning Irish farmers in the wake of the UK vote to leave the European Union.  This is a very uncertain time for our economies and society.  The number of issues identified in our presentations illustrates the complexity of the current circumstances for the agrifood sector.  <\/p><p> I again request the support of this committee on the proposals we have put forward at national and EU level for farmers and the agrifood sector.  Strong leadership and the ability to compromise will be needed, at both EU and UK level.  The strength of the relationship between Ireland, Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom, at government and civil society levels, must be leveraged to minimise the economic and social disruption in the short term and to achieve the most positive and sustainable outcome to the negotiations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016121300002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joe Healy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481644800,"counter":33,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Healy.

At this juncture, everybody is familiar with them, they have them on the tip of their tongue.  It is good to have the opportunity to put emphasis on where we see the problems and potential solutions.  There is an onus on the committee and all our elected representatives to work very hard to position Ireland as best we can to mitigate against the downside of Brexit.  I have not heard anybody outside of the city of Dublin suggesting there is an upside.  I would have liked a chance, and will have one in future, to cross-examine Mr. Jim Power on the displacement in the context of the imports coming into Ireland.  I do not see too many positives in that respect.  With the United Kingdom being the fifth largest economy in the world and the second largest economy in the European Union, any change will be significant.<\/p><p> Currently, the most immediate issue is the currency volatility and the vacuum that has been referred to already and the capacity of business people to try to make decisions.  There are all sorts of scenarios out there and any one of them could be right.  One of the likely ones is that this process will drag on for a number of years.  There is a school of thought that in five years&rsquo; time we might still not have a clear line of sight as to the final deal so it is not utopia.  A bad deal might be bad but a deal that clearly outlines the terms and conditions and the path forward means we can at least deal with it as a country.  We can deal with it as a rural economy and we can deal with it as individual business people that have to try to make decisions on a daily basis.  The maintenance of the single market, common agricultural policy funding, input costs, costs competitiveness, trade deals, consumer confidence, on-farm challenges in the Border areas, all-Ireland health status and transit across the United Kingdom have all been touched on.<\/p><p> Deputy Martin Kenny mentioned specifically the race to the bottom in terms of the price of food and food quality.  The committee and the Government and all the agencies of the State could offset much of that by trying to change mindsets one step at a time, influenced and backed up by the support of the European Parliament and the Commission.  That is what is happening.  Bord Bia has been referenced and Bord Bia&rsquo;s budget is as it is but it is our policy that it should be increased in order to dilute the dependency on the UK economy in terms of our exports going there.  More than 14%, or &euro;1.1 billion, of our agricultural exports are going through Tesco.  We are not only extremely heavily dependent on the UK market but on a specific multinational player in that market.  We need to examine that.  It is a very valuable market and it is a very valuable retailer in that regard.  Tesco announced in the course of the last 24 hours that it will not be beaten on price and will not be beaten on price against the discounters.  That is a significant shift in policy from a multinational that puts us in an even more precarious situation.  We need to understand that and have contingency plans for it.  <\/p><p> There will be a potential deficit in the common agricultural policy.  The United Kingdom is a net contributor of &pound;10 billion and about &euro;1.3 billion of that is going to the CAP budget in the European Union.  That equates to our basic payments.  What we need to do and what we can do in this committee and in Government is to not just look for more money but to justify it and explain to consumers why it is logical.  We should not dress it up because it is taxpayers&rsquo; money.  Why should we put taxpayers&rsquo; money into a common agricultural policy?  There is an onus on every elected representative and everybody who speaks on behalf of the agriculture sector to stand up straight and explain the reason why because it is justified.  It is just as relevant today as it was when it was initiated.  It is for the greater good of society to have a safe and secure supply of affordable food for the citizens of our continent.  We need to reiterate that at every opportunity.  Farmers should be proud of the single farm payment and that they are returning it to the taxpayer in spades.  They should not shrink away from it.  That is something this committee can do.  <\/p><p> The all-Ireland health status is a tricky one.  We are very vulnerable.  We have achieved an awful lot as an island in terms of brucellosis and other areas of disease control.  We must not underestimate the difficulties there could potentially be with transit across the United Kingdom.  The on-farm challenges are nearly self-explanatory and there is a role in terms of negotiating deals.<\/p><p> It also needs to be highlighted that as a result of the subtraction of 64 million consumers, every trade deal needs to be re-examined, especially the issue of lamb coming in from New Zealand and so on.  We could talk about that for a while.  Cost competitiveness is about net margin and sustainability at farm level.  As a country, we have legal costs, which, if we benchmark against our European counterparts, are very high.  If we benchmark insurance against our competitors, it is very high.  The costs of credit and energy in this country are extremely high.  It is very difficult for a small member state on the periphery of Europe to sustain economic vibrancy at farm level if their costs are out of kilter with their competitors.  We need to examine that issue.<\/p><p> Almost every aspect of this has been covered.  The question is how we position ourselves in the context of a negotiating position when we are a small member state that is most exposed to the risk as a result of our exposure in the United Kingdom.  Mr. Jim Power touched on all the aspects from the different sectors within each member state and the politics within each member state.  We have to get out there and demonstrate that a fair deal that minimises the impact on trade between the United Kingdom and the European Union is good for all member states not just Ireland.  That is an important point from my perspective.  A deal that is good for the United Kingdom is also good for the European Union.  We need to say that over and over again.  The localised politics in states such as Germany and France should not override common sense.  We could fall into that trap.  We need to be to the forefront as a nation in emphasising that a deal is good between the European Union and the United Kingdom not just for Ireland&rsquo;s sake but also for the European Union&rsquo;s sake.  <\/p><p> I will leave it at that and will be delighted to take questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016121300002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Comer","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481644800,"counter":36,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Comer.

I am delighted to be joined by Macra na Feirme chief executive, Mr. Denis Duggan.<\/p> <p>  We are pleased to be here and to get this opportunity to contribute to the discussion on Brexit.  As young farmers we were very disappointed, as the committee was, by the democratic decision taken by the people of the United Kingdom back in June to leave the European Union.  From our point of view, the decision does not make economic or political sense.  The farming and agricultural sector and young farmers are particularly vulnerable following the result due to our dependence on the United Kingdom as an export market for our main commodity products. <\/p> <p>  As a food exporting nation, we have more to lose than any other country following the result.  The value of the UK market to Irish food exporters has been well articulated by previous speakers.  The consequences and fallout from Brexit are the biggest challenge our industry will face in our generation.  In the past we have had the BSE, foot and mouth disease and others crises, but this is bigger than all of them together.  For this reason, Macra na Feirme is strongly calling on the Government to put on the green jersey and fight to protect the future of the industry, our livelihoods and, as young farmers, our future farming careers.  The medium to long-term impact of Brexit for Ireland and young farmers will not become clear for some time until negotiations get under way between the United Kingdom and the European Union.<\/p><p> Macra na Feirme is an active member of the European Council of Young Farmers, CEJA, and we will work with our European counterparts on Brexit.  Young farmers are worried about the impact on their businesses into the future in the short term with the current fluctuations in the value of sterling and the uncertainty this will bring.  Any fluctuations in the value of sterling will cause problems in certain sectors, particularly forestry and the mushroom sector, although it is keenly felt across all other sectors, including the beef and the alcoholic beverage industries.  Young farmers are already under a lot of financial pressure due to pressure on commodity prices.  Processors cannot be allowed to use the current fluctuations in sterling to cut prices paid to farmers who are already under pressure.  This will only add further to the current difficulties being experienced on the ground.<\/p><p> The negotiations on Brexit and on any future trade agreements between Ireland and the United Kingdom will be between the European Union and the United Kingdom.  This is a real concern for young farmers as we will not be able to negotiate directly our own trade deals with the United Kingdom until such time as broader terms are agreed at an EU level.  The protection of the Irish agriculture sector needs a bilateral trade agreement with the United Kingdom with none or minimal tariffs.  This needs to be the top priority of the Irish Government in future negotiations.<\/p><p> Young farmers farming along the Border do not want to see a hardening of the Border between Ireland and the North because of some of the businesses they work with and the value and volume of product that moves over the Border, which has been articulated by previous speakers.  Many young farmers' activities are cross-Border.<\/p><p> As young farmers, we have the most to lose from Brexit.  We are establishing our careers in the sector and are more vulnerable in the short term due to the uncertainty and volatility as we do not have the financial cushion built up to protect us from this volatility.  Macra na Feirme calls on the Chairman and the committee to articulate strongly our views and concerns at a government level.  Macra na Feirme calls very clearly for the minimisation of any barriers to trade and for no tariffs to be imposed.  We demand continuation of free, or as free as possible, movement of agricultural products between Ireland and the United Kingdom, especially between Ireland and Northern Ireland.  We call for specific attention and provision to be made for cross-Border trade.<\/p><p> Young farmers are frustrated by the prospect of additional labelling rules that could potentially occur with trade between the United Kingdom and the European Union.  Should additional regulations apply, Macra na Feirme would call for resources to be put in place to make the transition to new labelling as easy as possible for all farmers.  Increases in trade costs will follow any extra labelling criteria, so provisions need to be put in place to prevent farmers bearing the brunt of any new costs.<\/p><p> It has been mentioned by previous speakers that Ireland imports approximately &euro;3.5 billion worth of agricultural products from the United Kingdom.  Much of this comes from Northern Ireland, is processed in Ireland and is then added to our overall export figures.  Adding costs to this trade is not in the interests of consumers, producers or the economy as a whole.<\/p><p> Diversification of trade is very important, and while &euro;4.4 billion, or 40%, of our agricultural exports still go to the United Kingdom, we have diversified our trading significantly since joining the European Union.  In 1973, almost 70% of our food exports went to the United Kingdom.  This represented about &euro;350 million out of a total of &euro;500 million.  Today Irish exports go to more than 120 countries and are valued at about &euro;11 billion.  Expansion of access to new markets is very important, and trade missions should be accelerated further.  It is important to relay the message that Ireland is not part of Brexit and is open for business.  Macra calls for additional resources to be provided to bodies such as Bord Bia to sustain access to new global markets.  Decreasing our dependence on agri-trade with the United Kingdom will help to lessen the impact of Brexit.<\/p><p> Over recent weeks, young farmers throughout the country have raised some very specific queries which I will quickly run through with the committee.  They include the implications of Brexit for EU trade negotiations such as the Mercosur and TTIP negotiations which have been conducted to date on the basis of an EU of 28 member states; consumer confidence and the potential risk in the United Kingdom and its impact on Irish products; differences in EU and UK regulations regarding animal feed such as genetically modified, hormone-treated and antibiotic-treated feed; country of origin labelling and the United Kingdom's approach to this issue following its exit from the European Union; environmental targets, specifically water quality issues and their cross-Border implications; the implications of Brexit for EU research funding, particularly for cross-Border projects; issues associated with the transit of equipment, feed and livestock across any EU-UK border, which has been articulated by some members of the committee; and cost competitiveness and the cost of doing business in Ireland, which need to be considered in more detail.  We have higher costs than many of our EU counterparts in areas such as insurance, energy, credit and legal costs.<\/p><p> Macra na Feirme welcomes the establishment of the consultative committee of stakeholders on Brexit and the all-island agri-dialogue which will take place later this week.  We will take part in these initiatives, which will bring all parties in the agrifood industry together to discuss updates and developments surrounding Brexit.  The consultative committee will also discuss future negotiations and issues of mutual concern to the agrifood industry following the United Kingdom's decision to leave the European Union in the recent referendum.  We in Macra na Feirme look forward to working with the Minister and the committee and all its stakeholders.<\/p><p> A part of us all would love the United Kingdom to reverse its decision.  We in Macra na Feirme work closely with our five nations colleagues: the National Federation of Young Farmers Clubs in England and Wales, the Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and the Young Farmers Clubs of Ulster.  I recently travelled with a colleague to a Scottish Association of Young Farmers Club conference in Aberdeen.  Having also attended a meeting on Brexit in Northern Ireland hosted by the Young Farmers Clubs of Ulster, I can tell the committee there were no indications from either event that the United Kingdom's decision of Brexit would be changed.  The main discussion point and focus of both events was the opportunities for young farmers following Brexit to supply the home UK market.  At both events there was an expectation that payments similar to those under the current CAP and access to the free market would be maintained.  This is all unknown.  This match has only really kicked off.  There is a long way to go and the result is far from certain, and none of us, both here and in the United Kingdom, really knows where this will end up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016121300002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n Finan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481644800,"counter":39,"content":"<p>Finally, I call Mr. Kent who will speak on behalf of the ICSA.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016121300002#N00200","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1481644800,"counter":40,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for the invitation to appear before the Oireachtas agriculture committee.  We welcome the opportunity to engage with the joint committee on the topic of the implication of Brexit for the agrifood sector.<\/p> <p>  The Irish food exporting sector is profoundly concerned by the potential impact of Brexit.  This is not surprising, given that 41% of our total food and drink exports, worth &euro;10.8 billion in 2015, went to the United Kingdom.  Meat and livestock exports are a crucial component of total food exports, amounting to &euro;3.7 billion in 2015.  Of this, beef exports were worth &euro;2.4 billion, of which 52% went to the United Kingdom, 46% to other EU markets and 2% to non-EU markets.<\/p> <p>  The process of Brexit has not even commenced yet, but its impact has been very tangible in terms of instability and exchange rate fluctuations.  Fear of the unknown is the key driver of exchange rate problems, and it may yet be that the outcome is less destabilising than expected.  Nonetheless, we must operate on the basis of hoping for the best but planning for the worst.<\/p> <p>  From an Irish agricultural perspective, Brexit is challenging on several fronts.  We see the key issues as the sterling-euro exchange rate; trade deals and tariffs between the European Union and the United Kingdom; the implications for international trade deals and global movement of food exports; the need to diversify our exports profile and the possible need to pull back from expansion plans; consequences for the CAP; consequences for other EU and Government policies which impact agriculture; and practical problems surrounding the North-South Border.  Meat factories reacted to exchange rate movement by cutting prices paid to farmers in response to the drop in the value of sterling against the euro.  The fear of market outlooks has helped keep beef prices low in recent weeks, even though sterling has rebounded somewhat.  On the one hand, the fluctuation in the exchange rate has caused much uncertainty and the situation has been volatile.  On the other, we must guard against hype.  Meat factories like to keep farmers nervous, but some facts are worth considering.  For example, last night's closing rate was about &pound;1 to &euro;1.19.<\/p><p>It did fall as low as &euro;1.10 in November, but the current level is similar to the exchange rate that prevailed throughout much of 2013.  Farmers will recall that beef prices for R3 steers averaged &euro;4.40 in June 2013.  This is not to suggest they could be at &euro;4.40 now, but it does illustrate that other factors such as supply and demand of cattle are perhaps more relevant than the exchange rate.  However, when sterling is really strong against the euro, as happened in 2015, beef farmers do not get the full benefit.  We need to reduce our over-dependence on the UK market, but let us not fool ourselves that there are silver bullets when it comes to beef exports.  Despite the huge efforts to open up the US market, exports so far in 2016 amount to some 2,000 tonnes, well below what was anticipated, and with US beef prices down 20% on those this time last year, an opportunity may have been missed.  <br\/><br\/>The ICSA supports every effort to open new markets, but we are perplexed that there is little appetite to do business with Iran, even though it has been an important outlet in the past and could be important in the future.  Live exports must be prioritised.  We need to see Northern Ireland farmers in our marts, but even more important is the need to have live exports to Britain.  Currently, they are blocked by the UK supermarkets policy on EU country of origin labelling, but in a post-Brexit world the issue willl have to be looked at again.  The Turkish market for weanlings must be capitalised on.  Other possibilities for live exports, including countries such as Egypt, must be pursued.  One slight benefit of Brexit is that the euro has also weakened against international currencies, albeit marginally, but further instability in the EU-UK process may lead to further weakness of the euro, as well as sterling.  We cannot say for sure how the euro will do in 2017, with market sentiment likely to be volatile owing to elections in key EU states and concerns about the situation in Italy.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>On trade deals and the Brexit talks, it is only when negotiations kick-off to determine what the future relationship should be between the United Kingdom and the European Union that the long-term outcome for Irish agriculture will emerge.  Key in this regard will be the trading arrangements.  The conundrum Britain has created for itself, arguably unnecessarily, is that the war was won on the issue of the free movement of people, but the peace could be lost on the same issue.  Access to the Single Market is critical for British enterprises, but are the British willing to concede on the free movement of people, given the strong emphasis on immigration during the referendum campaign?  The problem for Ireland is that the final trade deal must be negotiated between the United Kingdom and the European Union.  This means that the more the United Kingdom insists on its demands being met in curtailing the free movement of people, the less likely it is that we will end up with tariff free trade between the European Union and the United Kingdom.  This means that there will be tariffs on our exports to the United Kingdom.  Tariffs, combined with a weaker sterling, would be the worst of all worlds, particularly as the curtailment of trade would potentially further exacerbate drops in the value of sterling in the longer term as markets would see the United Kingdom being more isolationist.  Accordingly, Ireland must ensure its interests will be centre stage in any EU-UK negotiations.  We cannot afford to leave such vital talks to the usual process by which the European Union negotiates trade deals, whereby the European Council gives a mandate to enter negotiations and then sits back while the European Commission does the negotiating.  When a deal is hammered out, member states and the European Parliament will have a say on a take it or leave it basis, at which point it will essentially be too awkward and politically impossible to roll back the unpalatable.  Irish MEPs will have to work to ensure our interests will remain centre stage in the European Parliament, but in reality the decisive interventions will have to be made at Council level by the Taoiseach and relevant Ministers.  Overall, we need to carefully analyse the impact on how we will do business with our British neighbours in the future and the extent to which Britain will open up to do business with the world at the expense of Ireland and other European countries.<br\/><br\/>The beef trade - we export 90% of what we produce - is particularly vulnerable.  Over 50% of our beef exports are to the United Kingdom.  Therefore, the ICSA is extremely anxious to ensure a hard Brexit would not result in tariffs on EU exports to the United Kingdom.  While the exchange rate may stabilise, Brexit is even more problematic in terms of international trade deals.  The ICSA has been campaigning against EU trade deals which sell out the beef sector.  We are especially concerned with the Mercosur agreement, the TTIP and particularly the CETA which appears to be a Canadian trade deal but is very much a North American trade deal and could be very problematic for us.  All of these negotiations have been conducted on the basis of there being an EU 28, with the United Kingdom being the member state with the greatest import requirements.  The ICSA pressed the EU Agriculture Commissioner for a cumulative assessment of the impact of these trade deals on the beef trade.  In other words, what is the potential impact of having three tariff rate quotas for Canada, the USA and South America?  As expected, the Commission's analysis painted a disastrous picture for Irish beef producers, with somewhere between an extra 146,000 and 356,000 tonnes of beef coming into Europe.  However, the impact analysis was made without knowing the trade deals a detached United Kingdom could do post-Brexit with the rest of the world.  A possible scenario is there would be two beef import deals.  This would arise where the European Union did its own deals and then the United Kingdom agreed to significant imports of beef and lamb from all over the world.  This could prove very detrimental to the future of the Irish agrifood sector.  The ICSA believes the European Union should park external trade negotiations with the United States and countries in South America until the post-Brexit arrangements become clear.  We also have to carefully look at the quota for New Zealand lamb which we think should be taken out of the European Union by the United Kingdom post-Brexit.  Overall, Brexit presents a huge challenge and we all need to work together to ensure it will be managed in the best interests of the agriculture sector on both islands.  Farmers, North and South, in particular, will be hugely affected.  This must be kept centre stage in all negotiations.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>On the future of the CAP and other policies, we are concerned about the future funding of the CAP, given that the United Kingdom is a net contributor.  Ireland must fight for adequate funding for the CAP post-2020, but we also need to assess what the outcome will be in future CAP design.  While the United Kingdom was opposed to the CAP as a matter of philosophy, it tended to be on the same side as Ireland on some of the detail such as decoupling and milk quotas.  The ICSA suggests all policy decisions must be aimed at circling the wagons to protect the interests of EU-27 farmers.  We need policies that will prioritise the viability of farming in Europe.  This means fighting against bad trade deals.  It also means fighting to ensure decisions taken on climate change and renewable energy resources will not undermine EU farmers.  We need to examine to where Ireland could move in the post-sugar quota era and whether the European Union's U-turn on biofuels makes any sense in pursuing the goal of farm viability across Europe at a time when tillage farmers are suffering.  Above all, we need to reassess the objectives of Food Wise 2025 which is all about expansion of output, especially in dairying but with a knock-on impact on beef supplies.  Given the risks posed by Brexit and the uncertainty around new markets, it is surely time to look at sustainable down-sizing until it can be sees if prices will rise to a viable level.  Expansion of beef output at this point looks like a crazy policy in view of the glut of beef expected in 2017.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016121300002#N00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Patrick Kent","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481644800,"counter":42,"content":"<p>I thank the delegates for their presentations.  As has been rightly said, this issue has been flogged to death.  As such, it is difficult to come up with new questions.  At Question Time last week in the D&aacute;il I raised the question of whether it would be timely to have a review of the Food Wise 2025 strategy and its impact.  We should be cautionary at this stage rather than rush ahead pell-mell.  We might not like what Mr. Power had to say - more often than not I disagree with him - but we must take cognisance of what people like him have to say.  This will not be a walk in the park.  Whether it is a hard or a soft Brexit, as we all desire, there will be consequences.  It is important that there be a review of where we are and that farmers be made aware of the realities to ensure they will not end up being led into financial difficulties that could be ruinous.  <\/p> <p>  Deputy Jackie Cahill and others referred to the impact on the dairy sector.<\/p><p>Of course, it is accepted that the impact on the beef sector will be more devastating.  Has any thought been given to that matter? <\/p><p> I accept Macra na Feirme's assertion that we all must wear the green jersey.  That is important and there is no doubt that this committee will make its input, insofar as it can.  However, while we can get representatives of all parties to acknowledge the issue and bring forward the submissions the committee has heard in recent weeks, we cannot lose sight of the fact that the negotiations will be led primarily by the European Union.  That is the big bugbear.  How do the delegates see us intervening and having an input at a national level?  I know that the Taoiseach will be representing Ireland.  He will be representing all of us; it will not be party political, nor should it be, as we are all on the one side.  The Taoiseach has allies, but, as Mr. Power said, there were many allies in 2011 and we saw where that got us.  It went down the tubes and there was not much sympathy for us.  We carried a load for which the European Union was directly responsible in its promotion of cheap money policies and so on.<\/p><p> How do the agrifood and fisheries sectors see us doing what has been suggested in the four very well researched presentations, all of which were excellent?  How will we get to the point where there is a soft Brexit, in the process preserving the common travel area, ensuring vital sanitary and veterinary regulations are retained and that we will have an all-Ireland animal health policy, as spoken about by Mr. Comer?  This policy has proved very worthwhile in achieving our brucellosis status, etc. <\/p><p> The UK market of 65 million people will be lost to the European Union.  There are some 6 million people on the island of Ireland.  What is the opinion of the industry representatives on the negotiations that will continue for two years?  Last week, according to the British Prime Minister, they would continue for about two years but yesterday there was talk about a transitional arrangement of at least four years, which is very optimistic.  I have always said it will take five years or more.  It took Greenland, a small country, three years to disengage from the European Union.  Who is codding who?  There are thousands of multilateral agreements to be considered.  If work was to start on them tonight, it would not be finished in two years.  It is time people stopped talking nonsense.  I can confidently say there will be a new Government in Ireland before Brexit is finalised.  I am not saying the Government will not last, but in time there will be a new Government.  That is the scenario and I agree that the longer it continues the more uncertainty it will create.  The only point on which everyone can agree is that the grave uncertainty will continue and as long as it continues, I agree totally that it will be bad news for everybody.<\/p><p> All of the representatives from the industries have put forward good ideas, but how can we have our voice heard in the process?  It must be remembered that there are 26 other member states that must be satisfied, not counting the United Kingdom.  Mr. Barnier will be involved in the negotiations.  While he has indicated that he recognises Ireland's position, the point is, as mentioned by Mr. Jim Power, that the European Union will not be shy about teaching lessons and sending signals that it does not want the European project to disintegrate. That is the problem.  Ireland should get a good deal, but will the political environment in the European Union permit it?  That is the question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016121300002#O00200","speaker":"1370","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481644800,"counter":44,"content":"<p>I thank all of the organisations represented for their contributions.  As Deputy Willie Penrose said, nearly everything we have talked about has been in the context of Brexit, as it was in the case of Mr. Jim Power's presentation earlier.  I have a couple of points which flow from what he said in response to my question on the drive towards cheaper food imports and how it would impact on all aspects of the industries.  When the chairman of Bord Iascaigh Mhara was before the joint committee a couple of weeks ago, we spoke about this issue - the need to increase the value of food exports from Ireland.  We should look at their value rather than their volume. That is the direction in which Ireland needs to move.  There has been too much emphasis on increasing their volume and not enough on increasing their value.  I wonder if the delegates agree with me?  It is strange.  <\/p> <p>  I had friends home from America recently and they spoke about the image of the small family farm in Ireland.  People around the world talk about it and how it is so quaint.  That may not always be the case, but certainly there is that image of the small family farm in Ireland.  Ireland does have small producers, grass fed animals and food traceability.  These are aspects about which people may not know, but they are aware of the image of the small family farm.  The image in people's minds of Ireland being a green clean environment is crucial and I firmly believe we do not use this image to its full potential when marketing our goods.  It is one of the aspects that we really need to change.  In the marketing of food from Ireland we need to move in a different direction to increase the value of our exports.  That is the real challenge.  It is said trouble is an opportunity in work clothes.  Brexit may offer an opportunity in that regard.  It may be the event that will smarten Ireland up to realise that if we continue to compete with Argentina, Brazil and other cheap producers of food, we will not make it.  We need to look in a different direction.  While we export a lot of what we produce, this is still a small island which, in a global context, produces a very small amount.  Because of its image Ireland should be looking to be at the very top end with its produce.  I implore the representatives to look at this aspect as a way forward in getting out of this mess.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to trade deals.  It strikes me that they are always good for the corporations and not so good for everybody else.  That applies on both sides of the table, from the point of view of the Canadians or the Irish people.  It is always about the corporation and the sectors involved.  Usually, agriculture forms part of a trade-off.  The Europeans may be trying to sell insurance services or cars to some other part of the world and will use agriculture as part of a trade-off because it is seen as a sector that can be dealt with in that way.  That is why we find ourselves in this position time and again and there is a serious danger of it happening in the case of the Comprehensive Economic Trade Agreement, CETA.  With the change in administration in the United States, the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership agreement may be slightly off the agenda, but we do not know for sure.  I suggest, however, that the farming organisations who represent primary producers take a look at these trade negotiations to see where they are taking Ireland.  They need to look at the deals, not individually but as a whole, and the direction in which they are pulling the agriculture sector.  It needs to be acknowledged that they are very negative.<\/p> <p>  My final point is about Brexit.  We have spoken about it so many times that we have flogged it to death.  We all know that it is going to be negative and everybody is trying to measure just how negative it will be.  It is very hard to see where we can turn it around to find the positives.  It was mentioned that we could replace some imports, but I do not know if that will be possible.  It is very unlikely.  I have thought of one example.  On the main street of Ballinamore there is a small confectionery wholesaler.  He has told me that every bar of chocolate and every item in his wholesale business comes through Britain.<\/p><p>I was just telling Senator P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn that I remember visiting Letterkenny many years ago and there being a smell of sweets all over the town.  Oatfield was the company that used to manufacture sweets in Letterkenny, but it no longer operates.  Many similar companies have also closed.  We need to examine whether some of these industries can be restarted to replace some imports.  In many cases, that will not be possible because we cannot compete with goods produced much more cheaply elsewhere.  However, we should seek to secure the highest prices in the world for our primary food produce such as dairy products, beef and lamb.

The European Parliament is starting to push UK MEPs out of all the positions they hold, including committee chairmanships.  The attitude is that the United Kingdom can have no interest in the future of the European Union when it has made a decision to leave.  That is the worrying reality and the context in which we must position the agriculture sector for three to five years ahead.

There will be choices for individual farmers because farmers have different stocking levels and densities.  The advice would be different for each one, depending on his or her stocking level and his or her age.  Decisions for one might not necessarily suit another.  Teagasc must give some direction in that there are no stocking rate controls with which to compare intensive, high input farming activities.  Some older farmers who are getting a good price for cattle on a given day are making money because they are not spending a lot.  Their input costs are lower, as are their stocking levels and work rate.  They might perhaps provide a model for young farmers to get involved in farming because owing to the lower intensity levels there may be an opportunity to find a part-time job or a full-time job off the farm.  Different advice applies to different farmers.  Teagasc must go back to the drawing board as some of the advice it has given to ramp up stocking levels and change direction and become involved in intensive dairying might not offer the best long-term solution.  It might be perfect advice for individual farmers, but for others, it might not be, depending on the resources available to them.<\/p> <p>  Brand Ireland must be revisited.  Food Wise 2025 must also be revisited.  Some of the projections have been very ambitious.  Some of the people involved have also been out of touch with the realities on the ground.  The forum should probably be convened for a few days to consider what direction we should take as it does not seem to be sustainable to follow the model originally envisaged.<\/p> <p>  We have unique selling points, but we have not sufficiently pushed the purity of our food.  We have dropped the ball in our food being GM-free.  There is not one GM crop we can grow profitably in this country as they are all designed for use in hotter climates, but we can sell our food as GM-free at a higher price on the basis that it is healthier and glyphosate free.  Glyphosate is endemic in GM crops and contaminates the entire food chain.  We must revisit the issue and declare this country a GM-free growing area.  We import some proteins that are GM, but perhaps we might revisit that issue also, even though there might be certain costs attached.  Gaining a higher shelf price for our product is something we should examine very closely.  We should also examine consumer trends.  Nobody in the world would then be able to compete with us because we would have a very pure and healthy product.  From a tourism point of view, we would also have a selling point.  We could gain a lot if we were to go down that road.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Thomas Pringle asked a question about sustainable downsizing and I think I have more or less addressed it.  Profitability is an issue.  <\/p> <p>  In reply to Deputy Martin Kenny's questions, we need to speak to farmers more to see what they want.  Up until now they have been told what to do.  They have not been asked what they think we should be doing.  There are tremendous people within Bord Bia who have been working very had during the years, but I think they have lost direction.  We need to improve marketing, rather than policing farmers in terms of quality assurance and Origin Green which is based on carbon levels.  German supermarkets in the United Kingdom are not carrying Irish beef and lamb products and we must change this.  Bord Bia needs to redirect its personnel towards marketing.  We must market our product as being the best available.  Farmers are willing to provide top quality food, from which we would like to see some benefit.  Our food must be unassailable.

Perhaps it would be premature to reopen Food Wise 2025 until we see where Brexit will take us in the next year, as none of us knows where the road will lead us.  There are some very good elements to Food Wise 2025 which, if adopted at farm level, will definitely increase profitability through improvements in efficiency and grass utilisation.  There is a wide variety of measures that should be examined.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Martin Kenny also referred to Food Wise 2025 and increasing value rather than volume.  I agree fully that we should increase value.  The Origin Green programme and quality assurance schemes are very important in promoting the green image and benefits or Irish produced products, including traceability.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy also mentioned trade deals, all of which must be properly and economically vetted.  As an exporting nation, we depend on trade; therefore, we must be very careful as we depend on international markets to sell our products.

I think it was Deputy Charlie McConalogue who mentioned our relationships at an EU level.

We had a discussion with our UK counterparts after the vote, but there has not been a lot of discussion since.

I am not sure whether there is an up-to-date report, but it does gives some insight into the matter.<\/p> <p>  I will go back to Deputy Jackie Cahill's point about market share and Ireland's dependence on the UK market.  The ESRI's report gives us an indication of the share of UK imports from elsewhere in the European Union.  Germany accounts for 28.34%; the Netherlands, 12.73%; France, 10.81%; Belgium, 10.5%; and Ireland, 5.05%.  There are, therefore, many countries other than Ireland that have huge dependence on the UK market, including Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and France.  Ireland is in fifth place.  Cars and other such products probably account for the significant percentages for other member states.  I am sure, therefore, that Brexit is also a worry for all of these countries.<\/p> <p>  I think I have addressed most of the questions asked.  I believe I have answered the final point made by Deputy Jackie Cahill about Food Wise 2025.<\/p> <p>  Huge work has been done by Bord Bia and Ornua in the marketing of our food.  I know that Ornua has based a number of its employees in the United States in order to sell into that market.  Bord Bia has identified huge potential in north Africa, China and a variety of other markets.  I am not sure about its budget, but its strategic direction might need to be set by the Government.  That would dictate the budget the agency would require to deliver on the strategic targets set by the Government and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.<\/p> <p>  I am not sure whether our CEO has anything further to add.

The ambition of Food Wise 2025 is to increase national exports from the agriculture sector to &euro;19 billion, which will be difficult.  From a farmer's perspective, it has to happen through increasing value as much as volume.  If it is all about increasing volume, farmers will go broke.  It must come down to increasing value.  How do we extract value from global markets when we have to export more than 90% of what we produce, leaving out our UK market share?  We can only do so with value-added products.  It cannot be done with skimmed milk powder, butter, whole milk powder or any of the other powders, particularly given from where we have just come, when the only buyer in the European market for a European product was the European Commission.  That is a statement of fact.<\/p> <p>  Let us not overemphasise the role and function of Bord Bia.  It is a very valuable organisation and completely different from Ornua.  Ornua is a farmer-owned co-operative, while Bord Bia is an arm of the State which certainly needs more funding in the context in which we now find ourselves.  The increase in funding should be to the tune of 20% which would give good value insofar as we could add value to Irish products.<\/p> <p>  I will not go through all of the questions again, but I was asked a specific question by Deputy Charlie McConalogue about the advice we gave farmers.  Our role and functions, as a farm leader, are to try to lead the industry and individuals out of this situation in which there is the potential to have a very negative impact.  All farmers have a responsibility to be as efficient as they can and adopt modern technology and practices on their farms.  After that, there is very little they can do.  However, I believe there is a role for farm leaders and politicians alike not to overplay the negatives and make everybody too afraid to make business decisions.  We have to make business decisions, even without the certainty everybody craves.  The reality is that there will be no certainty.  There has to be a counterbalance.<\/p> <p>  There were many other contributions.  One specific question asked by Deputy Charlie McConalogue was about whether the dairy sector was more sheltered.  There are global markets and the dairy sector is sheltered from that perspective.  We are on an upward trajectory.  The reality is that dairy farmers will increase and expand.  Whether they should is a more complex question, but let us deal with the realities.  Make no mistake about it - that is what is going to happen and we must prepare for it as an industry and the Government must facilitate it as best it can.  I know - I believe everybody present knows - that there has been a paradigm shift in the trading environment in which we are going to have to operate because of Brexit, but farmers will expand, particularly in the dairy sector.  That is almost certain and we must cater for it in our processing.  There are synergies and many symbiotic relationships have been developed between the North and the South.  Spare capacity in the South has been used up.  We must remember that only two years ago, before Brexit ever happened, British farmers had to ship distressed milk to Ireland to have it processed because nobody was investing in the processing sector in Britain.  I often give out about processors and so on, but at least we facilitated investment in processing facilities in this country which has stood us in good stead.<\/p> <p>  On the issues raised by Senator Tim Lombard, I believe I made the point very strongly, but I will re-emphasise and reiterate it because it is key.  We have to be proud of the CAP and understand why we have a CAP budget.  We have to make sure that we negotiate to retain it because there will be a deficit if the United Kingdom leaves the European Union.  I know that the overall total is &euro;9 billion or &euro;10 billion, but the agricultural portion is &euro;1.3 billion.  As an industry, farmers and a Government, we will have to figure out a way to justify why we receive that much taxpayers' money and indicate the service we are providing for it.  To be perfectly honest, I do not think we are doing a great job in that regard.  That incorporates Deputy Jackie Cahill's point and nearly incorporates everybody else's points.  <\/p> <p>  What can Ireland do, given how small it is in the European Union?  There are two things that we need to do and we are probably doing them behind the scenes.  The key to getting a reasonable deal for agriculture could be what happens on the UK side because it pays no heed to agriculture.  However, Scotland does and Ms Nicola Sturgeon is a very strong First Minister.  I certainly believe we need to have back-room discussions with her.  To enable her to protect Scottish farmers, she might be able to extract a good deal from the United Kingdom's perspective.  The same applies to Ms Arlene Foster in Northern Ireland.  There is leverage to work with them.<\/p> <p>  Leaving aside that issue, it was mentioned several times that France, Germany and all of the other power brokers wanted to make an example of the United Kingdom.<\/p><p>That is actually the real sentiment.  As a small member state, Ireland can act as a counterbalance by stating how stupid that is.  We do not want to see the United Kingdom on the naughty step.  We need to work slowly and repetitively to build a common-sense reaction to this immediate knee-jerk reaction.  A reasonable deal that allows for trade and does not make an example of the United Kingdom is in the interests of the United Kingdom and the European Union.  It is as simple as that.  If we are to be an effective counterbalance, we need to repeat that simple point for the next five years until we get a clear line of sight to the final outcome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016121300002#S00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Comer","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1481644800,"counter":59,"content":"<p>Most of the questions have been alluded to at this stage.  Deputy Willie Penrose said there would be consequences.  We have already seen consequences in the beef and mushroom sectors.  A number of good mushroom growers have gone to the wall.  As I said the last time I appeared before the joint committee, a base price of &euro;3.60 or &euro;3.65 for steers will have consequences.  Lower prices also have indirect consequences along the line.<\/p> <p>  The Food Wise 2025 strategy was mentioned by a number of those who asked questions.  Representatives of all the farming organisations are due to meet officials from the Food Wise 2025 review group which is chaired by Mr. Michael Dowling tomorrow morning.  I have no doubt that strategies such as Food Wise 2025 and the plans of individual farms for the future need to be revisited following the result of the Brexit referendum.  The ideas and plans that were being considered before the referendum need to be reconsidered in the different circumstances that now obtain, as will be highlighted tomorrow morning.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Willie Penrose spoke about whether this would happen over a timespan of two, three, four or five years.  Some believe there will be an election in the meantime.  That might happen.  I set out our preference for what will happen.  The uncertainty that will persist in the meantime will lead to exchange rate fluctuations.  As Mr. Jim Power mentioned, since 23 June last the value of &euro;1 increased from 76p to 89p or 90p sterling before dropping to approximately 84p.  Such fluctuations are having a real impact.<\/p> <p>  Reference has been made to added-value food products.  In the past 20 years value has been added to much of what we export.  That must continue.  When the US market opened, the IFA, the Government, the Minister and Bord Bia pushed very hard for the branding of Irish food.  It was disappointing that this did not happen, but I do not think there was anything more the organisation could have done.  It is a pity that the idea we were pushing did not gain traction.  As someone said earlier, our image is a strong marketing point.  Bord Bia is trying to push it as part of its Origin Green campaign.<\/p> <p>  A few questions were asked about the work being done in Brussels through COPA, etc.  We have met other farm organisations, including French organisations, through COPA.  Like Ireland, France exports agrifood products worth between &euro;4.5 billion and &euro;5 billion to the United Kingdom.  The United Kingdom is not as great a priority for France as it is for Ireland because the percentage of French agrifood exports to the United Kingdom is a long way short of the level of 40% or 41% here.  A similar point can be made about other European countries.  The United Kingdom is not nearly as important a priority for other farming organisations around Europe as it is for the IFA.  The Commission's civil dialogue groups refuse to discuss the issue when it is raised.  I do not think they will be allowed to do so until Article 50 has been triggered.<\/p> <p>  I mentioned in my initial contribution that the adequate funding of the Common Agricultural Policy was a priority the last time and will be this time.  If the United Kingdom leaves the European Union, the vacuum it will leave as a net contributor will have to be filled.  The dairy sector was mentioned in this context because 60% of the cheese we produce goes to the United Kingdom.  I mentioned the tariffs on dairy and beef products.  We will take a big hit in that regard.  As Mr. Comer said, we have to be able to defend the CAP budget.  In the 1960s approximately 30% of household income was spent on food.  The Common Agricultural Policy was introduced to ensure safe and traceable food could be purchased at an affordable price.  Just 15% of household income is now spent on food.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Jackie Cahill rightly mentioned that there was no sympathy.  We have met politicians and ambassadors from a number of EU member states.  They are all the same, although one particular group stands out.  The politicians from France told us that as far as they were concerned, there must be a hard Brexit to send a message to any other country that might be thinking along these lines.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016121300002#T00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joe Healy"},{"type":"speech","time":1481644800,"counter":60,"content":"<p>I will allow Senator P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn to ask a question before we conclude.

I want to get a sense of what they are calling on the Government to do.<\/p> <p>  The EU agricultural markets task force recently published an important report on improving market outcomes.  The report suggests legislation needs to be introduced at European level to provide legislative grounding for what it terms as an \"adjudicator\" or \"ombudsman\" because the voluntary systems generally are not working.

We view our appearance before the committee as integral to the fulfilment of the council&rsquo;s mandate and important in fostering greater public awareness and debate around macroeconomic and budgetary issues.  I am accompanied by council members, Mr. Sebastian Barnes, Mr. Seamus Coffey, Dr. &Iacute;de Kearney and Mr. Michael Tutty.  The council secretariat is also present.  The council would like to thank the staff of the Oireachtas for their ongoing and useful co-operation.<\/p> <p>  On a personal note, as this is my last appearance before the committee as chair of the council, I thank committee members for their interest in the council&rsquo;s work over the past five and a half years.  Our engagements with the Oireachtas in my time as chair have given me first-hand experience of the commitment, hard work and talent of our parliamentarians, although, needless to say, we have not always agreed.<\/p> <p>  Today, I will cover our 11th fiscal assessment report.  The report was written in line with the mandate of the council set out in the Fiscal Responsibility Act.  The report assesses the macroeconomic and fiscal projections set out by the Government in budget 2017.<\/p> <p>  Before getting into the detail of our assessment of budget 2017, it is worth reflecting on some of the positive developments in the public finances and in the broader economy over recent years.  The public finances have improved considerably with the underlying general government deficit falling from over 11% of GDP in 2009 to an expected deficit of less than 1% in 2016.  Although still at a high level, the debt-to-GDP ratio has been put on a downward path.  The Government&rsquo;s adherence to a credible fiscal adjustment programme, along with initiatives at a European level such as the European Central Bank&rsquo;s bond buying programme, have seen the Government&rsquo;s cost of borrowing fall dramatically from the highs recorded in 2011.<\/p> <p>  Importantly, the progress in repairing the public finances has been mirrored in other areas.  As a result of the strong recovery in the economy since 2012, the number at work has increased by 195,000 and the unemployment rate has halved from its peak of 15%.<\/p><p>The available data for 2016 present some mixed signals but the weight of evidence from a range of indicators shows that the economy continues to grow at a solid rate.  The Department of Finance's central projection is for further steady real GDP growth of around 3.5% in 2017 and an average of around 3% from 2018 to 2021.<\/p><p> Notwithstanding the progress that has been made, an important reality behind much of the council's analysis is that, six years on from Ireland's entry into the EU-IMF programme, the legacy problems from the crisis have not been fully alleviated.  Moreover, with a high debt level and tangible risks to growth from external sources such as Brexit, in addition to domestic risks, the economy and public finances remain susceptible to potential adverse shocks.  As an example of this, a GDP growth rate just half a percentage point lower than currently forecast each year would mean the public finances would remain in deficit out to 2021.<\/p><p> In this context, an important achievement of recent years has been the putting in place of a new budgetary framework containing both domestic and European elements.  The framework consists of sets of rules, processes and institutions, including, importantly, the role of this committee.  The key components of the framework are consistent with principles of sound budgetary management.  In an uncertain economic environment, full implementation of the framework can help achieve a phased reduction in the debt to safer levels and ensure that there is sufficient fiscal credibility to avoid forced austerity in bad times.  However, as outlined in our recent Fiscal Assessment Report, incomplete implementation of the new framework leaves the economy and public finances more exposed to severe shocks, such as Brexit.<\/p><p> Turning to the council's assessment of the fiscal stance in 2016 and 2017, the projections in budget 2017 show that progress in improving the public finances largely stalled.  Despite continued revenue growth and savings from falling unemployment and debt interest costs, the projected improvement in the general Government balance, stripping out financial sector measures, is just 0.1 percentage point of GDP in 2016, while the primary balance, that is, the balance excluding interest spending, is forecast to deteriorate in 2016 , the first worsening since 2009.<\/p><p> The absence of significant improvement in the public finances in 2016 is in part due to within-year increases in expenditure that absorb the majority of the better-than-expected tax revenue.  In June, the Government revised up its forecast of tax revenue for 2016 by &euro;1 billion, with &euro;900 million of this expected to come from corporation tax.  With spending revised up by close to the same amount, this additional tax revenue will not contribute to a significant improvement in the deficit in 2016.  This repeats what occurred in 2015 when the Government announced a &euro;1.5 billion increase in spending for 2015 in line with an upward revision to corporation tax of close to the same amount.<\/p><p> The council is concerned over the use of positive revenue surprises to fund permanent spending increases, especially when the revenue surprise is largely due to a single, and relatively uncertain, revenue stream - in this case corporation tax.  Instead of using the additional corporation tax revenue for permanent expenditure, a more appropriate policy would have been to use this revenue to reduce the deficit.  As the sustainability of recent corporation tax increases is not yet assured, this would have left the public finances less exposed in the event of a reversal in corporation tax receipts in the coming years.<\/p><p> The slowdown in the rate of improvement in the public finances in 2016 is reflected in the failure to fully comply with the fiscal rules.  The expected improvement in the structural balance in 2016 of 0.3 percentage points of GDP falls short of the 0.6 percentage points of GDP improvement required.  The expenditure benchmark is complied with in 2016, but only with the inclusion of a technical one-off transaction involving AIB in 2015.  Excluding the AIB transaction, the spending limit set by the expenditure benchmark would also have been exceeded in 2016.  As 2016 is the first year the Stability and Growth Pact preventive arm and domestic budgetary rules apply following the closing of the excessive deficit procedure, the failure to fully comply with all rules is a source of concern.<\/p><p> Potential compliance issues are also signalled in the Government's projections for 2017.  The budget 2017 forecasts show compliance with the structural balance rule; however, the forecasts indicate a breach of the expenditure benchmark.  It is important for the credibility of the budgetary process that the Government's fiscal plans show full compliance with the domestic and EU fiscal rules based on the Department of Finance's own estimates of the structural improvement.<\/p><p> Putting these different elements together, the combined &euro;3 billion package, or &euro;3.7 billion in a full year, of tax reductions and expenditure increases announced in 2016 by the Government for 2016 and 2017 goes beyond the limit considered prudent by the council.  Compared to the plan outlined in the July 2016 SES, the fiscal stance in budget 2017 leaves the public finances more exposed to risks than would have been the case if earlier plans had been adhered to.  Viewed in isolation, the deviation from what could be considered a prudent stance in budget 2017 is not large but a repeat of the approach to budgetary management evident in 2015 and 2016 over several years would not be conducive to prudent economic and budgetary management.<\/p><p> From 2017 onwards, the Government's projected fiscal stance and intention to comply with the EU fiscal rules is consistent with the deficit and debt remaining on a downward path.  Provided the economy is growing at a sustainable rate, the use of the available fiscal space as envisaged in the current forecasts would be consistent with prudent policy.<\/p><p> I would now like to make a number of remarks in regard to the planned fiscal stance in 2017 and over the medium term.  First, for 2017, the available fiscal space under the rules has already been allocated in budget 2017 for tax cuts and expenditure increases.  As a consequence, based on the current projections, any new increases in expenditure, such as to fund higher public sector pay, imply lower spending in other areas unless offset by compensatory tax changes.  In 2018, &euro;0.7 billion will be required to meet the carry-over cost of tax cuts and expenditure increases introduced in budget 2017.  On current estimates, this absorbs over half of the fiscal space for 2018, implying very limited scope for new initiatives in the absence of offsetting savings or new revenue-raising measures.<\/p><p> The Fiscal Assessment Report also updates the council's stand-still expenditure analysis contained in previous reports.  It is important to reiterate that this exercise is not intended as a forecast or recommendation for automatic indexation, but rather as a means of informing decision makers of the portion of available fiscal space that would be required to maintain the existing provision of public services and preserve the purchasing power of social protection benefits.  The results of the analysis in this report indicate that accommodating estimated demographic pressures and the cost of maintaining real public services and benefits would absorb almost the full amount budgeted for current expenditure increases from 2017 to 2021.<\/p><p> An issue that has raised considerable debate in recent years, not least in view of historically low global interest rates, is the treatment of investment under the fiscal rules and the question of whether the fiscal rules are too constraining on capital investment.  It is important to note that a key reason for the relatively constrained budgetary position in the near term is that Ireland still has a budget deficit that needs to be brought down towards a balanced budget position to ensure that the high debt to GDP ratio is reduced.  This requires that spending growth, net of discretionary revenue measures, be kept below the potential growth of the economy.  Once the medium-term objective is achieved - a structural deficit of less than 0.5% of GDP is reached - spending growth is allowed under the rules to grow at the underlying potential growth rate of the economy.  This will allow more resources to be available for both current and capital spending and to meet important societal needs.  Moreover, in both the near term and longer term, there is no restriction on faster spending growth provided that the necessary additional revenues are raised.  <\/p><p> In the meantime, even if the rules were to make more of a distinction between current and capital spending, it would be necessary to ask whether a higher overall deficit path than currently being projected in budget 2017 to accommodate higher investment would be appropriate, even taking into account potential long-run benefits for potential output.  Ireland already has a very high gross debt which needs to be brought down to safer levels.  In the short run, a key step in moving the debt to a safer position is to lower the deficit towards a balanced budget, in line with the current Department of Finance projections.  Therefore, although there may be concerns that the rules overly constrain capital spending, the current forecasts for the overall budget balance are likely to be close to what should be targeted in the coming years, given the need to bring the debt down and to make provision for future demographic pressures.<\/p><p> To address the concern that capital spending could be squeezed in the process of achieving the objectives for the overall budget balance, one possible solution is to supplement the main fiscal rule with a separate target for public investment.  For example, the Government could aim to achieve an overall level of public investment equal to a certain percentage of economic output.<\/p><p>A separate target for public investment could help ensure that viable public investment projects with positive long-term effects are undertaken, while preserving the advantages of the current fiscal rules in helping to avoid deficit bias and procyclicality in setting budgetary policy.<\/p><p> Summing up, the economy has made an impressive recovery from a deep economic and financial crisis, but fragilities remain.  Looking to the future, it is important that the hard-won achievements of recent years are protected and built on to improve the resilience of the public finances in the face of numerous risks and to lay the foundations for sustainable growth in living standards.  The risks facing the economy are tangible, with uncertainty around the long-term growth prospects of Ireland's three key trading partners, the UK, US and euro area.  Avoiding a repeat of past fiscal policy mistakes made in Ireland during relatively good times, such as reliance on transient revenues to fund permanent spending, will be essential to ensure the economy and public finances have the capacity to withstand potential negative shocks in the coming years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016121300002#A00400","nonspeaker":"Professor John McHale","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481648400,"counter":83,"content":"<p>I welcome Professor McHale and his colleagues to the meeting.  I note this is his last appearance before the committee and I wish him well.  He may be able to speak more freely in the future instead of having to represent the strict mandate under the terms of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council.<\/p> <p>  I welcome his comprehensive and detailed report.  He mentioned that using unexpected tax revenue is risky, the primary balance is not decreasing but is forecast to deteriorate and the expenditure benchmark will not be met in 2017, saying it is beyond prudent in respect of what the Government has done.  It appears, however, that the council has endorsed the budget although that was something different.  What is the council's overall stance on the budget?  After five years I imagine the Minister for Finance and his officials could have predicted the council's critique of the budget.  Many patterns are repeated, for example, using corporation tax in terms of permanent expenditure.  During Charlie McCreevy's time tax reductions and expenditure increases were tied to stamp duty.  Professor McHale says that year on year there have been upward revisions of previously published ceilings which happened before.  He says one of the potential risks is a monetary policy in Europe that would not be conducive to the type of policy we have.  This seems to mirror the past.  The Department and Minister should have been conscious that the council would have criticised these elements in its budget yet they went ahead with it.  What is Professor McHale's view of the fact that they have ignored what the council said?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016121300002#C00200","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1481648400,"counter":84,"content":"<p>It might be useful to say initially what we endorse.  The endorsement function is limited to the macroeconomic forecast underlying the budget and we do a similar endorsement exercise for the stability programme.  I thank the Deputy for the opportunity to clarify that point.<\/p> <p>  We made several substantive critiques, which the Deputy listed, in terms of the stalling in improvement in the budget balance.  He mentioned the primary balance which deteriorated in 2016 after several years of improvement and that when there was an upward revision of approximately &euro;1 billion in tax revenues there was an almost equal upward revision in spending within the year.  He also said the fiscal rules were not fully complied with in 2016 based on current projections and will not be fully complied with in 2017.  He is right that the Government was probably not surprised that we highlighted these factors.  His main point is that it went ahead and did it anyway and whether that indicates we are not having an impact.  <\/p> <p>  This Government, like any government, is under huge pressures from all sorts of directions to spend more money and to cut taxes.  Facing those pressures the deficit can be used potentially as a political release valve.  Most people do not obsess about that but we think about it a lot because we have been given a particular role, largely as a voice for the future.  When items are funded by greater deficit spending they are not free but the cost is being pushed to the future.  That does not mean there are not times when running deficits is a sensible policy in a major recession or where there are major spikes in spending, good economic policy is to run deficits because overall one wants to have a policy that is closer to a balanced budget position and to keep debt at safe levels.  We do not want the kind of risks we may have run before, and the very deep crisis we experienced.  I see the council as providing some balance because these costs will be borne down the line.  Just because the Government pursues policies that it could have predicted we might disagree with does not mean the countervailing voice is not present.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016121300002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Professor John McHale"},{"type":"speech","time":1481648400,"counter":85,"content":"<p>The council says that the Government is taking risks with the Irish economy in certain areas, breaching the rules it championed.  I have no love for those rules, as Professor McHale knows.  We campaigned against them but we are very satisfied that every party in the Houses wants the rules changed in one way or another.  Now, however, there is a false debate because nobody wants to comply with these rules.  Everybody says they need to be changed.  When they are breached it is no longer an issue.  It is like a road where the natural speed of 60km\/h is changed to 20km\/h.  It makes no sense.  My view is that it is not a big issue that the Government is breaching these rules.  There is a question about the teeth the council has, if that is the narrative.

The rules will bring us close to a balanced budget position and will allow our debt to come down to safer levels over time to minimise the risks the Deputy refers to.  When there are surges in tax revenues, particularly with the expenditure benchmark, it is harder to make the kind of mistakes we made before when we ramped up expenditures to match those revenues.  The key reason for pursuing these rules is not that the European Commission tells us to do it but because it is good for the Irish economy and will keep it safe.  It was always likely that as time passed after the crisis what the Deputy described was going to happen.<\/p><p>People were going to begin to forget and say, \"We do not need this framework; we can move back in the direction of the policies we had previously\".  Making it part of the national framework and putting in place a committee like this and an institution like ours helps to institutionalise that memory in order that we do not easily forget.  It is easy to think that we do not face these risks.  If we are hit by adverse shocks, having a strong budgetary framework at any debt level will become a huge asset because it will give credibility that the country will be able to get through them without defaulting, which will allow Ministers to do the borrowing that would be necessary to avoid austerity in the context of a deep crisis.  That is one of the advantages to a strong framework but I ask the committee not to forget and to carry that memory of the pain we had to go through because of mistakes made in the past and to see that this framework that can, hopefully, help us avoid making them again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016121300002#C00500","nonspeaker":"Professor John McHale","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481648400,"counter":88,"content":"<p>The report points out that along with the Government announcing budget 2017, it announced half of budget 2018 by eating into more than half of the fiscal space for 2018.

At that point, even without tax increases, more resources will be available to meet the needs the Deputy referred to.  There are two parts.

The Deputy is correct that capital spending is low in the economy based on historic international norms.<\/p><p>In recent years public capital investment has barely kept up with the depreciation of the existing capital stock.  There were recent announcements of greater public investment.  Public investment will now grow from &euro;4.2<b><\/b>billion in 2016 to &euro;7.3 billion in 2021.  There were announcements of what I believe are fairly significant increases in capital spending but the Deputy's point is well taken that even allowing for that, public capital investment as its share of the economy remains low.  Also, as many people have pointed out, as a result of postponing many investments during the crisis and the low interest rates there are now many opportunities for public investment.  We certainly understand the argument people make for using deficit financing to fund those investments.  However, the point we emphasise in this report is that we have to take account of the overall level of debt.  The fact that the debt might be accumulated for investment purposes does not mean we are still not carrying forward this high level of debt which creates these vulnerabilities, particularly in a very volatile global economic environment.  The reason for getting down the deficit close to balance is that it puts that debt on a strong downward path.<br\/><br\/>I might use the analogy of a small business.  Small businesses can often have good investment opportunities but one thing I have learned from talking to small business owners is that they are obsessed with cash and liquidity management, which means they can often be reluctant to undertake debt even when they have good investment opportunities because they are very concerned about their ability to roll over that debt in the future.  They have to look at their overall level of debt, therefore, and not just the investment opportunities.  I suppose we are making a similar point.I would not push the analogy of a nation state with a small business too far, but given the experience we have gone through where we lost our ability to access capital markets to roll over that debt for a period of time shows that we can be exposed to similar types of risks.<br\/><br\/>We are saying that the overall plans in terms of reducing the deficit and putting the debt on a downward path broadly makes sense but the Deputy is right that a problem can be that public capital investment gets squeezed out in the process when we have to meet these tough deficit targets.  Capital spending is often the easiest element to cut.  We were suggesting that, in addition to the existing fiscal rules and the deficit targets, that we would also have a target for public investment, and to some extent it is already there, but would make it a robust target and put a good deal of focus on it to make sure that we do not squeeze that public capital investment in the process of trying to hit those deficit targets.  It not a new proposal, it just draws attention to the fact that there is a risk that public investment gets squeezed in that process of trying to meet those deficit targets.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016121300002#D01200","nonspeaker":"Professor John McHale","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481648400,"counter":100,"content":"<p>The expenditure ceilings and so on would remain the same but this would be a separate heading, as it were.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016121300002#E00200","speaker":"1335"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1481648400,"counter":101,"content":"<p>The ceilings are largely at departmental level and within those ceilings it would mean making sure that there was sufficient allocation to the capital side of the budget as well as the current side of it, having that overall target subdivided among the different Departments but overall making sure that capital investment does not get squeezed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016121300002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Professor John McHale"},{"type":"speech","time":1481648400,"counter":102,"content":"<p>The authorisation and the transition in the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, coincides with the transition in the US.

I understand the pressures public representatives are under and, more important, the importance of this spending to people's lives.  There is a temptation to borrow the money to do the spending.  That is what greater deficit spending means, but that puts the costs to the future.  Even if we never repay the debt, we carry it in perpetuity and we carry higher interest payments in perpetuity.  If we run larger deficients now, we will have to run larger surpluses in the future.  In additional to that, we increase the risks that the economy faces because if some adverse international event occurs, if Brexit turns out to be worse than we had thought or something happens in the US and there are problems in the eurozone, the higher the debt level we would go into that crisis with, the more vulnerable we would be.  I made the point to Deputy Doherty that this voice tends not to be too prevalent in the debate because of the pressures coming from all sorts of directions and not denigrating that, health spending, as he said, is incredibly important to people's lives.  Spending will be important three, four or five years down the road when we would be carrying this interest bill, which would be crowding out the room for that spending so we would only be postponing it.  I have always thought that fiscal responsibility should be believed in most strongly by people who believe in Government and the positive role it can play in people's lives.  As we saw in the crisis, it is when the Government could not fund itself, when it could not access the finance to cover the deficit that inevitably opens up in a crisis, it is the Government that suffers to a large extent because spending gets caught and has negative effects on people's lives.<br\/><br\/>I hope in recent years we have succeeded - I am not sure if we have achieved this -  in trying to avoid making fiscal responsibility in any way an ideological issue.

Professor McHale outlined the overrun or carryover cost of the tax cuts and expenditure increases from budget 2017 and budget 2018 which would be in the region of &euro;700 million, and then there are the demographic pressures and the standing-still pressures that will come into play as well.  Essentially, there may not be much money in the pot at all to spend in 2018.  I am somewhat conscious of the council's mandate here and what Professor McHale can and cannot say.  One of the options mentioned in his opening speech, which he reiterated in response to an Teachta Doherty, is that \"in the absence of offsetting savings or new revenue raising measures\", then there is no money in the pot.  Is he essentially saying that we must look at revenue-raising measures, spending savings, or both?  Current Government policy, as Professor McHale will be aware, is to carry on and increase or accelerate tax cuts, including phasing out the universal social charge.  How does that sit with what Professor McHale is telling us in terms of the limited wriggle room with fiscal space?  Government policy is to cut taxes even more.<\/p> <p>  I will marry that with something Professor McHale stated in response to the critique of the fiscal rules.  Professor McHale is somewhat isolated on this because it is the case that ever more commentators are saying that these are a constraint.  It is not just politicians.  IBEC has been quite critical of the lack of flexibility in capital investment.  The Minister for Finance made a speech in Brussels recently about the need for greater flexibility in relation to the fiscal rules.  Professor McHale talked about the current fiscal framework being advantageous.  I suppose commentators would have a different view.  Are they advantageous, for example, to those who are victims of the housing crisis?  We do not have the ability to build houses because of these fiscal rules because we cannot borrow money to invest in capital infrastructure, which is, in part, why we have a housing crisis and why we have rising rents, which are symptoms of that as well.  It is the same with health, etc.  We have pressure points across public services.  How will we resolve those through a system that Professor McHale states is advantageous?  My point is that if there is pressure building in relation to the fiscal rules, not only politically but outside of the political system, what is the council's position on that?  Second, Professor McHale might comment further if he can on a policy of tax cuts on the one hand and a position where we had limited fiscal space which is being downsized almost all of the time on the other.<\/p> <p>  My third question is, how can there be such a difference between the Fiscal Advisory Council and the Government on demographic pressures?  The difference is in the region of &euro;600 million.  Surely, this should be more black and white than that.  It is either the council is right or it is wrong.  It cannot be so subjective.  It is incredible that we have that level of divergence between the Department of Finance and the Fiscal Advisory Council in this area.  It is something that has been a common difference between both for some time but it strikes me as odd that there can be such a divergence of views in monetary terms when it seems it should be something that is much more black and white, and much more grounded in facts because we are dealing with money and obvious pressures.  Those are my three opening questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016121300002#F00200","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1481648400,"counter":108,"content":"<p>If it is okay, Mr. Coffey will answer the first one.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016121300002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Professor John McHale"},{"type":"speech","time":1481648400,"counter":109,"content":"<p>Of course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016121300002#F00400","speaker":"1265"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1481648400,"counter":110,"content":"<p>I will take the part about the overall amount of money that may or may not be available.  The fiscal rules have been in place for a number of years.  For the past two years, we have seen measures introduced in each year of &euro;3 billion or maybe even a little more even though the rules were in place.  In 2015, it would have been a different part of the rules - the excessive deficit procedure.  We have been under the rules this year for the first time and, because of some technical reclassification, there was a total of over &euro;3 billion.<\/p> <p>  In terms of 2018 and the amount available for the budget to be announced next year, which Deputy Cullinane is looking at, it would not necessarily be the case that there is no money available.  The Government spends close on &euro;60 billion every year.  If one wants to make a reallocation, there is plenty of money within there that can be changed around.  Equally, we are not saying that there will be no increase in spending.  The total - there are different measures - gross fiscal space for 2018 would be approximately &euro;1.8 billion.  It is merely in terms of where is that allocated.  The Government itself has already allocated &euro;600 million for existing pre-commitments such as the Lansdowne Road agreement and its estimation of demographic pressures.  Because of budget 2017, a further &euro;600 million goes because some of the spending measures that were introduced in the budget will now be over 12 months rather than nine months.  Some of the increases in social welfare, which begin in March, must be paid in 2018 over a full year.  That is extra spending into the economy that has been announced this year but it will be additional spending in 2018.  Finally, our estimation is that to stand still - to do what we are doing now - and to maintain social welfare in line with expected inflation and maintain the real level of services across different sectors will absorb a further &euro;600 million.  It is not the case that there is no money there.  In a sense, it is just how it is allocated.  There is &euro;1.8 million of spending, either through existing pre-commitments, through standing still or paying for the measures announced in this year's budget.  Equally, if the Government wishes to spend more, it can introduce its own discretionary tax measures and then there would be additional funds available.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the rules limiting spending, the rules intend to limit spending in the sense of the impact it has on the deficit.  The fiscal rules apply for all countries of the eurozone and most countries of the EU, and they have various different levels of Government spending, from those high-tax high-spending countries - perhaps in Scandinavia - to lower tax low-spending countries.  In rough terms the limits are, by and large, a choice but it is about ensuring that one does not get this push for additional deficits that can lead to problems.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Conefrey will take the question of why the &euro;600 million difference arises.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016121300002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus Coffey"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1481648400,"counter":111,"content":"<p>We should not overstate it.

We have our own demographic model that we use to produce forecasts of the population by relevant age group over that period and some of the difference could lie there.  Also, some of the individual categories - when one thinks about the drivers of demographic pressures, for example, in health and education - involve fairly complex and detailed work, and it is not surprising that one can get differences.  Over that period, a difference of that size is actually quite small.  It is something we are working on with the Department, and the Department published a helpful paper of its own along with the budget documentation explaining the demographic drivers in health and education.  We place more of the emphasis on the other side of the calculation where the real difference is, that is, on the prices side.

Mr. Coffey stated in response to the question on the fiscal rules and whatever additional space might be there in 2018 that there is overall expenditure of &euro;60 billion and there can be a reallocation within that expenditure that can deal with some of the pressures that we have.  That is not a fair answer because much of the low-lying fruit in terms of whatever changes can be made have been dealt with quite harshly over the past six or seven years.  I do not see much room within overall current expenditure where we can do much reallocating.  It is not about reallocating.  It is about additionality.  The additionality that was identified in the stability programme update in terms of the fiscal space for the next number of years is being revised downwards.  Even leaving that aside, we then have the carryover from this budget and the differences in terms of the standing-still money.  That does not leave us with many options.  If that is the case and if Government policy is to cut taxes further, one can see the difficulties facing us at a time when we have patients on trolleys.<\/p><p> We have major problems in housing and in hospitals and I do not see how we can square those two.  As such, can the witnesses come back on that?  I do not have a difficulty with balancing budgets in terms of day-to-day spending, but there is an obsession with it.  The Tea Party in the USA, which is seen as an outlier politically, talks about balanced budgets.  There is a difference between balancing budgets for day-to-day spending and borrowing for capital spending.  That is one of the pressures we face.  Everybody in the room has to borrow at times to provide the capital to build a home and for big infrastructural projects.  That is what we do and the same should apply to the State.  Professor McHale referred earlier to learning from the mistakes of the past and remembering the harsh lessons of the economic crash.  However, we have gone from an extreme of reckless spending to an extreme of very limited spending and restricting ourselves in terms of investing in capital infrastructure funding for hospitals, schools, housing, flood prevention and all the other issues with which we have to deal.<\/p><p> My first question, very specifically, is on that difference between reallocation and additionality and my second is on whether the witnesses see a distinction between balancing budgets and not borrowing for day-to-day spending and borrowing for capital spending, which is where the debate is located.

The idea that there are no resources available is simply not something with which we would agree.  Within the fiscal rules, there is scope.  Over the past two years, between 2015 and 2016, measures totalling over &euro;6 billion were introduced.  If there are priorities there that should be addressed, one notes that there was scope to do so.  However, choices have to be made and there is no disputing that.  The line has to be drawn somewhere.  No matter where it is drawn, somebody will always point out the things that are just beyond the limit and say \"We could have done that\" or \"We could have done the other\".  That is simply a fact of having limited resources.  When it comes to the overall issue of addressing the problems, it is true that the fiscal rules place constraints on what can be done in terms of deficits.

There is quite an amount of discussion going on at European level on possible changes to the rules to create a greater distinction between current and capital spending.  That is an important conversation to have.  The point I was making earlier is that one cannot make too much of a distinction in the sense that they both lead to higher borrowing and, ultimately, higher debt.  There could be investments that yield such a high financial return that they pay for themselves but debt often has to be rolled over in a very short period.  The fact that it initially funded some good capital investment may not be particularly helpful when that debt has to be rolled over.  As such, one must look at the overall level of debt as well.  In our judgment, the path of debt reduction we are on, which is very much associated with bringing the deficit close to balance, is a sensible and prudent policy for the Irish economy in light of the fact that we are starting at a very high debt level and that there will be a lot of fiscal pressure from future demographics.  To bring that debt down, given the volatility of the international environment we face, is important.  As such, there is a distinction to be made and it is an important conversation that will take place over the next year or so.  I expect that some changes in the rules will come from Europe.

Whoever did that should be thanked on the record.  In reading the report, I would be reasonably happy were I the chief executive of a multibillion euro organisation of some description.  I would be quite happy about how things had gone at a macro level - notwithstanding some of the things that have happened - but I would be very nervous about the future.  I will go into the detail but I start by asking whether we are now beginning to repeat the budgetary mistakes of the past.  We can go into all of the detail, but is it the council's sense at a high level that we are now locking in permanent spending commitments based on what may be quite transient corporation tax returns and so on?  Is the council concerned that we are back to a pre-crash era and setting ourselves up for a fall, with the caveat that there are no safety valves this time?  There is no further public debt to be borrowed and there are no public sector pay cuts or other cutbacks for companies or households.  The airbag is gone, the ABS brakes are gone and we are running on bald tyres as matters stand.

A great deal was done on the banking side, with a new system of banking supervision and regulation, and a great deal was done on the fiscal side, including a great deal at national level.  I point again to this committee and the council as examples of that having regard to the Fiscal Responsibility Act.  We have put this framework in place, which also has complementary European elements, and if we are serious about it, then it has the potential to make us safer - albeit there are no guarantees.  Certainly, it will allow the debt to come down in a phased way and prevent us from making the mistakes of the past because if one really follows these rules, it is very difficult to use windfalls of tax revenue to fund permanent increases in spending.  One really has to wait for that spending to be based on the underlying growth of the economy.  While we have a framework that can keep us safe - and we are not saying disaster is imminent - the signs are that we are not taking the matter all that seriously.

That would be done without ever running a budget surplus.  I think that would be fine in normal circumstances, although my colleagues might disagree with me.  We do not need to pay down the nominal debt and we do not need to run budget surpluses.  I would like to make one qualification to that.  If there are signs that growth is strong and the economy is overheating - let us hope in a way that this happens - it may be necessary for cyclical management purposes to run budget surpluses.  That is how I interpret the Minister for Finance's proposal for a rainy day fund.  His approach seems to be that if there are signs that the economy is overheating, he will run budget surpluses and put the money away into a rainy day fund so that it can be used for cyclical management purposes in the event of an economic downturn.  While it may be necessary to run budgetary surpluses, this would be done for cyclical management purposes.  If we follow the framework and get close to a balanced budget, it should be sufficient to let the debt-to-GDP ratio fall, largely through growth.

To get the structural balance, an adjustment is made based on the output gap.  If the economy is considered to have a positive output gap - to be overheating, to all intents and purposes - essentially, an amount would be added on to the deficit to get the structural deficit.  Under this commonly agreed methodology, there is an output gap of almost 2% at the moment.  It is increasing the structural deficit.  If Ireland was above its target of 0.5% of GDP, it would have to bring the structural deficit down by 0.6 percentage points of GDP per annum anyway.  We think the commonly agreed methodology overstates the size of the output gap. Based on our analysis, we are probably close to an output gap of zero, if not a slightly negative output gap.  It is closing rapidly.<\/p> <p>  I will set out the implications of the mismeasurement, to the extent that there has been a mismeasurement.  It will take us a further year to reach our medium-term objective than would otherwise be the case.  If we had a zero output gap at the moment, we could take the general Government balance as being equal to the structural balance.  The projection for next year is that the general Government balance will be 0.4% of GDP, which would be below the medium-term objective.  The convergence margin would not apply in such circumstances.  This means that the extra adjustment is going on for a year longer than would otherwise be the case.  It would be better if this was not happening.

We do not know whether this is the case.  The figures suggest to me that the unexpected increase of 50% in corporation tax in 2015 was caused by Apple moving its intellectual property onshore.  A few other bits and pieces may have contributed, but the increase can basically be attributed to Apple bringing its intellectual property to Ireland and therefore paying more tax.  Those figures more or less work.  My question relates to the transience of the current position.  I appreciate that this is hypothetical, but I suggest it is probably more relevant in the context of a more protectionist United States under the incoming US Administration.<\/p> <p>  In 2015, corporation tax receipts unexpectedly increased by approximately 50%, which was huge.  I think approximately &euro;3.5 billion in unexpected revenues were received.  This money on its own basically allowed budgets to continue.  If that had not happened, we would have had a very different last 24 months in the D&aacute;il.  Those revenues have been put in the book as steady-state continuous revenues.  If Apple were to decide tomorrow to redomicile its intellectual property to Delaware, our revenue would fall in a day.  My question is not really about Apple.  I have mentioned it as an example of a company where there has been a sizeable shift.  Given that these receipts have been steady for the past year and half since the unexpected 50% increase, is the council concerned that they could decrease again just as quickly?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016121300002#H01700","speaker":"1230"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1481648400,"counter":140,"content":"<p>We are concerned, but we are not forecasting such a reduction.

He has done a really good job with his council and it is very much appreciated.  I am slightly scared that we are back in a whole range of different ways to some of the conditions that created the economic difficulty.  I really like what he said earlier about it not being left or right but whatever one's political view, if one believes in government it behoves all to be involved.  It is easy sometimes to characterise fiscal prudence as a conservative right wing mantra but if one believes in government, I suppose it also makes sense.<\/p> <p>  I wish to ask some very simple questions because there is so much information here one could be overloaded.  I found the document very interesting.  Figure 2.8 refers to the labour share as a percentage of GNP and I thought that was interesting.  This is a big broad question.  One of the characteristics of what is happening around the world in the past five to ten years is that this graph is borne out in reality across most of western developed economies.  The share of income to labour has fallen across the board and has remained low for a long period, beyond any historical context.  I cannot remember the figures historically but typically it is up around 45% to 50%.  That is a projection forward to set it at 38%.  My understanding is that is what has happened in most western developed economies in the past five years at least.  That is a very big macroeconomic question, but it relates to some of the questions we have around pay, which must be part of the debate.  Did the overall western world economic model get something wrong in terms of what it is allowing?

It is true in many countries but it is not true in every country.  The level and the trend in labour shares differ quite a lot by country as well.  What Deputy Ryan said is a basic characterisation of it but if one steps back from the labour share as a measure, there are a couple of things going on and this partly relates to political pressures as well.  First, the growth of GDP is lower, which is bad for everyone.  Second, it is true that in many countries labour share has been on a declining trend and has been weak since the crisis.  The development of labour has been quite interesting since the crisis.  On the upside, one of the few things that has surprised in many OECD countries is that employment has held up or recovered a bit more strongly than we would have expected given the growth in GDP, which up course pushes up the labour share a bit, but what has been exceptionally weak is wages.  That really reflects a combination of two things, depending on where it is, but in general there has been a big weakness in productivity growth and when that happens people do not get wage increases and that may partly be linked to the resilience of labour.  The other thing is that there probably are some pressures in the labour market which means it would be very hard to push up wages.  Something we see across many OECD countries is an absence of wage pressure.  Even in places like the US, it is taking a very long time to get any evidence at all that wages are pushing up.  Even though the economy has been unspectacular, it has actually been there for a quite a long time and usually normal economic relationships tell us that there should have been much more wage pressure than there was.  A number of things are going on, not all of which are well understood, but they fit together to make a whole.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016121300002#J01800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes"},{"type":"speech","time":1481648400,"counter":164,"content":"<p>We have an interest in that because some of the political consequences of what is happening in the United States and due to Brexit are due to the level of wages paid for rural American industrial jobs.<\/p> <p>  My second question is related and is based on figure 2.7 on page 42.  To be perfectly honest, I could not understand the graph.  I wondered why it was going back on itself.  I am interested in productivity growth and where it was said that real wage growth is forecast to be slightly below productivity growth from 2018 to 2021.  Where is our measure of productivity growth?  How does one measure that?  The figures for 2018 to 2021 are based on projections but where do they come from?  How is our productivity growth occurring?  I ask because I remember a line from someone in the middle of the crisis to the effect that if only we had tucked in behind Germany and had the same productivity growth it had and we were not losing competitiveness in that sense we would have been fine in the euro.  People blamed the euro but it was because we lost our productivity and competitiveness.  If we are to learn the lessons, then we must avoid the conditions being recreated whereby the euro environment might be out of step again with Irish economic circumstances.  To a certain extent, as long as we can maintain productivity and competitiveness compared to Germany in particular - our biggest currency partner - we are okay.

The point that we have been making is that even though the central scenario is reasonably encouraging there are huge risks around that given the uncertainties that exist in the world.  In terms of this particular graph, it is complicated, but if one sees those red dots flattening out as the unemployment rate falls, that is looking at the Government's projections for wage growth.

It is more to do with the projections from 2016 to 2021, when we anticipate that the labour share will remain flat, perhaps with the additional wage pressures that might be in the economy.  We would expect that to rise rather than remain flat.<\/p> <p>  There is an important point with regard to the labour share in these aggregate statistics for the Irish economy.  It is important to make a distinction between the two Irish economies, in other words, the labour share in domestic companies as against the labour share in foreign-owned companies.  Ireland's labour share in domestic companies for gross value-added is approximately 80%, the second highest in the European Union.  Only French domestic companies allocate a greater share of value added to labour than Irish companies.  However, Ireland's labour share for foreign companies is by far the lowest in the EU.  Up to 2014, the figure was 25%.  After what happened to the data in 2015, I imagine the figure is now far lower than 25%.  Let us consider the graph again.  There is a significant downward step in 2015.  That does not necessarily represent a reduction in wages.  It represents a massive step-change in the value of output created primarily in the foreign-owned sector.<\/p> <p>  The data on labour share in Ireland gives a differing picture of the domestic economy, where it seems reasonable, although I am unsure of the trend.

It is also the case that on top of the negative trade effect, growth in Ireland could be reduced because of Brexit and due to the effect of uncertainty on business investment and consumer confidence.

The effect for 2017 would be to knock about 0.75 percentage points off growth and around 0.3 or 0.4 percentage points thereafter, which is a little higher than some of the other estimates that were around at the time, mainly due to the fact that we have tried to take account of some of factors that Deputy Ryan mentioned.  It is the case that there is much uncertainty around the possible magnitude of those factors.  The reason the studies focus on elements such as the trade effect is that one can come up with some sort of reasonable estimate of what the effect on exports might be.

However, a ten year bond yield gives members some idea of the average interest rates that are expected over the next ten years on shorter-term bonds, essentially it is average interest plus a risk premium.  The market's assessment is still quite sanguine in terms of how low interest rates will be in the next number of years.  If it is a bubble, the fact that those yields are so low and the prices are so high is indicating a bubble.  That could be the case, it could burst and could change very quickly.  There is risk there, but at least the market assessment is still that interest rates are going to stay low for a protracted period.<\/p> <p>  I had not been aware of the century bonds which the Deputy mentioned, which shows that the market's longer-term expectations of interest rates have taken a jump upwards but given one is not seeing it in terms of the ten year bonds, it is outside that ten year window.

The commission was established on 29 June 2016  by the then Minister for  Environment, Community and Local Government in circumstances that are well known to the committee.  Its terms of reference are set out at paragraph 1.1 of the report and its membership is set out at paragraph 1.2.  As will be seen, the commission comprised national and international experts in the different aspects of public water policy, including technical, economic, administrative and legal expertise.  It was required to present its report to this committee by the end of November 2016.  Secretarial and research support was provided to the commission by the Institute of Public Administration.  The report now before the committee was unanimously adopted by the commission at its final meeting on 29 November 2016.<br\/><br\/>With regard to the approach taken by the commission, it reviewed a wide range of reports, papers and research materials, with which it was provided, relating to the topics under consideration.  It considered comparative data on international experience but also relied on the knowledge and experience of its own members in dealing with matters of public water policy.  As was required under its terms of reference, the commission sought submissions from interested parties.  The public consultation engaged in by the commission proved to be a valuable process and enabled the commission to obtain the views of a broad range of groups, political parties and individuals.  The list of parties from whom submissions were received or with whom the commission met is provided at Appendix 12 of the report.  The commission has taken full account of the views put forward by those who made submissions in its analysis of the existing system of funding public water services and in formulating recommendations for a new funding model.<br\/><br\/>With regard to water consumption in Ireland, accurate data on water consumption has only recently become available in Ireland.  This indicates that consumption levels are below those previously estimated.  The average consumption per person per day is estimated at 111 litres when outliers are excluded and 123 litres when outliers are included.  The data presented to the commission indicates that 7% of households use six times more water than the average.<b><font color=\"#4181C0\">  <\/font><\/b>I draw the attention of members to Appendix 14 of the report, which is a letter from the European Commission.<\/p><p>The committee will note in that letter that the Commission referred to Ireland as having an extraordinarily high level of water consumption and set the figure at 142 cu. m <i>per capita<\/i>.  I gather - I am open to correction by those who know more about these matters - that a cubic metre is 1,000 litres.  That indicates that the Commission's view of water consumption in Ireland, which was based on 2011 data, was way off the mark.  That is an important point to emphasise, in the overall context and having regard to what the Commission stated in the letter.  It is important that it be contextualised in that regard.  I should say that when we received the letter from the Commission the figures that are in the report were checked and double-checked and the Commission is happy to stand over those figures.<br\/><br\/>With regard to charging arrangements in other jurisdictions which it deal with at paragraph 2.4 of the report, it is noted by the Commission that until the recent introduction of a tariff structure for domestic consumption, Ireland was unique in Europe in not having any direct charge on users of domestic water services.  Reflecting the general categories of tariff structures available, the OECD, in 2010, notes that domestic water pricing typically derives from a combination of the following components.  It could be a one-time connection fee to gain access to the service.  It could be a recurrent fixed charge, sometimes known as a standing charge or flat fee, that can be uniform across customers or linked to some customer characteristic.  For example, the factors that may be taken into account in determining the charge include the size of the water pipe or meter flow capacity, property values and the number of water-using appliances, but fixed charges do not reflect consumption.  If a metering system is in place, a volumetric rate, when multiplied by the volume of water consumed in a charging period, gives rise to the volumetric charge for that period.  The rate can be the same for any level of consumption, it can increase in steps with volumes consumed - often referred to as increasing block tariffs, IBT - or it can decrease in steps with volumes consumed - decreasing block tariffs.  In some circumstances, a minimum charge is paid for each period, regardless of consumption.  The report sets out in more detail, as I am sure members will have seen, the charging systems that apply in various selected other countries<br\/><br\/>Financing infrastructure is dealt with in detail in the report.  The Commission has noted there is an investment target of &euro;5.5 billion up to 2021 to bring water services to an acceptable level, and it is quite likely that significant ongoing investment will be required beyond 2021.  A total capital requirement of &euro;13 billion was identified by Irish Water in 2015 as the minimum to meet good infrastructure and service standards.<br\/><br\/>The PricewaterhouseCoopers report of 2011 that recommended the establishment of a single utility for water services envisaged that Irish Water would become self-financing, perhaps as early as 2018, and could potentially achieve a borrowing capacity of &euro;2.9 billion by 2030, stating also that &quot;a key factor in evaluating the merits of the new operating model is the possibility that the borrowings of Irish Water could be outside the General Government Balance&quot;.  Indeed, it was recognised that a significant component of the strategy to establish Irish Water was that it would be classified as a market corporation under EUROSTAT rules.  However, the EUROSTAT decision of July 2015 that Irish Water is a non-market entity controlled by government and should therefore be classified within the government sector, clearly impacted on that strategy, including the strategy for borrowing to fund infrastructure.<br\/><br\/>The Commission has also been informed that the New Economy and Recovery Authority, NewEra, has prepared a report for Government on funding options for Irish Water, examining matters such as the financial cost of external borrowing versus the provision of funds from central government sources.  This report was not available to the expert commission at the time of reporting but, of course, is essential to a complete and accurate assessment of financing options.<br\/><br\/>I will turn to the issues arising in the consultation process.  As members will note, in Chapter 3 of the report a summary is given of the main issues which arose during the consultation process.  There was, as was to be expected, a wide spectrum of views expressed on the principal issues coming within the Commission's terms of reference, particularly on the issue of how public water services should be paid for.  They ranged from those who strongly advocated the principle that water should be paid for so as to emphasise its value and as a means of conservation, to those who expressed opposition, in many cases trenchant opposition, to any form of charges for domestic water, claiming that the service is already paid for through taxation.<br\/><br\/>The most commonly expressed concern to emerge from the consultation process related to the possibility of Irish Water being privatised at some time in the future.  Many of those who opposed water charges and metering focused their opposition on what they regarded as the commodification of water and the potential that this creates for the eventual sale of the water utility.  This concern was not confined to those opposed to water charges but was also expressed by some groups which were generally supportive of charges.<br\/><br\/>There was general support for the establishment of a central authority to manage and deliver public water services.  However, some respondents expressed the view that the reputation of Irish Water had been irreparably damaged by such matters as the excessive spending on consultancy and public relations, and that a new or different type of body could achieve more public support.  The regulatory role of the Commission for Energy Regulation was generally supported, although it emerged that the exact role of the regulator could be clarified.<br\/><br\/>A number of respondents addressed the need for more targeted conservation policies focused on such matters as tax rebates or grants for the purchase of efficient water fixtures, more emphasis on education and outreach programmes promoting conservation, implementation of new building standards and public campaigns directed at creating greater awareness of the need for conservation.<br\/><br\/>A further issue of contention that arose in the consultation process related to the State's obligations under Article 9 of Directive 2000\/60\/EC, otherwise known as the Water Framework Directive.  Some respondents submitted that Ireland continues to benefit from a derogation from the requirement of paragraph 1 of that Article and referred the Commission to professional legal advice to that effect.<\/p><p>Others submitted that by operation of that directive Ireland has no choice but to implement a system of household charges for domestic water services.  That is a matter I will return to in this summary.  <\/p><p> The view was also expressed that the decision to introduce water charges was imposed as part of the EU-IMF programme of financial support to Ireland and not as a natural part of the domestic socio-political process.  Many submissions also expressed frustration that there has been little consistency in policy direction on water charges over several decades, which has resulted in a lack of trust in Government decisions on this issue.  As such, there was concern that any proposed new policy directions will not be seen as credible or reflecting the views of Irish citizens.  There was also some mistrust of the independence of the expert commission, including concerns that the establishment of the commission was merely a box-ticking exercise for already settled Government policy.  In this context, some expressed the view that the terms of reference of the commission had already precluded certain outcomes.  Those are views to which I do not subscribe.  I hope it will be evident from the report that is before the committee that the commission did not subscribe to those views.  <\/p><p> Chapter 4 of the report discusses the commission&rsquo;s findings and analysis based on the research undertaken and its consideration of the submissions received.  Based on the evidence available to it, and having regard to the expert knowledge and experience of its members, the commission concluded that the ideal funding model should provide adequate and secure funding for the operational and capital costs of supplying treated water; be affordable and not place an undue financial burden on those who can least afford to pay; help to support the conservation of water and support a clean environment; be practical in terms of its implementation; and ensure optimal allocation and usage of water.  However, the commission also concluded that when assessing the optimal method for funding domestic water services, it is also important to consider country-specific factors and context, including the relevant weighting that should be attached to these various criteria.  Regarding water usage in Ireland, the commission reached the following conclusions, based on its analysis of relevant data: Ireland has an abundance of renewable water resources leading to a high level of water availability; local water scarcity occurs nonetheless, especially in certain urban environments which is driven by high levels of leakage and growth in water demand; there is no evidence to indicate that Ireland has particularly high levels of domestic water consumption; Ireland has a relatively fragmented distribution network and the majority of this infrastructure is in serious need of upgrade and investment; there are ongoing incidents of contamination of drinking water supply in certain parts of the country; a lack of adequate contingency supplies of water in cities and ongoing problems with untreated sewage entering rivers, lakes and the sea; and while renewable sources of water may be plentiful and average domestic consumption is not excessive, the infrastructural deficit is leading to problems and currently represents an unacceptable level of risk to the population. <\/p><p> I will speak on the existing charging frameworks, by which I mean the system in place prior to suspension.  Traditionally water services in Ireland have been paid for through general taxation.  This system has the merit of simplicity and is progressive to the extent that the taxation system is progressive and is complemented by social welfare supports.  However, it does not address the issue of water conservation and funding for water infrastructure could be - and many will say has been - crowded out by demands from other parts of the system.  A number of independent reviews, both in Ireland and internationally, have come to the conclusion that a volumetric charging system based on metering, supported by a well-targeted affordability system, represents the approach that is most in line with best practice and best meets the criteria described above.  The original charging plan approved by the Commission for Energy Regulation was also generally consistent with established practice in a number of other jurisdictions.  However, in addition to the criteria referred to earlier the commission was satisfied that in considering the suitability of a charging structure, due account must be had to the context of water charging, including the degree to which it attracts public acceptability.  On that point, the commission adopted the reasoning contained in the Indecon report on local government financing 2005, which noted that \"making recommendations which are correct in principle but which are not capable of being implemented does a disservice to the need to reform the system of local government funding\" and \"Changes also have to take account of political constraints and the overall acceptability of options to the community.\"<\/p><p> I will turn now to the recommendations which are set out in detail at chapter 5 of the report.  These recommendations are not intended to be overly prescriptive, rather to set out a number of principles upon which a revised arrangement for financing domestic water services could be based.  Given the extent to which many groups and individuals who made submissions to the commission are genuinely concerned at the possibility of Irish Water passing from public ownership, and the extent to which that issue overshadowed debate on water charging policy, the Commission considered it appropriate to address this matter in its recommendations, which it does at paragraphs 5.1.1 to 5.1.4 of the report.<\/p><p> On funding, the principal recommendation is that the cost of providing all citizens with sufficient clean water to meet their normal domestic and personal needs should be met by the Exchequer out of taxation.  Excessive or wasteful use of water should not be charged against taxation but should be paid for by the user.  The commission did not consider it possible - we did not have the data available to us - to determine the level of usage that would be necessary to meet the normal domestic and personal needs of citizens.<\/p><p>Rather, if this principle is accepted, the Commission for Energy Regulation should be assigned that task, which should be undertaken as part of an open and transparent process involving the public water forum.<\/p><p>In the overall context of the proposals, it is important to note that the practical effect of the expert commission&rsquo;s recommendations is that the State will be a customer of Irish Water and the Exchequer will pay for the volume of water supplied to meet the normal domestic and personal needs of citizens at tariffs approved by the Commission for Energy Regulation as a normal commercial transaction.  If accepted and implemented, this proposal will ensure that the revenue that Irish Water had anticipated receiving from households would be receivable from the Exchequer.  Hence, the overall income available to Irish Water would not be diminished and the company should have a guaranteed income stream from charges levied for normal consumption.  In addition, it will have some income from charges levied on households for excessive usage.<\/p><p> On metering, the commission noted that considerable benefits have accrued from the installation of meters, including in the provision of valuable data in detecting leaks and managing the system.  At this juncture, I should note that the information to which I referred on the issue of consumption, which demonstrated that we use considerably less water than was anticipated, was identified as a result of metering.  This information probably would not have been available in the absence of metering.<\/p><p> The question of whether the metering programme should be continued is not within the commission's terms of reference.  However, if it is decided to proceed with the programme, consideration should be given to an approach that is more aligned with the recommendations in the report, such as district metering.  The report addresses this issue in some detail. <\/p><p> The commission has also made a number of other recommendations, which are set out in detail in paragraphs 5.5 to 5.8, inclusive.  These can be summarised as follows.  The commission has made recommendations directed at improving public confidence in Irish Water through greater public engagement and transparency.  It has also made recommendations directed at enhancing the role and effectiveness of the regulator.  It is recommended that a much more proactive approach be taken to promoting water conservation through educational and information campaigns.  Measures should also be considered that are directed at requiring the installation of water conserving fittings in new buildings and an extension of the building energy rating schemes to incorporate water conservation.  The commission recommended that equity with the proposed arrangements for consumers on public water supplies must be maintained for those who are not served by public supplies.  The commission recommends that this be reviewed when the allowances for consumers on public supplies are determined and that equity for group schemes and private wells be maintained through additional subsidy or other means.  The commission further recommended that the necessary measures should be put in place to give effect to the commitment contained in the confidence and supply agreement that those who have paid their water bills to date will not be treated less favourably than those who have not.<\/p><p> Returning to the issue of compliance with obligations under European law, at paragraph 5.9 of the report, the commission addresses the significant and potentially difficult question of compliance with the State's obligations under directive 2000\/60\/EC establishing a framework for Community action in the field of water policy, known as the water framework directive.  The expert commission wrote to the European Commission on 19 October 2016 inviting it to make a submission on the matter under consideration.  By letter dated 24 November 2016, the European Commission responded to this invitation.  Its letter restated similar points previously made to the expert commission.  A copy of the European Commission's reply is appended to the report for the benefit of members.<\/p><p> As will be noted, the Commission received submissions from a number of interested parties in which the question of whether a particular type of funding regime is required to comply with the directive was addressed.  However, for reasons stated in the report, the expert commission cannot purport to offer any definitive opinion on that question.   It is, however, satisfied that the recommendations contained in the report provide for the full recovery by Irish Water of the cost of providing water services to households, thus ensuring proper funding of the water utility, and provides for investment in infrastructure.  Furthermore, the approach recommended provides incentives for domestic users to use water resources efficiently and respects the polluter pays principle.  In that context, if the recommendations are accepted, charges will be retained in respect of excessive or wasteful uses of water.  On that basis, it was the considered and unanimous opinion of the expert commission that it can cogently be argued that the recommendations, if implemented, will achieve the objective pursued by article 9 of the directive.  This wording was carefully chosen because, as I am sure members are aware, European directives are binding on member states as to the purpose to be achieved, while the method and form for doing so is left to member states.  This is provided for at article 288 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, otherwise known as the Lisbon treaty.  The considered and unanimous opinion of the expert commission is that it a cogent argument can be made that the proposals in the report meet the objective of the directive.  If careful consideration is given to the letter from the European Commission, it will be noted that it sets out what the Commission regards as the purpose or objective of the directive. <\/p><p> I wish to place on record the expert commission's appreciation of the excellent support services it received from the Institute of Public Administration, which enabled us to complete our work with a day to spare.  On behalf of the expert commission, I commend the report to the joint committee and wish members well in their deliberations. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2016121300002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin Duffy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481635800,"counter":213,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Uasal &Oacute; Dufaigh.

We appreciate the committee has had detailed discussions last week with the Department of Finance, the Revenue Commissioners and the European Commission on the Commission&rsquo;s latest corporate tax reform package.  This comprises proposals on CCTB and CCCTB as well as measures dealing with hybrid mismatches and dispute resolution. <\/p> <p>  Today, however, I will focus my comments on issues arising from the CCCTB package.  Let me outline the global context.  There have been huge efforts made by all countries to update the global corporation tax rules.  The OECD and the G20 have been working tirelessly on this agenda for the past three years with over 100 countries globally.  International consensus has been reached after thousands of hours of discussion and debate and countries and companies are now in the process of implementing this vast set of changes. <\/p> <p>  All of the 15 Base Erosion and Profit Sharing, BEPS, actions agreed are already being implemented by the EU as a whole, through a range of measures &ndash; the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive, the Joint Transfer Pricing Forum, the EU Code of Conduct Group and separate EU measures on exchange of information, mandatory disclosure of tax avoidance schemes and dispute resolution.  Changing the tax regime for multinational companies requires global and consistent action &ndash; countries must act collectively and the tools are now there to deal with these issues. <\/p> <p>  CCCTB would create an entirely new framework for corporate taxation with a whole new tax base and an arbitrary formula to allocate profit rather than the arms&rsquo; length basis agreed globally only last year.  If this were to happen, the EU would effectively be moving in a different direction on tax in a global economy at a time when it is also struggling to activate investment and promote innovation in the member states.  It would put Europe out of sync with other OECD countries who do not form part of the European Union. <\/p> <p>  There are some key elements of the proposal that could impact Ireland and those doing business here.  Without doubt the CCCTB proposal is very complex and wide reaching.  Analysing the full potential impact that it might have for Ireland and those doing business in Ireland could take some time.  As negotiations proceed some of the key elements are likely to change.  However, at a first analysis, there are four troubling aspects to these proposals for Ireland.  There are concerns in respect of loss of sovereignty.  Ireland would retain the right to set a single corporate tax rate but only one rate.  The rest of the corporate tax system for CCCTB companies would be determined entirely by the EU as a whole, with Ireland being one voice at the table.  Technical points would be determined directly by the Commission through the power of delegated acts and Irish courts would have no role in determining legal disputes, which would be heard by the Court of Justice of the European Union in Luxembourg.<\/p><p>Also to be considered is the loss of control over tax policy matters.A country's tax policy should be matched to the individual social and economic needs of its citizens.  For each country, these needs will be different.  Ireland has a unique set of circumstances in Europe as a very small open economy on the periphery of the Continent.  What is good tax policy for Ireland will not necessarily be good tax policy for France, for example, and <i>vice versa<\/i>; we are not all the same in the EU.<br\/><br\/>Countries need the flexibility to adapt their tax policy if problems arise or individual circumstances change.  One of Ireland's unique strengths is that we can adapt quickly to change when the need arises.  This has served us well and is not something to surrender lightly.  <br\/><br\/>We are concerned about the impact on the Irish Exchequer.  The allocation formula has three equally weighted factors, of sales, assets and labour.  This has been described as &quot;a formula based on Victorian manufacturing&quot; by the President of the UK Chartered Institute of Taxation.  As a contributor from one of Europe's largest economies, he observes that &quot;The allocation factors ... won't work for smaller economies which might manufacture goods or provide services to other countries&quot;.  Ireland clearly falls into this category. <br\/><br\/>The allocation formula also ignores the existence of intangible assets, which are a major part of modern global business.  Ignoring the existence of intangible assets is not a realistic way of allocating profits to locations where economic value is created.  It runs contrary to the EU growth agenda based on digital advancement, at a time when the Commission itself has told us that there are 1 million unfilled roles in the EU for people with IT skills.  <br\/><br\/>According to the allocation formula proposed, one third of a CCCTB company's profits would be allocated across the EU based purely on the location of its customers.  EU member states already collect huge amounts of tax as a direct result of their consumer base in the form of VAT.  Furthermore, a sales element in an allocation formula will always reduce the profits attributable to small economies such as Ireland, which are export focused and have fewer domestic consumers.  The Irish population of consumers is 4.7 million, compared to a population of 66 million in France and 81 million in Germany.  In any exercise where one third of a company's profits are spread across the EU on the basis on sales, Ireland will get only a tiny allocation.<br\/><br\/>Profits from trade outside the EU that are currently taxed in Ireland would also be reallocated to other member states based on an EU-wide assets and labour formula.  In order to stimulate growth and diversify risk, particularly in light of Brexit developments, businesses are trying to develop more non-EU markets.  Profits from this non-EU business would also be impacted by a CCCTB formula and reallocated to other member states.<br\/><br\/>We heard the Commission confirm to this committee last week that all income will be treated in the same way in a CCCTB regime so that Ireland would no longer be able to apply higher 25% and 33% rates to passive income and capital gains.  Our Exchequer yield would almost certainly be impacted by the loss of two key higher tax rates.  It is also likely that Ireland's corporate tax base, which is wide by international standards, would be narrowed.  How much it will be narrowed and the extent of the impact on the Exchequer will not be clear until an analysis is carried out by the Department of Finance.  However, any corporate taxes forgone would have to be replaced.  Does this mean higher taxes elsewhere or cuts in spending?  In its latest fiscal assessment report, the Fiscal Advisory Council said the total available fiscal space for 2017, for example, has already been allocated to spending increases and tax cuts in the budget, leaving no room for additional spending without offsetting tax rises or spending cuts.  <br\/><br\/>Research carried out by the ESRI in 2014 found that an increase in Ireland's corporation tax rate would negatively impact foreign direct investment.  Thus, there is little scope to increase the 12.5% rate to compensate for the narrower tax base that would arise under a CCCTB.  <br\/><br\/>What about the impact on business?  The way the allocation formula has been designed means that companies operating in Ireland are very likely to see profits currently earned here and taxed at 12.5% being reallocated to countries with higher tax rates.  In our view, this will have a direct impact on competitiveness, not only for Ireland but also for the EU as a whole. <br\/><br\/>There is a lack of certainty about the new rules.  We have almost 200 years' experience in Ireland of dealing with company tax.  Much of the legislation and case law that has evolved over that time could become redundant with a new regime, new rules and new definitions, creating huge uncertainty for business and Revenue. <br\/><br\/>Although there could be some administrative benefits for business from having a common set of rules, independent research commissioned by the Irish Tax Institute on the 2011 CCCTB proposal concluded that it would result in net higher administrative costs for companies.  Time saved in preparing local tax returns would be outweighed by the additional work required to manage the consolidation process and deal with queries and disputes with tax authorities EU wide.<br\/><br\/>In summary, we believe the common base and consolidation proposals from the EU would represent a major challenge for Ireland and businesses operating here.  As we have outlined, these proposals do not make sense from economic, job creation and competition perspectives.  We cannot see the logic of their design for a small open economy like Ireland, or indeed other small countries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016121300002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Cora O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481639700,"counter":224,"content":"<p>I welcome Ms O'Brien and Mr. Lucey from the Irish Tax Institute and I thank them for their opening remarks.

Ms O'Brien has given a quite detailed overview of the proposals as they stand.  Hers is a quite negative assessment overall.  What is the view the of the institute on the analysis carried out by EY on behalf of the Department a number of years ago - in 2012, I believe?  At the time, it was based on data from 2005.  This was applied by the ESRI recently in its assessment of CCCTB.  That was based on the 2011 version of the proposal.  It concluded that the loss would be around &euro;325 million in corporation tax receipts if the arrangement had been applied in 2005, representing a reduction of approximately 5.7%.  In terms of today's receipts, that would be a higher figure in nominal terms.  One might have believed the impact would be even greater than that predicted by the ESRI.  Could Ms O'Brien give us her view on that?  Is the conclusion based on certain assumptions?  The presentation of Ms O'Brien is even more negative, perhaps, than what the ESRI's data might lead one to conclude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016121300002#C00200","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1481639700,"counter":225,"content":"<p>Even leaving aside the economic numbers, with which my colleague Mr. Seamus Coffey might be more involved, the main point, based simply on taking a look at the exercise that would have to be done if we were to work out today the impact on the Irish Exchequer, is that there are so many unknowns.  Just taking the base, there will now be more generous expense deductions than before.  There is a new deduction for increases in equity and an exemption for foreign dividend income.  We have a credit system at the moment and there is relief for cross-border losses.  We have currently got a best-in-class research and development regime which could also be affected.  There is also the complication that the system is mandatory now.  Having said that, other smaller companies might want to opt in if they seek benefits.  Therefore, we would need to bring that aspect into the analysis.  Those are the issues associated with trying to work out the impact because of the base changes.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the impact if we were to consolidate and reallocate based on this formula, I believe it would be so difficult.  One would need to know each of the affected businesses' pan-European operations, where they have assets and where they make sales and have customers.  If one does not have those data, one cannot estimate what the new position will be under the triple CCCTB.  That is a very complicated task.  We know the non-EU sales will now be reallocated to other EU countries.  If the arrangement is introduced, one will have to consider the cost of administering the two systems because some of the smaller companies might prefer to stay in the existing system.  All of this really just takes account of the static changes.  There are also the dynamic changes.  Would businesses move functions and operations in a CCCTB environment if they believed they would be paying a lot more tax?  The potential cost to the Exchequer is very significant and very hard to measure.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016121300002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Cora O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1481639700,"counter":226,"content":"<p>Does Ms O'Brien believe that we would receive fewer corporation tax receipts overall from companies that are already here if the current proposals were adopted and that Ireland would be less attractive as a destination for inward investment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016121300002#C00400","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1481639700,"counter":227,"content":"<p>That would almost certainly happen because a high proportion of our corporate tax comes from the multinational sector and, in turn, a high proportion of that comes from the US and non-EU sectors.

The asset sales and labour factors are going to be low in Ireland in comparison to other member states, whatever way one looks at it, particularly the sales one.  For a continent trying to promote innovation, it does not take any account of intangible assets.

Where one does not have a price because it is an intergroup transaction, then one has to find an arm's length price and do one&rsquo;s best to get the best arm's length price.  A whole part of the OECD BEPS, base erosion and profit shifting proposals, is making sure there are tighter rules about those arm's length prices and they are closer to reality.  They will seek to ensure there is more of an onus on companies to do more analysis and share more information about them.  This is about entity by entity, trading with each other, based on arm's length prices.  One brooks profits and losses to places where value is created.  Corporation tax is about profits and they are supposed to be measured, based on value created.<\/p> <p>  In such a model, one will sometimes get double taxation.  That is where double tax treaties will come in so as to eliminate that.  They go hand-in-hand as a tax system globally.  That is the one the OECD is working on improving.<\/p> <p>  We then have the Commission&rsquo;s separate proposal, an almost artificial way, of taking all the separate entities within a group within the EU, or anybody with a presence in a member state, of putting them all in together into one pie.  This is then divided, based on these factors, which are arbitrary.  They do not actually match the economic model of the company and are not based on the way it does its business.  They do not take account of where its operations are based, where its management and control is located, where its intellectual property is held or where its risk takes place which should be driving where its profits are.  Instead, it is just based on these three factors.  That is where the difference lies.<\/p> <p>  It is very hard to put those two systems together without causing cracks and creaks in the regime.  There is an acceptance we need to get the rules better on corporate tax.

On the technical analysis, there are some very serious concerns.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016121300002#E00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Cora O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1481639700,"counter":242,"content":"<p>We have just been joined by Professor Seamus Coffey.

The information I would like to give relates to looking at some of the numbers underlying the common consolidated corporation tax base, CCCTB, proposals and the implications for Ireland.  I will run briefly through some of the points I made in the document I submitted.<\/p> <p>  First, the initial CCCTB proposals are perceived to be narrower than the existing base under domestic legislation.  While a lot of the emphasis tends to be on the impact on multinationals and the distribution of the tax base there, if the base under this proposal is narrower, domestic companies, which come under the &euro;750 million threshold may voluntarily choose to opt in if they can get a reduced taxable income using this system.  That could be through the treatment of research and development expenditure.  As Ms O&rsquo;Brien mentioned, we do have quite a good regime with the R&amp;D tax credit and the knowledge development box but in terms of the treatment of the expenditure it can be a 100% deduction plus an additional 50% under the CCCTB proposals.  Equally, for something like entertainment expenses which are not deductible under the Irish regime, there would be a 50% deduction allowed under the new proposals.  It could be that domestic companies would choose to opt in whether they are close or even at the &euro;750 million threshold for turnover.  It is difficult to assess the impact that would have but it is a possibility.<\/p> <p>  Second, as discussed before the committee previously, would be the impact on some of the rates Ireland applies.  I refer, for example, to the 25% rate that is generally perceived to apply to non-traded income but it does apply to the traded income of those in mining and extractive industries which have some presence in Ireland.  Equally, our 33% rate as applied to the capital gains of companies, although it is paid under corporation tax, it is paid at a 33% rate.  In 2014 Ireland had approximately &euro;2.5 billion of taxable income that was taxed at the 25% rate.  If we were to go to a single rate and if that rate was 12.5% then, notionally, there would be a reduction in the gross tax due of &euro;300 million simply by taking the amount of income that would be subject to the 25% rate and applying a much lower rate to it.  How that translates in terms of actual tax revenue is quite difficult because some credits could be applied to that or if the next step is taken and the tax base is apportioned we do not know how much we would get.  At present, our 25% rate brings in about &euro;600 million in gross tax due a year.<\/p> <p>  It is also worth noting that for the capital gains tax, again looking at the most recent figures for 2014, companies had about &euro;600 million of gains taxed at the 33% rate.  Again, if that was at 12.5% one would be looking at a reduction in the gross tax due of &euro;125 million, subject to the provisions about apportionment.<\/p> <p>  When it comes to looking at the broader impact of the common consolidated corporate tax base on Ireland, a number of studies have been undertaken.  Ernst &amp;amp; Young, EY, was commissioned by the Department of Finance to undertake a study that was published in 2012 based on the 2011 CCCTB proposal.  The Commission itself published an update on its revenue assessment impact of the most recent version of the CCCTB back in October.  Both of the outcomes seem to be very benign from an Irish perspective.  According to the EY analysis the loss in corporate tax revenue would be about &euro;325 million and according to the European Commission analysis the loss would be equivalent to 0.14% of GDP, which based on 2014 figures would be &euro;250 million of a total loss in corporate tax revenue for Ireland.  I have major doubts about the veracity or applicability of either of the approaches to estimating the impact on Ireland.  The studies used individual company data, which really does not follow geographic boundaries.  It tells one what a company does but if one gets a company reporting on Ireland and one has information on its revenue, profit and tax that does not mean that all happened in Ireland.  If one takes the EY and the Commission approaches, neither of them know where the companies make their sales.<\/p> <p>  A company's financial reports do not tell one, by and large, where the sales happen so both studies had to imply it.  The EY approach was to do it with export shares, which may be the final destination of the products and the Commission simply ignored it.  It applied an output measure as its way of attributing the information.  We know in the case of Ireland the output is quite large but of course all the sales happen elsewhere so either of those factors would have major implications in terms of their applicability to the Irish situation where we know, first, that 80% of our corporation tax is paid by foreign-owned companies and, second, that the top 10% of payers pay 40% of the corporation tax and, third, there is an overexposure in Ireland of companies from the US.  If the companies in the analyses do not reflect that they are not reflecting the corporation tax landscape in Ireland.  One could ask how we will go about overcoming that.  One way would be to try to look at aggregate data.  One sector that is very important for Ireland is the manufacture of pharmaceuticals.<\/p><p>In any given year that sector contributes about one sixth of our corporation tax.  For the years I have looked, from 2008 to 2012 where full data are available, we collected about &euro;700 million per annum in corporation tax solely from the manufacturing of pharmaceuticals.  <br\/><br\/>If we consider the tax base around Europe, we can try and proxy this with a national accounting concept called gross operating surplus.  In accounting terms, it is akin to earnings before interest, tax, deprecation and amortisation.  It is close to the tax base but it has some differences and, crucially, it does not take account of depreciation.  If we get a measure of the distribution of gross operating surplus across Europe, we can get a measure of the distribution of the tax base across Europe.  Ireland has about one quarter of the tax base in the manufacturing of pharmaceuticals in the EU and from that we collect about &euro;700 million in corporation tax per annum.  The figure is probably higher now but for the five year period from 2008 to 2012 it was &euro;700 million per annum.<br\/><br\/>If we consider what the CCCTB might do, on  the basis of allocating profits on sales, employees, employee compensation and fixed assets, Ireland would not do too bad on the fixed assets.  Approximately 8% of all fixed capital investment in the EU for the manufacture of pharmaceuticals takes place in Ireland.  When it comes to employees and employee compensation, we have about 3% of both, but when it comes to sales, Ireland has less than 1%, simply by the nature of the size of our market.  If the CCCTB was applied with the one third equal weights for sales, employees and fixed assets, we would get about 4% of the European-wide tax base.  It would go from 25%, as it is now, to 4%, if the CCCTB was to be applied.  That is making many assumptions but is based on the aggregate data.  It would mean a loss in tax revenue of over &euro;550 million for Ireland if we were to move from having the value added that is created or taxed here to having it allocated on the basis of sales, employees and fixed assets.<br\/><br\/>A big difficulty with all these analyses of the CCCTB is that they are on the basis on what companies do now.  Companies engage in tax planning.  A CCCTB is not going to stop that.  Companies are always going to engage in tax planning, therefore, we cannot be sure how the companies will react.  One issue is that in order for a country to be allocated some of the tax base, the company must have a taxable presence there, or a permanent establishment.  At present a company might have a sales function in various countries and that sales function would trigger a permanent establishment.  It might not be very profitable because it might not be where the company creates a value but, under the system of the CCCTB, it would be enough to create a permanent establishment.  We could have companies in a sense changing.  They would not set up permanent establishments or tax presences in various countries.  Perhaps they could outsource the sales to an independent import distributor if it was possible for them to do so.  They could concentrate their activities in certain countries.  We are not sure how that might play out and as Ireland is a peripheral country that is a little distant from the large markets in the EU, I  do not think they will be concentrating their activities here.  In terms of the impact a CCCTB will have, we must recognise that the companies will respond.  They will not simply continue with their existing activities and have an entirely new tax system imposed on them and not react to it.<i><\/i><br\/><br\/>Equally, the CCCTB in its objective of reducing tax avoidance will still make transfer pricing necessary for extra EU transactions.  In the case of Ireland, this is hugely important, given the presence of US companies here and the fact that their operations here use technology and platforms that are developed in the US, and they must be paid for through various patent royalties, etc.  This pricing will still exist under the CCCTB.  This proposal would not necessarily increase, on its own, the amount of taxable profit in the EU.  If we have US companies, they will still be able to allocate their profits to the various research and development, R&amp;amp;D, that takes place in the US, and rightly so.  The CCCTB would simply redistribute the profit to be taxed around the EU.  It would not necessarily change the amount of it.  In view of that, there might be an incentive for smaller countries not to be as strong on transfer pricing.  Why would Ireland or another small country engage in very aggressive transfer pricing when the benefits of that will be distributed, mainly to the larger countries in the EU?  There is a bit of mismatch of incentives there.<br\/><br\/>The CCCTB presents a significant threat for Ireland.  We clearly have had the impact of multinationals and we know that 80% of our corporation tax comes from multinationals but, equally, if domestic companies want to avail of a lower rate or a narrower base, they may opt into the system.  Given the large amount of Ireland's corporation tax that comes from exports from either domestic or foreign owned sectors, and we know that possibly the top ten companies that pay 40% are all likely to be huge exporters, it is not unduly pessimistic to say that Ireland could lose up to 50% of its current corporation tax base if the CCCTB was introduced and there are likely to be further knock-on consequences as companies react to the introduction of such a system.  At present as well as around &euro;3 billion of corporation tax, US companies pay &euro;6 billion of salary costs in Ireland, undertake an average of &euro;3 billion in fixed capital investment and buy around &euro;3 billion of goods and services from Irish suppliers.  That is a &euro;15 billion contribution to the Irish economy every year.<br\/><br\/>As has been outlined, there is no doubt that the system of taxing transnational companies has not kept pace with the modern economy and it is in need of reform.  However, it is hard to imagine any reform, even unilateral US tax reform, posing a greater threat to the huge gains from Ireland's most successful economic policy of attracting foreign direct investment than the proposed the CCCTB.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016121300002#E01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus Coffey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481639700,"counter":247,"content":"<p>I think we will leave it there.

It would be in everybody's interests if we consistently, properly and carefully implemented them in such a way that the rules were the same for everybody.  We have the tools, and many countries and companies argued about and debated this.  We need to let BEPS play out.  It is only starting to be implemented now.  It is only due for its first review in 2020, and many of the measures are specifically targeted at some of the concerns that have been raised.  Much work is being done on this.  The EU itself, in fairness, is being very careful in implementing many of these anti-avoidance measures.

When it comes to the international debate on tax avoidance, one of the most serious issues is the ability of companies to declare large profits in jurisdictions in which they simply have no substance.  This is definitely not the case in Ireland and clearly not in the EU as many of the companies have substance and operations here.  One of the key underpinnings of the measures and proposals at international level led by the OECD is to try to correct this issue of companies recording significant profits where they have no substance.  Some of the proposals regarding permanent establishment and reforms of transfer pricing go about addressing that, but the CCCTB proposal does not address it because it happens somewhere else.  It is going in the opposite direction to trying in a sense to amend and update the current system, which clearly has not taken pace with the change in the international economy.

There is a financial statement which shows either turnover, revenue or whatever else, and the Commission essentially takes those figures, looks at the output maybe from a certain sector and assigns that to a certain country.  In the case of Ireland, we know that the output or the turnover from pharmaceuticals, for example, is huge, but the sales are not happening here.  The Commission therefore makes no attempt to figure out where the sales are happening, applies the output on revenue figures and calculates their weights on the basis of that.  This will obviously show Ireland in a relatively positive light because the stuff is made here but is not sold here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016121300002#G01700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus Coffey"},{"type":"speech","time":1481639700,"counter":275,"content":"<p>Mr. Coffey refers specifically to the pharma sector and the &euro;15 billion impact it has on payroll, supply and so on.

Our information, from our experience as members of councils and reports from the Irish Planning Institute, is that the causes of delays in housing coming on stream have more to do with builders than anything else.  There is a huge amount of land being sat on, for which planning permissions have been granted.  Dublin City Council has seen figures that suggest there are 28,000 planning permissions, with thousands more in the pipeline.  Dublin is not the only location in which there is homelessness and a housing crisis, but it is a key location.  The conclusion is that developers are hoarding land.  the head of NAMA says the same thing, even about NAMA.  This issue came up at the housing committee and I hope the work done by it will count for something.<\/p><p>In one council area, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, there were no delays whatsoever.  Councillors believe delays are not caused at local council level, although a council may delay a project by four weeks or so.<\/p><p>The Minister presented the need for overturning many of the checks on developers at local council and community level as being vital, however, we have not seen the evidence presented.  Even the Irish Planning Institute has made that point, so it is not confined to people on the left.  We think it is vital that the Minister conduct an investigation within three months of the enactment of the Bill outlining the cause of delays and the percentage attributable to developers, landholders and the planning process and then present a report.  In this regard the tendering process is a key delay of local authority house building.  The local authorities are not going ahead with house building under this Government but when they do the obligation on them to tender out the contract to build is a cause of delay and acts as an impediment to houses coming on stream.<\/p><p> During the 1970s when between 8,000 and 9,000 houses were built a year to resolve the then housing crises, it was done by direct labour as the local authority councils had their own staff and would have employed a builder to do certain aspects.  The local authority process was much more ready to go.  We have a housing crisis and we should not be putting neoliberal obligations on local authorities that they must put the contract out to the private sector to build.  It was for those reasons that I tabled this amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12016121300002#C03500","speaker":"1254","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481638200,"counter":365,"content":"<p>I support amendment No. 3.  I do not want to repeat the arguments I made on the Second Stage debate, but at that point I had raised my concern that the evidence presented to members suggested there were alternative ways of shortening the length of time it would take for the 15 large planning applications that were cited on the spreadsheet to be processed.  There are on average 33 weeks spent of pre-planning and I questioned whether consideration was given to tightening up the statutory timeframe for pre-planning within the existing local authority decision framework.  Equally, it takes an average of 29 weeks for the local authority to make the decision in those 15 cases, and about half of that time has been as a direct result of the length of time it has taken the applicant to come back with the additional information requested.  When one removes that average ten weeks response time to requests for additional information, it brings it down to 19 weeks, which is the same time as a decision from An Bord Plean&aacute;la.<\/p> <p>  When looking at the average time of 19 weeks for a decision from An Bord Plean&aacute;la it is important to stress that what An Bord Plean&aacute;la does is much more narrowly focused and defined that what the local authority does, so one could argue that An Bord Plean&aacute;la having 19 weeks under the existing regime is too long.  While the Minister gave us evidence, I am not convinced the evidence as presented supports the overall objectives of this Chapter.  I will not repeat this argument at every section but I would like to know if consideration was given to rethinking the statutory framework for pre-planning, for shortening the time for additional information to be supplied by applicants, once they have applied, and for shortening the timeframe, and if necessary increasing the resources to An Bord Plean&aacute;la to tighten its timeframe.  If the Minister had taken those steps, he could by my calculations come up with a 25 week turnaround framework, without taking the power away from local authorities to make the primary planning decision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12016121300002#D00200","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1481638200,"counter":366,"content":"<p>The Irish Planning Institute makes the point that there is a myriad of guidelines that are confusing and that it makes it more difficult to make decisions.  It is almost a convenient way of blaming a cohort of society, namely the public who have an interest in the planning decision by virtue of living beside a development that is planned.  They appear to be the cohort that are being cut out, with very tenuous arguments being advanced for doing so.  There could be a very significant monetary price to be paid in later years by rushing decisions through An Bord Plean&aacute;la that otherwise would have been property scrutinised by the various sections of the local authority, such as the fire officer, the roads and sanitary services departments, all which have substantial levels of local information that is critical to making good decisions.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la will not be able to write the type of conditions that would be necessary to overcome difficulties that will present into the future.

There has been no proper analysis of how that arose, so therefore we cannot have a solution.

We do not think it is needed.  To be clear, much of what the Deputy is asking a report to do, is in train and is happening under pillar 3 of the existing strategy Rebuilding Ireland - An Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness.  We have the Dublin Housing Supply Co-ordination Task Force, which is a local infrastructure housing activation fund; the NTMA is financing a large-scale on-site infrastructure; while the planning reforms, as we are discussion today are putting in place a national planning framework and nine managing actions.  We are focusing on key sites and trying to force the issue on these sites and track what is going on and what is causing the delay in construction.  Efficient design and delivery methods to lower housing delivery costs are part of what we are trying to do as well, in both social and private housing.  There are measures to support construction innovation and skills, which is key, and we want a conversation around design and build as well.  <\/p> <p>  We had a discussion in the Seanad on whether the Bill is developer driven and also during the Second Stage debate in the D&aacute;il.  The Bill does not guarantee that planning applications are given a \"Yes\", but that there is a timeframe for a decision.  The decision can be a \"Yes\" or a \"No\".  I previously said that I think it strengthens the hands of some councils in the planning process.  This was analysed and three or four different reports on the Dublin Housing Supply Co-ordinatrion Task Force also fed into the analysis behind this as well.  <\/p> <p>  There are some serious delays in the planning process, not in all cases and not in all councils.  Deputies know that it takes up to two years in some cases to get a decision.  What the section is trying to do is encourage people, who might be of a mindset not to develop their land, to activate their plans to develop the site and deliver housing.  That is the motive for introducing a temporary change that will be reviewed in three years time.  It is a genuine attempt to inform people who have sites about a process that will given them a decision in six months or thereabouts.  It does not guarantee the applicant planning permission and applicants are rightly encouraged to engage in preplanning and consultation with the local authorities.  In response to Deputy &Oacute; Broin, it tightens up the timeframe for pre-planning and it is now down to 13 weeks in total.  We believe this amendment is unnecessary, because a lot of the work it proposes is ongoing and in any event, we discuss this most weeks during Question Time in the D&aacute;il.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12016121300002#D00500","speaker":"1264"},{"type":"speech","time":1481638200,"counter":369,"content":"<p>How can the Minister of State say it is not necessary to do an investigation into the cause of delays, when he is proposing-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12016121300002#D00600","speaker":"1254"},{"type":"speech","time":1481638200,"counter":370,"content":"<p>We have that analysis already<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12016121300002#D00700","speaker":"1264"},{"type":"speech","time":1481638200,"counter":371,"content":"<p>-----to rush a Bill through the Dail by Christmas?

We provided data for 15 planning applications and I accept that 83 weeks is far too long.  I read the breakdown or evidence provided by the Department's officials and three questions arose.  Did the Department consider shortening the pre-planning process through legislation?  If it did then the length of the delay would be dramatically reduced from 33 weeks to something shorter.  In the period where a formal planning application is made, did the Department consider shortening the length of time an applicant has to return information?  Again, the measure would shorten the delay.<\/p> <p>  My next question is on appeals made by An Bord Plean&aacute;la as its jobs differs from that of a local authority.  Did the Department consider shortening the length of time statutorily that An Bord Plean&aacute;la has to reply and, if necessary, will the Department provide additional resources?  The reason my three questions are vital is due to the concerns many of us have with Chapter 1 that are as follows.  The Minister said in his remarks that in some respect the provision could strengthen the hand of councils.  The provision takes the responsibility for making a planning decision away from the local authority.  The provision leaves the local authority with a consultative role but takes the decision away.  One of the consequences is that the role of the county or city development plan in the planning process is changed because local authority planning departments must adhere more rigidly to the text of the county or city development plan than An Bord Plean&aacute;la does, which only has to have regard for same.  <\/p> <p>  The provision also removes the right to appeal, which is significant.  I am not criticising the staff of An Bord Plean&aacute;la by saying the following.  Let us assume that the process could be available to more than ten local authorities.  The Department then expects the staff of An Bord Plean&aacute;la to have the same level of detailed knowledge of the city and county development plans, the local authority policies, the context and the local domain on the ground as the consequent officials in countless local authorities.  I have no difficulty with shortening the timesframe but I am concerned for the four reasons I have outlined that other ways to shorten it could have been considered.  I look forward to hearing the response of the Minister of State to my questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12016121300002#E00400","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1481638200,"counter":376,"content":"<p>I agree with some of the points made by Deputy &Oacute; Broin and his questions.  One usually only gets public interaction when there is a large scale development of 100 houses or more.  This is a particular category that draws public comment but the opportunity for meaningful public interaction has been cut out.<\/p> <p>  A developer has six months to respond to a request for additional information.  The delay is down to the developer.  There are 83 weeks but a developer might take 26 or 20 weeks to respond.  One can hardly blame the planning process if a developer has not responded in a timely framework.<\/p> <p>  This legislation should not be called a planning Bill as it is a development Bill because it cuts out the type of details that allows a local authority subsequently to ensure an application complies with planning permission.  Very often local authorities find it difficult to interpret the conditions stipulated by An Bord Plean&aacute;la that were not originally written by local authorities but are then adopted and lead to a favourable decision being made in response to an appeal.<\/p> <p>  Has a risk analysis assessment been carried out on what can go wrong with the decision-making process for planning permission?  Has a risk analysis been carried out on the kind of problems that will be picked up by the public purse later where there has been inadequate scrutiny at the planning stage?  It is at the planning stage that scrutiny is needed.  Planning decisions must have a local input and be properly interpreted by local authorities.  Has a risk analysis assessment been carried out?

I did not mean to skip the questions posed by Deputy &Oacute; Broin.  I believe the reason that I did not answer them is because I asked the same questions at the start of the process and so did the officials of the Department.  We went through the logic of shortening each process as part of the overall process.  Our consideration still did not do away with the risk.  It was easier to have a one stage process that guarantees a timeframe.  We considered all of the options.  It was the first question in my head and was not a case of me avoiding answering the Deputy's questions.  We analysed what was the best way to achieve greater certainty in terms of activating sites and moving them along.  We also wanted to encourage people who probably do not want to rush the development of their sites.  We want to convey to them that this is a process that will move planning quicker and the Department will work with developers.  The aim of the provision is to shorten the time it takes to activate sites and provide a guaranteed timeframe.  We considered all of the options but chose what we thought was the best option.  I accept that people have different opinions.  We have done our homework and chosen the best way to proceed.<\/p> <p>  I assure Deputy Coppinger that the Government is not rushing this legislation through the D&aacute;il.  Months ago we said that we wanted to deal with the legislation this week and there is any length of hours available to do so.  About a month ago we debated it in the Seanad for two or three weeks.  The legislation was not dreamed up yesterday and has been well discussed.  I do not want her to think that we are rushing through the legislation.  We are here all day tonight, all day tomorrow, Thursday, Friday or whatever time it takes to tease out matters.  It is desirable to get the legislation through.  It is important that we do so for the people, not just from a planning context but from a rental point of view as well.  The Deputy seems to think that a couple months of a process is rushing but I do not share her opinion.  It is not a reason to table an amendment and I cannot accept her amendment.  <\/p> <p>  Deputy Coppinger has outlined in her amendment certain work that she wants completed.  We have done the work as part of the action plan and publish quarterly reviews.  The reviews are honest and everything is open to scrutiny.  The reviews are published on a website and we can tease through them.  This committee has a role to track the reviews of the action plan.  I was involved in the process that led to the Action Plan for Jobs.  Every couple of months the plan was scrutinised by the relevant committee, the media and the D&aacute;il.  The process worked and the same process will work to deliver housing.  All of the Deputy's concerns are in the action plan.  We share her concerns and want to drive construction.  We will analyse the measures.  To provide that we have to bring back the report is therefore an unnecessary amendment.<\/p> <p>   I wish to assure Deputy Murphy that we are discussing a planning and development Bill following consultation.  There is no reason for inadequate scrutiny and planning decisions because there are plenty of opportunities for scrutiny, overview and input at all of the Stages of this legislation.  I do not share the Deputy's view.  I believe that the planning system has gotten better having been a councillor who was involved in planning and because I have a great interest in planning.  If people do their jobs properly then poor decisions will not happen.  The change in timelines and guaranteeing a decision should not affect scrutiny in any shape or form.

I am sure the Minister of State is aware of that.<\/p> <p>  I am very concerned about the variations in approach to planning in some local authorities.  As specific identified people in An Bord Plean&aacute;la deal with the planning applications from particular counties, they have the knowledge of the development plan.

His first question asked if An Bord Plean&aacute;la is bound to a development plan.  As it stands, it is not.  It needs to take it on board along with all the other national policies.  That is because the development plans do not always reflect national policy or national guidelines.  As that sometimes can be a negative, the board is not bound by it.  In the past, lands were zoned despite being in a flood plain.  If An Bord Plean&aacute;la were bound by that, I would have difficulty with it, as would other Departments.

The existing text already provides that a person who has an interest in the land may be a prospective applicant for the purposes of this chapter of the Bill.  The amendment will bring the provisions as regards entitlement to apply for planning permissions for strategic housing developments broadly in line with those for planning applications generally.

In essence, there are two aspects of the proposed changes to the definition of a strategic housing development.  The first is the necessity to remove a possible interpretation that the existing definition requires that, in order to qualify as a strategic housing development, a large housing or student accommodation development must include a mixture of other uses that are permissible under the zoning for the land.  The revised definition clarifies that a large housing or student accommodation development may include a mixture of others such as still qualify as strategic housing development for the purposes of the Bill.<\/p><p>The second aspect relates to the extent for uses to be permitted in a strategic housing development.  Under the proposed revised definition the amount of other uses that can be permitted will increase according to the overall size of the development, with a dual limit on the amount of other uses of not more than 15% of the total gross floor area of the development and not more than 4,500 sq m.  <\/p><p>It is also proposed to enable the Minister to prescribe alternative area measurements to those specified in the revised definition in order to enable the area required to be refined in light of experience with the first developments to progress under the new approval arrangement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12016121300002#H00200","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1481638200,"counter":409,"content":"<p>My amendment No. 5 is probably rendered obsolete by amendment No. 7, but I would like the Minister and his officials to clarify that.

In fact, this legislation could lead to huge problems in future.  In my experience, local planners work in a borough for an extended period and are familiar with developments.  They are also familiar with developers, including those who have not completed work on other developments.  They are able to put requests for additional information based on that knowledge.  That will be completely removed now, however, and it will go to An Bord Plean&aacute;la which is divorced from local communities and is at a much higher level.  This section is not justified and no objective evidence has been presented by the Government that it is needed.

I spend quite a lot of time travelling to different parts of the country to speak to councils on this issue and many others.  To be clear, we are not bypassing local authorities . The process will be that a developer who wants to develop more than 100 houses, or more than 200 student accommodation units, will have an informal consultation with local authorities for a two or three-week period before the formal statutory pre-planning consultation begins . However, during that nine week statutory period there is a requirement for management and planning authorities to brief councillors.  We actually made amendments in the Seanad to respond to concerns Senators had to ensure that councillors were involved in that process.  At the end of the nine week process the views of councillors can be reflected in the manager's report.  Local authorities can then make a recommendation on whether or not they think an application should be granted.  They can also make recommendations on conditions that should or should not go with that planning application.<\/p><p>An Bord Plean&aacute;la will be involved with the local authority in that statutory nine week period to make sure it understands the intricacies of some of the local issues.  There is a serious statutory process underway for a formal pre-planning consultation which is not there at the moment.  It is a very informal process at the moment, with no timelines.  In effect, there is a very serious look at the planning application and there is a recommendation made at the end of it.  It is not a formal planning decision, it is a recommendation by the local authority.  The planning application then goes on to An Bord Plean&aacute;la for the 16 week assessment which includes taking account of the recommendation.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la then makes a decision.<\/p><p> There is an idea that the process is by-passing local authorities but that is not the way it is going to work.  We have changed the language, through amendment, to reinforce the point that even though councillors do not make planning decisions they certainly have a right to know the detail of what is going on and they have a right to make comment on it.  Planners at local government level will be able to put a detailed report together which will then get full consideration when An Bord Plean&aacute;la gets the formal planning application.  We have spent a long time with An Bord Plean&aacute;la to make sure it will be properly resourced to do that through a new specific housing unit within An Bord Plean&aacute;la that has been set up for this purpose.  It is a robust process that will have learnt lessons from the past and will make sound planning decisions.  It will have much more predictability, to use a term from today, in getting a decision within a certain timeline.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12016121300002#H02300","speaker":"1286","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481638200,"counter":431,"content":"<p>Two further speakers have indicated to speak but the committee must vacate the room until 5.30 p.m.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12016121300002#J00200","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1481638200,"counter":432,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 3.35 p.m. and resumed at 5.35 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"speech","time":1481638200,"counter":433,"content":"<p>The committee resumes its consideration of the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Bill 2016 - Committee Stage.

This is a monumental error.  It is the kind of stuff we would expect to be written by the Construction Industry Federation.  This is more to do with development - or a hope of development - rather than planning.  With a really robust planning system one anticipates problems.  A lot of very good stuff happens but I do not disagree with the point made by Deputy O'Dowd that bad decisions have been made in the past.  There has, however, been a change.  For example, the regional authority of Dublin and the mid-east regional authority have met in joint session for several years.  I have found that there is a substantial difference in the tone of debates around county development plans and that they are much more strategic.  That change will be undermined by virtue of the fact that the work they do could now be set aside.<\/p> <p>  My second point concerns the degree of public trust.  People understand the current system of a site notice going up.  Now there may or may not be a site notice and if there is a site notice it is going to be a guideline.  Currently, a site notice requires that a council official visits the site to make sure the notice is in place so the public will be alerted to the fact that a decision on development is to be made and then the public can then go onto the council's website.  This will not happen in this case as the application will not be on the council's website; it will be hosted on An Bord Plean&aacute;la's website in the same way as a strategic infrastructure project would be.  Essentially the public is going to be very badly caught out with this measure and certainly do not appear to have been considered as a central player in the process.  I have seen very many planning applications because I am in an area of large scale development and County Kildare's population has quadrupled in the past four decades.  We are well used to planning issues.  We are well used to looking at the terms for additional information and to seeing the kind of positive engagement that can happen between the local authority, the developers and the community, where they make objections.  That process is all gone with this measure.  We are losing certainty in relation to a culture that has been long developing around the regional authorities and the county development plan.  We are going to lose the trust of communities and the certainty about how the planning process will happen.  The Minister may get a pile of planning permissions but whether houses follow will be another matter.  I can point the Minister to high demand regions in my own area with land zoned for development and with planning permissions yet there has not been development.  I know this is also the case in Dublin.  This particular section of the Bill is really offensive and the Aarhus Convention provides for the public to be consulted on planning matters.  The reality is that the public is not being consulted on planning matters in any meaningful way.  This issue was raised at the regional authority of Dublin and the mid-east regional authority  session recently and there was absolute uproar.  They issued a joint statement, which is almost unheard of.  This planning system is the same planning system that is used by all local authorities.  It only provides for decisions to be logged and tracked that are decisions of that planning authority.  That is normally where the public will go looking for information.  That information will not be there.<\/p><p>There may be a site notice.  There will be uncertainty about ways to allow public engagement.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12016121300002#AA00300","speaker":"1226","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481638200,"counter":436,"content":"<p>There is a site notice and there is no ambiguity about that aspect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12016121300002#BB00200","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1481638200,"counter":437,"content":"<p>It is by way of guideline.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12016121300002#BB00300","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1481638200,"counter":438,"content":"<p>It is by way of regulations.

I have studied the minutes of meetings and discovered instances where officials were over-ruled by councillors, shopping centres appeared in areas that they were not supposed to be, houses were built on flood plains and the most appalling, and in my view, disgraceful planning took place.  Notwithstanding the views of members, this was clearly stated on the record of the council officials.  I believe there should be a planning checklist and it is up to the Minister to decide whether he wants to legislate for same.  Notwithstanding the fact that this matter will not go to a local authority in this case, there should be a checklist to ensure connectivity within the existing communities.  I believe there should be an assessment of the educational needs of the area concerned and footpaths, lighting and other issues should be connected.  If that does not happen then housing estates will be badly supported in terms of services available and there will be issues with shopping.  I accept and acknowledge that we are talking about housing today.  The Minister must ensure that there is social infrastructure, particularly community buildings and health centres, which are missing from many housing estates.<\/p> <p>  The Minister mentioned housing estates consisting of 100 houses.  What happens if a person applies for planning permission to build a significant number of houses, multiple applications or concurrent applications?  In such instances we need to ensure that all aspects of the community are connected.  It is critical that each development has open spaces for recreation and sports that are open to the public.  All of these issues were lost sight of in previous planning histories that I have examined.  I am in favour of this section of the Bill given the current housing crisis.  I hope that my view will not amount simply to nice words that one hears at a meeting from the likes of me but can be followed through in order to avoid the hassles of previous years.<\/p> <p>  I am old enough to remember a building scheme that was built by a company called MFN.  The company was nicknamed money for nothing because it built houses without exterior walls and chimneys.  It also built in part of the estate that had no access to a road and, therefore, bins could not be collected.  In the past some crazy planning applications were successful.  We also experienced what is called Walt Disney houses where one could look out one's front door and straight into the parlour of the house next door.  There was no privacy.  We need to ensure that the quality of the planning and standards are up to scratch.  All of these issues should be vigorously tested at the planning stage. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12016121300002#BB00600","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speech","time":1481638200,"counter":441,"content":"<p>I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12016121300002#BB00700","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1481638200,"counter":442,"content":"<p>Is the Chairman referring to me?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12016121300002#BB00800","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speech","time":1481638200,"counter":443,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12016121300002#BB00900","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1481638200,"counter":444,"content":"<p>If the Chairman is referring to me then I ask her to please tell me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12016121300002#BB01000","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speech","time":1481638200,"counter":445,"content":"<p>No, I am just reminding members of the practice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12016121300002#BB01100","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1481638200,"counter":446,"content":"<p>What I have said is absolutely true.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12016121300002#BB01200","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speech","time":1481638200,"counter":447,"content":"<p>I do not doubt the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12016121300002#BB01300","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1481638200,"counter":448,"content":"<p>Any reference I made was to minuted meetings-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12016121300002#BB01400","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speech","time":1481638200,"counter":449,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12016121300002#BB01500","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1481638200,"counter":450,"content":"<p>-----which are on the website of Meath County Council.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12016121300002#BB01600","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speech","time":1481638200,"counter":451,"content":"<p>I do not doubt the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12016121300002#BB01700","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1481638200,"counter":452,"content":"<p>All the names and actions of the councillors are available for everybody to read.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12016121300002#BB01800","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speech","time":1481638200,"counter":453,"content":"<p>I suggest we forget the politics of this matter for a moment.

The vast majority of proposals on this scale go to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The board nearly always does so but it is not required to be consistent with existing zoning.  In this legislation, An Bord Plean&aacute;la can only make a decision on lands that are zoned accordingly in terms of consistency with the development plan and so on.<\/p> <p>  I will respond to the idea that local authorities do not have a role.  As I said earlier, they have a nine week statutory consultation process where the local authority plays a central role in virtually everything.  The planning authority must put its opinion in writing before submitting it to An Bord Plean&aacute;la which, in turn, gives it consideration in respect of proper planning and the sustainable development of the area concerned.  An  Bord Plean&aacute;la must bear in mind the local area plan and all of the other things on which councillors have made decisions.  <\/p> <p>  I agree with Deputy O'Dowd and others that there were terrible zoning and planning decisions made in the past. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12016121300002#BB01900","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1481638200,"counter":454,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12016121300002#BB02000","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speech","time":1481638200,"counter":455,"content":"<p>Not that many of them came through An Bord Plean&aacute;la, but I suspect that some of them have done so.  From my experience, with some exceptions, the public has a lot of faith in An Bord Plean&aacute;la to make fair, balanced and responsible decisions.  The legislation refers to a small segment of developments.  In County Galway there has been one application for a housing estate in the past seven years and in County Tipperary there has not been a single application for a housing estate in the past seven years.  In this section we have tried to reassure developers and investors that we will have a streamlined and predictable planning system in terms of timelines but not in terms of outcomes.  The process will now be more onerous for developers.  It means that if a developer does not submit a professional application that is consistent with the local area plans then his or her application will be thrown out at the formal statutory pre-planning stage.<\/p> <p>  We have tried to ensure that there is a process.  We have spent a lot of time talking to An Bord Plean&aacute;la about ensuring there is one.  We have made changes in the Seanad that were brought forward by non-Fine Gael Members in order to ensure that the core concerns of councillors were responded to and addressed.  Members should vote whatever way they see fit.  My Department and I have made a big effort to ensure that nobody is bypassed in the legislation.  We know from the applications that have come through the system for big planning applications this year that it has taken, on average, between 78 and 80 weeks from start to finish.  Our aim is for the process to be completed in 25 to 30 weeks.  The shorter time would make a huge difference in the amount of funding available for many of these projects.  Let us not forget that housing supply is the core problem.  I would not be working on this legislation if we did not have a crisis in many sectors of the country where we simply have not seen the kind of development that needs to come forward.<\/p> <p>  I wish to make a final point on the concerns expressed by Deputy O'Dowd.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin has tabled amendment No. 24.<\/p><p>We are looking at that to see if we can accept it, or a version of it, between now and Report Stage with a view to dealing with some of those issues.  This is not about building houses but building communities.  This involves everything from houses to schools to open spaces, with mixed tenure developments and a series of other things linked to local area plans on which councillors decide.  They never decided on planning applications but they do decide on rezoning and on development plans and these will essentially design the applications. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12016121300002#BB02100","speaker":"1286","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481638200,"counter":457,"content":"<p>In the last session the Minister talked about not bypassing local authorities.  The problem is that the role of local authorities is being diminished by this legislation, though the role of elected members is not being diminished because they do not, as the Minister said, have a direct role.  The local authority will no longer be the primary body responsible for taking the decision.  The Minister was not present when I made this point to the Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy English, earlier today so I am repeating it now.  The strength of a county development plan, which is not about zonings but SLOs and other policy elements, will be diminished because An Bord Plean&aacute;la has a different statutory relationship to the city and county development plans from that of the local authority planners.  He is correct to say he is not bypassing councillors but he is not correct to say he is not diminishing the role of local authorities and the city and county development plans.<\/p> <p>  The Minister said there had not been a single application for an estate in Galway but the primary reason for this in the past number of years has been the lack of credit and the insolvency of many developers.  The Rebuilding Ireland plan, however, seeks to achieve 25,000 units per year, every year for a set number of years and consequently there will be an increase in large applications.  I do not believe the Minister has deliberately designed this to have negative consequences but, in his rush to solve the problem of lengthy planning applications, there will be a whole series of unintended consequences, which will lead to much more negative planning outcomes at a later stage.  I did not hear anything from the Minister today or on Second Stage to allay my concerns.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12016121300002#CC00200","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1481638200,"counter":458,"content":"<p>There is a big difference between influence and power and the power is where the decision is made.  County councils will not be making the decisions on these planning applications and An Bord Plean&aacute;la will now make them.  A court-based process like a judicial review is not an appeal process because it does not deal with substance but with technical arrangements around which the decisions are made.  There is no real appeals process.  A substantial number of the decisions made by An Bord Plean&aacute;la overrule a recommendation of the report of the inspector, who tends to be a planner looking at the totality of the issues.  I completely accept the need to build communities and to have mixtures of tenure and size etc. in larger developments.  There has to be an interventionist approach to deliver that outcome, rather than just a market-led approach.  There also has to be certainty within the planning process because that is a driver of costs.  There are other ways of reducing the timeline than bypassing local authorities.  For example, a local area plan is going through my own area at the moment with large-scale development proposed.  It is proposed to zone the land and then include a master plan as a requirement.  It will be open to An Bord Plean&aacute;la to take a different view on the need for a master plan for a housing development where 2,000 houses are planned in one location and significant risks are associated with that.<\/p><p>Section 9(13) states &quot;Where the Board fails to make a decision within the period referred to in <i>paragraph (a)<\/i>, it shall pay the appropriate sum to the applicant.&quot;  The sum referred to is a large amount of money.

I am not sure, however, that this proposal will achieve any great speed.  The Minister quotes figures for how long it takes but a lot of that is around the preplanning stage and some councils have more efficient preplanning meetings than others, for example, bringing in different sections of the council.  This proposal bypasses local areas - though not local democracy as councillors have no role in these decisions.

We felt that, if we were going to provide for them, there had to be a consequence if the statutory periods were not delivered upon.  The truth is that my Department will probably be funding the fine, but the fact that it is being paid at all is what will ensure compliance.  Having spoken at length with An Bord Plean&aacute;la, I am confident that it can deliver.  I do not think the fine will ever be triggered because I think the board will ensure that it will not happen.<\/p> <p>  This was about ensuring that there was a consequence for not delivering on the statutory requirement in the legislation.  It would be a farce if the law provided that a decision was to be made within 16 weeks but it took 20 weeks and we could do nothing about it.  We had to provide for some consequence where a decision is not made within the timeframe set in the legislation.  No one in An Bord Plean&aacute;la will personally be out of pocket.  However, although it does not like it, the organisation recognises that there will be a consequence if it does not deliver.  The consequence will be that the applicant will get a payment because the State has not delivered on its side of the bargain, as provided for in law.<\/p> <p>  On the involvement of councillors and the public, the fees for planning objections in this situation will not be higher.  This is not the same as the process provided for in the Strategic Infrastructure Act.  If it was, we would have simply extended that legislation.  This is different.  The pre-planning consultation process is much more formal and involves the local authority in a meaningful way.  It will result in a report, which will be like a planning report.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la will also have been involved in the pre-planning process so that it understands the local issues, consistency with the local area plan and some of the quirky local issues that sometimes must form part of planning considerations.<\/p> <p>  Whether councillors should have to pay a fee to make an observation or an objection was raised in the Seanad.  We have indicated that we will examine the matter in the context of the broader planning Act that will come through the Houses next year.

We will examine and debate the issue when the legislation is coming through.  However, there will no increased cost for a member of the public to make an objection or an observation.

In terms of the public's ability to make a submission and its access to information in advance of An Bord Plean&aacute;la having an on-line information system, which will not be in place until the middle of next summer, local authorities will be asked to ensure that information linked to planning applications is made available to the public.

There already exists a provision under section 144(1A)(<i>b<\/i>) of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, for the board to determine fees for an application for any strategic infrastructure development, and this amendment extends that provision to strategic housing development applications.  Of course, it should be remembered this is not a money-making exercise on behalf of An Bord Plean&aacute;la, rather it is a concerted effort to ameliorate the current housing emergency throughout the country.  Therefore, any fees charges under this provision will be subject, as is currently the case, to ministerial approval, and in this context I would expect the fees charges by the board to be commensurate with the work undertaken in progressing applications strategic housing developments.<\/p><p>Amendments Nos. 11 and 12 are similar to amendments previously tabled in the Seanad.  These amendments effectively propose that a developer who has not commenced building on foot of a planning permission for more than 100 housing units on one site, be it in the same local authority area or in an adjoining local authority area, should be prevented from seeking planning permission for a strategic housing development on another site.  As we indicated in the Seanad deliberations, there may be a number of valid reasons and circumstances why a developer may not have commenced work on a housing scheme for which planning permission has previously been granted.  Such reasons could include poor market conditions, changing demand for housing in the area concerned, changed demand for particular house types or delays in the provision of infrastructure.  It is also often the case that large-scale developers will have a number of projects in the pipeline at various stages of development.  In addition, a developer may have a number of projects for which planning permission has been secured but that may be scheduled for development at sequential times.  In effect, the planning system should be sufficiently flexible to take account of these different types of scenarios while still ensuring that necessary large-scale housing developments can be brought forward in the right locations where people most urgently need them having regard to market conditions.<\/p><p>In this regard, following the Seanad discussions I tabled an amendment which is now incorporated in the latest text, which provides that an extension of duration of permission in respect of strategic housing developments will only be possible where substantial works on a development have been carried out during the original planning permission period.  This type of approach is much more effective in my view and will have the positive effect of incentivising developers to act on planning permissions and not to sit on, and hoard, the sites in question.  This approach provides a better overall balance, contrary to the approach in these particular amendments which, as I have indicated, are aimed at preventing planning applications from being made in the first instance.

Poor market conditions would affect my existing planning permission as it would new one.  If there is a change in the type of units required, an amendment can be made to an existing application, which would be quicker than a strategic planning application.  I find it hard to understand why, if the purpose of this is to assist developers to get planning applications more quickly than the current 88 week process, if someone has a planning application of that size in that local authority area would we even entertain them while they were not actually actively building.  I cannot understand the opposition to these amendments.<\/p> <p>  Amendments Nos. 13 to 15, inclusive, relate to the review that would be conducted from 2019.  With these amendments what we are trying to ensure that not only would the Minister have to lay before the D&aacute;il a review report, but there would be some level of public consultation on the outcome of the review, there would be full disclosure of all of the documentation in this regard and, before any of this could be extended, there would have to be a decision of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The amendments would have no material impact on the stated intention of the Bill, which is to fast-track large planning applications between now and 2019.  I am quite hopeful the Minister of State will be willing to accept amendments Nos. 13 to 15, inclusive, as they stand, or consider looking at them to bring them back on Report Stage.<\/p><p>It is about introducing greater public involvement in that review process and greater involvement of the Oireachtas in any decision to renew this set of proposals if such a thing arises.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12016121300002#EE01700","speaker":"1215","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481638200,"counter":482,"content":"<p>In respect of a site not being used, there are different reasons why a site might be brought forward.

There is a process to pick the sites and, hopefully, there will be a good return of housing on those sites as well.<\/p> <p>  Matters relating to amendments Nos. 13 and 15 were discussed in the Seanad.  There was already much discussion on these extension provisions in the Seanad deliberations which resulted in the insertion of an explicit review mechanism before any extension period could be activated.  However, I would add that it was inherent in the provisions in the Bill as originally published that coming to the end of the initial three-year period, the operation of the fast-track procedures would be reviewed.  We always had that intention but we have strengthened that.   <\/p> <p>  The three amendments tabled propose that any review of the provisions shall include a four-week public consultation phase, shall require the inclusion of a summary of the public consultation in the report laid by the Minister of the day before both Houses of the Oireachtas, and that before an order can be signed by the Minister extending the provisions beyond the end of 2019, the order must be approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas but not before a further public consultation exercise is conducted, this time on the report provided by the Minister.  It is a double whammy and is too long.  I made it very clear in the Seanad, and I am conscious that members were not there, so I will say again that through the action plan for housing and the various actions, the Department is constantly reviewing and engaging with stakeholders.  I said previously that Departments carry out reviews quite well.  This is what we will do and it will be discussed in this committee, the D&aacute;il and the Seanad.  It is not a case of trying to hide any success or failure of the scheme.  It is an open book so we think it is an unnecessary amendment.  Having been through the other action plan process, I can say that the committee has a major role in the scrutiny of all the actions.  That will serve the purpose of the action plan for housing quite well.  The Department and I do not think we need to table this amendment and I hope the committee understands why. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12016121300002#FF00400","speaker":"1264"},{"type":"speech","time":1481638200,"counter":485,"content":"<p>The only person being discriminated against is somebody who already has a permission in that area.

Rather, it is implemented at EU level by a number of EU directives, namely, the Directive 2003\/35\/EC which deals with public participation and access to justice in certain environmental matters and Directive 2011\/92\/EU on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment and commonly referred to as the environmental impact assessment EIA directive.  These directives have been transposed into Irish legislation and are fully reflected in the planning code.  The requirements and principles of the above mentioned EU directives are already fully reflected in the planning code.  It is fair to say that is not going to change with this Bill going through.<\/p> <p>  Amendments Nos. 17, 114, 115, 121, 125, 126 and 127 from Deputy &Oacute; Broin propose to amend sections 4 and 22 to provide that an application for an extension of duration of a planning permission will be treated as a new application for permission, involving environmental impact assessment and appropriate assessment in particular cases, full public participation, a right of refusal even where all statutory requirements are met, appeal to the board and extensive revision of existing conditions and the addition of new conditions.  I oppose these amendments as they would completely negate the purpose of extensions of duration, which is to allow extra time for existing permissions, the building out of which has been prevented or slowed down by unforeseen circumstances, to be carried out or completed in accordance with the terms of the original permission.  The Deputy's proposal could create a situation where a site with planning permission granted for 200 houses, and with substantial movement on the site with maybe 150 houses completed, may need to go back through all of this process for the last 50 houses.  It seems a little unnecessary when we are trying to bring the supply of housing up and to finish it out.  We have taken amendments already and there has to be substantial work on the site and major progress.  If these amendments were accepted that is what could happen and the development would need to go through all the process with the associated delays.  We believe it is excessive with regard to that aspect also.<\/p> <p>  Similarly, I oppose amendment No. 118 from Deputy Murphy, which on the face of it appears to apply to all types of development and not just housing development.  Planning permissions for development do not specify the phases in which development must be carried out and do not provide that the authority will take each phase in charge according as it is completed.  I do not believe that requirements of this nature, proposed in this amendment, are reasonable conditions to attach to extensions of duration of permissions.  The proposed requirement that all work is completed within five years would appear to preclude a developer who does not finish the approved work within the extended period from applying for a new planning permission to complete the development..<\/p> <p>  The amendment also proposes that the term of any bond or security that is conditioned under the original permission would be extended as part of the extension of duration of the permission.  The terms of any such bond or security are set out in agreements negotiated between developers and financial institutions without any direct involvement by planning authorities and I do not think any statutory provision can automatically change the terms of such agreements.  There are, however, a number of Government amendments in this grouping I propose to move, a number of which are of a technical drafting nature.  These are amendments Nos. 119, 120, 123 and 124.  Amendment No. 119 is in essence a technical amendment, correcting a reference in the Bill.  Subsection (4) of section 42 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, currently provides that a decision to extend the appropriate period of a planning permission shall be made once and once only under this section.  As subsection (1A) now proposed to be inserted into section 42 provides for a second extension of the appropriate period of a planning permission for a certain class of development, the &ldquo;notwithstanding&rdquo; provision of subsection (1A) must apply to subsection (4) of section 42, as well as subsection (1) of that section.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12016121300002#GG00500","speaker":"1264"},{"type":"speech","time":1481638200,"counter":527,"content":"<p>I did not refer to amendment No. 118.  It was not clear that this was being taken here, but the Minister of State has responded to it.  My intention with the amendment was around the provisions of Section 180 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 which covers the taking in charge of housing estates.  It says that where the local authority has not taken an estate in charge seven years after the planning permission has expired, the residents of the housing estate can petition to have the estate taken in charge.  That is a five year planning permission and a seven year duration after.  That is 12 years.  With the proposed extension of duration another seven years is added to that 12 years and the possibility of a further extension in certain circumstances.  The problem is that I can point the Minister of State to a small number of locations where people are living on a permanent building site.  The purpose of my amendment is to provide for a requirement for the developer to at least phase the development and have it taken in charge.  I know a place where the development is 15 years old and it does not even have street lights.  That is totally unfair.  It is an effort to look at it from the point of view of the people who are living in this area and existing on the site.  It is the developer's site and it is far too long to permit a situation where the people cannot even petition to have the estate taken in charge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12016121300002#GG00600","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1481638200,"counter":528,"content":"<p>I may have misheard the Minister of State, did he say that the Aarhus Convention does not have direct application to the member states?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12016121300002#GG00700","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1481638200,"counter":529,"content":"<p>It is done through a directive.

It further provides that before making a request to the board to enter into pre-application consultations in relation to a proposed development, the developer shall have held initial consultations with the relevant local authority regarding the proposed development in accordance with section 247 of the Planning and Development Act.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 22 in the name of Deputy &Oacute; Broin would have the effect of requiring a developer to submit specified detailed documentation to a planning authority when seeking an initial consultation on a proposed development when the plans for the development may only be at an early stage.  The amendment would also require the planning authority to notify the public of the proposed development and to make the documentation submitted with the request for an initial consultation available for inspection on the Internet.  The amendment further proposes that the Minister may make regulations on further specifying the requirements to be met regarding such initial consultations. <\/p><p>As I have indicated, the primary purpose of the initial consultation meeting between the developer and the planning authority is to assist and advise the developer with regard to the further development of his or her proposals when they are an early stage.  It is only when the developer has further progressed his or her plans for a proposed housing development on foot of the initial consultation with the planning authority that he or she will be in a position to submit the detailed documentation required for the purpose of the pre-application consultations with the board.  In effect, the requirements that would be imposed by amendment No. 22 go beyond the intention of the initial consultations between a developer and the local planning authority and consequently I must oppose it.<b><\/b><\/p><p>Amendment No. 24 is in the name of Deputy &Oacute; Broin.  Section 5(4) of the Bill outlines the documentation that a developer must submit to the board when making a request for a pre-application consultation on a proposed development &ndash; the name and address of applicant, a site location map, a brief description of the nature and purpose of the development, a draft layout plan of the proposal including house types, density, vehicular access etc., as well as details of the initial consultations on the proposed development with the local planning authority.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin&rsquo;s amendment proposes to require the submission of additional detailed documentation to the board with a request for pre-application consultations on a proposed development, that is, details on the availability of public transport to service the proposed development, as well as details on a range of other infrastructure and services including cr&egrave;ches, hospitals, shopping and other services to support the development.<\/p><p>In this regard, a developer - at the stage when devising his or her proposals for a proposed development - will not have details of many of the services to support the development when it is eventually completed.  Some of these services - for instance bus transport services, cr&egrave;ches, shopping etc. - may only start to be planned simultaneously to the granting of permission for, and construction of, a development.  It is considered premature and overly prescriptive to require details of many of the services to support a proposed development as are outlined in amendment No. 24 and accordingly I must oppose it on grounds of practicality.  However I am open to certain aspects of the amendment, specifically the introduction of some requirement for the consideration of public transport provision in the decision-making process on applications for strategic housing developments.  The provision of public transport, particularly rail links, at the early stages of the Adamstown strategic development zone was particularly successful and I would like to see more of this forward planning in respect of the provision of public transport links in the future. <\/p><p>Again, the local authorities will raise it at their planning discussions with An Bord Plean&aacute;la as well.<\/p><p>Accordingly, we will give a commitment to Deputy &Oacute; Broin that this matter will be further examined by my officials and if we are unable to bring forward an amendment in this regard in the current Bill due to the time constraints, we will make every effort to include provision along these lines in the other planning Bill before the Oireachtas at present.  The Government agrees with some, but not all of what the Deputy has proposed, if that is all right in terms of process.<\/p><p>The aforementioned other planning Bill, namely, the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2016 contains enabling provision for the introduction of arrangements relating to e-planning or electronic planning, the online submission of planning applications and appeals.<\/p><p>The wording of the provisions that are the subject of amendments Nos.<b><\/b>25 to 28, inclusive, as tabled by Deputy &Oacute; Broin have been framed in this context.  Once the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2016 is enacted - which we hope will happen in early 2017 - the detailed provisions concerning all matters relating to the submission of electronic copies of documents to planning authorities , including An Bord Plean&aacute;la, will be provided for in regulations made under that Act.<\/p><p>Accordingly, we must oppose amendments Nos. 25 to 28, inclusive, as they are premature.  The substance of the amendments will in any event be addressed and clarified in regulations to be made subsequently to the other planning Bill which is now on Second Stage in the D&aacute;il.  We will consult the Deputy to ensure he is satisfied with the proposed wording.<\/p><p>I am also opposing Amendment No. 32<b><\/b>as the additional wording proposed to be inserted in Section 5(7)(h) making specific reference to protected species is already broadly covered by the existing provisions referring to &ldquo;any aspect of the proposed development likely to have significant effects on the environment&rdquo; and therefore it is an unnecessary amendment.<\/p><p>At this stage I wish to discuss Government amendments Nos. 29 to 31, inclusive.  These amendments relate to the provisions of section 5 of the Bill, which set out the requirements for a prospective applicant for a strategic housing development to undertake in consulting with An Bord Plean&aacute;la to ensure that as complete an application as possible can be submitted to the board.<\/p><p>Section 5(7) of the Bill provides for regulations to be made which would set out matters to be included in a submission to the board by a prospective applicant for a consultation. <b><\/b>Amendment No. 29 is required because all the matters listed in section 5(7) of the Bill as ones that may be the subject of regulations under legislation relate to housing developments and there is no reference to student accommodation, which is also defined under section 3 of the Bill to come within the definition of &ldquo;strategic housing development&rdquo;. <\/p><p>Similarly amendment No. 30 is required because not all of the housing-related aspects of matters referred to in paragraph (b) of section 5(7) may be relevant in all cases to student accommodation, for example, play facilities and parking provision. <\/p><p><b><\/b>Amendment No. 31 is required because Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000, which relates to housing supply, does not relate to the provision of student accommodation units and in this context, the insertion of &ldquo;where relevant&rdquo; clarifies the proposed position in respect of student accommodation units.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12016121300002#HH01200","speaker":"1264"},{"type":"speech","time":1481638200,"counter":564,"content":"<p>My understanding of our obligations in both Houses and other related legal obligations is that we need to provide people with opportunities as early as possible to be involved in the planning process.

To get it right, it might be better to leave it until the next planning Bill, the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2016, is introduced.  We are in agreement with the logic of the amendment.  It would work well with the designation of strategic development zones and local area plans.  We have stressed to the proposers of planning applications that they deal with all issues before coming to An Bord Plean&aacute;la in order to enhance the chances of a good outcome.  This new procedure does not guarantee that they will receive a \"yes\" to their planning applications; it only guarantees a timeline.<\/p> <p>  On notifying the public earlier, I agree with the spirit of what the Deputy is trying to do, but it would not be practical because this is in the very early stages of a conversation and a developer might choose not to progress it further.

The first amendment is amendment No. 33 and refers to the provision in the Bill that where An Bord Plean&aacute;la refuses an application then any fee received from the prospective applicant for the purposes of this section would be returned.  I have two problems with this.  First, all of the effort and work of An Bord Plean&aacute;la, the local authority and others on the application, would not be recompensed with regard to the fees provided.  Also, in the same way that the Minister, Deputy Coveney, earlier defended the penalty that An Bord Plean&aacute;la would have to pay for late decisions, not returning this fee would be an equally fair penalty for an applicant and would discourage the making of a bad application.  It is all the better that the sums of money involved in fees could be quite significant because the bigger the sum of money the better the application will be if the applicant knows they will not get the fee back.  I feel strongly about this.<\/p><p>The next eight amendments are all of a similar nature and they are about providing greater access to information or giving slightly longer periods of time for public consultation throughout the process.  With regard to amendment No. 43, if a person feels that their only course of action is to seek a judicial review, there is a huge amount of confusion as to whether the point at which they seek a judicial review is the legally appropriate point.  This applies to ordinary planning applications as well as in this case.  I am not trying to encourage or champion the applications for judicial reviews but if there was clarity on the matter it would assist everybody.  It would ensure that people would not apply for judicial reviews when it is not legally appropriate, and where people felt compelled - for whatever reason - to apply or felt it was their only course of action at least they would know when to do it.  There are three different sets of issues in the amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12016121300002#KK00100","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1481638200,"counter":605,"content":"<p>I endorse the point made about not returning the fees.  The mind boggles on this.  If a person lodges an objection to a planning application in the normal planning application process at the local authority level, and if the application is withdrawn, the person who paid &euro;20 of their hard earned cash for their objection does not get that back.  The Construction Industry Federation is written all over this.  It is offensive.  It costs money to process these applications and the benefit on the other side is generally to the developer.  I find it strange and unacceptable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12016121300002#KK00200","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1481638200,"counter":606,"content":"<p>I am glad that on this occasion, on amendment No. 33, we are in agreement, not the exact wording but in the principle of it.  I am open to this amendment as I believe that there should be an onus on developers wishing to avail of the fast-track procedures to get things right.  When this was first mooted in July the Minister, Deputy Coveney was always very clear that the applications were to be right, and we would encourage that.  It was not to give people an easy or quick decision.  It was to make sure they submit quality applications which could then be appropriately judged.  Applicants should at least submit all the required documentation for the purposes of a pre-application consultation request.  Where incomplete documentation is submitted to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, which will have to conduct validation checks on the documentation submitted, I am open to the notion of withholding the fee submitted.  I can accept this amendment in principle subject to drafting, which will require the submission of a revised wording on Report Stage.  We will link up with the Deputy on that.<\/p> <p>  Amendments Nos. 34 to 36, inclusive, are interesting in that they make proposals aimed at enhancing the awareness of the public of developments that are under consideration by developers, and also at providing further local information to An Bord Plean&aacute;la that might assist it in the pre-application consultations on a proposed development.  While I cannot accept all of the three amendments as drafted, there are certain aspects of them which have merit and which could perhaps be taken on board either in the Bill or in subsequent regulations made under the Bill.  I see some merit in requiring developers who are in the process of submitting a request to An Bord Plean&aacute;la for pre-application consultations on a proposed development to place an advertisement in approved newspapers circulating in the area of their intention in this regard.  This notion is referred to in amendments Nos. 34 and 36.  This would have the effect of providing advance notice to the local public of the likelihood of a planning application being submitted in respect of a particular strategic housing development and would facilitate their engagement in the planning process on the development.  I have already given a commitment in the Seanad deliberations on the Bill that we were open to the idea of requiring developers who are submitting a request for pre-application consultations on a proposed development to place a site notice of their intentions.  I indicated to Senator Boyhan that this site notice requirement would most appropriately be addressed in regulations to be made following the enactment of the Bill.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin&rsquo;s idea that developers should place an advertisement in local newspapers on a proposed strategic housing development at pre-application consultation stage is a similar idea and consequently, I am open to requiring developers to erect a site notice and to place a press advertisement in advance of submitting a request to An Bord Plean&aacute;la for pre-application consultations on a proposed development.<\/p> <p>  With a view to further enhancing transparency in regard to strategic housing developments, I would also be open to the second part of amendment No. 36 requiring planning authorities to record in their weekly planning register that they have made a submission to An Bord Plean&aacute;la in regard to a proposed strategic housing development on foot of An Bord Plean&aacute;la receiving a request for a pre-application consultation on a development. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12016121300002#KK00300","speaker":"1264"},{"type":"speech","time":1481638200,"counter":607,"content":"<p>I must interrupt the Minister of State as there is a vote in the D&aacute;il.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12016121300002#KK00400","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1481638200,"counter":608,"content":"<p>Apparently there will be four votes in the D&aacute;il.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12016121300002#KK00500","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1481638200,"counter":609,"content":"<p>Okay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12016121300002#KK00600","speaker":"1264"},{"type":"speech","time":1481638200,"counter":610,"content":"<p>I propose that we suspend this meeting until the votes are concluded.

This type of information is likely to be of assistance to the board in its consideration of any new proposed strategic housing developments and determining whether a proposed development will assist in meeting local housing demand or give rise to excess supply in the area concerned.  Accordingly, as I have indicated, there are certain aspects of these amendments which we are open to accepting but which are probably most appropriately provided for in regulations made subsequent to the enactment of the Bill.<\/p> <p>  I also must oppose amendment No. 38 which proposed to increase the time period from three weeks to six weeks, within which the board would give its opinion on the proposed development following consultation meeting under section 6.  I consider that eight weeks is sufficient time to allow the board to make that determination.  In addition, the increase in time would also have a negative impact by serving to delay the process unduly.<\/p> <p>  I am opposed to amendment No. 39, which provides for public participation at the stage of pre-application consultations with the board.  Public participation is provided for in respect of the substantive application for permission for a proposed strategic housing development and the board is required to have regard to all submissions duly received relating to the effects of the development on the proper planning and sustainable development of the area and on the environment.  In light of this, I do not see the point of having a separate public participation process for a stage in the planning process that precedes the planning application process.<\/p> <p>  Amendments Nos. 40 and 42 require the board to publish on its website its post-consultation opinion on the proposed development and a record of its pre-application consultations with the developer.  I agree with the intent of these amendments but they are not necessary as I intend to make regulations under section 12 of the Bill requiring that relevant documents relating to the complete consent process for a proposed strategic housing development be accessible to all to view on a website.  I would ask the Deputy, therefore, to withdraw these two amendments.<\/p> <p>  I oppose amendment No. 43 which requires the Minister to prescribe certain matters relating to judicial review under section 50 of the Planning and Development Act 2000.  As regards specific elements of the amendment, a general time limit of eight weeks after the decision or act concerned for applying for leave to apply for judicial review is already set down in section 50 of the Act.  The question of the point at which a person may question the validity of a relevant decision or acts by judicial review is currently before the courts and I do not propose to amend the law in this regard until we consider whatever ruling is made in this matter in due course.  Finally, planning law currently requires all relevant decisions or acts to be publicised in an appropriate fashion and the current Bill proposes to do the same for strategic housing developments and EIA screenings also.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 37 relates to the consultation meeting held between the board and the prospective applicant.  The amendment will enable the prospective applicant and one or more persons nominated by him or her to attend the pre-application consultation meeting with the board and the planning authority.  This is an expansion on the previously drafted provision whereby the meeting could be attended by one or more persons on behalf of the prospective applicant, as opposed to with the applicant.<\/p> <p>

No. 600 of 2001) that does not exceed the relevant quantity, area or other limit standing specified in that Part, whether it is likely to have significant effects on the environment;&rdquo;.<\/blockquote> <p>Section 7(1)(a)(i)(<i>I<\/i>) of the Bill refers to a request for a determination as to whether a strategic housing development &ldquo;of a class specified in regulations made under section 176 of the Act of 2000&rdquo; is likely to have significant effects on the environment and, thus, require an environmental impact assessment, EIA.  However, environmental impact assessment is mandatory in respect of development prescribed under Part 1 of Schedule 5 to the Planning and Development Regulations 2001 to 2015 so an environmental impact assessment screening is not required for them.  In order to make this provision of the Bill more focussed and consistent, amendment No. 45 substitutes in clause (I) text that section 20 of the Bill proposes to include in a new section 176A(2)(a) of the 2000 Act, which deals with EIA screening in a different context.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 46 is required to bring the wording of section 7(1)(a)(i)(II) in respect of appropriate assessment into line with Article 6.3 of the 1992 Habitats Directive and also the wording of section 177U of the 2000 Act, which deals with appropriate assessment screening in a different context.  <\/p><p>Amendment No. 48 requires a person making a request to An Bord Plean&aacute;la under section 7(1) of the Bill to pay the appropriate fee for the request, which relates to a screening for environmental impact assessment or appropriate assessment of a proposed strategic housing development or a scoping request as to what should be contained in an environmental impact statement or Natura impact statement, depending on whether an environmental impact statement or appropriate assessment, or both, is required.<\/p><p>Section 18 of the Bill makes provision for the board to charge a fee for providing an opinion on what information should be included in an environmental impact statement and, under section 144 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, the fee for an environmental impact statement screening in respect of a proposed strategic housing development will be determined by the board, subject to the Minister&rsquo;s approval.<\/p><p>I also intend to move amendments Nos. 45, 46 and 48.  Opposition amendments Nos. 47, 49 to 51, inclusive, and 53 relate to section 7, which sets out the provisions and timelines whereby a prospective applicant may, following a consultation meeting, request the board to determine within eight weeks if the proposed strategic housing development will require an environmental impact assessment or an appropriate assessment or both and, if so, the prospective applicant may also request the board to give an opinion, within 16 weeks, as to what should be contained in the environmental impact statement, EIS, or the Natura impact statement, NIS, or both. <\/p><p> I thank Deputy Eoin &Oacute; Broin for tabling amendment No. 47.  This proposes the insertion of a new subsection (2) in section 7 to provide that where a screening request is made to the board under this section, an applicant does not need to submit the request to the planning authority under the new section 176A(2) proposed under section 20.   I accept the principle behind the amendment, which is to bring clarity to this process in respect of screening requests.  Therefore, in accordance with established practice, I ask the Deputy to withdraw amendment No. 47 on the basis that I will examine the legal and drafting aspects of the proposed amendment and table an amendment to the same effect on Report Stage.<\/p><p> However, I must oppose amendments Nos. 49 to 51, inclusive, and 53.  Amendment No. 49 proposes to make the board&rsquo;s determination and opinion subject to public consultation.  The process under section 7 is essentially a screening process, in other words, the board, on request, confirms if an environmental impact assessment or appropriate assessment is required for the proposed development and, if so, what the environmental impact statement or Natura impact statement or both should contain.  It is not a consent process in itself.  Under the EIA directive, there is no requirement for public participation in such a screening process.  It is not necessary.  Public participation is provided, however, at a later stage when the application for a proposed strategic housing development is made, to be accompanied by an EIS or NIS or both, if required. <\/p><p> Amendment No. 50 proposes to increase the time period, from eight weeks to ten weeks, within which the board is required to make a determination on a request under section 7.  I consider that eight weeks is sufficient time to allow the board to make that determination.  In addition, the increase in time would have a negative impact by serving to delay the process unduly.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 51 proposes that once the board makes a determination or gives an opinion under this section, it should be published on the board&rsquo;s website within three days.  The Bill already requires that such determinations or opinions should be maintained by the board and associated with the relevant planning application, which application will be available to the public during the public consultation.  I consider this is sufficient provision in this regard.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 53 proposes the insertion of a new subsection (3) in section 7 to provide that a decision or opinion given by the board under this section shall not prejudice the board in its consideration of any EIS or NIS or both submitted as a result, or its ability to revisit the matter at a later date or to seek further information during the planning process.  The principle in the first part of the proposal regarding not prejudicing the board is inherent in the planning process and such a specific provision is unnecessary.  Separately, regarding the latter part of the proposal, it should be noted that under these new streamlined planning procedures, there is no provision for seeking further information on an application.  Therefore, in these cases the onus is squarely on the applicant to ensure he or she has provided the full information required by the board to enable it to make a decision on the proposed application.<\/p><p> For these reasons, I must oppose amendment Nos. 49 to 51, inclusive, and 53.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12016121300002#PP06500","speaker":"1264","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481638200,"counter":678,"content":"<p>I am more than happy not to move amendment No. 47 on the basis of the commitments given by the Minister.

I believe this would be appropriate but the Minister clearly does not agree with me.  Likewise, with regard to the proposal to extend the period within which the board must make a determination from eight to ten weeks, if people are to engage meaningfully with the process, they must have an adequate period in which to digest the information, particularly where it is of a highly technical nature.  For this reason, the proposal to extend the timeframe for decisions by two weeks is not unreasonable.<\/p> <p>  The key issue in respect of amendment No. 51 is to ensure that information is provided to persons for whom it is relevant at the earliest possible stage.  <\/p> <p>  With respect to amendment No. 53, the greater the level of clarity we can provide for people, the better the final planning outcomes will be in this process.  I will press all the amendments, with the exception of amendment No. 47. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12016121300002#QQ00200","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1481638200,"counter":679,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1481638200,"counter":680,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 46:<\/p><blockquote>In page 13, line 2, after &ldquo;development&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, individually or in combination with another project,&rdquo;.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12016121300002#QQ00400","speaker":"1264"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1481638200,"counter":681,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1481638200,"counter":682,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 47 not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1481638200,"counter":683,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 48:<\/p><blockquote>In page 13, line 10, after &ldquo;<i>subsection (1)<\/i>&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, which shall be accompanied by the appropriate fee,&rdquo;.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12016121300002#QQ00700","speaker":"1264"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1481638200,"counter":684,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1481638200,"counter":685,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 49<\/p><blockquote>In page 13, line 12, after &ldquo;purpose&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and the public as appropriate&rdquo;.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12016121300002#QQ00900","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1481638200,"counter":686,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1481638200,"counter":687,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 50.<\/p><blockquote>In page 13, line 13, to delete &ldquo;8 weeks&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;10 weeks&rdquo;.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12016121300002#QQ01100","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1481638200,"counter":688,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1481638200,"counter":689,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 51.<\/p><blockquote>In page 13, line 26, after &ldquo;concerned&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, and shall cause that information to be published on its website within 3 days of the decision&rdquo;.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12016121300002#QQ01300","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1481638200,"counter":690,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1481638200,"counter":691,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 52.<\/p><blockquote>In page 13, between lines 26 and 27, to insert the following:&ldquo;(3) A person shall not question the validity of a determination by, or opinion of, the Board under this section by reason only that the procedures as set out in <i>subsection (2) <\/i>were not completed within the time referred to in that subsection.&rdquo;.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12016121300002#QQ01500","speaker":"1264"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1481638200,"counter":692,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1481638200,"counter":693,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 53.<\/p><blockquote>In page 13, between lines 26 and 27, to insert the following:&ldquo;(3) No decision or opinion made under this section shall prejudice the Board in its entitlement to revisit the screening decisions made, or in the further consideration on the scope and set of information required in either an environmental impact statement or natura impact statement, or in its entitlement to seek further information if it so requires as the application for development proceeds through the planning process.&rdquo;.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12016121300002#QQ01700","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1481638200,"counter":694,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1481638200,"counter":695,"content":"<p>Section 7, as amended, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1481638200,"counter":696,"content":"<p>SECTION 8<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1481638200,"counter":697,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 54 to 57, inclusive, and Nos. 59 to 68, inclusive, are related and may be discussed together.

Section 8(1)(a) relates to requirements relating to the application for permission for strategic housing development and, <i>inter alia<\/i>, provides that the applicant for permission shall, in the public notice of the application specify &quot;the period, not being less than 5 weeks&quot; during which a copy of the application and any EIS or NIS or both may be inspected.  This period is specified in section 8(1)(a)(vii) to be the period during which submissions or observations may be made to the board on the application.  This approach is in line with the standard provision for strategic infrastructure developments in the 2000 Act.<\/p><p>I am aware, nonetheless, that as previously drafted under section 8(1)(a)(iii)(II) of the Bill, the developer could specify an inspection period of, say, eight weeks, which would cause difficulties for the overall process as the planning authority is required, within eight weeks of the receipt by the board of the application, to submit its report on the application to the board, including a summary of the submissions or observations received by the board with respect to the application.  As it was always the intention that the approach in Part 2 of the Bill generally was to set specific time limits for particular activities and to remove the decision as to the duration of the inspections period from the developer, amendment No. 54 provides that five weeks is the period specified in section 8(1)(a)(iii)(II), during which submissions or observations may be made to the board with respect to the planning application.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 59 is a technical amendment in respect of section 8 and corrects text in paragraph (b) of subsection (3) to refer to the &quot;applicant&quot; rather than the &quot;prospective applicant&quot;, to the actual application made and documents that accompanied the application and in respect of a decision by the board to refuse to consider the &quot;application&quot; rather than the &quot;request&quot;. <\/p><p>Amendments Nos. 61 and 62 are technical amendments and correct errors of terminology within the existing text of section 8(3)(c).<\/p><p>Amendment No. 63 is required to make it clear that it is the members of the area committee or committees for the area or areas in which the proposed strategic housing development is located who should be notified of the making of an application under chapter 1 of Part 2 of the Bill and subsequently informed of the details of the application, etc.<\/p><p>Amendments Nos. 64 and 65 are technical and are required to correct the references in the existing text of section 8(4) to the elected members of the municipal district or districts in which the proposed strategic housing development is located.<\/p><p>Amendments Nos. 66 to 68, inclusive, are to<b><\/b>section 8(5) of the Bill and are required in order to ensure that, when formulating its views on the effects of a proposed strategic housing development on the proper planning and sustainable development of its area and on the environment, the local planning authority has sight of, and regard to, all submissions and observations duly received by An Bord Plean&aacute;la in regard to an application for permission for a proposed strategic housing development.<br\/><br\/>Under the Bill as it stands, the planning authority has sight of, and regard to, submissions and observations duly received by An Bord Plean&aacute;la in response to the developer&rsquo;s public notice of the application.  However, under these amendments, I am providing that the authority will also have sight of, and regard to, submission or observations from prescribed authorities and stemming from transboundary consultations, when formulating its views on the application for conveying to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.<br\/><br\/>The Opposition amendments Nos. 55 to 57, inclusive, and 60 relate to the provisions of section 8 which sets out the requirements relating to the making of an application for a strategic housing development.<br\/><br\/>I will address amendment Nos. 55 and 57 first.  Amendment No. 55 proposes that an application for strategic housing development and related environmental impact statement, EIS and the Natura impact statement, NIS, as required, be available for inspection by the public from a website.  I accept the principle behind the amendment proposed and it is my intention to deal with this by way of regulations.  Section 12 of the Bill provides for a regulation making power under this Part to deal with procedural and administrative matters, and specifically to provide for making applications available for inspection in electronic form.  Therefore, I request the Deputy to withdraw the amendment on the basis that this will be provided for by way of regulations.<br\/><br\/>In regard to amendment No. 57, again I wish to indicate that I am in full agreement with what is proposed and, indeed, I have publicly indicated on a number of occasions, as has the Minister, Deputy Coveney, that we will ensure that the fee for a member of the public to make a submission or observation to An Bord Plean&aacute;la in regard to an application for strategic housing development will be no greater than if he or she were making such a submission or observation to their local planning authority.<br\/><br\/>Under section 144 of the 2000 Act, the fee for a submission or an observation on a proposed strategic housing development will be determined by An Bord Plean&aacute;la, subject to my approval.  Therefore, I again request the Deputy to withdraw the amendment on the basis that this is dealt with under the section 144 provisions.<br\/><br\/>I cannot accept amendment No. 56, which proposes to increase the public consultation period from five weeks to eight weeks where an application is accompanied by an EIS or a NIS.  I consider that five weeks is sufficient time to allow members of the public to make their submissions or observations and is consistent with the time period provided for submissions or observations in respect of an planning application to a local planning authority.  In addition, increasing the time period will also impact on the overall period of time of 16 weeks for the completion of the application process.  This runs contrary to the purpose of the provisions, which is to reach a final decision in a shorter period of time.<br\/><br\/>I cannot accept amendment No. 60 as it proposes that should An Bord Plean&aacute;la refuse to deal with an application, on the basis that it considers it inadequate or incomplete, it should retain the application fee paid by the applicant on the lodgement of the application.  While I accepted this principle in an earlier amendment, regarding the retention of the fee paid for the consultation process, that is associated to a relatively minor cost for the applicant, however, at this stage more significant costs are involved and I think it would be overly punitive not to refund the fee paid in this particular case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12016121300002#QQ02300","speaker":"1264","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481638200,"counter":700,"content":"<p>I am happy to withdraw amendment No. 55 in my name on the basis of the Minister of State's commitment to deal with its intent to provide a greater level of information to encourage public participation by way of regulations.

This is the same point I have been making in a series of earlier amendments.  In amendment No. 76, the key point refers to the fee to be paid by the applicant to An Bord Plean&aacute;la in respect of his or her application permission of &euro;10,000 to be returned.

That is if we have read the amendment correctly.  If we have not, the Deputy can let us know and we can revert to him.  Clarity would help.<\/p><p> It is important to note that the board's power and mandate are to make decisions on the applications before it.  It cannot increase or augment an application by recommending an increase in the number of houses in a development.  Conversely, in its final decision it may restrict the scale or scope of a proposed development.  Even if an applicant is granted full planning permission, the decision cannot go beyond the parameters of the development originally proposed, full details of which would have been made available for public inspection and consultation.  Therefore, we oppose the amendment.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 71 proposes to amend the two core considerations of the board in any proposed development - the likely consequence for proper planning and sustainable development of the area of the proposed development and the likely effects on the environment or a European site of the proposed development &ndash; by including a reference to an assessment of housing needs of disabled persons.  This would not be an appropriate reference in this instance.  We are not sure of the intention behind the amendment or what it aims to ensure.  Such an assessment is for the housing authority to conduct or consider, with reference to those on its housing lists who may have a disability and need to be accommodated accordingly.  In addition, any social housing, including the specific needs of those with a disability, would more appropriately be addressed by a housing authority through the Part V processes and agreements reached with developers.  Perhaps there is an issue with the wording of the amendment that we need to discuss.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 73 is unnecessary.  It states the board \"shall be bound by the EIA and AA requirements of the 2000 Act, as set out in Parts X and XAB, respectively, of that Act\".  That is already the case.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 76 proposes to delete, in part or in full, section 9(13) which provides for the application of a penalty clause where the board fails to make a decision on a proposed strategic housing development within the statutory period of 16 weeks.  In doing so, the amendment would remove the provision in subsection (13)(a) which provides that, even though the 16-week period may have expired, the board can still proceed to make a decision on the application.  Accordingly, I cannot accept the inclusion of the amendment, as it would prevent the making of decisions on planning applications beyond the 16-week period.<\/p><p> By way of an alternative approach, amendment No. 77 proposes only to delete the penalty clause.  However, I must oppose the amendment.  The inclusion of this clause sends a clear message to developers of our absolute determination and that of the board to ensure housing is delivered within specified timeframes and, where decisions are not made within the timeframes proposed, penalty clause provisions may be applied.  Therefore, I oppose this amendment also.<\/p><p> I accept the principle of amendment No. 75 which proposes that the Minister may, by way of regulations, only extend the statutory 16-week period set down for the board to make a decision on application and, consequently, that he may not reduce that period below 16 weeks.  Therefore, in accordance with established practice, I will ask the Deputy to withdraw amendment No. 75 on the basis that we will examine the legal and drafting aspects of the proposed amendments with a view to tabling amendments to the same effect on Report Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12016121300002#RR04600","speaker":"1264","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1481638200,"counter":746,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1481638200,"counter":747,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 71 not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1481638200,"counter":748,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 72 has been ruled out of order.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12016121300002#SS00400","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1481638200,"counter":749,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 72 not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1481638200,"counter":750,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 73:<\/p><blockquote>In page 19, between lines 18 and 19, to insert the following:&ldquo;(4) For the avoidance of doubt, the Board shall be bound by the provisions of Part X and Part XAB of the Act of 2000 in respect of requirement to conduct an environmental impact assessment and appropriate assessment where appropriate to the application for development under consideration, and consistent with the Board&rsquo;s policies in relation to same, and to record and evidence those assessments as part of any decision made pursuant to provisions of this Chapter.&rdquo;.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12016121300002#SS00600","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1481638200,"counter":751,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1481638200,"counter":752,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 74:<\/p><blockquote>In page 19, line 20, after &ldquo;development&rdquo;

However, strategic housing developments are different in that they are on land zoned for that purpose and fundamentally different in nature from major once-off SID projects that often are not on land specifically zoned for that purpose.

Therefore, in order to speed up the approval process for strategic housing developments, I am not giving the board the power to request further information on planning applications for such developments.

I am proposing the substitution in order to present as clearly as possible in the Bill a number of amendments and additional elements in section 18.  Within the amendment is a new paragraph (a) which corrects an erroneous section reference in the existing text of section 18.  The definition of &ldquo;strategic housing development&rdquo; is contained in section 3 of the Bill and not section 4 as stated in the Bill, as published.  It is, therefore, a technical amendment.  Furthermore, the new paragraph (b) inserts a reference to a request for consultation under section 5<i><\/i>of the Bill, in contrast to section 144 of the 2000 Act which refers to an application for a pre-application consultation.<\/p><p>I am also providing in the new paragraph (c) that the board can charge a fee for making a determination under the section on whether an environmental impact assessment is required for a particular proposed strategic housing development.<\/p><p>Under section 144 of the 2000 Act, the fee for an EIA screening in respect of a proposed strategic housing development will be determined by the board subject to the approval of the Minister.

Again, under section 144 of the 2000 Act, the fee for an AA scoping request in respect of a proposed strategic housing development will be determined by the board, subject to the Minister's approval.

As I understand it, when a judgment is being made during the screening process there is a list of recognised bodies that must be part of the process.  That list can be changed by way of regulation rather than primary legislation.  In other words, we can add to it organisations that believe they should be on it, if they are credible, sensible and so on.  The danger is that if we open up the screening process to everybody it could potentially be delayed by one individual or organisation.  It is important we get consensus on what requires screening and what does not, and in a transparent and open manner that is supported by credible environmental bodies.

This would remove the requirement to go through the planning process again and, importantly, would expedite the completion of the housing development in question.  Section 22 amends section 42 of the 2000 Act relating to the extension of duration of certain planning permissions for the duration of the specific period provided for in sections 3 and 4 of the Bill.  This is an essential part of the strategic housing development provisions and follows a commitment in the Rebuilding Ireland document.  For the benefit of colleagues, we made a change in the Seanad to make sure that extensions do not apply to decisions made under the new streamlined planning system involving more than 100 houses because if people get the benefit of an early decision, we want people to move and start building.  We are not going to streamline a planning process and get planning permissions for people only for them to sit on them indefinitely.  After a five-year planning period, there will be no renewal in the case of the new streamlined planning process about which we spoke earlier but for existing planning permissions that are running out and that may have had one renewal, this effectively allows for a second renewal and gives the chief executive of a local authority the powers to do that.  Some estates that are half finished or that went bust may have run out of planning permission and would have to go through the planning process all over again.  This allows a local authority to renew the planning application so the estate can be built.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12016121300002#WW00400","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1481638200,"counter":859,"content":"<p>If I do not build at all and I have my extension, where does that leave me as opposed to-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12016121300002#WW00500","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speech","time":1481638200,"counter":860,"content":"<p>If building is consistent with zoning and the local area plans, the chief executive can make the decision to extend rather than going through the process all over again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12016121300002#WW00600","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1481638200,"counter":861,"content":"<p>Do they have to apply publicly?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12016121300002#WW00700","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speech","time":1481638200,"counter":862,"content":"<p>That is an administrative process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12016121300002#WW00800","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1481638200,"counter":863,"content":"<p>If I am an aggrieved party from a previous-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12016121300002#WW00900","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speech","time":1481638200,"counter":864,"content":"<p>It concerns whether there is a notification of the procedure if somebody has an extension to a planning application.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12016121300002#WW01000","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1481638200,"counter":865,"content":"<p>Should the person in question state that it is their intention to apply?

These amendments relate to the changes proposed in the Bill regarding the Part VIII process for the approval of local authority own development proposals, including social housing.  The Bill proposes a number of key changes to the existing local authority own development approval processes in section 179 of the Planning and Development Act 2000.<\/p> <p>  The first change is that at the end of the public consultation period for a proposed local authority own development, the local authority chief executive will have eight weeks to issue a report to the elected council members on the public consultation on the proposed development.  No such timeline is incorporated in the current Part VIII approval procedures.  The second change is that after the public consultation on a proposed development, the elected council members will have six weeks to consider the proposal and, by resolution, to vary, modify or decide not to proceed with the proposed development.  The third change proposes that a council resolution in relation to a Part VIII proposal will require the support of a majority of the elected members of the local authority concerned.  The fourth change is that a resolution not to proceed with the development must state the reasons for this decision.<\/p> <p>  The primary purpose of these changes is to streamline the timelines for decision making on local authority development proposals, providing certainty around the time frames for the Part VIII process.  Under the revised procedures in the Bill, the maximum timeframe for the determination of local authority own development proposals will now be 20 weeks from the date of issue of the proposals for public consultation.  Under the current procedures, there is no maximum timeframe for the completion of the Part VIII process which delays the delivery of local authority own development projects, including social housing proposals.  The amendments proposed in relation to the Part VIII procedures seek to dilute the intentions of the proposals in the Bill.<\/p> <p>  Many local authorities do a very good job on Part VIII planning applications but there are also some applications that take an eternity to get across the line.  We are trying to put timelines on councillors and chief executives to make sure the process moves through the stages.  We have a massive social housing build programme, that is going to be funded over the next five years and we must get the Part VIII applications through the system.  Some of the local authorities are great at that but others take a long time to make decisions and sometimes do not make decisions at all because issues get put off and put off.  We are trying to put timeline sand some certainty in to the decision-making process regarding the period of time involved.  We are not taking away the powers of the councillors to make the determination in the end.  This is what we had initially looked at, but having spoken to many people and to the councillors about it we came back from that position and looked at a slightly speedier process while making sure it remained a democratic decision at the end of the day.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12016121300002#XX01000","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1481638200,"counter":906,"content":"<p>I wish to speak against amendment No.128 and in favour of my own amendment No. 130.

It is important that in the course of the debate we do not lose sight of building standards or quality of living standards for the people who will occupy those units.  While it is slightly opportunistic of me to table this amendment at this point, it was in a Bill that I had tabled earlier on First Stage.<\/p> <p>  When the Minister's predecessor introduced this legislation, I was one of a number of Deputies who felt it was a very controversial measure for two reasons. First, the sizes are wrong.  That will have a negative impact on the quality of life for people, particularly vulnerable sections of society who could end up living in apartments of those smaller sizes.  I have spent a considerable period living in local authority high rise accommodation in London and in Belfast.  Size really matters, particularly over certain heights.  I do not believe it is the responsibility of the Minister to introduce these types of detailed restrictions.  That is the function of local elected members and the county or city development plan process.

It is important to note that these are much more generous than the UK guidelines, including Northern Ireland.  We are not talking about small boxy apartments.  From memory, it was agreed to apply the national guidelines which we had previously to everywhere in the country, whereas Dublin had decided to increase space.  The problem with that, of course, is that it pushes up the cost of building apartments.  I believe we compare well internationally.  Many of the developers who are coming to Ireland from abroad, make the case that the guidelines are far more demanding and far more costly in Ireland than they are elsewhere.  I do not make any apologies for that because we want decent quality apartment accommodation in Dublin and elsewhere but I think the principle of a Minister being able to set clear national guidelines that local authorities must abide by is important.  Otherwise it may be impossible for a national decision to be made in response to a national emergency of some type or take some significant policy initiative to be able to do that.  The local authorities could ignore that ruling or a Minister might not be able to do it.<\/p> <p>  The issue is a delegation of powers in terms of whether the Minister with responsibility for planning has the capacity to introduce something that local authorities must take note of.

The first relates to the formal declaration of a housing emergency and the second, amendment No. 148, is one recommended by Focus Ireland, the homeless charity.  The effect of this amendment would be to ensure that families living in buy-to-let properties which are being sold would remain in those properties.  Focus Ireland has said that a significant number of families who are currently becoming homeless come from private rented accommodation, effectively, buy-to-let properties where the landlord is being forced to sell the property by banks, leading to the families being evicted.  Some 20 families a month are so affected and these include approximately 40 children.  The situation has been dealt with in other jurisdictions and it is not allowed in the North.  It is time we took the same decision down here so that families in buy-to-let properties can remain in those properties in all circumstances.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 133 proposes a formal declaration by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann of a housing emergency.  The first sentence reads, &quot;D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann formally declares that a housing emergency exists in the State and while this emergency continues the right of any person to remain in the dwelling in which the person currently resides will take precedence over any property right of any other person&quot;.  The effect of this amendment would be that the common good in housing matters would supersede property rights.  We have a housing emergency in the State, which the Minister acknowledged publicly in the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>a number of months ago, as have other Ministers.  We are effectively adding to the emergency every day and figures from earlier this week show that 420 families have lost their homes by various methods, whether by repossessions, evictions or just handing back keys and abandoning their properties under pressure from banks.  Four families per day are losing their homes so we should not add to the emergency but should deal with evictions, security of tenure and rent certainty.  We also have to deal with the EU on funding for local authority and public housing.  The Taoiseach wrote to the EU some time ago requesting flexibility in relation to additional funding but as the State has not declared a housing emergency, the EU obviously is going to take his request with a pinch of salt.<\/p><p>A declaration of an emergency is not unusual.  The financial emergency has been in place for a number of years and was extended again on 30 June this year so it is not unprecedented.  The financial emergency ensures that pay and pension cuts are continued.  Pensions are private property and have been declared as such by the courts.  There is a huge emergency, which the Minister has acknowledged, and to stop adding to it a declaration that one exists is required so that the common good and the right of families to homes and a roof over their head come before property rights, specifically in the case of evictions.  There are 6,800 homeless people, of whom 2,500 are children, and we simply cannot continue to accept this situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12016121300002#AAA00800","speaker":"1348"},{"type":"speech","time":1481638200,"counter":950,"content":"<p>I think my grouping list is different so can I clarify which ones we are taking now?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12016121300002#AAA00900","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1481638200,"counter":951,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 133, 145 to 156, inclusive, 158 to 169, inclusive, and 174 to 177, inclusive, are being discussed together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12016121300002#AAA01000","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1481638200,"counter":952,"content":"<p>I support the spirit of amendment No. 133.  I realise that we will come back to these matters on Report Stage and in the new year when we see the outworkings of the Minister's rental strategy, which was launched today.<\/p><p>Obviously we will come back to some of this material on Report Stage.  I presume that in the new year we will see the outworkings of the Minister's rental strategy, which was launched today.  I am firmly of the view, however, that we need to move at a speedier rate to tenancies of a more definite duration than the Minister outlined today.  He clearly outlined the move from four to six as a first step, and while that is fine, it depends on when we get to take the second and third steps.  On that basis I am still going to press amendment No. 145.<\/p><p> I wish to support Deputy Seamus Healy.  We had a very important and detailed presentation by Focus Ireland in the AV room a couple of weeks ago.  They have done a fair amount of research on the last secure tenancy of many of the families they are working with who are currently in emergency accommodation.  They found that the last secure tenancy of a significant majority of those families was in private rental accommodation.  Some of them may have been transitioned through to family accommodation for a short period, or sofa surfing, before ending up in emergency accommodation.  The difficulty that Focus Ireland identified is that unless there is a greater level of protection for those kind of families we will see them continuing into homeless at some rate.  Focus Ireland's research showed that in most cases those families were in properties owned by a single landlord.  They were either served notice to quit because of repossession proceedings or the sale of a property.<\/p><p> In this amendment - which is a more sophisticated than the one I drafted - Focus Ireland is trying to find ways of excluding certain categories of landlord without drawing the net too widely.  In particular, this concerns those whose mortgages were funded by buy-to-let mortgages or by availing of section 23 tax reliefs.  There is enormous merit in what Focus Ireland has tried to do.  It speaks more directly to some of the concerns the Minister has articulated regarding his nervousness in intervening in a way that causes difficulties for landlords with one or two properties.  My own amendments draw the net much wider than that.<\/p><p> The Minister should consider amendment No. 148 and while I am not expecting him to accept it, it is one that he should examine with a view to tabling further amendments on Report Stage.  If we cannot provide this minimum set of protections that Focus Ireland is requesting, we will not be able to stem the flow of families into emergency accommodation.<\/p><p> I know the Minister will not accept amendment No. 149 but at some point we will have to move to a situation whereby residential rental properties are treated similarly to commercial ones.  When an individual decides to rent, they are not just renting temporary accommodation for a short period but are renting a home.  I know the Minister's views on this and it is my intention to press the amendment.  The amendment aims to remove the sale of property as a grounds for notice to quit.  I know that sounds harsh, particularly in some categories of accidental landlords, but one must balance that.  We hear the Minister talking quite a lot about this in his approach to the rental strategy balance between investors and tenants.  However, we also need a balance between accidental landlords and tenants who, in the kind of cases we are concerned about, are effectively rendered homeless and go into emergency accommodation.  That is something that needs to be addressed.<\/p><p> My amendment No. 150 is a clumsier attempt to do what Focus Ireland did, so I am more than happy to withdraw it in favour of theirs. They did a much better job on the amendment, but mine attempts to do the same thing. <\/p><p> Amendment No. 163 generated considerable debate in the Seanad.  On Second Stage the Minister outlined that he was keen to draw the threshold back from five to ten.  There is simply no value in giving a minority of tenants this valuable protection - whether it concerns landlords with 20, ten or five - when the vast majority of tenants will not get that protection, particularly those most vulnerable due to the financial insecurity of their own landlords.  I do not expect the Minister to support the amendment because he is seeking to move it in the other direction.  As I said on Second Stage, however, this will create two classes of tenant protections.  For example, a tenant - whether it is five or ten - will get a protection when that property is repossessed and there is an attempt to sell it on, versus the poor unfortunate who is in the property of an accidental landlord.  I do not see how that can be justified given the impact on the tenant and the need for equity in the protection of tenants' rights.<\/p><p> I will discuss amendments Nos. 164, 167 and 168 together.  These try to remove or limit the Minister's proposed exemptions for landlords who will be caught in the threshold, albeit five at the moment or ten if the Minister manages to get it changed on Report Stage.  Given the impact on families who could end up homeless and the cost to the Exchequer of people having to be in emergency accommodation for 12, 16 or 24 months - particularly in the Dublin region - I cannot see how those exceptions are justified.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12016121300002#AAA01100","speaker":"1215","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481638200,"counter":954,"content":"<p>I support the thrust of what my colleagues have said.  I agree that we do have a housing emergency and this legislation is specifically dealing with it.  I welcome the principle of what the Minister is doing.  Later on, we will have a debate on the rental changes the Minister is making which, from what I have read, I very much welcome.<\/p> <p>  There are 198,000 vacant homes in the State, not including holiday homes, of which 36,000 are in Dublin.  That is a huge number.  Notwithstanding all the excellent work we are doing, including encouragements for landlords to put more properties on the market, it is time to introduce a tax on vacant homes, such as happens in the United Kingdom.  In England, local authorities have flexibility to do it.  They may or may not do so but they have the requisite powers.  If a home is vacant for two years or more they can double the council tax on it.  I agree with Deputy Seamus Healy that if there is an emergency then families should come first.  We must ensure that where houses are vacant for two years or more then property tax on them should be increased.  That would encourage the owner or landlord to let such houses.  Many people might not like such a proposal, but many others would welcome it.  It is the only way one can meet current demand because it will take three or four years to build the required number of houses.  I appreciate that it is \"all systems go\" in that regard, but by the time we reach that phase our population will have grown again and there will be a consequent increase in demand for accommodation.<\/p> <p>  We have to go after those vacant homes and encourage their letting, which the Minister is doing.  There must be a penalty if people are holding on to homes while their value appreciates.  There are many reasons why they do so, but if it is good enough for England then it is good enough for Ireland also.  An increase in property tax would encourage people to let empty homes which are not required for their owners' personal accommodation.  It is a no-brainer to me.  That proposal goes to the heart of the problem and it is the only way we can get a few thousand homes released for letting, which are badly needed.  Local authorities have not done their job in this respect.<\/p><p>In the greater Dublin area the local authorities were offered at least 800 homes under favourable circumstances which they did not let to families on their housing list.  <\/p><p> I was approached by a family who were in court last week and given seven weeks to vacate the family home.  This family were very successful business people - equally they could have lost their jobs - having built up a business for their whole lives that went bust.  These people in their late 60s have gone bust and they have nowhere to go.  Their children are grown up so they will not get priority on the local authority housing list.  I rang the bank involved but they are not for budging.  We need to have more respect for people who have paid their way all their lives and find themselves in this situation, as do people who have their employment.  I am not making a distinction between them.  We need to do a lot more in that area.<\/p><p> It makes me sick when I listen to advertisements on the radio where a lady says, \"My son was born homeless, I am living in a hotel tonight\" because that is the result of the mismanagement of our economy by a previous Government.  We have to act now.  I accept, acknowledge and support all the actions we are taking.  We need to go a step further.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12016121300002#BBB00200","speaker":"1329","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481638200,"counter":956,"content":"<p>I will deal with amendment No. 133.  I appreciate the sentiment behind Deputy Healy&rsquo;s amendment but I am afraid that I cannot accept a blanket ban, essentially, on all court orders removing people from a property.  I do not accept that such a provision is in place in Northern Ireland, the idea that nobody can be removed from a premises in Northern Ireland.  I do not think that is the case.  However, the amendment tabled by Deputy Healy does not take account of the fact that the Government has and will be putting in place a number of measures to assist homeowners to remain in their homes where possible.  In particular, I draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to the new, innovative mortgage arrears resolution service - Abhaile - which the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality and the Minister for Social Protection officially launched recently.  The new nationwide service marks a departure in State assistance by providing free, independent expert advice and support on financial and legal issues.<\/p><p>In addition, action 4 of the rental strategy, published today, commits to engagement with the banking sector to encourage banks and landlords in arrears to agree sustainable solutions which may include retaining the use of the property for rental uses &ndash; for example under HAP or rent supplement.  The key is to prevent these cases from ever reaching the courts where possible.  Furthermore, action 5 of the strategy commits to the establishment of a working group made up of the key public sector bodies involved, including my own Department, the Departments of Justice and Equality, Finance and Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  This group will examine the scope for the obligations of landlords to transfer to receivers and will report by the end of the first quarter of next year.  We are looking to revamp the mortgage to rent scheme to try to give people an option to effectively move from being in real difficulty from a mortgage arrears perspective to being able to rent the properties that they have been living in from local authorities or approved housing bodies.  That scheme has not been the success that it could or should have been so we are looking to redesign it.<\/p><p>Amendments Nos. 145, 146, 159, 174 and 175 propose to amend Part 4 of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 to provide for tenancies of indefinite duration.  There are some very significant provisions included in this Bill in relation to security of tenure; both the Tryellstown amendment and the repeal of section 42 make important changes in regard to security of tenure for tenants.  However, this Bill includes only the early action measures set out in Rebuilding Ireland.<\/p><p>The Bill does not resolve all of the problems in the rented sector and it was not intended that it would do so.  To legislate for the problems in the rented sector in advance of having a strategic plan for that sector risks exacerbating the very problems that the Government is trying to solve.  That is why the action plan committed to the publication of a strategy, by the end of the year, which was launched today.  I presume some members have read the strategy already.  It is relatively short.  There is a commitment to move towards tenancies of indefinite duration but we are not making that jump just now.  My judgment is that the so-called accidental landlords and those who invested in rental property for capital appreciation are essentially stuck with properties.  We do not want to make decisions that spook landlords and result in people getting out of the market altogether.  We have taken a step in the right direction by proposing going from four to six years with an intention that we are trying to create much longer tenancies.  We also have a proposal for unfurnished properties under ten year tenancies.  Again, we are looking for longer term tenancies, much more certainty and a clearer commitment from both landlords and tenants for longer term rental relationships.  This is movement in the direction that Deputy &Oacute; Broin and I want in terms of moving towards tenancies of indefinite duration, with reasonable break clauses that are available to both tenants and landlord.  We will bring forward an amendment to that effect on Report Stage so we will have an opportunity to discuss it again.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 147 provides that the four year period would be changed to a &ldquo;period agreed between the landlord and tenant&rdquo;.  I do not believe this is advisable.  The four year period is a minimum right for all tenants at present and I intend to increase this to six years.  By allowing the period to be determined by agreement between the landlord and the tenant runs the risk that the tenant, in a weaker bargaining position, would lose the right to remain for four or six years.  Therefore, I do not propose to accept amendment No. 147.<\/p><p>Amendments Nos. 148 to 155, inclusive, all relate to the termination of a tenancy on the ground that the landlord wishes to sell the dwelling.Amendments Nos. 148, 150, 151 and 153 all prohibit a landlord from terminating a tenancy on the ground of sale where the dwelling concerned is an investment property, a buy-to-let or a section 23 dwelling.  Amendments Nos. 149, 152 and 155 prohibit terminating a tenancy on the<b><\/b>ground of sale in all cases and amendment No. 163 reduces the number of dwellings that the Tyrrelstown amendment would apply to from five to one dwelling, which would have a similar effect.<\/p><p>The Bill includes two significant provisions in regard to security of tenure.  Section 30 provides that a landlord may not terminate a tenancy on the grounds that he or she wishes to sell a dwelling in circumstances where he or she is selling more than five dwellings, at the same time, in the same development.  This amendment arises from a commitment in the strategy Rebuilding Ireland - Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness to deal with terminations in very specific circumstances, that is, where large numbers of tenants in a single development are served with termination notices at the same time.  The original figure was 20 dwellings and this was amended to five on Report Stage in the Seanad.  On foot of legal advice, I will bring an amendment on Report Stage to increase this number to ten dwellings and we will debate that then.  In drafting the Tyrrelstown amendment, the Department was very aware that restricting the use of the grounds of sale to terminate a tenancy could be regarded as an interference with constitutionally protected property rights.  Therefore, the amendment was drafted so as to ensure that this interference was both proportionate and justified.  I believe that taken together with the measures in the strategy &ndash; including the increase in the length of the Part 4 tenancy from four to six years and the provisions to provide for rent stability &ndash; that the Government has provided a proportionate and balanced improvement in security of tenure for tenants and I do not propose to accept these amendments. <\/p><p>For similar reasons, I do not propose to accept that part of amendment No. 154 which also prohibits a landlord from terminating a tenancy on the ground that a dwelling is unsuitable having regard to overcrowding and that the dwelling is required for a family member.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 156 proposes that where a landlord terminates a tenancy because the dwelling is required by the landlord or a member of the landlord's family, the landlord will pay six months' rent as compensation to the tenant.  The payment of six months' rent as compensation is neither proportionate nor balanced and I do not propose to accept this amendment.<br\/><br\/>A tenant acquires the protection of a Part 4 tenancy after six months' continuous occupation.  Amendment No. 158 provides that the protection of a Part 4 tenancy should arise after two months.  The purpose of the six-month period was to provide for a type of probationary tenancy whereby the landlord and tenant could ensure they were ready to enter into a long-term four-year tenancy.  The six-month period is reasonable and provides for a balance in the Act and I do not propose to accept this amendment.<br\/><br\/>Amendments Nos. 160 to 169, inclusive, all relate to the Tyrrelstown amendment.  I note the section is opposed and I have addressed this already.<br\/><br\/>Amendments Nos. 160 to 162, inclusive, 164 to 166, inclusive, 168 and 169 relate to the exemptions to the Tyrrelstown amendment.  As I discussed earlier, the Department was aware that restricting the use of the ground of sale to terminate a tenancy could be regarded as an interference with constitutionally protected property rights.  Therefore, the exemption to the amendment was drafted to ensure this interference was both proportionate and justified, while also taking account of cases of genuine hardship.  These amendments were strengthened by Opposition amendments on Report Stage in the Seanad.  I do not intend to undo these changes other than to provide for a consequential amendment to section 29 on Report Stage.  The amendment, as drafted, addresses the concerns raised in the Seanad and I do not propose to go further.<br\/><br\/>Amendment No. 167 proposes to increase the figure of 20% to 40% in subsection 30(3)(<i>a<\/i>).  High levels of landlord indebtedness are leading in many cases to insolvency and repossession.  A breakdown of buy-to-let accounts for June 2016 found that more than 20% of these accounts were in arrears and that, of these accounts, more than 10% were in arrears for more than two years.  The figure of 20% is proportionate and balanced.  Not alone must there be a loss of 20% but the landlord must also be able to show hardship or that the effect of the provision is unduly onerous.  For this reason, I will not accept the amendment.<br\/><br\/>Amendment No. 176 provides that a landlord may not terminate a tenancy for non-payment of rent unless the landlord has engaged in a rent arrears resolution process to be established by ministerial order.  When terminating a tenancy for non-payment of rent, a landlord must first serve a 14-day warning letter to the tenant.  If the tenant does not comply with this letter, the landlord may only then serve a 28-day notice of termination.  Where the tenant believes that the notice is invalid, he or she may take a case to the Residential Tenancies Board and a termination of the tenancy may not be effected during that time.  It is clear that while tenants have rights, they also have obligations and there is an obligation under the Act on a tenant to pay the rent.

On Second Stage, I asked two questions on the amendments to section 42, which I welcomed.  Approved housing body tenancies now come under the terms of the Residential Tenancies Act, which is a welcome change.  In the case of a person who has been a long-term tenant of an approved housing body, one of the anomalies of including such tenancies within the scope of the Act is that a six-month probationary period will apply.  Many tenants have asked whether this will result in a diminution of their rights.  In the round, the rights of such tenants are greatly strengthened by the decision to include their tenancies within the scope of the Residential Tenants Act and Residential Tenancies Board.  Nevertheless, this remains a genuine concern of many tenants.  I asked in my Second Stage contribution that the Minister respond to this specific query either on Committee Stage or a subsequent Stage of the Bill.<\/p><p>Another issue arose in respect of the removal of six-month probationary periods from subsequent four-year tenancies under Part 4, which is obviously a positive step.  Does this provision give rise to any loopholes?  Did officials examine whether the removal of the second six-month probationary period at the start of a second four-year period under a Part 4 tenancy will cause difficulties in terms of a rent review?  While this is a very good change, one of the questions that has been asked is whether it will have any unintended consequences for rent reviews.  While I do not believe that will be the case, I raise the issue because it is important.<\/p><p>I acknowledged that the move from four-year to six-year tenancies is welcome.  On the issue of moving to indefinite duration, is there a notional timescale for moving beyond six-year tenancies?  Will new arrangements be phased in over a number of years?<\/p><p>My final point is a question rather than a rhetorical comment.  On Article 43 and the possibility that constitutional issues could arise in respect of interference with constitutional property rights where a landlord was prevented from issuing a notice to quit on the ground that a property was to be sold, I have two specific questions.  The Minister cannot or will not share the legal advice received from the Attorney General on this matter.  If there is no constitutional difficulty in placing such a restriction on a landlord who has ten properties, on what basis would such a constitutional protection apply in the case of a landlord with five properties or one property on whom the Minister imposes a restriction given that landlords must all enjoy the same constitutional rights?  Likewise, we do not require commercial landlords to evict tenants in the event of a property's sale.  In fact, the norm in commercial practice is to sell on commercial properties with the tenant <i>in situ<\/i>.  Why is this not constitutionally possible in the residential rental sector when it is constitutionally possible in the commercial rental sector?  These are genuine questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12016121300002#DDD00200","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1481638200,"counter":959,"content":"<p>My understanding in respect of the Deputy's final question is that there is a legal view that interference with someone's property rights, in other words, the right to sell a property unencumbered, must be both proportionate and justified, irrespective of whether it applies to an individual or a fund which owns large numbers of properties.  In other words, if the owner of 30 properties in one development chooses to sell all his or her properties, the question is whether it would be proportionate and justified to allow the landlord to kick everybody out to sell the properties.  The reason we are introducing the Tyrrelstown amendment is that we do not believe it would be proportionate or justified for the landlord to do so.  The scenario is different, however, in the case of someone who owns one property, which may be a family home or similar, and wants to sell the property.  As a result of selling the property with a tenant in residence, the value of the property will be significantly less.  In such circumstances, the question is whether it is proportionate and justified to prevent the landlord from selling his or her asset unencumbered.  That is a genuine issue.  This is not a bluff by us to try to have a figure of five or ten properties.  A genuine legal issue arises where somebody is essentially told that, as a result of a change in the law, a property cannot be sold vacant and, therefore, the owner must accept a lesser value for the property because a tenancy will continue through the sales process.  Is this proportionate and justified in respect of the constitutional rights of a person as regards his or her assets or property?<\/p><p>There is a grey area there and we had to make a judgment call in the case of Tyrrelstown as to whether that was justified and proportionate to ensure it could not happen again.  In my view it is and I would defend that in court any day.  How low should we go with the number before moving into that grey area of property rights versus the obligation on the State to reasonably protect tenants <i>in situ<\/i>?  That is where the figure of five or ten is under discussion.  That is my understanding of the judgment.<br\/><br\/>I cannot give an exact timeline on the indefinite duration issue.  We looked at going straight to indefinite duration.  I tested it with many stakeholders and got considerable negative feedback that people were not quite ready for it.  So we are going from four to six and we will discuss in the future when we can take the next step.  However, I do not want to give an exact date for it now, as that would create more uncertainty.<br\/><br\/>Tenants of approved housing bodies, AHBs, have more rights now than they previously had.

Obviously, because we have been in Committee all day, we did not have the time to read the detail of the report.  I went to the launch to get as much of the detail as possible.  I would like to hear the Minister's response to two things in light of what he said today.  He talked about the balance between the ability of the investor to make a reasonable return and the tenant to have some predictability of rent, as he now calls it.<\/p> <p>  My concern is twofold.  Yields on rental properties are at a very high level - some estimates have them at around 7% meaning that rent rolls are very high.  There are many smaller landlords for whom even at the current high rents they are not meeting the mortgage payments on the properties.  We accept that and there is research to back it up.  However, for the institutional investors the Minister is looking to attract in as part of his overall Rebuilding Ireland strategy, the yields are already significant - not only higher than they have historically been in this State but higher than in other EU member states.

I meant the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund.  A 4% annual return is reasonable.  From what I can see, the Minister has not provided for 4% annual return.  It is 4% in the first year, effectively 8% from base point in the second year and 12% in the third year.  So it is a significantly higher level once a landlord passes that third year.  This assumes that landlords in Dublin and Cork do as we expect them to do, which is to take the full 4%.<\/p> <p>  In a market where the landlords and in particular the investors are already getting a healthy return, they are getting a further rate of return well above what other investors in other areas of activity would get.  I do not understand the logic for that and I ask the Minister to explain it to me.<\/p> <p>  In addition a significant portion of renters simply cannot afford more rent.  While on paper 4% sounds better than 8%, or 12% over three years is better than the 26% over two years that Davy estimated, if the Minister is going to facilitate that additional cost, it has a big financial implication for families.  For example, a family renting the average family home in Dublin at &euro;1,500, would have to pay an extra &euro;4,500 over the three years.<\/p> <p>  In arguing against using the consumer price index, the Minister said that part of the problem is that it would not allow any rent increases.  That is precisely the point.  These families cannot take any extra rent increase.  At a time when the market is already providing healthy yields, I do not understand.  In the Second Stage debate I heard the general argument.  However, based on the detail of what the Minister announced today, I do not accept the logic of it.  I do not see evidence that a more constraining approach to rent inflation would have any negative impact on either existing levels of stock in the rental sector or future levels of investment.<\/p> <p>  I am also very concerned that by starting with Dublin city and county, and Cork, significant portions of the State are left out.  I know the Minister has a mechanism in there, but for those other geographical areas to qualify for the scheme, their rents will have to increase to the rates in Dublin and Cork, which means that those people will have to suffer the more dramatic rent increases that people in Dublin and Cork have experienced in recent years and then be hit with a further 12% in three years.<\/p> <p>  I am expressing frustration.  I know it is Fine Gael and that party does not like intervention in the market.  If Deputy Noonan were not Minister for Finance, I am sure the Minister, Deputy Coveney, could get a better deal than the one he got.<\/p><p>However, based on the Minister's figures, this is a really bad deal for struggling renters and a really good deal for institutional investors.  I will, therefore, press the amendment, although I do not want to get into the detail because we have already had that discussion.  If the consumer price index is not the right index, that is fine, but this is not the right mechanism either.  It will not provide the relief for struggling renting families or individuals that the Minister claimed today at the press conference.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12016121300002#EEE02500","speaker":"1215","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481638200,"counter":986,"content":"<p>I do not agree.  Much of the response from the organisations referred to by Deputy &Oacute; Broin, such as Focus Ireland, the Simon Community and the Peter McVerry Trust, has been welcoming of what was introduced today.  I am sure some people would have liked us to have gone further, but we are talking about something that has never happened before.  It certainly has not happened in recent political history anyway.  The State has decided to put a limit on rental increases and a pretty modest one too.<\/p> <p>  I took a lot of soundings and advice before settling on a figure.  This was not a horse trading session with the Department of Finance.  We considered the possibility of the CPI plus 3%, the CPI plus 2% and a figure of medium term economic growth, which is about 3.25%.  We considered what is seen as a reasonable and modest rate of return for the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, which is 4%.  We considered the European Central Bank's target for inflation, which is 2%, plus a 2% yield on top of that, which is also 4%.  We also examined what is happening in other countries and cities where there is intervention in the rental market.  Berlin, for example, has a cumulative limit over three years of no more than 20%, which is significantly higher than 4% or 5%.  We are trying to signal to investors that it makes sense to invest in rental property in Ireland and that there is opportunity for growth, but that it is limited and modest.  The current extraordinary rates of rental inflation must end within the rent pressure zones.  Tenants in Cork city or Dublin who have a rent review coming up in January or February will be relieved as they know they could probably have anticipated an increase of 15%, 16% or 20%, depending on location, but now the maximum increase will be 4%.  <\/p> <p>  The other thing I keep hearing people say today is that this is a 12% increase over three years.  That is not necessarily the case.  All tenancies are now restricted to two-year rent review periods.  There cannot be a review except after 24 months.  Many people, including those in rent pressure zones, will not have a rent review until possibly the middle of next year.  It might be 18 months away.  The rent review that will then be applied will be subject to a maximum increase of 4%.  For many, it will be nowhere near 12% over the next three years.  It might be less than 8%.  It will depend on where they are in the cycle of reviews.  The two-year rent review restriction will continue to apply until the rent review comes up and, if they are in a rent pressure zone, after that there is an annual ceiling allowed of 4%.  As stated, from what I can see this compares pretty well with what is seen as a reasonable but modest level of rental inflation in other jurisdictions.<\/p> <p>  I have spoken about this balance repeatedly.  There are far more tenants than there are landlords.  Therefore, the campaign for many tenants who are under genuine and serious pressure is significant politically, but we will not have a functioning market if more landlords do not come into the market and existing landlords do not want to stay.  We want to provide for some growth and rental appreciation, or modest increases, over the designated period for the rent pressure zones.  At the same time, we want to provide a total change in terms of the expectation for tenants as regards the level of rental increases.<\/p> <p>  A fair point has been made about the areas outside the four Dublin areas and Cork.  In the next three months or so, the Residential Tenancies Board will be able to give me information and recommendations on the basis of local electoral areas - in other words, local wards within local authority areas.  We will be able to have a much more granular and accurate assessment of areas.  This may result in some areas in Dublin falling outside of the rent pressure zone, but it will result in some areas outside of Dublin and Cork - perhaps parts of counties Galway, Meath and Kildare - coming within it.  Fianna F&aacute;il has raised the issue this evening, but the way the system is designed allows designation to be granted.  We want it to start with a big bang, if one likes, in the two big cities - Dublin and Cork.  If we did not do that, the market would not take this as seriously as it is intended.<\/p> <p>  We asked what we needed to do in terms of a trigger threshold to bring in the whole of Dublin and the whole of Cork.  The Residential Tenancies Board can apply that threshold to other areas and if they qualify they qualify.  In effect, what is required is a sustained period of time where annual rental increases are above 7% and the average rent in the area above the national average.  Those are the two criteria.  We predict that other areas will meet the criteria.  The whole of County Meath probably does not qualify at the moment, but if broken into local electoral areas certain parts probably will qualify.  It is likewise for other counties and cities.  There is method in what we are proposing today.  This is about targeting areas that have genuine and real pressure for a sustained period so that we can give families that are renting some certainty and predictability on their next rent review.  At the same time, it will allow for a modest level of rental increase over the next three years after the designation is made.  For me, that is a reasonable balance.<\/p> <p>  We had almost 500 written submissions, including very detailed submissions from Fianna F&aacute;il and Sinn F&eacute;in.  If one were to look at a matrix of all the things Sinn F&eacute;in and Fianna F&aacute;il had sought in key areas, a lot of those boxes have been ticked.  However, it is not good for Ireland if we go below 4% in terms of a ceiling.  That would have a severe negative impact on supply, which is not a good thing.  We are seeing a dramatic growth in the private rental market and we need to continue to facilitate it with a lot of increased supply.  I am, therefore, concerned by requests to reduce the figure of 4% and do not want to go there.  There are many other things we can do.  In terms of designations, we can instruct the Residential Tenancies Board to examine areas outside Dublin and Cork more quickly.<\/p> <p>  If we start reducing the figure of 4%, however, we fundamentally undermine the core issue that has to be dealt with, which is the lack of supply.  Even though new properties coming onto the market are not affected, in terms of the appetite for investment, investors will look at the long-term impact of the rent pressure zones model on their investment.  I must advocate for a balanced approach that will deliver supply and ensure that landlords can make reasonable margins so that they stay in the sector and that tenants who are under pressure can sleep at night in the build up to rent reviews, knowing that nothing dramatic will be coming down the tracks, whether it is in 18 months time or eight weeks time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP12016121300002#FFF00200","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1481638200,"counter":987,"content":"<p>This is an important debate.

Were the Minister to restrict Airbnb lettings in Dublin to owner-occupied homes only, it would release approximately 1,200 homes.
