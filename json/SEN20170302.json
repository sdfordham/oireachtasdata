At this stage, she is probably fed up listening to me talk about the few issues I constantly raise.  I am always bringing the Minister of State back because I firmly believe that there is no follow-up.  When a Minister comes to the Chamber and we receive the answer, there is no follow-up from the health boards or the Department of Health.  That is a major issue for me.<\/p> <p>This matter relates to the paramedics and the prefabs where they are based in Carlow.  Following the health and safety audit that was carried out on the prefabs in which the Carlow paramedics and ambulance service are located, the prefabs were condemned and deemed unfit for purpose.  In light of this, I ask the Minister of State to give me an update on the situation.  As she will appreciate, the ambulance and paramedic staff constitute a vital asset to Carlow and the south east.  They provide assistance and support to local communities, especially at times of illness or tragedy.  Carlow ambulance service has 18 staff, four women and 14 men, who are based in two prefabs.  A small bit of work has been done.  When I first spoke to the Minister of State, the prefabs had been deemed unfit.  There were sewerage problems and only one shower for the 18 staff.  Although they are not all on duty at the same time, they need at least two or three showers in these locations.  The other issue I addressed is the fact that the stores are in a totally different building that is located away from the prefabs.  On winter evenings, this puts these paramedics and other staff in a very vulnerable position.  A few months ago, another health and safety audit was carried out and, again, the accommodation was deemed unfit for purpose.<\/p> <p>There is regular, ongoing health and safety training for paramedics and they do an excellent job.  I compliment the 18 paramedics and ambulance staff in Carlow on their work.  While some work has been done, it is unsuitable.  There is a massive hospital called St. Dympna's Hospital which has some empty rooms.  On the previous occasion, the Minister of State said she was considering putting in another prefab.  Would she consider putting them in the building?  How much work has been done?  We are dealing with taxpayers' money here.  These paramedics are great people and they come across so many vulnerable and very sick people.  What is the update?  Hopefully the Minister of State will have some good news for me.  I thank her for coming back in again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017030200002#A00400","speaker":"1395"},{"type":"speech","time":1488450600,"counter":10,"content":"<p>Before I read the reply, I want to reassure the Senators that when I take Commencement matters, I make it my business to go back to the Minister and speak to him personally.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Catherine Byrne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2186\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2186&amp;amp;pid=CatherineByrne&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=02\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I am sorry if Senator Murnane O'Connor has not received a response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017030200002#A00500","speaker":"1307","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488450600,"counter":12,"content":"<p>Yes, I have not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017030200002#B00200","speaker":"1395"},{"type":"speech","time":1488450600,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I will follow up on the matter.

As the Senator is aware, there have been difficulties recently with a prefabricated building that forms part of the station facilities at Carlow ambulance base, which is situated on the grounds of St. Dympna's Hospital.<\/p> <p>Following a review undertaken as part of a health and safety audit, urgent remedial works were carried out to ensure the immediate safety of the ambulance base.  These remedial works have been completed with the exception of fitted furnishings in the kitchen and the installation of new staff lockers.  I understand that this work is ongoing and is soon to be finished.<\/p> <p>While the base is functional at present, the national ambulance service has engaged with the HSE estates division with a view to finding new premises for the Carlow ambulance base.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, has been advised that agreement has now been reached in respect of a building situated at Elm Court, also on the grounds of St. Dympna's Hospital, that will be converted and modified to provide a new home for the Carlow ambulance base.  It is estimated that the cost of this work will be approximately &euro;300,000.  Works will commence later this year and are expected to be completed in early 2018.  The works will be funded from the minor capital programme.<\/p> <p>The Minister, Deputy Harris, has been assured by the national ambulance service that there will be no disruption to the provision of emergency ambulance services to the people of Carlow during the transition to the new base.  The House will be aware that the national ambulance service has undergone a significant process of modernisation in recent years and a number of important initiatives and developments have taken place.  We have established the national emergency operations centre and provided improved technology to improve response times.  We have developed the intermediate care service to provide lower acuity hospital transfers.  This frees up emergency ambulances for the more urgent cases.  Of course we have also established a permanent emergency aeromedical support service to provide more timely response to persons in rural areas.<\/p> <p>The ambulance reform programme is taking place against the backdrop of the HIQA review of ambulance services, which was published in late 2014, and the national ambulance service capacity review, which was published in 2016.  The capacity review, which was undertaken by Lightfoot Solutions, a UK-based consultation firm, examined all ambulance resource levels and distribution against demand and activity.  Implementation of the recommendations of the capacity review will require a multi-annual programme of phased investment in ambulance manpower vehicles and technology.  To this end, increased funding has been made available to the national ambulance service for 2017.<\/p> <p>The Senator referred to another point.  I will get more final dates in respect of the fitted furnishings in the kitchen and the installation of new staff lockers.

The meningitis B vaccine was rolled out last September and it came into operation last December.  It was a positive initiative led by the Department of Health.<\/p> <p>A vaccination programme at this level is important.  It mainly affects people between the ages of one and five years, as well as from 13 to 18 years.  These are the two age groups most affected by meningitis B.<\/p> <p>The unfortunate side effects of meningitis B are well documented.  There are approximately 170 cases in Ireland every year.  A total of 10% of these sufferers could face amputation, brain damage and loss of hearing.  Unfortunately, 33% of this group face a lower IQ.  Clearly, it is a major issue.<\/p> <p>I compliment the work of the Department of Health on rolling out this important programme.  Similar programmes have been rolled out in other countries, such as New Zealand.  Those countries have seen a dramatic reduction in meningitis B over the lifetime of the programme.<\/p> <p>My major concern about the programme is that it goes from September onwards.  In other words, if a child is born in September, he or she is included in the programme.  We need to consider a programme going backwards to pick up the 1.2 million children aged between six months of age and 18 years of age.  The Government must invest in such a programme because it has long-term benefits for the State and the population.<\/p> <p>The cost of getting the vaccination privately is high.  For example, let us suppose a child is less than nine months of age.  That child must get three jabs, and it costs &euro;150 per jab plus &euro;30 for the visit to the doctor.  That is a significant cost.  If the child is over nine months of age, it is down to two jabs at &euro;150 per jab plus &euro;30 for the cost of a doctor's visit.<\/p> <p>We are now running a two-tier health service.  We are heading for a situation where only those who can afford the vaccination can get it.  That is a major concern for the general population.  Parents have contacted me with concerns over meningitis.  An unfortunate case arose in Cork in the past two weeks.  There is broad concern about the disease.  The cost issue for young families is considerable.  I hope that the Department of Health can put in place a programme to cover the people who are not vaccinated.  We have seen catch-up elements as part of other programmes.  We need the Minister to look at putting in place a catch-up programme to catch the 1.2 million children in the State who are not tied in to this programme.<\/p> <p>We have seen the effects of meningitis.  The recent vaccination programme has been a great success, but we need to go from September backwards and tie in all those people who need this vaccination.  The vaccination programme is a great programme.  We should promote it and recognise what it has delivered.  However, we should go backwards and look at the 1.2 million who are not in this loop.  If we do not, the knock-on effects will be horrendous.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017030200002#B00800","speaker":"1386"},{"type":"speech","time":1488450600,"counter":19,"content":"<p>On behalf of the Minister, Deputy Harris, I thank Senator Lombard for giving me the opportunity to update the House on this important matter.  Meningococcal disease is a vaccine-preventable disease which has a high mortality rate if untreated.  It is statutorily notifiable in Ireland under the Infectious Diseases (Amendment) Regulations 2016.  However, this does not require reporting of individual strains.  The annual epidemiological report for 2015, published by the health protection surveillance centre of the HSE in December 2016, indicates that between 1999 and 2012, a marked downward trend in invasive meningococcal disease was observed.  In 1999 there were 536 cases and in 2012 there were 66 cases, a decline of almost 88%.  In Ireland in 2015, meningococcal B was the pathogen most commonly associated with invasive meningococcal disease, accounting for 57.3% of the 75 notifications that year.  Age-specific incidence rates show that the highest rates are in infants less than one year of age.  The vaccine used in Ireland is Bexsero.  In January 2013 the vaccine received marketing authorisation from the European Commission.  The immunisation programme in Ireland is based on the advice of the national immunisation advisory committee.  The NIAC is a committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland comprised of experts in a number of specialties including infectious diseases, paediatrics and public health.<\/p> <p>In December 2013, the NIAC issued guidelines relating to the use of this vaccination in the control of clusters or outbreaks of meningococcal B disease.  The vaccine has been used in accordance with these guidelines, along with other measures, to control outbreaks of the disease.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Catherine Byrne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2186\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2186&amp;amp;pid=CatherineByrne&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=02\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->On 23 January 2015 the chair of National Immunisation Advisory Committee wrote to the chief medical officer strongly recommending that meningococcal B, or MenB, vaccine be included in the primary childhood immunisation programme, if the vaccine can be made available at a cost-effective price.  In Ireland, both childhood and adult immunisation programmes are delivered by the HSE.  The HSE service plan 2016 included additional funding of &euro;2.5 million for the expansion of the primary childhood immunisation schedule.  Two changes were made to the primary childhood immunisation schedule and I am happy to inform the House that, from 1 December 2016, all babies born on or after 1 October 2016 are eligible to receive the MenB and rotavirus vaccines.<\/p><p>The HSE national cold chain service has distributed 35,500 doses of the MenB vaccine to date.

The real issue is that, going forward, we have to consider such a catch-up programme.  Other countries like New Zealand that have put in place a catch-up programme have seen amazing reductions in meningitis B.  One of the key issues is that of planning that catch-up programme and putting it in place.  That some 1.2 million people are exposed to this issue makes it a big issue for us all.

These people have been puzzled, to say the least, by two related phenomena in the sector.  The first is that a number of employers declare they cannot fund redundancy payments, leaving the workers to pursue their statutory entitlements via the Social Insurance Fund.  This situation creates a number of problems for the workers in question.  For starters, they lose their right to notice, leaving them short between one and eight weeks' pay, which is a significant loss.  Second, they have to wait for payment for months, sometimes up to one year if they are taking cases through the Workplace Relations Commission to recover their redundancy entitlements.  A huge amount of stress and worry is involved for those workers.<\/p><p>What has been even more frustrating is the regular sight of companies that declared they were unable to pay redundancy not only continuing to trade but actually winning public contracts for more work.  It seems bizarre that this practice could happen.  It appears, I regret to say, to be a regular feature of the construction sector.<\/p><p>I want to give the Minister of State a couple of examples in this regard.  As one of the company names is actually the name of an individual, I will not mention the name out of respect for the rules of the Chamber, but I can supply the Minister of State with the name of the company afterwards.  This medium-size contractor let workers go, declaring it could not fund redundancies, and left the workers to recoup moneys via the taxpayer and the Social Insurance Fund.  However, the company continued to trade, it won a contract to build the public swimming pool at Nenagh, County Tipperary, and it has since won substantial public contracts at Athlone Castle and with the Department of Education and Skills - a current &euro;8 million project at Ballyhaunis community school has been given to this company.  It seems baffling that a company that declares it has no money to pay redundancy continues to win public contracts.<\/p><p>Another company, an agency specialising in contract labour, has regularly laid off workers and declared it has no funds to pay redundancy.  The same agency continues to trade and continues to be a major supplier to a wide range of public contracts.  Interestingly, when trade unions are taking cases for redundancy to what was the Rights Commissioner Service, now the Workplace Relations Commission, the labour agency would not even bother to turn up.  The union would win the case and apply directly for payment to the Social Insurance Fund.<\/p><p>This begs the question of whether the Department of Social Protection is pursuing these moneys.  Can the Minister of State explain how such companies can continue to tender for and win public contracts?  I note from a report in the <i>Irish Independent <\/i>that the Department of Social Protection has written off more than &euro;100 million of PRSI debt owed by thousands of firms.  The same report tells us that the total debt pile owed by 13,600 companies has soared to nearly &euro;500 million, and that just 10% of this debt is deemed recoverable.  The report goes on to say the Department seeks recovery of debt directly from employers who continue to trade after getting into difficulty.  I have a real concern that the Department may not have been relaying information about companies in debt to the Social Insurance Fund to other Government Departments.  The examples I am citing are clear proof that something fundamental is wrong here.  I wonder whether the examples I am quoting are just the tip of the iceberg.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017030200002#C00600","speaker":"1389"},{"type":"speech","time":1488450600,"counter":27,"content":"<p>First, I want to address Senator Gavan's remarks on our previous engagement.

Under the Redundancy Payments Acts 1967 to 2013, eligible employees who lose employment as a result of redundancy are entitled to two weeks' statutory redundancy payment for every year of service, plus a bonus week.  In the first instance, it is the responsibility of the employer to pay statutory redundancy to all those eligible.  However, the Social Insurance Fund provides a safety net for employees in situations where the employer is insolvent or in financial distress to the extent that it cannot fund the redundancy payments.<\/p> <p>In situations where an employer becomes insolvent or is in financial difficulties, and is unable to make these payments, the Social Insurance Fund steps into the shoes of the employer and makes statutory redundancy payments directly to the employees concerned.  In such situations, a debt is then created on the employer for the full amount and the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, can confirm that the Department of Social Protection actively pursues the recovery of the debt to the extent that it is able to do so.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Catherine Byrne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2186\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2186&amp;amp;pid=CatherineByrne&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=02\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The fact that a firm is in such severe financial difficulty that it becomes insolvent or is otherwise unable to fund statutory redundancy payments means that much of the debt is unlikely ever to be recovered.  This position is recognised by the Comptroller and Auditor General and noted in the statutory accounts of the Social Insurance Fund.  Nevertheless, the Department of Social Protection has an employer debt management policy in place which it actively implements.  In support of this policy a new debt recovery and accounting IT system was introduced in 2014 which provides structured support for the debt recovery process.  As part of this policy, when redundancy payments have been made from the Social Insurance Fund, the Department of Social Protection liaises with those employers continuing to trade in a constructive manner in order to recover the debt.  In doing this, it takes account of the financial position of each company and tailors the debt management process to suit individual circumstances, balancing the requirement to recover the debt on behalf of the fund with the concern not to further jeopardise the financial position of the employer.  This is both to protect remaining jobs and to enhance the prospects of ultimately recovering the full debt.  For this reason, the debt management policy does not include an exclusion from tendering for public contracts.  It is not in the interests of the Department of Social Protection to put barriers in the way of employers in obtaining contracts for work, rather it is important that those companies with a debt to the Social Insurance Fund continue to trade in order that they remain viable and in a position to repay that debt.  <\/p><p>Debt owed to the Social Insurance Fund by employers is only written off where the Department of Social Protection is completely satisfied, in line with the Comptroller and Auditor General's requirements, that the debt is not recoverable and debt write-offs are only carried out with the sanction of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017030200002#C00900","speaker":"1307","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488450600,"counter":31,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her response.

I will talk about Poolbeg West and the 3,000 homes that will I hope be built there in the coming years.  For young people, like those in the Visitors Gallery, we are talking about building a sustainable city with a properly integrated social mix.<\/p> <p>I will give some of the history of the area.  People living in the Ringsend, Sandymount and Pearse Street area have a history of providing homes for themselves.  Way back in the 1980s we started to build affordable housing through co-operative movements.  When the docklands were developed, the community devised a scheme that provided for 20% social and affordable housing.  It was taken on board by the then Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Noel Dempsey, and developed as Part V housing.  In the Ringsend area alone about 150 affordable housing units have been generated.  They are very different.  Because there is such a strong tradition of providing affordable homes in the area, very few people are in arrears.  Many people living in affordable and council housing fell into arrears during the recession, but that has not happened in our community because of that strong tradition.  In many ways, we would not have a housing crisis if the former Minister, Martin Cullen, had not undermined the very good legislation brought forward by his predecessor, Noel Dempsey.  <\/p> <p>There were no social or affordable units provided during the boom because the legislation had been watered down to such an extent that very few social or affordable homes were provided during that period.  Now that we are starting to see new homes being built, there is the possibility to make sure we will have sustainable integrated communities.  The pilot scheme can start in Poolbeg West, on the old Irish Glass Bottle site, on which it is proposed to provide 3,000 new homes.  I ask the Minister of State to look seriously at the options for developing affordable housing, including for renting, on that site.  There are many working people living on Pearse Street and in Ringsend and Sandymount who cannot afford to meet the huge market costs.  We want to have a sustainable city and sustainable communities.  There is a pilot scheme taking place on Dublin City Council land.  The housing action group that has emerged from the community is made up of very reasonable people who want to develop a model that will work.  They have engaged positively with the receiver because we understand the land is not owned by the State.  They have met most of the voluntary housing bodies.  We can develop the model of affordable homes, including for renting, and establish how they would be managed into the future because sustainability is important.  It has been gotten wrong in cases before.  The people concerned met department officials this week.  The meeting was supposed to last for only about half an hour or 45 minutes, but it went on for nearly two hours at the officials' request because they were interested in hearing about the new developments and the thought process involved.  <\/p> <p>What do I want from the Minister of State today?  Affordable homes, including for renting, which the Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, want to see provided, can be developed.  The legislation in place only specifies a figure of 10% for social housing.  To have sustainable communities, we need a mix.  <\/p> <p>I will take some time off at the end because this element is important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017030200002#D00500","speaker":"1417"},{"type":"speech","time":1488450600,"counter":35,"content":"<p>The Senator can have a further chat afterwards.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017030200002#D00600","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1488450600,"counter":36,"content":"<p>We need some indication that the SDZ can be opened up in a way that was able to be done successfully in the past and to perhaps develop a model that could be implemented across the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017030200002#D00700","speaker":"1417"},{"type":"speech","time":1488450600,"counter":37,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this issue and giving me the chance to talk about it.

The Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, the Department and I are working very closely on the different models and ways of doing this because we want to achieve it.  I am glad that the group had a chance to meet the officials last week, although, knowing some of the officials involved, housing was probably not the only issue they discussed.  I am sure the Dublin football team came into the conversation at some stage, which is why the meeting took two hours.  I am glad that they had a chance to meet and have that engagement.  We want to engage with communities that have ideas and solutions and are prepared to work with all involved, including the receivers.  We want to make that connection through the action plan for housing with local authorities in working with communities and through the Department.  We are all on the same page in trying to achieve the best results on these sites and we will use taxpayers' money where we can on site.<\/p> <p>The Senator mentioned sustainable cities and sustainable housing.  That is what we are trying to achieve.  Housing is the number one priority for the Government, the Department and the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney.

We have to make sure that we are getting a kick-back on the price.<br\/><br\/>Delivering extra supply across all tenures is agreed by all as the key to addressing our shared housing challenges.  We have ample land and planning permission to secure the sustainable development of Dublin and at more affordable prices.  Last May the Government took the decision to designate Poolbeg west as a strategic development zone, SDZ, because of its potential to deliver a big element of the extra homes we need right in the centre of our capital and on a superb site.  The process has moved forward with Dublin City Council&rsquo;s publication, for public consultation, of a detailed planning scheme for the area under the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.  Comments and observations on the scheme must be submitted to Dublin City Council by 8 March 2017.  The Minister is a statutory consultee under the aforementioned Act and he intends to indicate that, in broad terms, the draft planning scheme outlines a rational and reasonable approach to the development of this strategic site.  <br\/><br\/>The Minister will also be emphasising that a key requirement of Rebuilding Ireland is the promotion of sustainable and mixed communities, which is exactly what the Senator is seeking.  In this regard, he has asked the Department to explore new models for the maximisation of a mixed tenure approach on this site.  In particular, we want to secure additional social housing well in excess of the 10% social housing requirement guaranteed under Part V.  We believe it is crucial that people who need social housing and key workers who cannot afford high-end rents can also live in the city centre and in areas like Poolbeg.<br\/><br\/>I am glad to report that my Department is engaged with this issue and is working with all the relevant interests including NAMA, Dublin City Council and, as the Senator mentioned, the local community.  It is essential that this communication continues.  Therefore, rather than a pilot scheme <i>per se<\/i>, we are determined to progress on an agreed basis with an approach to a mixed tenure model that would deliver for the owners of the lands covered by the draft planning scheme and also for those communities who want and need to see homes delivered in the area that meet their aspirations.<br\/><br\/>I know that the issue of a pilot scheme has been discussed here previously.  As I understand it, the Senator will be happy once this scheme actually happens.  We hope that this scheme will be a top-class model that can be rolled out at other sites.  This is a key site, as Senator Humphreys said, and we must get this right.  All involved want to see what Senator Humphreys has outlined and hopefully that can be achieved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017030200002#D00800","speaker":"1264","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488450600,"counter":39,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for State for his reply.

They should be able to do this online and there should be a number for a direct line for people to sort this out.  No grants have been given to date, and from an administration perspective, the resources do not seem to have been given to the Revenue Commissioners to deal with the number of people applying for these grants.  It can be very worrying, especially for first-time buyers who are very nervous about the purchasing process.  When there are so many people looking to buy in the market, builders can pick and choose who will buy the houses.

I raise a particular issue that has been raised in the Chamber before, which is the ongoing strike at the Hastings garage in Westport.  This dispute is of great concern and there are men on their fourth week of strike.  They have stood out in all weather for the past four weeks and their cause is absolutely just.  The Labour Court has declared they should get a decent redundancy payment but the Tim Hastings garage has refused point blank to implement that recommendation.  These people on strike have exhausted the industrial relations machinery of the State and I will speak to three aspects of the issue.<\/p> <p>The first is the role that Volkswagen Ireland should be playing in this dispute.  This is one of its dealers and it is a partner of the Hastings garage.  Unfortunately, to date it has decided to hide and it refuses to answer e-mails or phone calls.  It wants the issue to go away but the message I want to give here very clearly is that Volkswagen has a role to play in it.  For every day this strike continues to go on, it is a day of shame for Volkswagen Ireland for not fulfilling its responsibilities to the workers who have given a life of service to the Tim Hastings garage.  I call on Volkswagen Ireland to come out from its hiding place, face up to its responsibilities and play a constructive part in resolving this dispute.<\/p> <p>The second issue I raise is the silence of public representatives from Mayo because, to be frank, the only representative to date who has tried to engage and build a solution is my colleague, Senator Rose Conway-Walsh.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Paul Gavan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2469\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2469&amp;amp;pid=PaulGavan&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=02\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I have been stunned by the silence of Fine Gael representatives in particular - there are quite a few of them in Mayo - and, indeed, those in Fianna F&aacute;il for that matter.

They run these pages and the people who visit them, thinking that they relate to their communities, tend to join.  Over a period, these trolls build up a serious number of friends.  They then start working on the news themselves and putting in their own news and take away people's credibility by putting in false news.  Before that, they cry wolf and people stop listening, so they go under this new fake news.  I am calling for accountability in respect of these pages.  If one contacts Facebook or Twitter or whatever Internet company is hosting such pages, they cannot be found.  Many people have been badly hurt and their credibility has been taken away.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017030200002#H00700","speaker":"1423"},{"type":"speech","time":1488450600,"counter":58,"content":"<p>Badly maligned perhaps.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017030200002#H00800","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1488450600,"counter":59,"content":"<p>Yes, badly maligned.

Last night's events in Leinster House were particularly emotional, particularly for anybody who witnessed what happened in the D&aacute;il.  After years of people complaining, the Taoiseach, on behalf of the Government and the State, formally recognised the ethnicity of the Traveller community.  What happened is great credit to a number of people in this House.  In particular, I want to mention Senator Mac Lochlainn who, along with myself and others, pursued this issue through the offices of what was then the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality in recent years.  The Senator produced a report for the committee which advocated in favour of ethnicity being recognised.  The report in question enjoyed cross-party support.  What was wonderful about last night, and many here might agree, was that a debate on any Traveller issue in this House or in the Lower House 20 years ago would not necessarily have involved people speaking with one voice.  However, last night every political leader from every political party was absolutely in agreement with the statement that was made.  It was incredibly emotional.<\/p> <p>I want to pay tribute to the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton.  Senator Kelleher, Senator Mac Lochlainn and I have been meeting the Minister of State regularly over the past year, encouraging him and getting updates on progress in respect of what he was trying to achieve, and he did it.  He is to be commended for that.<\/p> <p>For those who may have had an academic argument or discussion as to the reason for recognition of ethnicity, if they could see the emotion from the Traveller groups last night in the Gallery, the standing ovation they got from Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, the tears that were shed and the hugs and embraces that were engaged in - it was quite remarkable.  Sometimes in this House we might lose faith in politics.  I know that the Traveller groups had their faith in the political system sorely tested over the past number of years.  They have experienced tragedies, as we all know.  I am of the view that yesterday was a start of a new engagement and provides a positive platform to engage on a number of issues over the coming years.  I want to put on the record of the House my congratulations to the Government, to the Taoiseach - who spoke so beautifully, including a phrase in Cant - but particularly to the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton.  When someone does the work and makes the difference, he or she is to be commended and I want to do that today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017030200002#H01300","speaker":"1410"},{"type":"speech","time":1488450600,"counter":64,"content":"<p>I support the comments made by Senator Butler regarding the anonymous trolling that happens on Facebook and other blog pages.  I had personal experience of that in a previous Seanad when I famously, or perhaps infamously, made a comment about the seagull situation in Dublin.  What my family and I had to undergo on the blog pages for a week afterwards was horrendous.  It was terribly upsetting because at the time I did not quite understand that type of comment.  I did speak subsequently about it here in the Seanad and, of course, I drew all the trolls on me again, as indeed Senator Butler will, no doubt.  If someone wants to express an opinion in a newspaper, writing to <i>The Irish Times<\/i>or some other publication, he or she would have to give his or her name and stand over what he or she says.  I have no problem whatsoever with that.  These nameless, faceless people who obviously have no lives to live of their own and spend their entire time on their computers watching to see who they can attack or abuse next are different.  One guy suggested, in quite a detailed manner, that I should be physically assaulted.  I have experienced it.  Something needs to be done.  Eventually, something will have to be done to protect the rights of individuals.  In that context, I commend Senator Butler on raising the issue.<\/p><p>During the lifetime of a previous Seanad, I raised a matter regarding the provision of additional services for the handicapped at rural railway stations and action was taken in respect of it.  I was zoning in on Charleville in particular at that time, which is the station I use when I travel to Dublin by train.  I had watched many elderly people and invalids having to take their cases and climb up a very steep metal staircase to get from one side of the platform to the other.  Ultimately, and in fairness to Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, lift services were provided at Charleville.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Ned O'Sullivan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2233\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2233&amp;amp;pid=NedOSullivan&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=02\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->However, it has been brought to my attention that there are still quite a number of rural railway stations that do not have that facility.

It concerns the urgent care unit in Blanchardstown.  There was a demonstration of the new model this morning.  It is welcome that building is due to start in May.  The unit will cater for 20% of the cases that normally arrive in a paediatric hospital.  I take the opportunity to commend the wonderful doctors, nurses and staff at Temple Street Hospital and thank them for the decades of service they have given to the people of north Dublin.  The new unit will be 50,000 square feet in size and provide consultant-delivered emergency care.  It will have short-stay observation unit beds and be staffed by senior clinical paediatricians.  It will be open from 8 a.m. until midnight and also provide outpatient services.  This is real for the people of the region, particularly those living in Fingal.  Commute time to the unit will be 36 minutes from Skerries, 30 minutes from Rush, 16 minutes from Swords, 24 minutes from Balbriggan and only 20 minutes from Malahide and Portmarnock.  As I said, building will start in May, to which we all look forward.  However, there is a need for a day hospital in Swords in support of the principle that patients be treated as close to their homes as possible in the most appropriate and cost-effective setting.  As I have said before, many procedures can be carried out in day hospitals.  There are numerous such hospitals around the country and we need one in Swords.  It would make a huge dent in waiting lists.  I commend the Minister for Health for the progress made to date in this regard.  Will the Leader to invite him to come to the House to express his views on day hospitals and the role they can play in addressing waiting lists?  In day hospitals one does not see operations cancelled owing to overcrowding in emergency departments.  This means that such patients do not end up presenting at emergency departments.  I, therefore, ask the Leader to invite the Minister to come to the House to express his views on day hospitals and their role in reducing waiting lists and within the health service more generally, as well as his plans in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017030200002#J00200","speaker":"1421"},{"type":"speech","time":1488450600,"counter":67,"content":"<p>Before calling Senator Gerard P.

While that in itself is good, let us examine it more closely.  It is the most cynical move I have ever seen in my life.  In fact, it is disgusting that this organisation trumpets its tremendous profits, given that they were gained on the backs of citizens who were thrown out of their houses onto the streets.  Many years ago I lost my house to a bank and know the pain and suffering involved.  I also know how long it takes to get over a repossession.  I am still paying off my debts.  I know what it is like and was appalled to hear the CEO talk casually about how the bank still had some distressed mortgages on its books which it would sell on, not to a vulture fund but to a financial institution.  However, as the Leader and everyone else in this House knows, highly distressed mortgages are not sold on to entities that want to allow families to remain in their homes.  The bank is selling them to kill off the debts on its balance sheet.  The citizens of this country have been good.  They have helped to rebuild it.  In no uncertain terms, the recovery is due largely to the efforts of the last Government of Fine Gael and the Labour Party.  It put us through hell, but at the end of the day, we are seeing the economy recover.  It is now time for the banks that were saved to start being good corporate citizens by recognising the pain and suffering they inflicted.  AIB went as far as trying to diddle people out of money by not passing on tracker mortgage rate reductions.  I ask the Leader to organise a debate with the relevant Ministers on what constitutes good corporate citizenship on the part of the banks and financial institutions.  I would like to send a message to the CEO of the AIB to the effect that he should go away and learn how to show a little citizenship and humility and thank the people of the country who saved him, his bank and his job.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017030200002#J00400","speaker":"1390"},{"type":"speech","time":1488450600,"counter":69,"content":"<p>I join others in expressing solidarity with all members of the Traveller community and their settled allies following yesterday's historic announcement.

One man tragically lost his life.  Many cars were involved in the accident.  There was severe weather along the stretch of road and I have e-mailed the CEO of Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, formerly the National Roads Authority, Mr. Michael Nolan, asking him to carry out an investigation into the circumstances of the accident.  The stretch of road in question is in County Tipperary but it leads towards Gooig bog.  Many of people have told me there are issues relating to the road in terms of flooding and aquaplaning.  I pass my sympathies to the family of the man who lost his life on the route last night.  We need to ensure that the route is safe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017030200002#K01600","speaker":"1374"},{"type":"speech","time":1488450600,"counter":95,"content":"<p>The good news is that figures from the Central Statistics Office, CSO, show that there are 44,000 fewer unemployed people than this time last year, which is a major improvement.  Now that we have got over the major unemployment difficulty, we need to start planning for the long term.  Part of that planning should involve infrastructure development.  We have not had a major debate on that matter.  Senator Kieran O'Donnell has raised the Cork to Limerick road or, as he would say, the Limerick to Cork road, and the Cork city north ring road.  We need to plan for infrastructure development and set out a clear plan including sourcing the funding to do this work.<\/p> <p>The population of the country will continue to increase.  There is no point in responding to it after it has increased.  We need to plan for the increase.  Part of it is about rail, road and the whole infrastructure, including our health care system, school system and third-level institutions.  We do much of our planning in our urban areas in a piecemeal fashion.  We produced a Cork area strategic plan.  Although it was great to do a plan, not all of it was implemented, and it causes the bottlenecks that subsequently arise.

The figures available last week show that 2,161 applications have been made and 307 have been approved to proceed to finality.  As the Senator quite rightly said, the scheme is about assisting first-time buyers to put together a deposit and encouraging the construction of new homes.  The Minister is committed to commissioning an independent review and impact assessment of the scheme with the budget of 2018.  The Senator made that the point that it should be easier for people to access the scheme.  I am happy to talk to her about it and then to converse with the Minister.<\/p> <p>Senator Freeman raised the issue of mental health.  I am unfamiliar with the case she mentioned.  I understand that 17 year olds go to child and adolescent mental health service, CAMHS, and persons over the age of 18 go to the adult psychiatry services.  The Minister of State responsible for mental health services is committed to improving access to mental health services.  She has received the highest budget ever for mental health services.  We must ensure people can access the available services.  It is important to highlight that the Department and the HSE, through the existing liaison psychiatric service for hospitals, provides psychiatric consultant-led cover in hospital and emergency departments for both out-of-hours and weekends, and there is a national clinical programme for the assessment and management of self-harm.  These have all been initiated and are in place.  I am sorry that Senator Freeman is not here.  If she wants to give me the details of the case, I am happy to talk to the Minister about the matter.<\/p> <p>It is important to put on record that an awful lot of work is being done in our health system around mental health.  For the impression to be created that there is not and that nothing is being done is a bit unfair to the people who work in the system.  A great deal of work is being done.  For example, an additional &euro;2 million was made available in 2016 to address the specific mental health needs of homeless persons in Dublin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017030200002#L00300","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1488450600,"counter":98,"content":"<p>I do not think people realise, and it is happens regularly, the effect that the noise generated by phones located near recording equipment has on the people who are seated in front of me, in particular the person who must wear earphones.

There has been investment and we have a Minister of State committed to the service.<\/p> <p>Senator Gavan raised the issue of the Hastings garage.  It is an issue that Senator Rose Conway-Walsh also has raised.  I am unfamiliar with the case.  I do not hide behind a cloak or relationship with anybody.  If there is a Labour Court or Workplace Relations Commission finding, there is a need for it to be upheld and implemented.  There is also a need for both sides to talk.  The Senator referenced the issue of Volkswagen Ireland.  Perhaps it has a role.  I would maybe agree with the Senator on the matter but I am unfamiliar with the specifics of the case.  It is important that people talk.  If workers' entitlements and rights have been awarded by the mechanisms of the State, they should be honoured, in my opinion.<\/p> <p>Senator Ruane mentioned the Heritage Bill.  We will debate the legislation later today so we can discuss her matter at that time.<\/p> <p>The Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government will be here on 21 March to discuss and present to the House an update on the action plan on housing.  On that occasion we can debate the issues Senator Ruane raised about housing.<\/p> <p>Senators Butler and Ned O'Sullivan raised the issue of accountability in terms of social media, in particular Facebook.  The Senators are right that there is a need for accountability and to ensure fake news is not promulgated or that a person's name or character is not maligned.  Those of us who are in the public eye as politicians or public people receive a lot of commentary on our Facebook or social media feeds.  Some of it is done by trolls and some is a genuine engagement in discussion.  There is no place for cowardly comments or acts being made against people who genuinely hold views.  There is a need for accountability.<\/p> <p>Senators &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, Warfield, Kieran O'Donnell and Reilly mentioned the importance of yesterday's decision by the Government and the declaration by an Taoiseach about Traveller ethnicity.  Yesterday, remarks were made about it in the House during the Order of Business.  As Leader, I congratulate the Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality, Deputy Stanton, on his role.  Yesterday, in his absence, I paid tribute to Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, the former Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality, and Senators Mac Lochlainn and Kelleher on the work they have done in this area.<\/p> <p>Today is an important day of celebration.  Senator Warfield quoted a folk song.  The words of a Christy Moore song came to my mind, \"This the day the cuckoo likes and so do I.\"  It is a new beginning and new dawn for the Traveller community.  As I said yesterday, I had the pleasure of serving as chair of the Traveller consultative committee on Cork City Council.  Yesterday was a good day for the men and women who engage positively, who want to see their lives improved and who want to see the Traveller community respected and recognised.  I commend all the people who were involved in the work to make yesterday happen.  As the Senators correctly said, 20 years ago the Government would have been in a different space and there would have been political rivalry in terms of different sides of the debate.  Yesterday and today are good days.<\/p> <p>Senator Ned O'Sullivan also referenced the issue of disability access at rural train stations.  He is right to highlight the matter.  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has a responsibility and an obligation to provide access for disabled persons and people who need assistance.  I am happy to invite the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to the House to debate the matter.  To expedite the matter I suggest the Senator tables a Commencement matter.  He made the valid point that Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has an obligation and duty that it must live up to.<\/p> <p>Senator Reilly raised the issue of health.  I congratulate him on the work he has done to provide health services in many parts of the north of this city.  I am happy to invite the Minister for Health to the House to discuss the matter raised by the Senator.<\/p> <p>Senator Colm Burke has highlighted the issue of building new hospitals.  We have not built too many new hospitals in a 40-year period.  As part of the overarching debate on health we should consider the matter.<\/p> <p>Senator Craughwell mentioned AIB.  I did not hear the radio interview given by Bernard Byrne this morning.  I heard the news headline that a proposal has been made to pay a &euro;250 million dividend to the State as shareholder.  All of us in this House fully understand how the public feel.  We feel frustrated and annoyed at the way banks have treated people, whether it is business owners or home owners.  These people have worked hard and are trying hard to retain their businesses or homes and to live in their homes.  I fully understand the remarks made by the Senator.  It is important that we, as a State, get our money back from the banks.  We bailed out the bank, in this case AIB, and we need to get money back as well.  We must strike a balance between restoring a bank to health but not at the expense of the customer or citizen.  I am sure and confident the Minister will be able to strike a balance.  As I said yesterday, it is important that banks work with people.  Banks must recognise that they have a role and a duty to play in working with people to ensure every effort is made to retain their homes or businesses.<\/p> <p>Senator Feighan mentioned the vote that took place in the House of Lords yesterday.  It is important for us to acknowledge that the Irish angle is very important.  The decision yesterday recognised that a debate is still taking place in England.  As Prime Minister May said, Brexit is Brexit.<\/p> <p>I commend Senator Richmond who has commenced his work as Chair of the committee doing preparatory work for the Seanad Brexit committee.  We need to highlight the importance of Ireland in the Brexit negotiations.  As Senator Feighan has said, we must tap into the goodwill that exists for Ireland.<\/p> <p>Senator Davitt made the very good suggestion that we should have a village hub.  Senators Davitt and Butler should get together to lobby about rates because both of them have banged that drum for a period in the House.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=02\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The contribution the Senator made this morning is worthwhile and one that should be put to the Ministers.

I believe we should all read the piece about water by Mr. Stephen Collins in this morning's edition of <i>The Irish Times<\/i>.  Maybe the Senators opposite will go back to Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin and ask him to stop playing politics.  Mr. Collins wrote &quot;Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s cynical approach to water charges has demonstrated that the party is unfit for government for the foreseeable future.&quot;  For me, that is the line of the morning.

It was an election gimmick to buy the farmers' vote.  For that reason, Fianna F&aacute;il colluded in it.  It was complete and absolute nonsense.  I wish to quote what the Taoiseach said during a Second Stage debate in the D&aacute;il on 15 December 1999.  He stated:<\/p><blockquote>The Minister referred to the issue of hedgerows, which really are corridors of wildlife.  I have had meetings with various groups who are interested in this.  The local authorities, for reasons of public safety, feasibility, etc., have, under contract in some cases, cut these hedgerows and the quality of the cutting has ranged from neat to environmental savagery.  I am glad to see that the Minister proposes to regulate this.  In Britain, the regulations are much stronger.  The species and licence requirements are identified and one just cannot cut at random because it is seen as a social and criminal offence to stray outside the legislation in that regard.  We may need to discuss all of these areas at some length on Committee Stage.  For instance, the Minister specified that hedgerows may only be cut during certain periods by public bodies, including local authorities, for reasons of public health or safety.  When the people of village X or Y get on to a hard pressed local authority, it will send down the flail-cutter to cut hedgerows, saying it had to do it for public health or safety because the people were complaining.  The legislation must be much tougher and regimented here in the sense that local authorities should be under no illusions that there are times specified in the Bill during which hedge-cutting and trimming may be legitimately carried out.  We do not want environmental savagery to which I referred to take place in the middle of the nesting season on the excuse that it is for public safety or health.<br \/><br \/>I recall being a member of Mayo County Council in the mid-1970s when a then independent member, the late Councillor Nellie Robinson from Ballina, introduced a by-law, the first lady member in Ireland to do so, whereby no hedge-cutting should take place during the nesting season.  She was before her time in that sense and I am glad to see that this kind of thing is now being recognised here.<\/blockquote> <p><!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator David Norris:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=1758\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1758&amp;amp;pid=DavidNorris&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=02\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Why is the Government doing a complete <i>volte-face<\/i>on what the Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, said so very clearly in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in 1999?

Similar studies have been taking place in Northern Ireland, England and Scotland where they have clearly indicated it is illegal to cut hedgerows from March to August.<\/p> <p>I have a problem speaking to this as a heritage Bill, as the last thing it seems to be doing is protecting our heritage.  One of main concerns relates to bird nesting patterns across the country.  The wren, blackbird, song thrush and robin nest in August; the bluefinch, yellowhammer, greenfinch, goldfinch etc. nest in September; and nesting in March is the curlew, which is on the red list because we have seen a drop of 86% in breeding pairs over the past 25 years.  The yellowhammer has seen a 61% decline in breeding pairs in Ireland since 1970.  Hedgerows play an important role within that.  We can also speak about their importance to bats, which are still feeding their young at that stage using hedgerows.  Hedgehogs are an endangered species across the country and they need hedgerows for food so they can lay down fat for hibernation.<\/p> <p>The accusation is levelled that anybody who wishes to stand up for the environment is from Dublin 4 and does not understand rural Ireland, as the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, recently shouted at me.  The argument is that if a person has never lived in rural Ireland, he or she does not understand it.  As I stated to the Minister of State, I have spent many a year in rural Ireland.  I worked in places from Donegal to Kerry, west Cork and Galway, in small villages and towns.  I very much understand the issues and everybody in the House wants to ensure rural Ireland is viable, with a strong agricultural community.  Destroying the food source of pollinators, however, such as the bees in hedgerows, will cause immense damage to farmers struggling for a living.<\/p> <p>Is there the possibility of compromise or a way forward?  My understanding is Fianna F&aacute;il will probably support the Government on this issue.  If the issue is road safety, let us examine it.  I certainly do not want to see anybody injured on our roads or cars damaged because of overgrown hedges.  It is a matter of compromise so let us look at cutting those hedges that abut onto roads.  We can examine the Road Traffic Acts and put in place legislation for where a danger exists, such as for pedestrians who are pushed further into the road because of an overgrown hedge.  If the Minister is open to it, the issue could be dealt with in the Bill before us today.<\/p> <p>The good Senator from Cork is sitting in front of me and unfortunately, he let the cat out of the bag when he made his contribution.

I ask the Minister to think very carefully as many farmers in the country depend on subvention from the European Union.  Grants are paid to tillage farmers and under various schemes across the country and these all have rules and regulations.  One could see an enormous loss of earnings for small tillage farmers if they do not maintain hedgerows to the standard laid down with regard to EU funding.  Farmers have raised the issue with me as not all of them see me as being anti-rural.  We want to see this work in the Twenty-six Counties and indeed in the Thirty-two Counties.

We discussed it at length on the last occasion.  Matters of road safety and the Road Traffic Act can be dealt with outside this issue.  It is not a road safety issue for farmers.  The Minister is suggesting roadside hedges be cut and that this is what many farmers disagree with.  A farmer said to me last night that hedges inside a field were cut, even though that did not have to happen.  Farmers have told me that it is not a big issue in the month of August.  There is an issue not only for the various environmental wildlife groups but also farmers.  I speak on behalf of the wildlife groups and farmers with whom I have consulted.  There is ample provision made for road safety.<\/p> <p>I turn to the Fianna F&aacute;il Party.  One of its Deputies has been replying to some of the letters sent by the different federations and using the Road Safety Act as the reason we have to cut and grub.  Senator David Norris referred to grubbing on the last occasion and said this was a grubby Bill.  It is certainly grubby.  Grubbing means taking the roots and branches and pulling out every component of the ecosystem.  As Senator Kevin Humphreys said, it deprives the people of Ireland of a beautiful heritage and wildlife of roosting.  It affects mammals and different wildlife species.  As a farmer's daughter, I am fundamentally opposed to it.  My father has passed away, but the land is still there.  One of the reasons I am here is that he used to bring me out onto the land, on which there were hedgerows.  He had a dairy herd.  What the Minister is prescribing is cutting in the month of August, lock, stock and barrel.  I fundamentally disagree with him.  <\/p> <p>I also fundamentally disagree with the proposal to carry out a survey.  It would be absolutely unscientific.  It would be a joke and totally flawed.  I suggest carrying out an environmental impact assessment of the hedgerow system and wildlife corridors throughout the Twenty-six Counties.  In that way we would be able to assess the true ecological value of the system from all perspectives, including climate change and drainage.  We would then gladly come back here and the Minister could prove me wrong, but what she is proposing at this stage is absolutely the wrong way for the country to go.  This is not about greening Ireland but destroying it.  It is an attempt to damage our natural environment.  It will damage the rural way of life and is potentially damaging to the farming community which, as Senator Kevin Humphreys said, wants to avail of all of the funding mechanisms available, including GLAS.  What the Minister is proposing can damage this for them and the livelihood of the small family farm in rural Ireland.  I am, therefore, fundamentally opposed to the Bill and hope the Minister can do better for us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017030200002#Q00500","speaker":"1385"},{"type":"speech","time":1488450600,"counter":131,"content":"<p>I am loath to intervene while Members are speaking, but most of the points made have nothing to do with the section.

He responded in the most amazing way by saying he was glad that I was not from rural Ireland because if I was, I would actually understand it.  I suspect that, in contrast to the Minister of State, I have actually read the Bill.  I told him that I was not referring to hedgerows along the roadside which is what he said the Bill was about.  That kind of parochial language and the presumption that I am not interested in rural Ireland are extremely insulting to a political activist and someone who came to this House not in the interests of any one constituency but those of society.  I am interested in what happens in all of Ireland.  Today people in the North go to the polls.  Sinn F&eacute;in's leader in the North, Michelle O'Neill, was Minister for Agriculture and Rural Development.  In December 2014 she clarified the position on legislation dealing with the closed period for hedge cutting.  Responding to calls from the Ulster Farmers Union for consideration to be given to further exemptions, she stressed the importance of hedgerows which supported a wide variety of plants, birds, mammals, insects and wildlife.  She will potentially be First Minister or deputy First Minister following negotiations after the election.  The Minister, Deputy Heather Humphreys, is not in a Department with responsibility for agriculture, rather she is Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  I urge her to appreciate the views of those Members who are arguing in the interests of rural Ireland based on their scientific knowledge and the knowledge of local authorities across the State that have strategies in place and scientific evidence which support our amendments.  I urge her one last time to appreciate the amendments proposed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017030200002#Q00700","speaker":"1372"},{"type":"speech","time":1488450600,"counter":133,"content":"<p>I will speak to the section which outlines the Short Title of the Bill which is the nub of the concern being expressed.

However, as the Minister with responsibility for heritage, the onus is on her to prove this legislation is driven by and serves the purposes of heritage at its core.  It is not a Bill coming from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine or the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  It comes from the heritage side and that must be the threshold we cross.  That is why I believe it is relevant that everyone is reminded of the issues of heritage in respect of the Title of the Bill.<\/p><p>We want to ensure we pass the Heritage Bill as a heritage Bill.  It is unfortunate that there has been much confusion as well as direct differences in respect of what was said in the House during the last debate and the components of the Bill under examination today, that is to say, the text.  For example, we were told there would be provision for one year of growth.  However, the legislation refers to the destruction and grubbing of hedges.  All of this clashes within the language of the Bill.  The opportunity was not taken in the period between the last debate and this debate to put forward more substantial Government amendments to clarify the exact purpose and intent of the Bill.<\/p><p>There has been an interim period, during which people have had ample opportunity to engage and work with others across the House as well as civil society groups to put forward amendments to address issues.  For example, we constructively engaged on the proposal of road safety.  I do not intend to speak to it because I know we will come to vote on it and we have debated it at length.  We put forward real proposals to address the important issue of road safety and to strengthen the existing adequate protections.  Section 17 enforces these provisions further.  However, we hear that people in Fianna F&aacute;il are sending letters on the road safety issue.  If road safety is a core component of concern to them, where are the amendments from Fianna F&aacute;il to address road safety?  An opportunity has been missed not only by the Government but by our colleagues in Fianna F&aacute;il, unfortunately, in respect of addressing road safety.  Excellent ideas have been floated, even by members of Fianna F&aacute;il, around limiting the hedgerow cutting to the road side of roadside hedges.  We heard that proposal.  The Minister needs to follow through and demonstrate whether that is her core concern.  I appeal to the Minister to narrow down, delve into the detail, as we have done, and try to improve this legislation in order that we can stand over the Title.<\/p><p>I will not go into our pilot.  We will debate the matter later.  However, it is an example of what a heritage Bill would look like.  The Bill should look to reflect all the obligations under the various heritage related Acts as well as the many national and international environmental, social and other heritage acts to which we have signed up.  They would be visible in a heritage Bill.  New measures would also involve rigorous and appropriate baseline work.<\/p><p>It is disappointing that the proposals put forward by us have not been matched by proposals from the Minister.  We have specified that the Minister is responsible for heritage matters and we urged her in our previous discussion to discuss these matters with her fellow Ministers, not only in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine but also in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment as well.  I would appreciate if the Minister would let us know how these conversations unfold and how she has put the heritage case to them.<\/p><p>I will come to a conclusion presently because I know we need to move to the section.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017030200002#Q00800","speaker":"1405","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488450600,"counter":135,"content":"<p>We are on the section.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017030200002#R00200","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"speech","time":1488450600,"counter":136,"content":"<p>I will leave it to the substantial debate.

The Bill suggests the Minister will define the geography, timing, location and who is permitted to carry out the burning.  It is not a free-for-all.

I simply pointed to the valid arguments that Senator Paul Daly made during the last debate.  I urged him to follow through and table the legislative proposals.  Let us not wait to see what regulations may emerge after the fact or be laid before a committee because there is utterly no requirement in the legislation.  We can talk about our aspirations for the Bill.  It behoves us, as legislators and where we have constructive points to make, let us translate them into the legislation and ensure it moves through this House and is fit for purpose.<\/p> <p>I echo the view that we should send a strong message to farmers that there has not been an attack.  My colleague spoke passionately about her farming background.  I spoke about my genuine concern for Ireland's Common Agricultural Policy payments and the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme or GLAS scheme, on which so many of our farmers rely.  Many small farmers have a genuine concern about the impact damaging our hedgerows will have when we go to Europe and plead for funding.  We, as custodians, potentially endanger our case for funding, which is essential for farmers.<\/p> <p>Lastly, pollination is crucial to small farmers and anybody who produces orchards, crops and practices horticulture in Ireland.  Pollination is genuinely in serious jeopardy in this Bill.  We have heard from the beekeepers of Ireland that bees gather pollen in August to have a store of food to survive winter.  We must ensure we have a healthy bee pollinating population because they are necessary to pollinate fruit, vegetables and everything that needs pollination.  We have a national pollination plan.  It is reasonable to say that pollination is a farming issue, as well as a heritage and natural environment issue.  I would like to correct the record.  We are talking about farming.  Everybody in the House might not always talk about the same farmers but many farmers in Ireland are concerned about this matter.<\/p> <p>Senator Ruane mentioned the 16th century.  We need only to look back to 1999 when we heard Enda Kenny speak in favour of protecting the hedgerows.

When one drives through a stretch of the road that has a 50 km\/h speed limit that switches to 100 km\/h at the end it does not mean one must drive at the higher speed.  If farmers are worried about their GLAS payments or anything, nobody will put a gun to their head to comply with this measure.

We have to protect the environment.<\/p><p>The example of the red grouse is a good example.  The numbers dropped disastrously, quite close to the level of extinction.  That happened because of poor science and lack of research.  Some 70% of its natural habitat was destroyed.  We are now fighting for an endangered species to be brought back again.  It is being brought back through good science.  There were in-depth surveys carried out between 2008 and 2010 on how red grouse numbers could be restored in Ireland.  It was carried out on the basis of good science.  Unfortunately, the good science was not done before 70% of the habitat was destroyed.  We are now talking about a possible loss of habitat for many endangered species.<\/p><p>We need to be cautious.  All I am arguing for today is good science, proper pilot schemes, proper measurements, and a look at the impact on habitat.  Senator Daly's example is good.  I admire and commend him on the work he has done and the work done by many people in rural Ireland.  We got to that point because of poor science, research was not carried out, and 70% of the natural habitat was destroyed.  We are now trying to build up the numbers and it is costing a hell of a lot more money than it would have had a percentage of that habitat been protected in the first place.  That is why people in the House are so passionate on this matter.  It is a little bit like a doctor, who should do no harm.  If we are going to do this, let us research it properly with a small pilot area.<\/p><p>We do not know the regulations.  I thought that there may have been a possibility of having that conversation as to what those regulations are rather than it being a question of trust.  Is it that we are going to protect a certain species, extend an upland burning ban to protect red grouse and ensure the numbers increase?  Those are the types of regulations.  There was ample time, and there is still ample time before we finish debating and go to Report Stage in this House, for the good science to be shown to us and for us to test and analyse it.  Are we doing the right thing for the heritage of this country?  That is why I am objecting to section 1, because I believe it destroying the heritage of this country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017030200002#S05500","speaker":"1417","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488450600,"counter":204,"content":"<p>I have heard the Senator say that before today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017030200002#T00200","speaker":"1418"},{"type":"speech","time":1488450600,"counter":205,"content":"<p>I will resist the temptation to follow my colleagues into the wider aspects of the Bill.

We would at least be ensuring that natural heritage is recognised as part of heritage.  We spoke earlier of the hedgerows as corridors for nature.  The canals are not just an important public and social amenity but also are a vital corridor for many species and for much of our nature in Ireland by making sure they have pathways along which to travel.

I take that in a general way, not just about the pikes and muskets but also the wildlife along the banks of the canals.  Amendment No. 1c proposes that in page 4, line 9, after &ldquo;designate&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, without impeding navigation,&rdquo;.  One aspect of this is to ensure the canals are open and available for navigation by boats and so on.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 1d proposes the insertion of &ldquo;, except for areas subject to protection or proposed protection for natural heritage or used by species listed in Annex IV or V ... on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora&rdquo;.  On this I take a slightly more general approach.  I point out to the Minister that some 26,000 people signed the petition against this Bill and are totally against it.<\/p><p>On the issue of the county councils, Laois County Council, for example, has stated that no changes whatever should be made without recourse to the best scientific evidence.  This has simply not been done.  I want to emphasise this to the Minister.  It is outrageous that a Minister should come into the House totally scientifically unprepared.  There has been no preparation or examination of scientific data whatever.  I could put on the record of the Seanad the list of birds that are threatened by this Bill.  The beekeepers have also protested against it.<\/p><p>The Minister speaks about a pilot scheme.  There is already a pilot scheme in existence that will report this month.  Tipperary County Council has conducted a real pilot scheme in conjunction with Donegal County Council.  As it will report this month, why are we having this debate on a Bill just before a vital and relevant pilot project makes its report?  It is quite extraordinary.  I saw the Minister shaking her head when I said there was no scientific basis for this Bill.  I put it to her that in December 2014 to January 2015 she convened a working group.  It reported back with a full report, which was made to the Minister in October 2015.  One of the most significant points made by the working group was that it would be important to engage with the European Commission regarding any proposed changes, given the interests in the protection of wild birds generally and in the context of the implementation of the birds directive.  Based on the response to an information request, it is my understanding that there has been no formal correspondence between the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and the EU directorate general for environment on this subject.  Where is the scientific evidence to back this up? The report of the working party was very clear that the Minister should engage with the European Commission.  She has singly failed to do so.<\/p><p>In addition, the Minister has placed - on the record of the House - quite inaccurate information, which is contradicted by the scientific facts.  For example, I refer to the question of cutting hedges and the resulting impact on natural fruits and so on.  On 17 November the Minister said in this House that &quot;If people want to get the best results out of their hedges in terms of seeds, berries and flowers, it is best to perform a light cutting every year.  This is recognised to be the best husbandry and leads to a better production of flowers, seeds and berries.&quot;  I have a communication from a professional hedgerow manager and consultant; a professional manager and consultant.  Let that sink in.<\/p><blockquote>I would like to point out to you that the scientific evidence does not support this statement; quite the opposite in fact.  The annual trimming of hedgerows (particularly early in autumn) reduces the potential of hedgerows to produce flowers, seeds and berries.  Whitethorn, by far the most dominant hedgerow shrub and found in 98% of hedgerows (National Hedgerow Database, NBDC), only flowers and fruits on wood that is at least two years old.<\/blockquote> <p><!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator David Norris:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=1758\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1758&amp;amp;pid=DavidNorris&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=02\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->There are numerous research papers on this subject and he has said that he would be happy to supply this information.<br\/><br\/>My final piece comes from another correspondent who is also professionally qualified.  I am talking about people who have a real standing in the matter:<\/p><blockquote>In my capacity as an Agricultural advisor in the past I have never heard of farmers checking to confirm if breeding birds were to be disturbed by hedge cutting as suggested by the Minister.  Farmers hire a contractor to cut and that's the end of it.  As I followed the debate I found it very disheartening and insulting that the Minister never addressed the overwhelming evidence of the loss of breeding birds, the nonsense of a proposed pilot and why she was ignoring the existing body of evidence that would lead any rational person to conclude the proposed legislation in relation to hedgerow cutting will only serve to hastened the loss of birds.<\/blockquote><p>Here I have put a substantial body of opinion from those engaged at the heart of this question with full scientific rigour and they contradict the Minister.  I have also shown the absence of any contact with the European Commission despite what the working party report given to the Minister recommended.  The scientific evidence is all against the Minister and I cannot understand why she is so obdurate in pushing the Bill through.<br\/><br\/>There are already six months of the year when farmers can do this.  Senator Paul Daly made the reasonable point that there have been two major storms in the past couple of weeks.  That is two weeks out of six months.  Surely to goodness there is enough flexibility in the six months that are available already.  I respectfully ask Fianna F&aacute;il Members to consider their position and even take a neutral position.  It would be a very good day for the Senate if we could knock out this Bill.  It does not implicate Fianna F&aacute;il in any negative response to the Bill.  It can just be a neutral position.  I respectfully ask that, as with the Canadian trade agreement, Fianna F&aacute;il take this political position.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017030200002#V02100","speaker":"1392","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488450600,"counter":236,"content":"<p>I will call Senators who have not spoken already, starting with Senator Grace O'Sullivan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017030200002#W00200","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1488450600,"counter":237,"content":"<p>The waterways of Ireland are wildlife corridors and are like the blood veins of the country.

We need to be certain that the local views of all users of Ireland's canal network will not be impacted negatively by any of the changes being introduced or any of the additional responsibilities being given to the North-South body.<\/p> <p>The current legislation was drafted in 1985 and came into law under the Canals Act 1986.  It recognised the historical importance and heritage role of the Grand Canal, the Royal Canal and later the River Barrow, as well as the emerging tourism potential for recreational users, boating activities and so forth.  Many people use canals every day.  Some people live on the canals because they have boats located on a canal, whether here in Dublin or further down in other parts of the country.

For more than 200 years, the canals have been utilised by the public - families, communities, farmers and so on - for commerce, recreation, amenity, walking, etc.  If new powers are being bestowed on a North-South body, it is important that there is an assurance written into the legislation that will require that body to keep the network open when designated works are taking place.  The concern relates to section 3, which states, \"Waterways Ireland may designate particular parts of the canals and other canal property for particular purposes including purposes incidental to such purposes as aforesaid.\"  Amendment No. 1c in my name requests that while Waterways Ireland may designate - that is fine - it must do so without impeding the navigation of the canal.

There is so much confusion.  This is about the people who use the canals.  The Barrow runs through my own area.  We have had massive meetings about the Barrow walk, as it is known.  An issue I have had for years is that between Waterways Ireland, the OPW and local authorities, there is nobody responsible for anything anymore.  If someone wants to get something removed from the Barrow, its track or its walkways, one does not know who to go to because there is nobody taking responsibility.  That is the biggest issue.<\/p> <p>There is another issue that I feel is not being addressed.  If we look at Carlow when considering the Heritage Bill today, the county does not have a heritage officer.  Many other local authorities do not have heritage officers.  That is unacceptable.  We are here today to promote the counties, the heritage, the hedges, the hedgerows, the birds and the bees.  We are here today to ensure that is all looked after.  However, when I ring up and wait for ages while seeking information, there is no heritage officer in Carlow from whom I can get such information.<\/p> <p>The Minister needs to put all these things in place.  I know that we are passing Bills here and doing what we can.  However, at the end of the day, if the community is not represented, if people do not know where to go between local authorities, OPW or Waterways Ireland, if nobody is taking responsibility and if there is no enforcement, this is not going to work.  Those are the biggest issues that face us.  Somebody has to be accountable.  As far as I can tell, nobody is taking responsibility for anything.  As previous speakers said, if Waterways Ireland is to be given this extra responsibility, which the Minister seems to be saying, where is it going to work from?  Who is going to organise it?  Will it be through local authorities or will it work with the communities?  Where is this going?  The Minister needs to clarify that because people are confused.  We need to make sure to let them know that this Bill is for the users of the canal and the River Barrow.  This is for all of them.  That matter needs to be resolved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017030200002#X01400","speaker":"1395"},{"type":"speech","time":1488450600,"counter":261,"content":"<p>I agree with the previous speakers.

I would like speak about a number of amendments.  I think the issues covered in many of the amendments boil down to amendment No. 1f.  Given that the Heritage Bill is sponsored by the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, it is bizarre that it requires Waterways Ireland to engage \"with the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources\" rather than the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  As this matter clearly falls within the ministerial remit and portfolio of the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, she should be consulted on it.  We are proposing the amendments because we do not think the Minister, having brought the Bill to the House with the intention of pushing it through, should remove herself thereafter from any communication on a heritage or wildlife matter.  I ask Senators to consider amendment No. 1f, in particular, in order that we can provide for consistency in relation to the Minister and her office.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 1e refers to \"wild fauna and flora\".  Our environmental obligations as an EU member state mean that certain areas are protected, or potentially protected, because of their value as natural habitats and specifically because they are used as habitats by certain wild flora and fauna.  I was surprised to see the findings of a study carried out in Clondalkin by an environmental group and several community groups which focused on the Royal Canal in the Clondalkin area.  According to the study, there are 74 bird species in the Clondalkin part of the canal alone.  This also ties into the argument that has been made for why the Minister needs to row back on what she is proposing in the case of hedgerows.  The study found that as a result of the development of Grange Castle townlands and the construction of the outer ring road in the vicinity of the Grand Canal, the pheasant breeding grounds had been all but destroyed and that birds of prey, including the long-eared owl-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017030200002#Y00500","speaker":"1404"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1488450600,"counter":267,"content":"<p>(Interruptions).<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1488450600,"counter":268,"content":"<p>It is very hard to concentrate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017030200002#Y00700","speaker":"1404"},{"type":"speech","time":1488450600,"counter":269,"content":"<p>Senator Norris, there is a request for ci&uacute;nas in the House.

When we consider the amendments which seek to ensure our natural heritage is protected, we need to look at the species we have lost to date, including the pheasant and the long-eared owl.

I have already spoken about amendment No. 1b.  I echo Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill's eloquent point about amendments Nos. 1c and 1g, both of which relate to the idea of navigation, the core purpose for which the canal network was originally designed.  We must recognise that substantial work has been done over the decades in the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and elsewhere to make navigation along the canals an option again.  The maintenance of the canal network to facilitate journeys between the Republic and Northern Ireland along the canals is more essential than ever in the light of the unique North-South role of such navigation.  It is surprising that this is not mentioned in the Bill.  It is essential for navigation to be mentioned in both places in order that this core use of the canals can be maintained.<\/p> <p>I have seen the canals from two or three ends.  When I was growing up in Galway, I saw the importance of the canals there.  I am also familiar with the role of the canals along the Shannon waterway which many tourists take great joy in navigating.  It is also worth mentioning that many people live and work on the canals.  Many of us who live in Dublin will know that there is a point in the year when boats come to the city from all over Ireland via the canals.  This essential navigation is a joyful and key role of the canals.  The maintenance of navigation is needed to ensure the canals function effectively.  I am happy to co-sponsor amendments Nos. 1c and 1g and strongly support the message we have heard from Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill.<\/p> <p>I thank Senator Kevin Humphreys for proposing amendment No. 1d which differs slightly from what Senator Lynn Ruane and I are proposing in amendment No. 1e.  I appreciate that Senator Kevin Humphreys has indicated that he might be willing to withdraw his amendment while withholding the right to resubmit it.  I will explain the slight nuance in our amendment.  We are concerned that amendment No. 1d provides that Waterways Ireland would have this responsibility \"except for areas\" covered by the Heritage Acts.  We have tried to change that by providing that Waterways Ireland would have this responsibility \"with appropriate exception and allowance made for\" such areas.  Of course, there will be areas which will need to be maintained by and under the responsibility of Waterways Ireland but which will also require an allowance to be made for their protection.<\/p> <p>Senator David Norris spoke about our European obligations.  We have tried to put them back in because it would be appropriate to do so.  This is where they belong.  If we have subscribed to certain obligations at European level, we need to ensure they are in this Bill and part of what is being considered, \"with appropriate exception and allowance made for areas subject to protection or proposed protection for natural heritage or used by species listed in Annex IV or V or Council Directive 92\/43\/EEC of 21 May 1992 on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora\".  When we talk about natural corridors - Senators have listed eloquently the species in question - we are not talking in some abstract or loose way.  Our comments are based not only on debates we have previously had in Ireland but also on the debates that have taken place across Europe on identifying what we collectively need to do to mind flora and fauna.  There are rules and regulations in place.  In amendment No. 1e we are simply seeking to ensure the rules and regulations to which we have already subscribed are adequately reflected in the legislation.  We need to recognise that the functions of Waterways Ireland in undertaking \"the care, management and maintenance of the canals\" will be carried out in a way that is informed by all of our obligations.<\/p> <p>We must speak about the canals as amenities, in addition to speaking about them in terms of navigation.  I reserve the right to table amendments on Report Stage with regard to tourism, another key purpose of the canals for which we have not provided.  Unfortunately, the list of canal amenities in the Bill, as it stands. is unimaginative.  The proposed new section 5(1)(a) of the 1986 Act refers to \"navigation in such parts of the canals as are open to navigation from time to time\" and to \"fishing or otherwise\".  The things Waterways Ireland might need to consider as its duties, as listed in this core starting point of the legislation, are narrow and unimaginative.  I ask Members to support one of the amendments seeking to ensure \"natural heritage\" is mentioned in the Bill.  I reserve the right to include an amendment in respect of tourism and tourism purposes.<\/p> <p>I do not intend to speak at length about the proposal for the River Barrow because it would be more appropriate to do so in the context of the next section.  However, I acknowledge what has been said about the matter.  Members of my family who live by the River Barrow use it.  I know that this routeway is of massive importance to counties Carlow and Kilkenny.  The lack of consultation on the proposals for the river has been extraordinary.  Perhaps we might have an opportunity to discuss the matter when we reach the section of the Bill that pertains to public consultation.<\/p> <p>I have referred to all of my amendments other than amendment No. 1h to this section.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=02\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I formally propose it.

What we have in this proposal is simply a statement that any actions taken under this section would be &ldquo;subject to agreed criteria for safety standards aboard a vessel and adjudicated upon by a suitably qualified person&rdquo;.  We do not want a situation where the regulation \"under which boats may be used on the canals\" is used in an arbitrary fashion, given, for example, that heritage vessels such as the Guinness barges are such a part of our heritage.  We must be clear that once a boat is meeting agreed safety standards, because safety is, of course, paramount, and once this has been adjudicated in a transparent and appropriate way, then it is appropriate that regulation may be set.  However, what we do not want is an arbitrary power that a class of boat might be randomly removed.  While that is to move more deeply into the section, and is a slightly different topic, these matters were grouped together.<\/p> <p>I acknowledge my colleague had points to make in regard to birds which we did not address in these amendments, although we may look at that on Report Stage.  I would ask the House to support amendment No. 1f, which relates to the inclusion of the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  Is it not extraordinary that this Bill seeks to abrogate and move responsibility which, as we heard, previously sat with the OPW and others from the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and to state that Waterways Ireland should only report on fish stocks and other environmental issues to the \"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources\"?  Our amendment simply states that the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs should also be consulted and talked to.  It is an abrogation of responsibility in an area that should be led and owned by the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.<\/p> <p>There is a concern here, although I know the Minister rejects that.  We need to see the footprint of the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs in this legislation.  We also need to see amendments from that Department, which I would welcome.  We need to see where the channels of responsibility and accountability will be in this section and the other sections of the Bill.  They need to be a lot more visible because, at the moment, there is a real concern as to where this would go.  For example, we heard farmers will be making their own decisions of their own free will, and I also think we will free up the local authorities, which should be supporting this.  We have seen very good initiatives in places like Clare with regard to hedge cutting, for example.  Local authorities have a responsibility around safety and they need to step up but there is a danger we would move away from having the local authorities fulfil their responsibilities.  Similarly, I would be concerned that, in giving these powers to Waterways Ireland and not ensuring enough of an accountable political structure upwards, we are potentially abrogating responsibility.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017030200002#Z00500","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1488450600,"counter":277,"content":"<p>I very much hope the Minister will be able to accept amendments Nos. 1c and 1g.  I do not think there is any use having a canal if it is not navigable - it is just a blot on the landscape, a kind of weed-strewn expanse, and there is absolutely no point to it.  The only point to the canals is if they are available for navigation and people can sail their boats through them.  I would have thought that was pretty obvious and I do not see any reason the Minister should object to that.  It seems to be a fundamental purpose of the Bill.<\/p><p>With regard to amendment No. 1f, it seems extraordinary that the Minister should introduce a Bill and then include a section that holds another Minister responsible.  There is a sustainable argument that Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs has no business sticking her nose into fishing and that there should be a separate Bill on this subject.  However, given this Bill has been introduced by this Minister, I do not understand why she is running away from responsibility for this.  If she is taking responsibility for introducing this Bill, she should continue to have responsibility with regard to the provisions of the Bill.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 1h, which was dealt with very well by Senator Higgins, reads as follows:<\/p><blockquote>In page 4, line 29, after &ldquo;canals&rdquo; to insert the following:<br \/><br \/>&ldquo;subject to agreed criteria for safety standards aboard a vessel and adjudicated upon by a suitably qualified person&rdquo;.<\/blockquote> <p>Again, I hope the Minister will be able to accept this.  Without agreed safety standards, what is being implemented?  We do not know what is being implemented.  It has to be set down what the standards are.  We know that every year, tragically, there are quite a few drowning accidents, mostly in the sea but some could well be in the canals.  Therefore, we first need to know what are the standards that are being implemented.  If we do not have these standards set down, then we do not what we are implementing and people are working in the dark.  Those standards should then be adjudicated upon by a suitably qualified person.  Again, it is obvious and logical that we should have somebody who has suitable qualifications.  There is no point having unqualified people with no training in this area and who do not understand the circumstances.  It seems absurd to allow a situation where there are no standards, we do not know what is being applied and the person applying it has no qualifications.  Surely we need to establish very clearly what the standards of safety are, given this is a critical matter in terms of the welfare of citizens of Ireland.  We then need have people who are actually qualified.  I could not just walk on and say, &quot;I think this is unsafe&quot;, because that would be rubbish.

There is no question of the Minister's good intentions in this regard.  Amendment No. 1f strengthens the Bill by naming the Minister.  As outlined by Senator Higgins and other speakers, it does not make sense for this to fall to the \"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources\" and it should also specify the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  It is really a matter of future-proofing legislation to ensure there is enough and proper oversight.  Among all the amendments, of some of which I am co-sponsor, I do not see any that undermine the Minister's intention.

That is the purpose of this provision on the canals.

We cannot give Waterways Ireland new powers.  Given that Waterways Ireland is a North-South body, we must work on a North-South basis.  We cannot act unilaterally to change its remit.  While I accept the Senator's intentions in proposing the amendments, Waterways Ireland is a North-South body and I cannot alter its remit.  The purpose of the Bill is to allow for the proper regulation and to manage and control the canals and waterways properly.  It is to strengthen the powers of Waterways Ireland to regulate activity on the canals and allow the canals to be used for the benefit of everybody.<\/p> <p>Regarding amendment No. 1b, Waterways Ireland is responsible for the management, maintenance, development and restoration of the inland navigable waterway system throughout the island, principally for recreational purposes.  This statutory remit is set out in the British-Irish Agreement Act 1999.  The amendment would alter the body's legislative remit from one to manage, maintain, develop and restore the inland waterways primarily for recreational purposes to one which makes the environment the primary driver of Waterways Ireland.  Waterways Ireland complies with all legislative protections for the navigations.  The proposed amendment is not within the statutory functions of Waterways Ireland and would alter the body's legislative remit.  Waterways Ireland does everything in its power to protect the interests of natural heritage.  It is a statutory body and complies with all the legislation to protect the natural heritage.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 1c inserts the words \"without impeding navigation\".  It is not the intention of Waterways Ireland to impede navigation.  The primary purpose of the canal and Waterways Ireland is to keep it open.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017030200002#AA00300","speaker":"1249"},{"type":"speech","time":1488450600,"counter":283,"content":"<p>Then there is nothing to stop the Minister accepting the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017030200002#AA00400","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"speech","time":1488450600,"counter":284,"content":"<p>The amendment would restrict Waterways Ireland's ability to provide new infrastructure such as moorings and weirs along the canal.  Water levels need to be lowered due to flooding and other circumstances which would impede navigation.  Waterways Ireland regularly closes navigation, through its marine notices, to allow special events to take place.  That is for the enjoyment of the public.  The change of the wording in the legislation would preclude it.  The wording in the legislation has been in place for many years and it works well.  It allows all navigation users' interests to be represented and accommodated.  It has never caused any difficulty in the past.  There has been no problem with the wording.  There is no intention to stop people from using the canal.<\/p><p>The purpose of Waterways Ireland is to engage with people.  It has carried out projects such as the blueways.  Members should go to Carrick-on-Shannon where there is a wonderful project whereby Waterways Ireland has worked with the local community to explore how to increase the use of the waterways, not just for boat users but for water-based recreational activities.  That is what Waterways Ireland is trying to do.  It wants to manage the canals in such a way that everybody can use them.<\/p><p>Amendments Nos. 1d, 1e and a1f are unnecessary in that compliance with EU directives is legally binding.  It is not necessary to restate it here.  Waterways Ireland works within the EU directives.  All the canals are designated as proposed national heritage areas or special areas of conservation, SACs.  Waterways Ireland must comply with EU directives and it already has to carry out assessments of all its activities under such legislation to ensure it does not negatively impact on the natural heritage or the environment.  There is no need to make the amendments given that Waterways Ireland complies with all the EU regulations and all the necessary assessments are carried out.  The canals are already designated protected areas under the EU directives on SACs or natural heritage areas.  Waterways Ireland must comply with all EU and national regulation on protected species and natural habitats.<\/p><p>The Barrow towpath was mentioned and it has got a lot of attention.  Waterways Ireland has engaged in a number of information meetings during the past month following the planning application.  The closing date for objections to the planning application is today.  Regarding amendment  No. 1e, I have already outlined that Waterways Ireland complies with EU directives and is legally binding.  Therefore, the proposed amendment is unnecessary.  The same applies to amendment No. a1f.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 1f is, again, regarding compliance with an EU directive.  The amendment proposes, in page 4, line 15, after &ldquo;canals&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, and the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs&rdquo;.  By not putting it in I am not running away or letting any future Minister off the hook.  Nobody wants to run away from his or her responsibility.  Under the British-Irish Agreement Act, there is an obligation on Waterways Ireland to obtain the Minister's consent for making by-laws.  There is no need to mention the Minister here.  It is all in the British-Irish Agreement.  Waterways Ireland is a cross-Border body and there is another set of rules it must work with as well as what I am trying to do here, which is to put in enabling legislation to allow it to pass by-laws in order that it can control activity on the waterways for the benefit of all users.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 1g is to maintain navigation.  In the Canals Act 1986 &quot;the board&quot; means C&oacute;ras Iompair &Eacute;ireann, CIE.  CIE has no statutory responsibility to maintain navigations.  Waterways Ireland's duty to maintain navigations is set out in section 5(1)(<i>a<\/i>) and it is unnecessary to repeat it here.  This is why I do not feel the amendment is necessary.  Amendment No. 1h is not within the statutory function of Waterways Ireland and would alter the body's legislative remit.  It is not in the interests of the public or of community users.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017030200002#AA00500","speaker":"1249"},{"type":"speech","time":1488450600,"counter":285,"content":"<p>How could it not be in the interests of the public?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017030200002#AA00600","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"speech","time":1488450600,"counter":286,"content":"<p>Senator Norris will get an opportunity when the Minister is finished.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017030200002#AA00700","speaker":"1418"},{"type":"speech","time":1488450600,"counter":287,"content":"<p>We must challenge nonsense when we hear it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017030200002#AA00800","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"speech","time":1488450600,"counter":288,"content":"<p>You may challenge it when the Minister has finished.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017030200002#AA00900","speaker":"1418"},{"type":"speech","time":1488450600,"counter":289,"content":"<p>I do not make references such as that to the Senator.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017030200002#AA01000","speaker":"1249"},{"type":"speech","time":1488450600,"counter":290,"content":"<p>Was the Minister suggesting safety is not an important aspect?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017030200002#AA01100","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"speech","time":1488450600,"counter":291,"content":"<p>No.  The amendment proposes to insert \"to maintain the ability of those who make their homes on boats upon those waters to do so\".<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017030200002#AA01200","speaker":"1249"},{"type":"speech","time":1488450600,"counter":292,"content":"<p>The Minister is on a different amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017030200002#AA01300","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1488450600,"counter":293,"content":"<p>We can deal with that one later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017030200002#AA01400","speaker":"1249"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1488450600,"counter":294,"content":"<p>Additional debate to follow.<\/p>"}]
