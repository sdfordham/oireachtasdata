It seems that the HSE still has not released the sections of the Conal Devine report as directed by the Office of the Information Commissioner.  The eight-week appeal period expired over a week ago.  I think it expired on the 24 November or 25 November.  This really flies in the face of what Tony O'Brien, the head of the HSE, said at our previous meeting.  He said he wanted to see the report published as quickly as possible.  So a question arises.  Why the delay?  The report was commissioned using public funds.  The Office of the Information Commissioner is funded through the Exchequer.  The decision has been made.  I do not know where to go with regard to actually making it happen.  It is clear what the intent of the committee has always been.  It is now clear what the Information Commissioner has directed.  Maybe the first port of call might be the Secretary General of the Department of Health, with whom we have dealt on this matter on a couple of occasions, to ask him to expedite it and have it published by the end of the week, which is tomorrow.  If that is agreeable, we should register that intent with the Department of Health immediately.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015120300002#C00200","speaker":"1091"},{"type":"speech","time":1449136800,"counter":27,"content":"<p>Arising from that, we can ask the clerk to contact the HSE and the Department with a view to having their responses before next week's meeting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015120300002#C00300","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speech","time":1449136800,"counter":28,"content":"<p>The Information Commissioner should express his view on this delay as well.

At the end of 2014, a total of &euro;9.3 million was liable for surrender from the Vote back to the Exchequer.  There were two elements to this.<\/p><p>The Department underspent by &euro;8.6 million relative to its budget.  The main components of the underspend were a &euro;2.5 million saving on budgeted administration costs across all programmes, mainly due to the delayed delivery of planned training programmes and delays in the progress of certain IT and accommodation projects, and a &euro;6 million saving on a budgeted spend of around &euro;9 million on a broad category described as consultancy and other services.  The Department also received approximately &euro;750,000 more in appropriations-in-aid than budgeted for, mainly due to recoupment of consultancy costs previously incurred on banking stabilisation activities, which had not been anticipated in the framing of the Estimate.<\/p><p> As indicated in figure 1, the expenditure on the Department&rsquo;s financial services policy programme recorded in the appropriation accounts is &euro;6.8 million.  However, it should be noted that this does not include costs associated with staff seconded to the Department from the NTMA to deal with banking sector issues and certain related consultancy costs.  These costs are borne by the NTMA and not recouped from the Department.  The level of costs incurred in that regard is not disclosed in either the appropriation accounts or the NTMA&rsquo;s financial statements.<\/p><p> I turn now to the finance accounts for 2014.  As provided for in Article 11 of the Constitution, all revenues of the State are paid into the Central Fund of the Exchequer, unless otherwise determined by law.  Examples of State revenue which is not paid directly into the Central Fund include PRSI receipts which are paid into the social insurance fund and the proceeds of motor tax which are paid into the local government fund.  The annual finance accounts present the receipts into and issues from the Central Fund of the Exchequer, together with a set of bespoke supporting statements that analyse the transactions.  The national debt accounts which are prepared by the NTMA and audited separately by me are also presented in full as Part 2 of the finance accounts.  The finance accounts are designed to provide an annual statement of Central Fund transactions on a cash basis and are not a comprehensive set of annual financial statements for the State or central government.  The chapters from my report on the accounts of the public services for 2014 that are the subject of the meeting were compiled to complement the information in the finance accounts by highlighting key aggregates and trends in Central Fund transactions and State liabilities.<\/p><p> Figure 2 shows the trends in overall issues and receipts from 2002 to 2014.  The deficit for the year has fallen each year since 2011.  In 2014 the deficit was &euro;8.2 billion, &euro;3.3 billion lower than in 2013.  Some significant developments during 2014 which the committee may wish to note were as follows: there was a 2% year-on-year increase in the cost of servicing the national debt which in 2014 amounted to a total of &euro;7.6 billion; there was a transfer of &euro;484 million in local property tax receipts from the Central Fund to the local government fund; there were Central Fund loans to the value of &euro;54 million and capital funding of &euro;407 million provided for Irish Water, on which I report in further detail in chapter 11 of my report; and there was the receipt of &euro;405 million in respect of a 20-year national lottery operator&rsquo;s licence which is dealt with in further detail in chapter 7.  That matter was discussed two weeks ago when the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform was before the committee.<\/p><p> The aggregate values of Central Fund receipts and issues increased significantly in 2014 due to the stepping up of repayable cash flow funding provided for the social insurance fund.  In total, &euro;4 billion was advanced to the fund in 2014 from the Central Fund and these advances were fully repaid by the end of the year.  Because of the absence of a balance sheet in the finance accounts, we have included a new \"loans and advances\" analysis in annex A of the chapter.<\/p><p> Revenues from taxation and other charges represent the primary source of State funding, but, as Deputies will know, the State also borrows substantially to supplement annual funding and cover deficits.  Chapter 2 of my report outlines the trends and composition of government debt and the cost of debt servicing.  It also provides an update on Ireland&rsquo;s activity in the sovereign debt market.  The most comprehensive measure of Government debt is general Government debt.  This is an internationally-standardised measure of the total gross debt owed by all Government bodies to third parties outside government.  The ratio of general Government debt to GDP declined to 108% at the end of 2014 from its peak level of 120% at the end of 2013.  This reduction was due to a combination of strong GDP growth and a reduction in the liabilities of IBRC in the course of its liquidation.  The main component of Ireland&rsquo;s general Government debt at the end of 2014 was cumulative borrowing undertaken by the NTMA on behalf of the State, referred to as gross national debt.  Because the deficit for the year was met by a reduction in the Exchequer&rsquo;s cash balances, this decreased by a net &euro;500 million during 2014.  The gross national debt rose marginally in the first six months of 2015, standing at around &euro;201 billion at the end of June.<\/p><p> The NTMA estimates that the weighted average cost of servicing the gross national debt was 3.5% at the end ofJune 2015, down from 3.8% at the end of 2014.  Around 92% of the gross national debt at the end ofJune 2015 was at fixed rates.  A significant factor in the reduction in the average servicing cost was the early repayment of the most expensive portion of the EU-IMF lending.  The first tranche of early repayment was concluded in the first quarter of 2015 and, in total, just over &euro;18 billion, or 81% of the original IMF loan facility, was repaid early.  The repayment was funded by other NTMA borrowing.<\/p><p> In response to the financial crisis in 2008, the State undertook a succession of interrelated measures to stabilise the banking system.  The economic impacts of the measures are both complex and long-term.  Chapter 3 was compiled to provide an estimate, as at the end of 2014, of the net financial cost of these measures.  The sums involved in recapitalising banks, including covering their losses, are relatively straightforward to identify.  Income accruing from the investments and capital repayments or disposals of investments are also generally clear.  Less easy to identify are the costs incurred by the State in funding the investments.  Estimation procedures are required to identify these costs which are substantial and in arriving at a valuation of the State's residual interest in banking assets.<\/p><p> The results of the examination analysis are summarised in figure 3.1 in the chapter.  The overall investment in the banks, including the value of shares accepted in lieu of dividends, totalled &euro;66.8 billion.  Directly or indirectly, this resulted in equivalent State borrowing which cost an estimated &euro;8.7 billion in interest costs up to the end of 2014.  After receipts from disposals, dividend and other payments, fees charged for guarantee protections and the estimated share of Central Bank profits that relate to banking stabilisation measures, the State&rsquo;s net outlay associated with the stabilisation measures, up to the end of 2014, was just under &euro;60 billion.  Against this, the State held an interest in the rescued banks, worth an estimated &euro;16.7 billion at 31 December 2014.  Netting the two amounts results in an estimated net cost to the taxpayer for the State&rsquo;s banking stabilisation measures of around &euro;43 billion.<\/p><p> Members are, of course, well aware that the scale of the State support provided was different for each bank.  Therefore, using the same estimation approach, we calculated the outturn for each of the banks.  We estimated that, as at 31 December 2014, support for IBRC had cost the State a net &euro;36.1 billion, that support for AIB had cost a net &euro;8.8 billion, that permanent tsb was almost at break-even and that there was a net surplus of &euro;2 billion in respect of the State&rsquo;s support for Bank of Ireland.  I emphasise that these estimates are at a point in time and that the final cost of the measures will not be identifiable for some time to come.  The cost of servicing residual banking-related State debt will be an ongoing economic one.  We estimate it to be between &euro;850 million and &euro;1.7 billion annually, if the State&rsquo;s average cost of borrowing is in the range 2% to 4% a year.<\/p><p>The NTMA's average cost of borrowing was around 3.5% at the end of last June, so that cost is likely to be at the higher end of the range.<\/p><p> Of course, other factors will also be at play in determining the final overall cost of the stabilisation measures.  These will include the amount the State ultimately realises from the disposal of its remaining bank investments and the period for which the Central Bank continues to hold Government bonds relating to redemption of the IBRC promissory notes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015120300002#C02800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1449136800,"counter":56,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy.

Sitting behind me is Fiachra Quinn.<br\/><br\/>I would like to focus on the four specific items of today's agenda and provide an overview of performance.  The first item on today's agenda is Vote 7 - Office of the Minister for Finance and the 2014 Appropriation Accounts for the Department.  The Estimate for 2014 was &euro;31.2 million.  Spending in 2014 was &euro;21.9 million, leaving a surrender of approximately &euro;9.3 million.  This surplus arose for a number of reasons.  Recruitment did not progress at the pace anticipated, resulting in pay bill savings of circa &euro;1.7 million and a further &euro;1 million underspend on non-pay administration expenses.  There was also an underspend of approximately &euro;5.3 million on programme-related costs arising from the completion of some work in-house on third-party funding of certain international assignee replacements, there were later timelines than originally anticipated in certain national payment plan projects and lower costs in regard to the shareholding unit.  There were lower than anticipated costs on the medium term economic strategy and the economic planning initiative, because much of the work in these areas was completed in-house and in conjunction with our colleagues across the system, with a saving of &euro;700,000.  The Department also recouped an additional &euro;600,000 in respect of costs associated with the stabilisation of the banking sector.<br\/><br\/>We remain committed to seeking to minimise costs where possible, subject to achieving the best outturn for the State.  In terms of the financial outturn, I draw the committee's attention to the following key points.  Tax revenues, at &euro;41.28 billion, were up &euro;3.48 billion, or 9.2%, year on year and &euro;1.24 billion up against profile, or 3.1%.  Within the figure for tax revenues, the increase was distributed across the three key tax heads.  Income tax grew by 8.9%, corporation tax by 8.1% and VAT by 7.9% year on year.  Total expenditure, at &euro;58.59 billion, was up &euro;2.3 billion, or 4.3%, year on year.  This was driven by increased non-voted expenditure, which showed an increase of &euro;3.23 billion.  General government debt as a percentage of GDP is projected to drop to 97% in 2015, from a peak of 120% in 2012.  This downward trend is projected to continue next year when a debt to GDP ratio of some 93% is forecast, in line with the euro area average.<br\/><br\/>The investment by the Irish taxpayer in the banks has been unprecedented, totalling over &euro;64 billion.  This investment comprised &euro;34.7 billion for IBRC and &euro;29.4 billion for the three viable banks, AIB, Bank of Ireland and Permanent TSB.  Our objective is to ensure the best return to the taxpayer and we are well on the way to recovering almost all our investment in the three viable banks.  The total current value of the State&rsquo;s investments, based on the latest valuations, in the three remaining banks is &euro;18 billion.  A further &euro;11.2 billion has been generated from disposals, fees, including guarantee fees, and other income.  This totals some &euro;29.2 billion against the &euro;29.4 billion invested.  We remain confident that, over time, the aggregate funds the State has invested in the three viable banks will be recovered.<br\/><br\/>I would like to turn briefly to performance and outputs in recent years.  The Department is working towards two broad goals: a sustainable economic environment and sound public finances; and a balanced and equitable economy enabled by a restructured, vibrant, secure and well-regulated financial sector.  After a difficult number of years, the Irish economy is now recovering and the short to medium-term outlook is bright.  Budgetary policies continue to focus on the need to reduce public debt, generate sufficient funding for public services and boost the growth capacity of the economy.<br\/><br\/>A modest recovery in economic activity under way since 2011 has gained momentum over the past 18 months, with GDP expanding by over 5% in 2014, and by close to 7% in the first half of 2015.  GDP <i>per capita<\/i>is now above the pre-crisis peak recorded in 2007.  The expansion in economic activity, initially led by the exporting sectors, has become more sustained, with domestic demand now making a strong positive contribution to growth.  We now have broad-based employment growth across the economy, with increases recorded throughout the country and in virtually every economic sector.  The most recent figures show that 140,000 net jobs have been created since the low point of the crisis.  As a result, the unemployment rate fell to 8.9% in October, representing a decline of almost 6% from its peak in 2012.<br\/><br\/>Putting the public finances on a sound and sustainable footing is a key priority.  Stable public finances are a prerequisite for economic growth.  The general government deficit has fallen from a peak of 11.5% of GDP in 2009 to an estimated 2.1% in October 2015.  Based on the Exchequer returns published yesterday, I anticipate this will be closer to 1.7% at the end of the year.  Gross government debt peaked and is now on a firm downward path.  Gross debt is expected to be around 97% of GDP at the end of 2015.  Appropriate fiscal policies will continue to be necessary to ensure that deficit and debt levels maintain a downward trajectory.  The new economic governance rules agreed in recent years now operate within the framework of the European semester.  Ireland has been a consistent supporter of the new economic governance and fiscal regime.<br\/><br\/>This year&rsquo;s budget also introduced new processes to improve transparency, dialogue and understanding in our domestic arrangements.  The spring economic statement, SES, outlined the parameters that would be applied in the October budget, including provision for additional public expenditure and taxation measures, while still complying with our Stability and Growth Pact, SGP, obligations. The SES is an important development and reform in how we budget.<br\/><br\/>The national economic dialogue in July provided for engagement with stakeholders and created an environment in which all aspects of the public finances and budget could be explored within the parameters set out in the SES.  This initiative allowed for an open and public dialogue on policy choices before the formulation of the budget, set within the strict rules that must apply to the assessment of policy options.  A further potential reform identified in the SES was the possibility of establishing an independent budget office after the next election.  The Department, in partnership with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, has begun to scope out that option.<br\/><br\/>A sustainable tax system is also central to ensuring stable public finances and supporting economic growth.  We have been reforming and modernising the way we develop tax policy advice for several years.  Central to this is a much greater emphasis on open public consultation processes, which lead to better evidence-based policy-making.  Contributions from stakeholders, interest groups and individual members of the public are welcome as part of this process and are carefully assessed.  To ensure policy proposals are robust, in 2015 we introduced new tax expenditure guidelines to assist with <i>ex-ante<\/i>and <i>ex-post<\/i>evaluations of tax expenditures going forward.  The Department also hosted its third annual tax policy conference, at which over 150 stakeholders, academics and policy makers discussed topical tax policy issues.<br\/><br\/>Work continues across a wide range of challenging issues within the banking and financial services sector.  A viable and stable banking system is essential to the proper functioning of the economy.  A key focus of our work in 2015 has been to enable EU regulatory reform measures, such as banking union and Solvency II, in addition to a range of other transpositions.  The European Commission also published its capital markets proposal and action plan in September 2015.  The key objective is to unlock non-bank financing so as to better connect capital to investment projects in the European Union.  The Department will continue work commenced on this during 2016.<br\/><br\/>As I indicated earlier, our objective is to recover our investment in the viable banks.  The State owns just under 14% of Bank of Ireland, which is worth approximately &euro;1.6 billion.  The State owns just under 75% of Permanent TSB, which is worth &euro;1.4 billion.  During the past year, Permanent TSB raised &euro;525 million from the private sector and the State received &euro;509 million in capital receipts from the sale of shares and the repurchase by the bank of our contingent capital notes.  As members know, the State owns 99.8% of AIB and it announced last month that it had reached agreement with the regulator and the Minister to reorganise its capital structure.  AIB remains an extremely valuable asset for the State.  As part of the capital reorganisation, an updated valuation for the bank of some &euro;15 billion was estimated.<br\/><br\/>Since its launch in 2014, some 3,200 Irish SMEs have benefited from Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, loans, with almost &euro;110 million of new lower cost loans drawn down.  The loans offering longer maturities and payment flexibility have been taken up by Irish SMEs across a range of sectors in all regions.<\/p><p>To date, NAMA has redeemed &euro;22.1 billion or 73% of the &euro;30.2 billion senior bonds originally issued and is well on the way to redeeming 80% of the senior bonds by the end of 2016 rather than the previous target of 2018.  NAMA expects to have fully redeemed its senior debt by 2018 and its subordinated debt by March 2020.  Members will also be aware that NAMA recently announced that it would fund the delivery of 20,000 residential units on a commercial basis from its own resources by 2020.<\/p><p> My Department also published a review of the Credit Union Restructuring Board, ReBo, in October 2015.  The review found that ReBo had made significant progress in achieving its overall objectives.  ReBo has assisted 74 individual credit unions in 36 completed restructuring projects.  The Minister recently announced that 31 March 2016 is the final date for acceptance of any further restructuring proposals.  This will enable ReBo to continue to engage with the sector and complete the performance of its functions within its time-bound mandate.<\/p><p> The Department continues to make steady progress in line with our goal to enhance our capacity, to continually improve and become a higher performing Department.  I will mention a couple of specific examples.  The Department&rsquo;s governance framework published earlier this year has been an input into the development of the corporate governance standard for the Civil Service, recently approved by Government.  It is also one of the Department's two shortlisted nominations for this afternoon's Civil Service awards, along with the SME online tool.  The Department was also shortlisted for best learning and development organisation as part of the Irish Institute of Training and Development awards.  The Department achieved an outstanding achievement award following an awards ceremony on 6 March 2015. <\/p><p> I would like to take this opportunity to express my appreciation to the staff at the Department for their ongoing hard work.  It is only through their continuing commitment and dedication that we can deliver on our objectives.  The Department will strive for continuous improvement and develop into the best organisation we can be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015120300002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Derek Moran","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1449136800,"counter":59,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. Moran.

I refer to corporate tax.  As Mr. McCarthy said, they are capital intensive in their nature.  There is a concentration in that the very large multinationals - the top ten groups - pay us about a third of the total corporation tax.  This year is no different from last year in that regard.  The things that are changing are that there is across the board performance improvement; 20% more smaller companies are paying tax this year than were last year; and those which were paying tax last year are paying more this year.  This is with the multinational sector - the big taxpayers - still retaining the same share of what they pay.<\/p> <p>  There are other issues that complicate the matter.  Anybody who prices in dollars has improved their profitability because of the appreciation of the currency.  I am not sure if that explains a huge amount of it but it accounts for some of it.  In addition, during the worst economic times, companies were perhaps not making profits and were carrying losses.  As they move from a loss-making situation into profitability, they burn off those losses and go from zero to paying a substantial amount of tax.  The performance is exceptional by any measure.  <\/p> <p>  We have been talking to the Revenue Commissioners throughout the year.  With the exception of relatively small one-offs, the consistent message is that this is not going to necessarily disappear.

The Revenue Commissioners through what they call their large case division survey the big taxpayers once a year to get an indication of performance but it is a voluntary arrangement that involves them telling  Revenue how things are going.  We did not get anything from that survey that would suggest this type of surge.<\/p> <p>  The key thing throughout the year has been the fact that as this performance has continued, it is a confirmation that this is not once-off.  This is a lift in the overall level.  There is a range of explanations such as improved trading conditions, continued recovery in the US and UK economies and the fact that more companies are paying tax as they come out of the recession with those at the smaller end that paid tax last year paying more again this year.  It will take us some time to drill down into this.  Mr. McCarthy and his team work with the Revenue Commissioners to drill down into this in greater detail because we must understand what has happened and what lies behind it.

While some of the multinationals may skew the figure, it is important to remember that actual receipts from the smaller firms - the SME sector - are growing at a faster pace than receipts from the large cases division.  We have this concentration issue in Ireland.  Some would see it as a risk.  The Secretary General mentioned that the top ten groups pay one third of tax while the top 50 firms pay one half of corporation tax.  By its nature, corporation tax is susceptible to firm-specific and sector-specific developments.  We saw it back in 2012 and 2013 when the patent cliff occurred in the pharmaceutical sector so it does make it very difficult to forecast.<\/p> <p>  I emphasise the role of the exchange rate in overall profitability.  I say this because our profiles for tax revenue were published last February when the assumption was that the economy would grow by about 4.25%.  That was based on the assumption, and we are required to take the European Commission's assumptions under the new European semester, that the euro-dollar exchange rate will average about 1.29-1.30.  Following quantitative easing, we now have an exchange rate that averaged about 1.05 for the year as a whole.  We know that about 80% of firms in Ireland price in dollars so that depreciation of the euro has brought about a massive increase and improvement in terms of corporate profitability.  That is a very important factor in trying to explain the increase in profitability this year so I would not underplay that.  As the Secretary General said, we will need the detailed tax returns over the course of next year to be able to conduct a more in-depth analysis.  <\/p> <p>  What we are doing at the moment is looking at some econometric work in this area to see if additional variables might improve the modelling we use.

That does not explain the problem because profitability and corporation tax revenue typically move one for one over time.  The fact that corporation tax is now between 50% or 52% above for the year as a whole means there is a massive gap between those two variables.  We are looking at the econometric models and so is Revenue.

Ultimately, just to reiterate, for a range of reasons this has significantly overperformed.  We will do the econometric analysis as the data come through to try to understand where this came from and we may have far better answers in due course.  It would have pushed the bounds of credibility in October 2014, in preparing for 2015, to have put in this type of forecast for corporation tax.  There would not have been any basis for it.  We tend to operate off the basis of national accounts estimation of profitability and for next year, I think on budget day we had approximately 8% growth.  To a certain extent, this becomes de-risked, as the performance has been so strong this year that we are close to achieving the target for next year.  Consequently, to achieve that and to keep the budget on target for next year, one does not need any growth and so that removes a bit of the risk.  The interesting thing over the course of the year has been that we planned the budget for 2015 in October 2014, and that budget had a deficit target of 2.7%.  By April, we were saying 2.4%, by October, 2.1% and it now looks as though it will be 1.7%.  All of this essentially is feeding through into the deficit coming down more rapidly, which must be regarded as a positive.  In itself, that removes some of the risk but the performance this year is up very close to the total target for next year.  We know we have a large amount of work to do to try to understand this and we will be doing that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015120300002#J00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Derek Moran"},{"type":"speech","time":1449136800,"counter":150,"content":"<p>I am quite concerned about this because it is quite important.

The US is not at all a disinterested party in this.  So it goes beyond Ireland.  It goes beyond Europe and it reaches out to the US.  Some of the points he was making were, first, that the US is somewhat worried about the over-concentration on US companies by DG COMP; second, that it interferes with its bilateral tax treaties with individual countries, because it does not have a tax treaty with Brussels per se; and also, the risk at the end of the day that retrospective imposition will be regarded as a credit by US companies and ultimately will become a bill on the US taxpayer, among other things.  So that was very interesting testimony in that regard.

Mr. Moran, Ms Nolan and their team are very welcome.  The first thing to recognise is that they have presented us with a good news story.  There have been excellent returns in virtually all categories, including corporation tax, which has been phenomenal.  We should look at it initially from that point of view.  A figure of 140,000 jobs is incredible over a few years.  Unemployment is down from 15.3% to 8.9%.  Gross Government debt is down from 120% to 97%.  The general Government deficit is down from 11.5% in 2009 to 2.1% in 2015.  These are phenomenal results in a very short space of time and the Department should in the first instance be complimented on them.  All the indications are that there will be strong progress in a positive direction in the future.<\/p> <p>  In respect of corporation tax, which has been teased out in considerable detail and on which I will not dwell, I would speculate in terms of getting a final solution.  I hope the Department does come back to us with a more detailed statement as to where all of that money has come from after all the econometric models are completed and the IDA has produced its final report.  Mr. McCarthy spoke about exchange rates and the depreciation of the euro versus the dollar from 1.29 to 1.05 or thereabouts.  That is depreciation of almost 25%.  Considering that the vast majority of the multinational companies are US companies that are trading in dollars or using currency of that nature, this alone would affect a considerable amount of it.<\/p> <p>  It seems that the IDA has done a fantastic job throughout the recession and there has been an unexpected increase in multinational companies' attraction to the country.  It appears that even while the economy was going down domestically, through the global Irish network and the IDA, those critical areas of foreign direct investment not only remained intact, there was a substantial increase in those years and this is now coming to fruition.  Perhaps the second pillar of that was that for the first time ever, small and medium-sized Irish industries were trading abroad because there was no domestic consumer market here.  They have now established bases so there is a strong trading return coming from the international exports stage.  Now that the domestic market has picked up substantially, a double whammy is coming forward when the opposite was true in the past.  This could account for a certain amount of the profits that are now being realised.<\/p> <p>  Despite all of that, the phenomenal increase of 2.2% or 2.3% over 2014 from &euro;4.184 billion to &euro;6.361 billion requires further teasing out and clarification.  I would love to see the details of why and how Mr. Niall Cody, the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, was able to say that this was sustainable going forward and that it was not a windfall but effectively cyclical and sustainable.  Could the witnesses respond?  I do not want to go into any further detail but could they expand on whether this scenario could exist and also expand on what they have already said?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015120300002#O02800","speaker":"1006"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1449136800,"counter":298,"content":"<p>I have no doubt that as we work through the data, we will make that available because it is important for people to understand and have confidence in what is going on.  The Deputy is right to say the flow of foreign direct investment continued throughout the darkest days.  Our colleagues in the IDA have done a remarkable job and have ambitious targets.  When a company sets up, it takes a bit of time before it starts paying tax.  It does not pay tax from day one.  That flows through eventually.  Both Mr. McCarthy and I have said, and it features in the chairman&rsquo;s letter, that the small and medium enterprise, SME, sector, is characterised as the smaller payer of corporation tax, but there are now more SMEs.  Those that were paying tax are paying more.  In respect of the uplift in corporate taxation, the concentration in the top ten groups has not changed proportionally.  It is approximately one third.  It is good news.  We have to be cautious.  At the level we are at, in terms of corporation tax collected and assuming we get what we are expecting in December, we are there or thereabouts in the target for next year which removes some of the risk while we are doing this analysis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015120300002#P00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Derek Moran"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1449136800,"counter":299,"content":"<p>The Deputy makes a valid point about FDI during the very difficult years.

Will Mr. McCarthy give us an idea of the percentage increase year on year in that period, not necessarily now?  What level of trading took place?  For example, I was a Minister of State with responsibility for trade and development, which was part of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  All the embassies were mobilised as economic engines where Irish networks were established all over the world.  Trade missions then went to an area where there were networks of Irish business people plus networks of other business people.  All of a sudden there was business coming to small and medium enterprises that could not trade in Ireland or had never traded abroad before.  I would love to see an analysis of the effectiveness of that because the focus was on the Global Irish Network in Dublin Castle, the ideas it came forward with and the amount of FDI it continued to mobilise for Ireland.  It was able to mobilise SMEs, which could not sell anything at home because there was no consumer market, to go abroad and do that and maintain those high levels of export.  That could be flowing into a particular resolution now in much the same way as the most recent figures for unemployment were down from 9.4% to 8.9%, a drop of 0.5% in one month.  That came out of the blue and nobody asked how.  Why could we have that amazing drop at this time?

We expect it will have paid back the Government-guaranteed bonds by the end of 2018.  The agency is obliged to have 80% of them paid back by the end of next year and to date, it has paid back 73%.  Consequently, NAMA is well on target to make good on 100% of the primary debt.  It also has subordinated debt, which is owed to the banks, and it expects to pay that back by 2020 because that is when it is due and I cannot think of any particular reason NAMA would pay it back early.  In the meantime, one provision in the NAMA Act is that the agency is to consider dysfunctions in the market and at present - a Deputy made reference to it earlier - there is a clear dysfunction in the housing market.  Within that mandate, NAMA has decided it will, through its debtors and others, build 20,000 houses between now and 2020, primarily in the Dublin area but also in other urban centres where they are needed and that work is continuing.  NAMA also has some long-term development work in the strategic development zone, SDZ, area, particularly in the Dublin docklands, where the agency has a lot of property or property interests and that project is ongoing.  There will be a decision whenever we do the review, obviously we will review the agency after it has paid back all the Government-guaranteed debt, as to what it intends to do in the long term with those long-term investments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015120300002#Q00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Ann Nolan"},{"type":"speech","time":1449136800,"counter":329,"content":"<p>At this point in time, we are 50% of the way through NAMA's remit.

That was &euro;32 billion, of which twenty-something billion euro has been paid off.  At this point, NAMA has accumulated a considerable profit and is it not time to review the direction of NAMA?  Is there any advantage at this point, with property prices rising, for NAMA to concentrate on the disposal of property?  Members have been discussing, in this committee room, some of the large portfolios that recently have been disposed of by NAMA.  Is it not time to have a review of NAMA's remit and to focus NAMA as an investment vehicle for precisely those activities, namely, the 20,000 new housing units and the SDZ in the docklands?  The latter is to create 23,000 jobs and NAMA is investing money in it.

I should point out NAMA owes &euro;8 billion that is guaranteed by the Government and which Moody's finally has agreed is no longer a serious threat to the Government.  However, were we to change the strategy and state the agency no longer was obliged to pay back the aforementioned &euro;8 billion, it would not take long for the rating agencies to start saying the Government was responsible for this debt.  What we must get and what we have asked of NAMA under the section 227 review we have completed is that balance between long-term investment where it is needed because there is a disruption in the market, as provided for in the NAMA Act, and the payback of debt at a point to stop this debt being a millstone around the country's neck and damaging growth in the country.

The eventual agreement was that we would have two &euro;250 million funds.  In the event, a number of things happened.  First, I do not think the problems, although they were significant, and very significant in some individual credit unions, throughout the movement were quite as bad as had been estimated.

The credit union movement is renewing itself and has a huge contribution to make.

They are rebuilding their organisation and different branch structures and so on but the regulation that is beginning to have an impact on them is having a negative effect on those who borrow, particularly those on the edge between the moneylender and the credit union.  The amount of red tape people have to jump through to get a loan from a credit union is so significant now that it is almost creating an inflexibility within credit unions to deal with loans applications that come before them that can be paid back but which, for some reason or other, regulation is preventing that from happening.  The credit unions that I have met have a case.  We can over-regulate and over-complicate a sector that has done so much good for the country and for those members it represents.  Given the fact that the credit unions have &euro;7 billion to &euro;9 billion in the banks and are ready to activate it in terms of house construction or loans to small and medium businesses, and I am talking about those single employers or family employers at that level within the small and medium enterprise sector, the Department should be proactive in ensuring that money is released into the economy to a sector that is finding it difficult to borrow.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015120300002#T01400","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1449136800,"counter":435,"content":"<p>We would certainly encourage the credit union movement to develop appropriate extra loans, whether it is in the microfinance area or whatever.

If the money collected within a business was being spent incorrectly, the head of the department responsible would soon be brought in.  It would be pointed out to him or her that he or she was given X and he or she had spent part of it unwisely and must account for that.  For example, &euro;13.5 billion is allocated to the HSE and it does not have a single financial system going back to the dissolution of the health boards and the foundation of the executive, which is incredible.

The thought has just crossed my mind that we should have, and I must recommend it to whoever chairs this committee in the next session, that both Departments, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Finance, should be brought in together to discuss an overview of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report each year so that we can get a handle on it.  I do not accept that the current situation should continue whereby the Department of Finance gives money to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform or other Departments.  I won't say that the Department of Finance is not concerned because I know that it has expressed concern about how moneys are spent.  Taxpayers and struggling businesses, in particular, would like to see greater accountability and a greater sense from each Department that they clearly understand that the taxes collected by Revenue are perhaps not being spent with the same diligence and care that Revenue applies to their collection.  That is my view, having been Chairman of this committee for the past number of years and from my experience of being a member of the committee some years ago.  Someone has to bridge that gap.<\/p> <p>  I suggest to Mr. McCarthy that when the Comptroller and Auditor General's report is published every year there should be an effort made to hold a joint session with both Departments to bridge the collection and spending of taxes with what is found in the Comptroller and Auditor General's account.

I note that for once, we outnumber the committee.<\/p> <p>  On behalf of the council, I thank the committee for the opportunity to discuss our recent assessment published on Thursday, 26 November.  We view the opportunity to publicly explain our assessments as integral to the fulfilment of the council's mandate and important in fostering greater public awareness and debate around macroeconomic and budgetary issues.  In our eight previous appearances before this committee, the engagement with Members of the Oireachtas has been of great value in the development of our work and we welcome further feedback from the committee today.  With me are council members Mr. Sebastian Barnes, Dr. &Iacute;de Kearney, Dr. R&oacute;is&iacute;n O'Sullivan and Mr. Michael Tutty.  As the Chairman noted, this is Michael's first appearance before the committee following his recent appointment to the council in September 2015.  I am sorry to say it is R&oacute;is&iacute;n's last appearance with us, as she comes to the end of her four and a half year term.  I thank her for the significant contribution she has made to the council.  The council's secretariat is also present.  The council would like to thank the staff of the Oireachtas for their ongoing, useful co-operation.<\/p> <p>  Today, I will cover our ninth assessment.  The report is written in line with the mandate of the council, as set out in the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2012.  Since our last appearance before the committee in June, there has been further welcome evidence that the recovery in the Irish economy continues to strengthen.  Behind the impressive growth in headline aggregates, such as GDP and GNP, are signs of a broad-based economic recovery.  Domestic demand is now making a positive contribution to economic growth through higher consumer spending and domestic investment.  Meanwhile, a favourable exchange rate and external demand environment is benefiting Irish exports.  The combination of strong output growth in the internationally traded sectors of the economy along with the positive impetus from domestic spending is driving rapid growth in the Irish economy, faster than that of its EU neighbours.<\/p> <p>  Importantly, the fruits of the economic recovery are to be seen in both the labour market and the public finances.  The unemployment rate has dipped below 9% for the first time since 2009 and employment growth has averaged 2.7% on an annual basis over the first three quarters of 2015.  It is important to note that even with this impressive employment growth, the employment rate &ndash; the ratio of the number at work to the working age population &ndash; is still back at early 2000 levels.  This indicates that although output, as measured by GDP and GNP, has regained its 2007 peak, the recovery is incomplete and more progress is needed to repair the economy and labour market and to restore living standards following the deep recession.<\/p> <p>  The public finances have continued to improve despite budgetary overruns in some areas through a combination of strong tax receipts and savings from lower debt servicing costs and falling unemployment.  The general government deficit fell to 3.9% of GDP in 2014 and is likely to be lower than the budget day forecast of 2.1% this year.  The general government gross debt-to-GDP ratio has continued to fall and is expected to measure around 97% of GDP by the end of 2015 compared to a peak of 120% of GDP in 2013.<\/p> <p>  Although the near-term prospects for the economy are positive, substantial risks surround the central projections.  These risks, which are detailed in our report, stem from both internal and external sources.  Among the domestic risks is the highly concentrated nature of production in the Irish economy, whereby a small number of sectors and firms account for the bulk of manufacturing output and exports.  External risks include the impact on the Irish economy of a slowdown in the US, UK or euro area economies.  Were one or more of these risks to materialise, growth would be slower and unemployment higher than envisaged in current forecasts.  This would make it more challenging to reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio in line with current projections and there is a risk that the debt ratio could start rising again.<\/p> <p>  Weighing up these considerations, the rapid growth now being observed and the pace at which the economy's spare capacity is being reduced argue against the need for an expansionary fiscal stance at present.  With domestic demand recovering strongly and unemployment falling, the need to eliminate the remaining budget deficit and to put the debt on a firm downward path takes precedence over using a more expansionary fiscal stance to stimulate an already rapidly growing economy.<\/p> <p>  The April 2015 spring economic statement formed the basis of the discussions at the national economic dialogue held in July.  In a departure from the plan announced in the spring statement, budget 2016 showed an increase in Government expenditure for 2015 of &euro;1.5 billion compared to the projection in April.  Since the majority of the current spending in 2015 is carried into the base level of spending for 2016, the overall package of budgetary measures, combining the announcements in budget 2016 and additional White Paper spending, implies a significantly looser fiscal stance for both 2015 and 2016 than projected in the April 2015 spring economic statement.<\/p> <p>  The council assesses that the decision to increase expenditure in 2015 beyond what was originally budgeted was a deviation from prudent economic and budgetary management.  There are a number of reasons for this assessment that we detailed in last week's report.  The additional spending absorbs the majority of the better than expected tax revenues in 2015.  This keeps the deficit and debt higher than could have been achieved and provides an unnecessary stimulus at a time of strong economic growth.  Had total spending not been increased in 2015, the general Government deficit would likely be around a half a percentage point of GDP lower than currently anticipated for this year.<\/p> <p>  Using unexpected incoming revenues to fund permanent increases in expenditure at a time of strong economic growth has echoes of the last boom, when property-related revenues funded large increases in spending.  In addition, an unusually large surge in corporation tax receipts accounts for a large proportion of the better than expected tax revenue in 2015.  While the Revenue Commissioners have noted that the majority of the corporation tax overperformance in 2015 is not due to one-off factors, further analysis is needed to ascertain the drivers of this exceptional growth in 2015 and to determine the likely growth in this tax heading over the medium term.  The Revenue Commissioners have confirmed that they have agreed to review the forecasting method for corporation tax and have established an internal working group.  The council looks forward to the publication of the review's findings.  In the meantime, until there is more certainty as to the sustainability of the corporation tax increase in 2015, the council is concerned about the decision to use unexpected revenues to increase expenditure.<\/p> <p>  More positively, for 2016 the Government has signalled its intention to follow the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact and the national budgetary rule from 2016.<\/p><p>Government revenues in 2016 are forecast to grow faster than non-interest Government spending by some margin, which is appropriate given the ongoing recovery and consistent with prudent policy.<br\/><br\/>I will address the second major theme of the fiscal assessment report concerning the projections for the public finances beyond 2016.  Following exit from the excessive deficit procedure in 2016, Ireland&rsquo;s national budgetary framework comprising the domestic budgetary rule, which mirrors the requirements of the preventative arm of the Stability and Growth Pact, SGP, along with the expenditure ceilings will come into operation.  Despite its complexity and imperfections in some areas, the budgetary framework provides a valuable structure to guide Irish fiscal policy and is consistent with moving Ireland&rsquo;s debt to safer levels.  A core requirement of Ireland&rsquo;s budgetary framework is the need to provide credible medium-term plans for the public finances.  As well as being a requirement of the Government's budgetary framework, proper medium-term fiscal plans are vital for a number of reasons.  Such plans provide a comprehensive and realistic framework for the planning and management of public expenditure over the medium term by linking annual budgets to longer-term fiscal targets.  Well-specified medium-term plans increase the predictability of the budgetary planning process by providing realistic estimates of revenue, expenditure, deficit and debt over a three-year period.  Medium-term planning is important in providing a link between resource allocation and Government policy and priorities and can guard against a return to short-term, incremental budgeting.<br\/><br\/>Providing detailed medium-term projections for the public finances is a much more demanding task relative to current practice, and the Government has made some progress in the recent budget and April stability programme update, SPU.  Nevertheless, the absence of a realistic medium-term plan for the public finances has not been fully addressed in budget 2016.  Expenditure projections after 2016 explicitly provide for an additional &euro;400 million each year to cover demographics but do not fully incorporate the cost of providing current levels of public services in future years, with the ratio of Government spending to GDP projected to fall by more than five percentage points by 2021.  The tax forecasts do not reflect commitments announced in budget 2016, including the plan to abolish the universal social charge, USC.  As a result, the projections for the budget balance in budget 2016 do not provide a useful picture of the fiscal position over the medium term.<br\/><br\/>Based on the projections in budget 2016, the council&rsquo;s analysis compares the estimated expenditure growth necessary to accommodate spending pressures with the allowable expenditure growth when there are no new tax changes and all the space under the rules is used for additional spending.  The analysis shows that meeting likely future expenditure needs would absorb the majority of the estimated fiscal space available after 2016.  Further tax cuts would make it very difficult to fund these expenditure pressures, if fully accommodated, while complying with the rules.<br\/><br\/>Another challenge that has emerged regarding the implementation of Ireland&rsquo;s budgetary framework concerns the operation of the system of expenditure ceilings.  Multi-annual ceilings were introduced in 2012 to address serious expenditure management problems evident in Ireland prior to the recent fiscal crisis.  These problems were manifested by a pattern of <i>ad hoc<\/i>year-to-year budgeting that inevitably contributed to pro-cyclicality in fiscal policy during the boom.  Even before 2015, there have been regular upward revisions to the expenditure ceilings.  Such persistent revisions undermine multi-annual public expenditure management by creating uncertainty around the scale of future resources, both in aggregate and for individual Departments.  Without improvements to the existing system of expenditure planning, it is likely the recent upward revisions to expenditure ceilings will continue to revert to the pre-crisis pattern of pro-cyclical adjustments.  The failure to respect expenditure ceilings raises the risk of funding increases in expenditure from windfall revenue sources.  The domestic medium-term expenditure framework should be strengthened to ensure multi-annual planning becomes a central element of the budget process.<br\/><br\/>As economic conditions improve, it is timely to remember Ireland&rsquo;s tendency to make budgetary mistakes during good times that have helped set the stage for the crises that followed.  Avoiding a repeat of the pattern of mistakes that undermined the public finances in the past should remain foremost in the minds of policy-makers.  Prudent policy is a necessary ingredient of sustainable growth in incomes and employment in a fragile global economy, and all the more so given the crisis legacy of high debt.  Ireland&rsquo;s post-crisis budget framework should help avoid boom-bust cycles and guide Government debt to safer levels.  It is important, therefore, that the framework, in both letter and spirit, is respected in fiscal plans.  Adherence to the budgetary framework during good times will help ensure a sustainable growth path and limit the need for austerity measures in any future downturn.

While everybody welcomes the increased Exchequer returns, three elements are manifesting themselves in the economy.

We are dependent on a very small pool.<\/p><p>There seems to be a shifting of revenue generation towards more volatile revenue generation centres.

While the bounce-back is welcome, there is an enormous array of external economic factors over which the State has no control and which are blowing very strongly in favour of the State.  As Professor McHale's report states, there in an output gap which is reducing quickly, and there is a danger again of the economy overheating, which is shocking.

On the one hand, there seems to be a sort of pattern of unrealistic forecasts for health.  This is combined with what we refer to as a soft budget constraint in health.

Also, elements of the rules, including the expenditure benchmark, are designed to prevent the type of procyclical response to revenue surges that we have been discussing.  The reason that it was able to occur this year is that we are in an odd transition between one phase of the rules, the corrective arm of the Stability and Growth Pact, and what is called the preventive arm.

I do not always agree with their recommendations but I appreciate the work they do in these engagements.  The witnesses identify two key vulnerabilities for us, one external and one domestic.  My question is about the external one first.  This is the one that is often mentioned but is not thought about much beyond that, namely, the possibility of a significant global downturn or external shock because of what is happening in the global economy.  Is it fair to say that the Government is not factoring this into its projections for steady growth over the next period and its generally upbeat story about what is happening in the Irish economy and that it is extreme folly for the Government not to factor in what I consider to be the growing likelihood - the witnesses can say if they agree on this - of a significant external shock?<\/p> <p>  I wish to hear what the witnesses have to say on that but I will outline why I view it as a growing likelihood.  First, mainstream people are saying it.  My young nephew who is in my D&aacute;il office did some research for me today and he picked out some examples of this.  Willem Buiter of Citigroup, a New York based bank, is warning that it is very likely that China is facing a hard cyclical downturn and that this will have a very significant impact on the rest of the global economy due to falling demand and so forth.  Similarly, the IMF has warned of a strong likelihood of a new global recession.  Its head has said that the scenario the IMF is depicting does not rely on extreme assumptions at all.  In other words, it is saying it is very likely.  Frankly, when one looks at what is happening in China, it appears to be almost inevitable that this will happen.  All of the money that exited from the banks in Europe and the western economies after 2008, which we bailed out, ran to China.  It over-heated the Chinese economy and now China will face a downturn.<\/p> <p>  Is this not almost a racing certainty?  In addition, there is a simple historical fact.  The recession happened in 2007 and it is now 2015.  Can we think of a period in recent history when there has not been a recession at least every eight to ten years?  Is it not almost a racing certainty that there will be a shock of some type?  We do not know the exact depth of it but it is not factored into the Government's projections.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015120300002#F00800","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1449151200,"counter":616,"content":"<p>The collective wisdom of the OECD is represented through Sebastian Barnes, so I will let him respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015120300002#F00900","nonspeaker":"Professor John McHale"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1449151200,"counter":617,"content":"<p>The Deputy makes very good points.  The council has included a risk matrix in its fiscal assessment report.  From memory, we gave a high relative likelihood for the type of scenario the Deputy outlines.  We definitely agree on the substance.  Putting on my OECD hat very briefly, this is the fifth year in a row in which the global growth rate has slowed.<\/p><p>Organisations such as the OECD and the IMF consistently revise down their forecasts for global growth which is a big source of concern for us.  The centre of this is a collapse in world trade.  World trade growth has been very slow since the crisis - slower than past relationships would suggest - and that situation has got worse during the course of the last year.  That is a great source of concern.  Times where trade growth has been this weak have typically been associated with recession or recession like conditions in the global economy.  We are very concerned about that.  The mechanisms the Deputy referred to through which this might happen are very familiar to people in Ireland and include, in essence, the accumulation of debt in China and other emerging economies.  We are about to go through an interesting couple of days.  The ECB met today and the Fed meets next week.  That may well be the trigger of some of these things, but it may not and there may be other triggers.  There is definitely good reason to be concerned.  Partly because it is so concentrated on very specific activities, Ireland can prosper even though things around it are not so good, but we should not be too complacent about that.  If there were a big global economic crisis, particularly one that went through into financial markets, it would clearly have very big consequences for everyone.  Everyone would be affected to some degree.<\/p><p> In terms of the forecasts by the Department of Finance, and this covers all OECD forecasts, we have a central scenario that assumes these things will not happen within the forecast period.  It is very hard to predict when a crisis is going to happen and exactly what the triggers would be.  The Department of Finance refers to a downside risk in its forecast material and that is surely the right thing to do.  I have not looked at the budget documents closely enough to say whether the Department has got the balance right but it is right that it has set out that there is a downside risk.  What this points to is not really a forecasting issue, but is rather a policy one.  One of the reasons we are arguing for caution, particularly on the 2015 decision, is that we have had a whole series of positive shocks for Ireland, which has been very helpful, but there is no guarantee that they will carry on being positive.  If one looks back at the typical scale of forecast shocks, one can quite easily see things that make life look a lot more difficult and less rosy than it does.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015120300002#F01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1449151200,"counter":619,"content":"<p>I am sorry to interrupt but my time is short.  I appreciate Mr. Barnes's response, which confirms what my fears are.  He clearly echoes those.I note two things in passing.  It is not Mr. Barnes's responsibility but we should all learn the folly of bailing out the banks, not just for us but internationally.  We gave the moneys back to the banks to go off and speculate somewhere else and it is going to blow back on us.  That is a bigger international issue.<\/p><p>On the projection side, it is fair to say the downside risk is always mentioned as a &quot;by the way&quot; to cover ourselves, but it is not taken seriously.  It is mentioned as a matter of course that there is upward, downward and central, but that picture is changing.  The likelihood of the downside risk materialising is now significantly greater than it was when it was mentioned in a perfunctory way three or four years ago.  On the domestic side, I find myself again in total agreement with the witnesses.  We have been saying for some time that over-reliance on the multinational sector is dangerous.  I would be interested to hear from the witnesses what we should do about it.  What is the council's role in advising on this?  Our view is that we should get as much out of these multinationals as possible now while we can and apply it to the development of our domestic economy.  We should invest it in infrastructure that provides a basis and some protection on a medium to long-term basis against the fluctuations, volatility and uncertainties of the global economy, in particular for an open economy like ours.  Is that not what we need to start saying?  Do we not need to say that we are too reliant on multinationals?<\/p><p>My theory for the boost in corporate tax revenues is as follows, and I do not know if the witnesses agree.  Microsoft was recently reported to have bought a huge amount of intellectual property from itself in the game of one subsidiary moving rights and patents from another to avoid tax.  I understand that it bought an incredible &euro;1.5 billion worth of intellectual property from itself which means the charging being done previously to subsidiaries in tax havens is now being done here.  Some of the profits will be allocated here that were previously allocated elsewhere and that relates to the closing off of the double Irish and the opening up of the knowledge box.  It is done precisely in order to benefit in the longer term from the knowledge box and to keep down the tax liability.  That is my theory.  What must we do and what should we be saying about insulating ourselves from the vulnerability that arises from an over-reliance on the multinational sector?  Is it not about investing in our own domestic industrial and infrastructural capacity and so on?<\/p><p>My last question flows from the above.  An area of this which is macro in scale as well as a very immediate social problem is the housing market, about which I have spoken to the council on a number of occasions.  This is now a big problem.  Some of us have been warning about it for a couple of years.  I read a very interesting article in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>today which acknowledges that the hope that the private sector would deliver the housing we need is not materialising.  In fact, the article explains quite well why that is not the case.  I will quote it briefly:<\/p><blockquote>A difficult dynamic of recent years is that very little land in Ireland is owned by developers, instead it&rsquo;s owned by international funds, receivers, and private equity.  Most of the multi-unit planning permissions of recent times have been run through by receivers and banks simply trying to add value to assets they already held, with no intention of ever building houses.  Project Clear and Nama among others have been a big driver of planning permission applications and renewals and this is now moving towards a natural end.<\/blockquote> <p>Ultimately, the article continues, this land has to get into the hands of capitalised builders or, I might add, the State before houses will be built.  The people who bought up all the land and assets have no intention of building.  They are just inflating the value of their assets.  The private sector does not have the capacity or the will to do it and we have a major problem as a result, including a major social crisis.  It will also be a macro-economic problem.  If people do not have anywhere to live, it will put upward pressures on pay demands and choke off investment.  Who wants to come to a place nobody can afford to live in?  This is a developing global problem.  I would be interested to hear what the witnesses have to say about it.  The answer is for the State to marshal more resources to itself.  It must increase taxes on capital and on those who hold all that wealth and those assets to invest them in key strategic areas of the economy.  If we do not do that, we will be riding for a big crash.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015120300002#G00200","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1449151200,"counter":620,"content":"<p>Dr. Thomas Conefrey will answer the multinational question first and I will come back to the housing question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015120300002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Professor John McHale"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1449151200,"counter":621,"content":"<p>We agree that the economy is hugely dependent on the traded side on multinational enterprises.

I agree on the seriousness of the issue.  It is a great risk to Irish growth.  One of the factors that should be feeding positively into growth is the return of emigrants.  It is incredibly difficult to come back to Ireland, particularly Dublin or one of the other cities, because of the cost of housing.  This could choke off the very positive growth dynamic.  In addition, there are social issues to be considered in relation to the housing crisis.  I agree with the Deputy on the seriousness of the problem.<\/p> <p>  Perhaps the lack of housing supply is so severe that a private sector response will be an important component along with identifying all the factors that are holding this back, such as people sitting on development land, as mentioned by the Deputy.  A vacant site levy could be important, bearing in mind that the cost of providing housing is still very high.  We have a chart in the report that compares the evolution of the cost of house building with house prices.  There are finance issues, as the Deputy stated, in addition to regulation issues.  Many challenges need to be tackled to try to have a private sector response.  Clearly, however, we cannot rely on the private sector alone, such is the severity of the problem.  People&rsquo;s housing needs are so great that the social housing side must comprise an important part of the solution.  We probably do not disagree that both sectors are required.  One could argue about the mix but I agree on the seriousness of the problem.

Surely that or something akin to it is the case.  Is there not a shifting of profit locations, thereby having an impact on tax?

I have been in the Irish public sector for a long time.  We worried all along about the dominance of the multinational sector in terms of what we would do if multinational companies were to disappear and how they could be substituted with domestic enterprise.  Over the years, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and its predecessors have tried to devise policies to reduce our dependence on multinationals and to build up the domestic system.  Clearly they have failed to do this.  Domestic activity is good, but it is not good enough to soften our dependence on multinationals.  This is something that has been around for a long time.  If anyone on the Deputy's side of the House can come up with good ideas for how to divert activity away from multinationals and towards domestic companies, that would be great.<\/p> <p>  The Revenue letter which says that all of this will be okay next year is couched in all kinds of qualifications.

There is great uncertainty in this area and I do not doubt it will continue to fluctuate.  It is too early for us to be able to say exactly what is behind the current fluctuation.  The Deputy is right when he says the profits which are shown as being in Ireland do not always reflect the economic activity that is here.  That is the most worrying aspect of the matter.  It comes to the fore when we come through a base erosion and profit-sharing process, which tries to fix the tax in different countries in line with the activities in such countries.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy is right to raise these issues.  The Fiscal Advisory Council, the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners should be looking closely at them.  Our warning is that we should not start spending this money until we know exactly what it is.  It may be around for a long while or a short while.  In the meantime, we should examine the reasons behind it and where the profits are coming from.  Even the changed forecasts for profitability in the economy in 2015, as set out in the latest economic projections, do not reflect the level of profitability that is showing up in the corporation tax returns.

Many people feel it is something of a paradox that the substantial and impressive headline growth rates that are undoubtedly being achieved are not being felt by the majority of people.  That is not just a political statement.  In opinion polls, a slight majority of people say they do not feel a recovery.  Clearly, some people are feeling a recovery.  I am not asking about what that says about the nature of the recovery.  Are there things, perhaps in the extent of the GDP growth rates, that explain why this seems to be a recovery that exists among certain sections of the economy, the country or the population but is not felt by a substantial number of people?  It is clear that the increase in VAT receipts is real.  It can be seen that this shows there is increased money in people's pockets.  People are spending.  That is real.  Most people will accept that there is increased economic activity that can be witnessed.  However, I do not think people would have a sense that they are experiencing a growth rate of 6% or higher.

The representatives of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council have said there were echoes of where we were.  We are not really dealing with the same figures as was the case in 2003 and 2004.  The echoes do not correspond.  I was a Member of the Parliament at the time and I remember budgets for health alone were increasing year on year by more than &euro;1 billion per annum during the course of the Celtic tiger.  That was only one Department.  There were also the benchmarking one and benchmarking two agreements as well as extra expenditure in all Departments.  As the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council representatives have said, it was all built on the loose foundation of tax receipts from one sector of the economy.  We are not in that scenario at the moment.  Some of my colleagues in the House may choose to read one part of the report but, in fact, they want to spend like crazy as well on other aspects.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015120300002#K00300","speaker":"1095"},{"type":"speech","time":1449151200,"counter":646,"content":"<p>You say \"as well\".<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015120300002#K00400","speaker":"1197"},{"type":"speech","time":1449151200,"counter":647,"content":"<p>You want to spend like crazy.  It is not at the level of what we are talking about or what is being budgeted for.  The current position is nowhere near the scenario the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council representatives have referred to.  The risk is very low for what they have referred to as the expansionary budget.  This economy has come through seven years of austerity and as we often hear, people are well and truly fed up with it.  However, there have been improvements and people have repaid vast amounts of debt.  Things are stabilising.  There are more than 100,000 extra people in the economy.  VAT receipts are up because people have more confidence, even those who worked through the recession.  They are far more confident about their jobs now.  There was a time four or five years ago when everyone was concerned that they might lose their jobs.  They did not have the same job security as they have now.  Will the representatives of Irish Fiscal Advisory Council comment on that?<\/p> <p>  Do the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council representatives believe we have an enterprise culture in this country?  We have done a great deal in regard to taxation issues, how we promote enterprise and how we encourage people to set up their own businesses.  However, there are still huge barriers to making this country an enterprise country.  The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council maintains we rely on multinationals.  I know from experience the views of people who have tried to set up and grow businesses.  They believe this country is not at the races in comparison to other countries when it comes to promoting enterprise and the relevant people valuing the contribution such people make.  Will the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council  representatives comment on Ireland in comparison with others other countries, such as Germany or the United Kingdom?  Those countries do far more to give people a start.  Let us consider the bankruptcy issue, for example.  The people who go bankrupt are the people who take chances and risks.  For years in this country, we more or less told those people that they were out of the market for five years.  That is not how an enterprise culture works.  People go broke because they take risks.  During the Celtic tiger, people took silly and disproportionate risks.  However, in a proper country which has a good SME culture, people take risks and they may lose their business but they should be given an opportunity start quickly.  Will the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council representatives comment on that?<\/p> <p>  This is an open economy, so it is expected to be volatile.  As a small country on the periphery of Europe with a small population, what else can the economy be, only volatile?  No one in this room believes we can have the same sort of economy as others - one for which we can plan ten years hence, for example, between now and 2025.  That would be ludicrous given the type of economy we have and how it is expected to work.  Can the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council representatives comment on that?<\/p> <p>  I realise the discussion of short-term, medium-term and long-term projections is important.  However, the nature of our economy makes this something that cannot be tied down.  The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council representatives have referred to how we have made revisions to what we expect will happen to the economy.  I almost see that as a positive thing, something we must do because of the nature of our economy.  Even larger economies that are far more developed and stable cannot make the predictions expected by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015120300002#K00500","speaker":"1095"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1449151200,"counter":648,"content":"<p>I will address the question of the parallels between the spending of excess corporation tax versus the property tax issue during the Celtic tiger years.

By spending at this point, the Government is making itself vulnerable to the next inevitable downturn.  This means when the economy turns down, the Government will not have the cushion to be able to handle the shock.  Therefore, we will end up in a situation where we are facing austerity at a time when the economy is hurting.<\/p> <p>  I am keen to go back to something Deputy Murphy said earlier in the interests of trying to help him warm up to us.  It is my parting gift to the council.  He describes the council as being designed to push austerity at all times.  I take issue with that description.

I take the point that people cannot see austerity continuing indefinitely, which is why we were supportive of what looked like a reasonable plan for 2016, which was a package of &euro;1.5 billion, but even then, for the next couple of years until we achieve a balanced budget, adjusting for cyclical factors, it will still be pretty tight.  I hope we can reach this sooner than had been initially forecast and get there by 2017 or 2018.  At that point things will loosen up and expenditure will be able to be increased at the underlying growth rate of the economy.  Coming up to this, the stringency with which we have been living for quite some time - the idea it would go on indefinitely would be very depressing - will start to lift in a more phased way.  I take the point that people need to see some light at the end of this.  As has been said, it is a reaction to the within-year increase in spending because of the surge in revenue.  This is the type of thing that got us into trouble before, and if we want to ensure we have sustainable growth, we should avoid making such mistakes again.  We believe it is our role to point this out very strongly to the public and to politicians.<\/p> <p>  The points made on enterprise culture go beyond the mandate of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council.  I understand the point that at times it seems entrepreneurship and enterprise do not get valued in this society in the way they are valued in other places, although I would not exaggerate this too much.  It is difficult to defend the fact the self-employed face the top marginal tax rate of 55%, which is three points higher than that for PAYE workers.  There are reasons for this, in terms of the way the social security system is organised and the benefits one gets, but it is a very negative signal to the self-employed.  On the positive side, Ireland scores quite well in the World Bank's doing business surveys which compare the ease of doing business in various countries.  I would not exaggerate the anti-enterprise culture too much.<\/p> <p> On the specific issue of bankruptcy, Ireland has a fairly tough bankruptcy regime even though it has been reformed significantly in recent years and these reforms continue.  Even from the point of view of an entrepreneur, getting the bankruptcy regime right is a balancing act.  On the one hand, one would like bankruptcy to be relatively easy in order that one can make a fresh start and failure is not punished, which may happen here more than elsewhere.  On the other hand, if people giving loans do not feel secure about giving them because the value of the underlying collateral is less because of bankruptcy procedures being too easy, it can make credit more difficult to obtain.  If the bankruptcy regime is designed badly so that it undermines a borrower's creditworthiness, it would not be good for entrepreneurs as it would affect their ability to start new ventures.  Even from the point of view of the entrepreneur and enterprise, getting the bankruptcy system right is a balancing act.<\/p> <p>  The volatility of the Irish economy has come up in various ways throughout the discussion.  Ireland has an incredibly volatile economy because of its openness and the importance of the multinational sector.  In addition to avoiding pro-cyclicality in policy, the other big lesson that came from the crisis is that we must think in a risk management way.  During the boom there was too much focus on central scenarios, with the soft landing scenario been the famous example.  This may not have been a bad central forecast.  As it turned out, it was desperately wrong, but given the uncertainties of the time, it may have been a reasonable central forecast.  However, people should have been able to see that things could have gone desperately wrong given the volatility of the economy and planned accordingly.  What we need to do now is recognise this volatility and that we are vulnerable because of our high debt, the multinational sector and other issues we have mentioned.  Many things can go desperately wrong.  Deputy Boyd Barrett sees a very high likelihood of the negative scenario unfolding.  Even if one still thought the central scenario was the right one, the Deputy is right to say many things could go wrong, and we need to plan for this.  One of the important things is to reduce our debt.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015120300002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Professor John McHale"},{"type":"speech","time":1449151200,"counter":656,"content":"<p>If one were to plan for Deputy Boyd Barrett's scenario, one would be expected to have even more regression on expenditure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015120300002#L00400","speaker":"1095"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1449151200,"counter":657,"content":"<p>We think the pace of deficit reduction and debt reduction under the framework in place is-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015120300002#L00500","nonspeaker":"Professor John McHale"},{"type":"speech","time":1449151200,"counter":658,"content":"<p>Too slow.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015120300002#L00600","speaker":"1095"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1449151200,"counter":659,"content":"<p>No, we would say it is about right.

At this stage, being realistic, having part of the banking-related debt written off is highly unlikely.  It will not be a source of significant debt relief.  On the other hand, the State has significant banking-related assets on the balance sheet which are estimated to be worth &euro;18.5 billion.  If we look at Allied Irish Banks alone, the estimate is that these assets are worth &euro;15.4 billion, less than the &euro;20.7 billion put in but still a significant sum.  Selling these assets is a way to get the debt down, but I would not exaggerate the benefit of it from an overall balance sheet perspective because these are assets on the balance sheet.  One can sell assets to reduce liabilities if the goal is to bring the debt down because there are risks associated with having high levels of sovereign debt.  Even if one has assets on the other side of the balance sheet, however, it can be hard to liquidate them quickly in a crisis.  As such, it can make sense from a risk management perspective to deleverage in the sense of bringing down the debt by selling assets.  On other ways to bring down the debt-to-GDP ratio, faster growth certainly will bring it down, as will a larger budget surplus or a smaller deficit.  The possibility of selling assets, as I have outlined, is another possibility.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015120300002#M01500","nonspeaker":"Professor John McHale"},{"type":"speech","time":1449151200,"counter":683,"content":"<p>Going back to the exchange between Deputy Pat Rabbitte and the Chairman, one of the concerns I have is that sometimes actors on the right figure they own fiscal responsibility.

The IFAC has said that it is imprudent to spend money the origins of which are uncertain.  There is this unexplained jump in corporate tax revenue which was not in the initial budget projections and it would be unwise to merely go on a splurge and spend it.  The IFAC has said that the Government is imprudent in this regard.  Would it be less imprudent to spend it if one knew that the expenditure was guaranteed to give one back revenue and the spending, if you like, would wash its own face in the medium to long term so that there is not a risk associated with the expenditure?  The reason I ask relates to my second question in respect of housing and the financing of housing, which I have already touched on but the importance of which I cannot overemphasise.  It is often said - but we do not think through the implications - that the question of housing and the financing of housing is at the centre of the economic crisis, domestically and internationally.  Buying a house is the biggest expenditure that anybody ever has in his or her life.  On an ongoing basis, it is the biggest investment.  It is central.  It links to so many different matters.  Is it a serious risk if the State is vulnerable to the volatility of the financing of an essential sector?<\/p> <p>  I highlight for the IFAC this danger of which it should be aware.  The vast majority of the Government's housing strategy, even in its social housing provision, is dependent on outsourcing to the private sector.  The State will have to pay for that.  It is money out - in the form of leasing arrangements, rent allowances, etc. - that will not come back in.  The cost is running at approximately &euro;1 billion per year.  If property prices and rents continue to rise, the State could be in a really serious position.  Is it not, to use the IFAC's word, \"prudent\" to reduce our risk in that regard?  The way in which we would do that is to have a bigger stock of State housing which generates revenue.  That would not be money out, it would be investment which guarantees money coming back in.  There would be less current expenditure than there is at present.  Through upfront capital investment for which we could use this &euro;2 billion we would reduce the current expenditure going out on the private sector that is just money literally going out the door.  Would that be prudent because there is no risk associated with it?  The rents will come back, if the State builds this housing.  I say that because one of the features of a more stable period of the world economy was in the post-war era when there was a much bigger stock of state housing across the western world.  At certain times in Ireland, 40% to 50% of all housing would have been provide by the State and that created stability at the centre of the economy.  Now the State provides less than 5% and its stock of housing is much reduced compared to what it was at that period of much greater stability.  Is this something that we need to consider and that must be a much bigger feature of the IFAC's analysis?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015120300002#N00400","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1449151200,"counter":689,"content":"<p>Mr. Tutty will respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015120300002#N00500","nonspeaker":"Professor John McHale"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1449151200,"counter":690,"content":"<p>I will respond generally on investment.  This is one of the weak areas in the new EU budgetary rules, namely, that everyone is to get to balance, whether for current expenditure or capital expenditure.  There is no special provision for investment.  If one states one can have an extra 1% or 2% as long as it is productive investment, it is difficult to define what that is.  There are many items we call investment that do not really bring a return at all and many items we call current expenditure that do bring a return, for example, in the education area.

The committee will be aware that the Supplementary Estimate is for &euro;15 million and relates, in the main, to meeting increased costs arising under the operational remit of Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, in the areas of sleepover payments and private residential care.<\/p> <p>  An industrial relations settlement relating to twilight hours, or sleepover payments, was not provided for in 2015 as no agreement had been reached at the time of making 2015 allocations.  The cost pressures experienced in the areas of private residential care and private foster care payments are driven by factors in demographics such as an increase in the numbers of children in care due to the fact that children are staying in care longer overall and the complexity of the challenges facing the children coming into these care placements.  Savings targeted for 2015 will not be achieved owing to the need to protect, in so far as possible, front line service delivery.  There are also legal cost pressures which continue to arise.  In the main, these pressures relate to increasing GAL costs and third party costs over which Tusla has no control but which are paid through it.<\/p> <p>  It will be possible this year to offset some of the required additionality in these areas from savings in other areas of the Tusla subhead, including payroll and capital.  The remaining portion of the required Supplementary Estimate is of a technical nature in which the reduced intake of receipts into the Department's Vote is to be offset against a corresponding reduction in expenditure on subhead B8 relating to the intervention programme for children.<\/p> <p>  The request for a Supplementary Estimate for Tusla for 2015 must be seen in the context of the favourable budget outcome for 2016.  As a result of this budgetary outcome, I have been able to allocate significant additional resources to Tusla next year.  I thank my Government colleagues for that too.  The case I made to Government colleagues around this funding was predicated on the management of risk.  This became most apparent in the area of unallocated cases with which members will be very familiar.  What followed was the preparation by Tusla of a business case for investment in children and family services.  This document, Survival to Sustainability, set out the many challenges being faced.  It detailed and quantified the additional resources which will be required over the coming years to address these matters.  It was also clear from both the business case and discussions between Tusla and officials from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs that some of these pressures are being felt in the current year.  This is a contributory factor to the need for this Supplementary Estimate.<\/p> <p>  My appearance today also provides me with a valuable opportunity to briefly reflect on the progress made to date by Tusla since its establishment at the start of 2014.  The agency was established to provide a one-stop-shop for children, by bringing together key services for children from the HSE children and family services, the National Education and Welfare Board, the Family Support Agency and a number of other services, including psychological services and domestic and sexual violence support services.  The establishment of Tusla was a key priority for the Government.<\/p> <p>  The intervening two years has seen Tusla make good progress in the reform and delivery of services to vulnerable children and families at a time of particular budgetary restraint.  In this regard, the committee will be particularly conscious of the issues highlighted by the agency itself and by HIQA that arose in some parts of the country, including counties Laois, Offaly, Louth and Meath.  Tusla has worked intensively to address these matters, both in dealing with the areas of immediate concern and by putting in place special measures to support good practice in the future.<\/p> <p>  The committee will also be aware that for some time, I have been very concerned about the number of cases awaiting a dedicated social work service.  I know this has been a serious concern for the committee also.  At my request, Tusla carried out an audit of these cases which formed an important part of my Estimates bid for 2016.  Action on this area, grounded in a significant and challenging recruitment programme, together with work on developing caseload management, standard business practices and a quality assurance strategy will help Tusla address the demands on the service to enable it to meet the needs of all vulnerable children in the right way, at the right time.<\/p> <p>  In accordance with legislative requirements, Tusla has developed its first three year corporate plan for 2015-17 in response to my Department&rsquo;s performance framework.  The plan includes the agency&rsquo;s key objectives, outputs and related strategies and sets out the agency&rsquo;s medium-term strategy for service delivery and reform.  This corporate plan underpins the agency&rsquo;s annual business plan, which is prepared in response to my annual performance statement.  I issued the performance statement for 2016 to the agency last month and the 2016 business plan is currently being prepared by Tusla in response.<\/p> <p>  The next step for the Child and Family Agency in its start-up phase, having gained a clear understanding of where gaps and solutions lie, is to commence implementing new structures to better resource and to drive service delivery and reform.  Every child who is the subject of a child protection or welfare concern is entitled to expect a timely response.<\/p> <p>  Through 2014 and 2015 Tusla has continued to develop its services and to address a number of key concerns regarding child welfare and protection services.  As Minister, I am fully supportive of the agency&rsquo;s implementation of a wide-ranging programme in this area.  The increased funding available to Tusla in 2016 will allow it to build on these initiatives and the further necessary reform of services will continue to be a high priority.  There is more work to do and Tusla would be the first to say so.  However, it is important to say that in its annual overview earlier in 2015, HIQA noted evidence of improving services and good practice in children&rsquo;s social care in many regions.  It is now important that we all build on the progress to date to further improve service delivery to children and families.<\/p> <p>  I seek the select sub-committee&rsquo;s approval for the Supplementary Estimate, Vote 40, and in doing so, I will be happy to hear any comments and to take questions from members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE22015120300002#C00300","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1449135000,"counter":704,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

No one would dare to argue with an increase in funding to Tusla as it is very much-needed.  Members across the political divide would acknowledge that the agency has struggled to keep up with everything we would like to see it address.  Last year alone, Mr. Gordon Jeyes, the CEO of Tusla, called for &euro;18 million extra just to keep up with the shortfall in social workers.  We have seen a 17% cut to domestic violence services since 2012 while counselling services were cut by 47%.  There has been a 5% cut year on year to the school completion programme and the family resource centres.<\/p><p>Many of the good schemes dealing with prevention and early intervention have not been able to fulfil their obligations and are becoming reactionary and are only getting involved when a problem manifests itself and it becomes abundantly clear State intervention is needed.

While I welcome the extra &euro;15 million, I have grave reservations that it is not enough.<\/p><p> The Minister referred to the recovering economy, which is true and needs to be acknowledged.  However, when one heard of huge increases in revenue returns announced this week, one wonders whether the Minister is selling the agency short by only looking for a &euro;15 million increase.  Mr. Gordon Jeyes is on record as saying that &euro;18 million is needed just to keep pace with the shortfall in social workers alone.  We are not even keeping pace with what Mr. Jeyes said he requires.<\/p><p> A bugbear of mine, which I have repeatedly highlighted, is the amount of money being spent, from limited resources, on legal fees.

At a time of such limited resources, we are spending large amounts of money on an unregulated service.  I am aware the Minister published a draft document in the past four to five weeks on regulating the service.  Will the Minister indicate how much his Department has spent on legal fees, in terms of the administration of the GAL system, over the past four years?  The huge amount of money being spent on legal fees is questionable at a time when people are waiting months to have a social worker assigned to them and when thousands of cases are not being treated with the urgency they warrant.  Will the Minister outline exactly how much has been spent on legal fees in the past four years?<\/p><p> I turn to the other cost pressures.  The Minister spoke about private residential care and private foster care payments and the demographic factors driving these increases.  The Minister said more children are in care for longer periods of time.  Last year, Dr. Niall Muldoon, the Ombudsman for Children, identified the huge delay in assessing children who are vulnerable.  Does the Minister believe this increase in funding is sufficient given the backlog of cases that have yet to be assessed and the potential for a further increase in the number of children who may need to go into foster care or residential care?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE22015120300002#C00500","speaker":"1065","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1449135000,"counter":707,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and his officials for being here and thank the Minister for his presentation.  I have a small criticism.  I would like to get the notes and documentation a little bit earlier so that I would have more time to prepare.  Sometimes the supporting documentation comes in late and it could be late in the evening before we get a chance to look over it.<\/p> <p>  The &euro;15 million is a minimal amount in the overall spend but it does not come as a surprise because it has been well highlighted that Tusla is underfunded.  I acknowledge the Minister has allocated extra funds next year but when one takes into consideration all the different agencies under the umbrella of Tusla, when the money is divvied out, it means very tight budgets for many of these agencies and it is hard to stay within these budgets.  A Supplementary Estimate has been brought forward this year but we cannot bring one forward next year.  If there is an overspend next year, it will be a cause for concern.<\/p> <p>  The Minister said savings targets for 2015 would not be achieved owing to the need to protect, in so far as possible, front line service delivery.  That is a bit strange because the State would have had to provide resources to protect the children anyway, so it is just stating the obvious.  No provision was made for the industrial relations settlement on twilight hours.  Should the Minister not have made a provision, such as a contingency fund, to cover this?  Is this something that came out of the blue for which his Department was not prepared?<\/p> <p>  Tusla's main focus should always be to provide the best care possible in an efficient manner, something on which everybody agrees.  Will the Minister indicate, in the context of spending breakdown, how much funding is allocated to each measure he has put forward?

Clearly, finding the level of funding it requires, and predicting the funding it requires, is more an art than a science for the first couple of years.  I believe we have a handle on it now.  I am pleased the agency was able to conduct the audit of unallocated places I requested of it and to produce and price a business plan.  It is a realistic business plan as it is based on a three-year approach.  People will complain that three years is a long time but this is an issue which has bedevilled successive Governments over many decades.  To finally get a handle on it, to have a plan to deal with it and to be in a position to provide the agency with the money it requested for the first year of that plan, because of our recovering economy, is to be welcomed.  I acknowledge Tusla's efforts in this regard; it has done a very good job.  We have given the money and I met with the board in recent days.  I have made it very clear that it is now up to the agency.  I have every confidence in the agency to deliver.  It has done a very good job to date.<\/p> <p>  The agency faces serious challenges.  It must recruit many staff but due to the recovering economy, there is competition for talent, for social workers and others.  The Department has supported the agency as far as it can with resources but now it is over to it.<\/p> <p>  We are here to debate the Supplementary Estimate and we will have an opportunity next week to debate the broader business plan and services, etc., more fully.  The funding announced for 2016 is very close to what was sought by Tusla, the spending of which represents a major challenge for it.  We have given it sufficient money and today is about the Supplementary Estimate.  Tusla, not unlike the HSE, is a demand-led service.  We cannot predict how many children will need to go into care.  We cannot predict what issues will arise and many of the events which occur in our society are beyond the control of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.<\/p><p>We seek to protect our children and I think we are all committed to that.  I thank the members of the committee for their commitment to that.  We all want to support the Department and Tusla in achieving the best outcomes for our children.  I thank members for their comments.  I do not know that it is particularly useful to over analyse what has happened but let us be clear I concur with Deputy Troy's concern about legal fees.  My Department is developing policy around this issue.  We are looking at best practice in the North of Ireland and elsewhere and it is an issue that does consume us because nobody wants to see money that has been allocated by the taxpayer for the care of children going into the hands of the legal profession, no disrespect to them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE22015120300002#D00500","speaker":"952","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1449135000,"counter":712,"content":"<p>I concur with what the Minister has said and I am conscious that next week we have another opportunity at the quarterly meeting to go into the general scheme of things for next year.  I acknowledge it is a new agency but many of the schemes run by the agency are not new.  For example, the school completion programme, family resource centres, domestic services and the counselling services have been in operation for many years and have proven their worth but have had their funding drastically cut in recent years.  There is nothing in the Supplementary Estimate to restore any of those cuts.  The Minister said nobody can predict what will happen or how many children will come into care at any particular time and there is an element of truth in that but one also has the benefit of previous years of knowing the number of children on average who have come into care in the past ten decades.  He will be aware there has been an increase in the number of referrals because people are much more vigilant than in the past, as a consequence of the awful inquiries we had to conduct into our shameful past on how we treated children.  As a result there are more children who need more intervention and a greater level of support.  We should be able to budget for that but, unfortunately, we have not been doing so.<\/p> <p>  It is not good enough for the Minister in his position as head of the Department to brush over and say that he concurs with my sentiments in respect of the legal costs because he is in a position to do something about it.  I produced legislation 12 months ago in terms of how we might look at regulating this industry based on looking at best practice in other jurisdictions.  I am sure it is easy for the Minister or any of his officials to put a finger on this - how much did we spend on legal fees in the past four and half years at a time when we were cutting family resource centres, counselling services and domestic services?  It is not good enough, after four and half years, to say we are working on the issue and will address it.  In my opinion, the savage downturn in the economy actually gave an opportunity to look at look at where there was waste.  Nobody wanted to see it but there was an opportunity to look at the waste and reprioritise the areas to which funding was being allocated.  In a Department which is so critical in terms of the protection and welfare of our children and so many services in the community that it supports, legal fees would not have been high on the agenda.  One of my first priorities would have been to rein them in and ensure the money was best spent on front line services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE22015120300002#E00200","speaker":"1065"},{"type":"speech","time":1449135000,"counter":713,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Byrne.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE22015120300002#E00300","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1449135000,"counter":714,"content":"<p>I am sorry I did not come in earlier, I was waiting to hear what the Minister had to say.

Tusla has made a huge impact in communities in guiding groups as to how they should and should not function.  If one was to take everything into account, we are in a different space than five or six years ago.  When the previous Government was in office there was a huge duplication of services and money was being poured out to beat the band in communities.  In my own community, I am aware of the amount of money that was paid to different groups and agencies, family resources centres and so on.  It is not all about money, it is about the quality of the service who run it.  Money is important but it is not the be all and end all of everything.  It does not make running a family resource centre or any other agency better.  What makes it better is that it is run properly and that the people in charge are capable of running it.  I can only speak about my community.  In the past money was poured into every agency, every community group and every family resource centre.  Some of it did not make a damn difference because there was a duplication of services.  In fairness to the Department and Tusla, things are starting to show a better picture of how things should be managed.  This is what this is about, it is not about pouring money into services.  It is about managing what one has and being able to distribute it properly and use it with better standards than have been used  previously.  I welcome the funding that is being allocated - whether it is will become known in time.  I am very happy that Tusla has a plan for the next three years and maybe in that time it will have the opportunity to establish what services really work.  There are services out there that are not working, they are a shambles and we need to look at them, parish by parish, at this stage.  There are groups who say they are doing X, Y and Z when I know in my heart and soul they are not doing X, Y and Z.  I welcome the increase in the funding but it is rich of anybody who was a member of the then Government to criticise it given that when there was huge money in this country it continued to pour it in and took no responsibility for the way that money was used in communities.  That is the sad reflection of where we are today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE22015120300002#E00800","speaker":"1029"},{"type":"speech","time":1449135000,"counter":719,"content":"<p>I call Deputy McLellan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE22015120300002#E00900","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1449135000,"counter":720,"content":"<p>While I agree with Deputy Bryne that quality is extremely important, money is also important.

We are representatives of a group of parents who have come together from throughout the country to form REGRET, which stands for Reactions and Effects of Gardasil Resulting in Extreme Trauma.<\/p><p>We are a support group for families with children suffering long-term and life-changing health issues following the administering of the Gardasil HPV vaccination.  Our 130 daughters display a series of debilitating, long-term and chronic symptoms corresponding directly with the Gardasil patient information leaflet, or PIL, provided by the manufacturer.  The PIL is the folded leaflet everyone gets included in the medication package when they go into the pharmacy to collect medication.  We were not given this information when signing the consent form for our daughters to get vaccinated with the Gardasil HPV vaccine in first year of secondary school.  Instead, parents are given a marketing leaflet outlining five mild side effects.  Nowhere are we told about the risk of long-term, chronic and life-changing side effects.  We were not told about the daily severe headaches our girls struggle with for years, the nausea and stomach pains, the debilitating fatigue, the fainting and seizures and onset of autoimmune disorders.  We were not told that we might regularly end up in the accident and emergency department watching our teenagers scream in pain while doctors rule out one condition after another.  We were not told that our previously healthy, sporty and high-achieving girls might never play sports again never mind socialise with friends to enjoy what should be the most carefree time in their lives.  We were not told about the impact of these illnesses on our daughters' ability to continue their education and the resulting psychological impact of having this basic human right taken away.<br\/><br\/>Parents are not prepared for the emotional strain of watching a child struggle to get out of bed to face another day of pain, fatigue, muscle weakness, dizziness and inability to concentrate.  We worry about how we will manage to raise the funds to meet our daughters' many medical needs in years to come.  Some of our daughters have contracted potentially life-threatening conditions which are rare or unheard of in children their age.  While some doctors admit that they think it is connected with the Gardasil HPV vaccination, most medical professionals in GP clinics, accident and emergency departments and hospitals throughout Ireland will not acknowledge any connection with this vaccine.  Maybe if we as parents had been given the PIL, we could have pointed out the list of possible side effects to these doctors.  Instead we struggled, sometimes for years, to understand our previously healthy daughters' range of health issues before making the connection.<br\/><br\/>We believe there is significant under-reporting of HPV vaccine adverse reactions to the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA.  Before contacting REGRET, most parents had never heard of the HPRA or the adverse reaction reporting system.  It is also their experience that doctors and consultants failed to report suspicions of side effects even when parents had pointed out the connection.  We all wanted the very best for our children.  We trusted that the HSE would act responsibly and respect our right as parents to be fully and honestly informed before making the decision to sign the consent form.  This is a significant decision for parents, considering Ireland is one of the very few countries in the developed world that still does not have a vaccine damage compensation scheme.  When the Gardasil vaccination programme was discussed by this committee three years ago, Dr. Colette Bonner from the Department of Health noted the committee's concern that there is no vaccine damage compensation scheme.  She said, &quot;There is an expert report which we are considering.  I will convey the committee's concerns both to the secretary-general and the Minister on this point.&quot;<br\/><br\/>We now know that Gardasil got CDC fast-track approval and underwent a mere six months' of human trial research.  Subjects were only followed for five to 15 days in the safety studies and only 1,200 girls under 16 years of age participated even though this is the target age for the vaccine.  During these clinical safety trials paid for by Merck, 95% of the placebo injections contained the same toxic aluminium adjuvant as the vaccine itself which resulted in Merck being able to claim that adverse reactions were not significantly higher than those of the placebo group.  We also now know that in a later four-year clinical trial by Merck, one in 40 trial participants reported a serious adverse event after taking the Gardasil HPV vaccine.  In addition, one in 30 also reported a new autoimmune condition.  Given that the current rate of incidence of cervical cancer in Ireland is only 13 in 100,000, the benefits of this vaccine hardly appear to outweigh the risks.  According to politicians and health authorities, the benefit is that 50 to 60 lives a year will be saved by the HPV vaccine in Ireland.  However, health technology assessment reports from other countries show that these statistics can only result from the combined effect of screening plus vaccination.  In Ireland, however, these figures are being presented as the effect of vaccination alone.  The truth is that our girls will still require ongoing and regular pap smear tests because protection from the HPV vaccine has not been shown to last longer than eight years.<br\/><br\/>Worldwide, concern is mounting about the safety of the Gardasil HPV vaccine.  Gardasil has now been dropped from the childhood immunisation schedule in Denmark and replaced with an alternative vaccine.  As of 1 September 2015, approximately 1,100 girls were being treated in five Danish regional medical centres for suspected Gardasil related conditions.  Japan no longer recommends the HPV vaccine after conducting its own investigation into serious reactions.  This month, we have been told that Gardasil's safety has been reaffirmed based on the results of a European Medicines Agency, EMA, review which found no link between Gardasil and two specific medical conditions, CRPS and POTS.  However, the research director and consultant, Dr. Jesper Mehlsen, from Denmark has studied many girls with suspected adverse reactions to the HPV vaccine.  He has criticised the EMA for not releasing the evidence of records and data when submitting its early release conclusion.  Dr. Mehlsen is now heading an independent investigation into the HPV vaccine with results due out in April 2016.  Speaking in June this year, he said, &quot;A realistic estimate is that one in 500 girls experience serious side effects.&quot;<br\/><br\/>Spanish doctor and professor of public health, Carlos Alvarez-Dardet, from the University of Alicante has initiated a petition against the HPV vaccine.  He is a former President of the European Public Health Association and was also an adviser to the WHO.  He is now calling for an immediate stop to the vaccine.  Last month, researchers announced the results of a Canadian study to show the effect the HPV vaccine had on 170 teenagers whom they followed for four years.  They now question both the safety and benefits of the HPV vaccine, urging Quebec to halt HPV immunisation until its alleged dangers have been independently investigated.  In France, Mich&egrave;le Ravasi MEP has compiled a large petition with hundreds of physicians' signatures calling for a moratorium on the HPV vaccine.<br\/><br\/>As parents, we feel that the Minister for Health has a duty of care for the 130 teenage girls suffering chronic ill health since receiving the Gardasil HPV vaccination.  However, he has consistently declined our requests for a meeting to discuss our daughters' situation.  By way of a parliamentary question in October, Deputy Maureen O&rsquo;Sullivan asked the Minister for Health the reason parents are not provided with a copy of the patient information leaflet prior to signing the consent form for the HPV vaccine.  The HSE provided a response in the form of a letter from Dr. Kevin Kelleher, assistant national director of public health, which included this explanation:<\/p><blockquote>All the information provided to parents about vaccination is prepared from the available licensed documentation for each vaccine, the Summary of Products Characteristics (SPC) and Patient Information Leaflet (PIL).  The information is presented in clear simple language and approved by the National Adult Literacy Agency so that it can be understood by all adults as the average reading age in Ireland is 12 years of age.<\/blockquote><p>As such, the official reason for the HSE withholding the list of known serious, debilitating and long-term side effects from the HPV vaccine information literature is because &quot;the average adult reading age is 12 years old&quot;.  That is the basis on which the content of these information leaflets is determined.  I hope the absurdity of this logic is not lost on the joint committee<i>.  <\/i>As an aside, I note that it was <font color=\"#2F2F2F\">Merck Sharp &amp;amp; Dohme <\/font>who sponsored NALA's 2007 <font color=\"#2F2F2F\">Irish health literacy research project<\/font>.  This is the manufacturer of the Gardasil vaccine.<br\/><br\/>There are some who would rather dismiss us as anti-vaccine parents, but we all gave our other children their vaccinations just as we all signed the consent form for this one.  We thought we were doing the best for them.  Instead, we signed away our girls' futures and five years later they are still struggling.  Our lives will never be the same following the Gardasil HPV vaccination of our daughters.  Years have been taken from them, their parents, their siblings and their grandparents.  We have been given no answers, no guidance and no hope.  We live with the guilt of our decision to sign the Gardasil consent form every day as we watch our previously healthy young girls struggle to get through their day with our bags packed 24-7 in case of yet another emergency visit to the hospital.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015120300002#B00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Anna Cannon","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1449141300,"counter":749,"content":"<p>Six months ago, we were just a few mums and dads who recognised a pattern of similar illnesses among our daughters.  Today, we represent more than 130 teenage girls and receive more reports every week of girls displaying a similar pattern of debilitating side effects.<\/p><p>The Department of Health and the HSE have acknowledged they know some young women will suffer detrimental effects from the vaccine.  We represent 130 of these girls.  My daughter Laura celebrated her 18th birthday last week and this is her story.  When Laura brought home the consent form from school in 2010 I read it thoroughly.  I also went on the World Health Organization's website to educate myself about this vaccine as it was new to Ireland and I did not know much about it.  After reading the information supplied by the HSE, I felt not only reassured that this was a safe vaccine but also that this was something very important for my little girl and her future health.  I naively thought that all details, good and bad, had to be printed to enable parents to make properly informed choices for their children.<br\/><br\/>After Laura&rsquo;s vaccination she became severely fatigued on a daily basis and her short-term memory and concentration deteriorated.  She also started to experience food intolerances for the first time.  Laura suffered visual disturbances and noise sensitivity.  Severe daily headaches, burning muscles and joint pain were her constant companions.  She was unable to continue with sports, which had played such an integral part of her life before the vaccination.  All extra-curricular and social activity had, by now, become impossible for her.  Her friends stopped calling as she did not have the strength to go out with them.  Slowly, life as Laura knew it was changing.<br\/><br\/>To put things in perspective, my mother, who was in her 80&rsquo;s, was going out to day care while Laura was lying in bed or on the couch.  We had to use my mother&rsquo;s wheelchair for Laura when she did not have the energy to walk.  It was plain for anyone to see something was very seriously wrong.  We started to visit our GP more and more but no one seemed to have any idea what was going on.  Tests and more tests were performed and nearly every box on the blood forms was ticked.  Every kind of sample one could imagine was requested, yet none of the results showed any clues as to what was wrong with my daughter.<br\/><br\/>Weeks and months went by, with Laura lying in her bed exhausted but unable to get any kind of rejuvenating sleep, racked with pain and barely able to communicate.  The weeks became months, and we saw less of her around the house as she was spending most days in her bed.  At her lowest point, I found her younger brother Conor spoon-feeding her as she did not have the strength to feed herself.  She moved into a spare bed in his room, as she was lonely and afraid on her own.<br\/><br\/>Five years post-Gardasil, my daughter was so debilitated that she could not attend her uncle's wedding and struggled to attend her grandparents' funerals.  She is no longer able to attend family outings with us and we feel guilty if we leave her at home.  Laura knew from an early age what she wanted and had her sights set very high.  Since receiving the vaccination all this has changed as Laura has missed almost her entire secondary school education.<br\/><br\/>This is Laura's story in her own words:<\/p><blockquote>Hi, my name is Laura, I'm 18 years old and live in Louth.  I am one of the too many girls who have been affected by the HPV vaccine, Gardasil.  It has rendered my life very difficult.  I am lying here in bed when I should be in school preparing for my leaving cert.  My cognitive function is so bad I can't even manage home schooling at the moment.  My symptoms include chronic fatigue, chronic pain, severe headaches, dizziness, short-term memory loss, very poor concentration, food intolerances, cysts, heart and breathing difficulties, light and noise sensitivity and menstrual disruption.<br \/><br \/>I&rsquo;d like to think I am an intelligent girl, once aiming to study psychology in Trinity.  I was playing basketball and kayaking.  I had so many friends and wanted to travel the world.  Now all those things have been taken from me.  You have no idea how horrible this is.  My own mother has devoted every second of her life to helping me and finding me relief in expensive therapies, supplements, and hopefully one day a cure.  Not only has this vaccine taken my life, it's stolen my mother's.  I'm five years down the line and I just turned 18.  I try my best to keep positive but at this point I don't have the energy to keep going the way I am.  I just want recognition and help for all these girls.  We've been put in a box for far too long.<\/blockquote><p>The Irish Government or the HSE has not put in place a support system to cater for all of these previously healthy Irish girls suffering ongoing, chronic and long-term symptoms post-Gardasil.  Their fate is unknown and their debilitating health issues are potentially life-long.  Many of these girls will never complete their leaving certificate.<br\/><br\/>We need to provide holistic long-term treatment plans for these girls.  Families are not coping financially with the ongoing need for doctors, specialists, hospital stays and medication.  We need to get help for these children to explore alternative options for schooling and education, and allow them exemptions if attempting to sit their leaving certificate.  We need to support these girls with basic requirements such as disability allowances and medical cards as their condition is not being recognised.<br\/><br\/>I thank the Deputies and Senators for their time and interest in the young women throughout the country affected by the State-sponsored HPV vaccination programme.  We ask them for the suspension of the HPV vaccine programme pending a full, independent and transparent investigation into the safety of the HPV vaccine, including the many long-term side effects and adverse reactions suffered by the girls in REGRET; recognition and acknowledgement of our daughters' post-Gardasil conditions followed by holistic approach medical treatments by specialists in this area; financial assistance for our families to meet their children&rsquo;s ongoing medical needs; the urgent establishment of a task force comprising senior officials from the Departments of Health, Education and Skills and Social Protection to fast-track support for our daughters; and full information from the HSE to parents, including the patient information leaflet as drawn up by the drug company, which requests that parents inform their health care provider if their daughter experiences any of the 21 known side effects as part of the informed consent process.<br\/><br\/>I hope the stories of these 130 Irish teenage girls will trigger a positive response from the committee, and that committee members will help us ensure their immediate and long-term needs are met.  This is the very least they deserve from us, as their future has been so unfairly impacted upon by medical decisions outside of their control.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015120300002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Karen Smyth","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1449141300,"counter":751,"content":"<p>In 2009, the national immunisation advisory committee recommended the HPV vaccination for all 12 year old girls, and in September 2010 the programme started for all girls in first year of second level schools.<\/p><p>My colleague, Dr. Kevin Connolly, is chairman of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee.  He will give the committee examples of how NIAC makes recommendations for inclusion of new vaccines in the primary childhood immunisation schedule and school immunisation programme.<\/p><p> Gardasil is the vaccine used by the HSE in the school immunisation programme and is provided free of charge.  My colleague, Dr. Brenda Corcoran, will give details of the school immunisation programme and discuss the information given to parents.<\/p><p> Why did we introduce the human papillomavirus vaccine?  The reason is that it protects against HPV types 16 and 18, which are known to cause over 70% of cervical cancers.  In Ireland, approximately 300 cases of cervical cancer are diagnosed each year.  Up to 60% of women diagnosed with cervical cancer are under 50 years of age and there are approximately 100 deaths each year.  This vaccine could save up to 70% of these women's lives.<\/p><p> What happens when a new vaccine or medicine is introduced to the market?  All medicinal products, including vaccines, are required to go through extensive trials before they are reviewed by the European Medicines Agency and licensed by the European Commission.  Even after any products are licensed, the EMA, the Health Products Regulatory Agency and all EU competent authorities continue to monitor them to ensure they continue to be safe and effective.  My colleague, Dr. Joan Gilvarry, will explain the regulatory regime in greater detail.<\/p><p> I am aware of reports of serious health problems alleged to have occurred following HPV vaccination and I have great sympathy for any family caring for a sick child.  However, I emphasise that this does not mean the symptoms have been caused by the HPV vaccine.  Over 170,000 girls in Ireland and up to 63 million girls worldwide have received this important cancer-preventing vaccine.  The vast majority of reported side-effects have been consistent with the expected pattern of short-term adverse side effects for the vaccine.<\/p><p> Two reported conditions have recently been examined by the European Medicines Agency.  These are complex regional pain syndrome, a chronic pain condition affecting the limbs, and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, a condition causing symptoms such as dizziness, fainting, headaches, chest pain and weakness.  It should be noted that these two syndromes are recognised to occur in the general population, including adolescents, regardless of whether those affected have had the HPV vaccine.  The EMA review confirms that the evidence does not support a causal link between the HPV vaccine and the development of CRPS and POTS.  Therefore, there is no reason to change the way the vaccines are used or amend the current product information.  My colleagues will give the committee further details of these reviews.<\/p><p> Anyone in Ireland who is experiencing ill-health is eligible to seek medical attention and access appropriate health and social services, irrespective of the cause of the symptoms.  I strongly advise any girls and their families in this situation to seek medical advice from their doctors and be guided by that advice, so that they can have an opportunity to return to full health as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015120300002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Colette Bonner","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1449141300,"counter":753,"content":"<p>I am here in my capacity as the chairman of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee.  I will offer some background or additional helpful information.  Up to last year, I was the Irish representative on the expert committee of the European Medicines Agency known as the paediatric committee.  One of the functions of the committee is to stipulate in detail the contents and timelines of all trials by any company for any vaccine intended for use in Europe.  These plans include a large emphasis on safety monitoring during the trials and after the vaccine is introduced.  The companies must comply with these conditions or they will not get a licence.<\/p> <p>  I have been a member of the advisory committee of the Health Products Regulatory Agency for over 20 years.  I worked as a paediatrician for 32 years up to 2010, dealing with children with chronic ongoing debilitating conditions.  I am a parent of four children.  One of my children had chronic fatigue following infection with glandular fever, a well-recognised cause of chronic fatigue.<\/p> <p>  I am keen to make clear that I strongly empathise with the children and families represented by the Reactions and Effects of Gardasil Resulting in Extreme Trauma support group.  Chronic fatigue syndrome can be a debilitating chronic condition, and no one who has listened to the stories could fail to recognise that.  I have met and spoken with representatives of REGRET.  Any person in Ireland with a chronic condition should have ready access to services that can, in a timely fashion, appropriately assess, investigate and manage their problems on an individual basis.  If that is assured, the main aim of REGRET. will be achieved.<\/p> <p>  I will address four areas to help inform the committee and to answer some of the questions put by the representatives of REGRET.  First, I will set out some information about the immunisation advisory committee.  Second, I will outline some facts about the infection and disease caused by HPV.  Third, I will outline some information about the vaccine.  Fourth, I will try to tease out the differences between adverse events and adverse reactions.<\/p> <p>  The immunisation advisory committee is an independent committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland.  Members include members of the college of physicians, the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, the Irish College of General Practitioners and the faculties of paediatrics, occupational medicine and public health medicine in universities.  There are also representatives from the national virus reference laboratory as well as the Travel Medicine Society of Ireland and nursing and midwifery experts.  The committee also includes representatives of the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, which gives us information about the incidence and pattern of diseases.  A representative of the Health Products Regulatory Authority is on the committee because the licensing and legality of particular decisions must be ensured.  Finally, there are representatives from the Department of Health and the national immunisation office as well as another observer from the HSE.<\/p> <p>  I will set out the relevant responsibilities of the immunisation committee.  I call it NIAC for short because it is easier to say.  First, the function of the committee is to review new licensed vaccines to see whether they are suitable for inclusion in the Irish vaccine schedule.  Second, its role is to give advice or make recommendations to the Department of Health with regard to vaccines.<\/p> <p>  I will set out the main criteria we consider when we are considering new vaccines.  First, the availability of a safe and effective vaccine.  Second, knowledge of the incidence of the disease or infection in Ireland.  Third, whether there is a significant disease burden.  In other words, a mild infection such as a cold does not really require a vaccine whereas a significant infection like the cancer-causing HPV would.  Fourth, we consider whether the recommended vaccine can be easily added to the current vaccine schedule.  This is why the national immunisation office is represented on the committee.  We also consider the experience in different countries that may have already introduced the vaccine and an economic analysis to see whether the vaccine is cost-effective.  Then we provide advice or recommendations to the Department.<\/p> <p>  Another function of the committee is just as important as making the decision.  This is the ongoing review of all available information regarding the vaccines, including the safety and their effectiveness.  I will set out why this is relevant to the infection caused by the human papillomavirus.  HPV infection is the commonest sexually-transmitted infection and it is very contagious.<\/p><p>It is estimated that up to 80% of males and females will have contracted the infection by the time they are 50.  It is known that it causes cancers of the cervix, vagina, vulva, penis, anus, mouth and throat.  It also causes anogenital warts.  Without the screening mentioned by REGRET, the lifetime risk of sexually active people developing cancer from this virus is about one in 30, which is very appreciable.<\/p><p> Most HPV infections of the cervix and the anus have no symptoms and more than 90% of infections are cleared naturally within two years.  Early infections in both sexes may be accompanied by mild changes at the site of infection and for females these changes can be identified in cervical smears, which is part of the cervical screening programme.  The term given is cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, which to me means abnormal cells in the cervix, and this can go on to cause cancer.  As the infection persists, the cancer precursors are noticed.  This means that if these remain untreated they have a high chance of leading to cancer.  It can take ten years or longer for the cancer to show; there is a very long incubation period.<\/p><p> Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer in females and the virus is estimated to result in nearly all of the approximately 250,000 deaths from cervical cancer.  In Ireland each year there are more than 300 cases of cancer of the cervix and 100 deaths.<\/p><p> No vaccine is 100% safe or 100% effective, but they are very safe and very effective.  The trials of drugs normally involve hundreds or thousands of subjects.  In the case of vaccines, the trials involve tens of thousands of subjects, as they are given mainly to people who are well and the bar is set much higher.  This safety is monitored both in the trials carried out before licensing and in follow-up reports.  The clinical part of the trials on the HPV vaccines in Europe lasted more than four years and not the six months that was stated in the United States.  So they happened for appreciably longer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015120300002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Kevin Connolly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1449141300,"counter":755,"content":"<p>I ask Dr. Connolly to conclude because he has exceeded his allocated time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015120300002#F00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1449141300,"counter":756,"content":"<p>I am very sorry.

I was not informed about that.<\/p> <p>  An adverse event is different from an adverse reaction.  An adverse event happens in association with the vaccine but is not necessarily caused by the vaccine, whereas an adverse reaction is.  In order to determine whether the chronic fatigue symptom is caused or coincidental, it is necessary to know the incidence of the syndrome in those who were never vaccinated, for instance before the vaccine was introduced, and the incidence subsequent to the vaccine.  We know that the numbers expected for chronic fatigue syndrome in Ireland before the vaccine was introduced are conservatively 340, and up to 680.  Some 170,000 children have been vaccinated, so the reports that have been received - I believe 120 or 130 was mentioned - are less than would be expected.  As is known, it is under-reported, but based on that there is no evidence to suggest that the vaccine caused chronic fatigue syndrome in these children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015120300002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Kevin Connolly"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1449141300,"counter":759,"content":"<p>I am representing the HSE national immunisation office, which is responsible for the co-ordination of all publicly funded immunisation programmes.  We are responsible for training and communication materials for health professionals and the general public.<\/p> <p>  The HPV vaccine is one of three different vaccines given to first year students in second level schools.  The HPV vaccination programme commenced in 2010, using the Gardasil vaccine manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur, which was awarded the contract after a competitive tender.  All vaccines used by the HSE are on the recommendation of NIAC and are licensed by the Health Products Regulatory Authority and the European Medicines Agency.<\/p> <p>  The programme is delivered in schools because there is international and national evidence that better uptakes are achieved. We have regular engagement with the Department of Education and Skills and school management bodies to ensure the smooth running of the programmes.  The World Health Organization promotes school vaccination programmes and other countries with successful HPV vaccination programmes such as the UK and Australia do so through school-based programmes.<\/p> <p>  Our programme started initially for girls in first year in 21 second-level schools in May 2010.  This allowed us to ask parents if they were happy with the content of the information materials they received and over 95% were.  The vaccination programme was fully rolled out in September 2010 for all girls in first and second year.  The following year a catch-up programme started for all girls in sixth year.  Since that concluded at the end of 2013-14, the routine programme has continued for all first year girls.<\/p> <p>  Initially, girls required three doses of HPV vaccine at zero, two and six months to be fully vaccinated.  This changed to a two-dose schedule in 2014 as new scientific evidence showed that two doses at zero and six months gives the same protection. <\/p> <p>  The target uptake is 80% for a completed course of vaccine in first year girls.  The programme has achieved the target uptake every year since it started with the most recent figure of 84%.  Over 95% of girls who start the vaccine course complete the required number of doses, which is a great credit to the dedication of the HSE school vaccination teams. <\/p> <p>  The HSE is committed to providing accurate information for parents about all the diseases, the vaccines to prevent them and side effects from those vaccines to allow them to choose whether to give consent to vaccination.  All the information provided to parents about vaccination is prepared from the available licensed documentation for each vaccine - the summary of product characteristics and patient information leaflet.

The language is in line with the HIQA guidance entitled Communicating in Plain English, published in July of this year.<\/p> <p>  Prior to all school immunisations, parents receive an information pack in a sealed package with an information leaflet, consent form and cover letter.  All the information booklets, including that for the HPV vaccine, include information on the most common, quite common, rare and very rare adverse events that can occur after vaccination.  The information booklet does not include conditions that are not known side effects of the vaccine.<\/p> <p>  Each information leaflet also refers parents to the national immunisation website, where additional information including the licensed documentation can be found.  Information leaflets for the very successful UK and Australian HPV vaccination programmes contain less information than ours on side effects and also refer parents to websites for further information.  Our website has been accredited by the World Health Organization as providing good credible information.  The website allows members of the public to contact us to ask questions if they require further information.<\/p> <p>  Parents are also given contact details for their local immunisation office and advised to speak to a member of the school team if they have any further questions.  The information materials for all school vaccines are reviewed annually and the website content is constantly updated.<\/p> <p>  The HSE acknowledges concerns from parents about the level of information they receive about HPV vaccine and will take these on board to ensure parents receive as much accurate, credible information as possible to allow them to choose this life-saving vaccine for their daughters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015120300002#F00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Brenda Corcoran"},{"type":"speech","time":1449141300,"counter":760,"content":"<p>We did not have a copy of Dr. Corcoran's presentation for members but hopefully we will get copies to them afterwards.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015120300002#G00100","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1449141300,"counter":761,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses and attendees today and thank them for their testimonies.  I can only speak for myself.  I have no medical, scientific or clinical expertise but I think it is important that we provide a forum where the witnesses can present their case and outline their concerns about the Gardasil vaccine.  Equally, we have an obligation as a committee to question and hold to account State agencies that work on behalf of the people in terms of oversight, and to ensure that there is strong oversight of vaccines and observation of any potential adverse effects.  The testimonies presented today were very powerful and moving, and create huge anxiety and concern.  At the same time, we have an obligation to ensure that we have vaccination programmes in place that protect the health of our people.  We have agencies in place to oversee the vaccination programme but also to monitor any potential adverse effects.<\/p> <p>  In the context of the experiences of the parents and Ms Smyth, they felt the information provided in the patient information leaflet was not sufficient.  That is a small part of the bigger issue they are facing now.  In their interaction with the health services, from general practitioners to the HSE to the Department of Health, was there any understanding of their concerns due to their belief that Gardasil was the reason for the adverse effects on their daughters?  Having met with individuals and, collectively, with REGRET, I have detected that there was no clear understanding of their concerns.  That may not be the case for every person who has interacted with the general practitioner services and the HSE in general.  When the parents explained their concerns, was any effort made to interact with them beyond what would take place in the context of an ordinary illness?<\/p> <p>  Japan and Denmark would certainly be first world countries and they have suspended the vaccination programme.  I would point this out to the various officials who are here today and ask if they have considered why those countries have done so.  On the broader issue of the vaccine itself, I know the European Medicines Agency carried out a review of it recently.  Can the officials tell me if that was just a standard review, or if it came out of concerns about the vaccine and potential adverse effects?<\/p> <p>  We now have 130 people who feel their children suffered adverse effects because of the Gardasil vaccine.  Is there any centralised monitoring system in place whereby there is an obligation to report to some agency in the State in order to collate information and data?  We would be all failing in our duties if we did not have at least some system in place to monitor that nationally.  There should be some centralised way of collating all that information so that we could at least be able to observe trends on a national basis.  That might lead us to revisit the whole issue of the Gardasil vaccination programme.<\/p> <p>  As I do not have any scientific evidence, I cannot say it is the wrong way to go, but equally I believe it is critically important that the witnesses' voices are listened to.  We must ensure that information is provided to parents in a way that is legible and understanding and that informs them of the full potentials of the risks around the vaccination programme.  In the broader context, perhaps we could have a view as to what the Departments of Health and Social Protection and the HSE are doing to assist families who are finding themselves with these conditions, whether or not we can establish that Gardasil is the cause.  I do not have the expertise in that area but there is surely an obligation on the State to ensure every effort is made to assist families that are going through this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015120300002#G00200","speaker":"983"},{"type":"speech","time":1449141300,"counter":762,"content":"<p>I welcome the representatives from REGRET and the other health professionals who make up the panel.  I would like to ask a number of questions about the patient information leaflet that comes with Gardasil when accessed across the counter.  Is it still the practice that the same detail is not provided to parents in advance of their signing the consent form for their daughters to be vaccinated at school?  If that is the case, could the officials explain why the information provided through the school vaccination programme falls short of that offered by the patient information leaflet?<\/p> <p>  Ms Cannon stated that there has been significant under-reporting of adverse reactions to the HPV vaccine.  For the information of Ms Cannon and her colleagues, in a parliamentary reply I received on 5 November on this matter, which I have been pursuing for some time, it is advised that the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, had at that point received 919 reports of adverse reactions and events associated with the use of Gardasil in Ireland.  That may, in the minds of some, be few in terms of the number of those who would have participated in the vaccine programme, but 919 reports of adverse reactions and events over what is a relatively short period is not insignificant, in my opinion.  I am only offering that as additional information.<\/p> <p>  Would Dr. Bonner like to confirm to the committee that she did indeed convey the committee's view regarding a vaccine damage compensation scheme to her colleagues as undertaken at that time?  Would she or anyone else like to comment on the potential for such a scheme to occur in the near future?  <\/p> <p>  Regarding worldwide concerns, Deputy Kelleher has also made reference to Japan and Denmark.  Who takes that into account?  Is it the HPRA?  We know the HPRA has indicated that it does not have the authority to withdraw the licence for the vaccine but can only make recommendations.  Are we taking into account international concerns and evidence?  I use the word evidence quite positively.  What is the situation in Denmark?  They have replaced it with an alternative vaccine.  Have we such a choice?  Is there any evidence to suggest the alternative vaccine is safer than Gardasil or that there are not the same concerns attributable to it?  Is it an alternative, safer vaccine?  Perhaps Dr. Bonner or Dr. Gilvarry could comment on that.<\/p><p>The decision of Japan to no longer recommend is not an insignificant decision on its part.<\/p><p> It is totally understandable that families are not coping financially.  Ms Smyth made this point in her contribution.  I advise the representatives from REGRET and any other interested party present that I raised this matter by parliamentary question this morning on the floor of the D&aacute;il with the Minister, Deputy Varadkar in the area of disability allowance, medical card entitlement, etc.  While the Minister's response was anything but encouraging - he kept referring to the criteria for qualification for medical cards - I reminded him that not so long ago medical cards were issued on the basis of medical need.  The breach has happened and it is an important one.  I asked the Minister to look at this particular cohort favourably, sympathetically and humanely.  I would reference it to the representatives of REGRET.  If they are not able to access the exchange, I would be happy to forward it to them afterwards.<\/p><p> Dr. Bonner, in her contribution, stated the signalled expectation was that the vaccine, Gardasil, could save the lives of up to 70% of women.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015120300002#G00300","speaker":"969","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1449141300,"counter":764,"content":"<p>If I may interrupt the Deputy, there is a vote in the Seanad.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015120300002#H00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1449141300,"counter":765,"content":"<p>I ask Dr. Bonner or any of the rest of the professional panel how many years before evidence presents in Ireland as to its effectiveness.

I wonder are we still at too early a point in time in order for that.<\/p> <p>  I presume the European Medicines Agency, EMA, is the HPRA equivalent on the European stage.

In this regard, what link have we with other countries internationally?  Denmark and Japan have been mentioned.  Is there any communication between ourselves and these countries on this matter and is there any understanding as to why Denmark should advise an alternative and Japan should recommend against this?

We have a lot of families in Cork.  One family has two daughters affected by the after-effects of the Gardasil vaccine.  I want to address the point of fatigue, as it sounds like it is the key issue for the girls.  It is one of many side-effects the girls are experiencing.<\/p><p>As regards the question on interacting with the NIO and the HSE, I will give some clear examples.  I have a list of my daughter's side-effects - or what I believe are side-effects - from Gardasil: severe headaches, which are worst morning and evening; hot flushes of the face; nausea; lack of appetite; balance issues; dizzy spells; clotted nose bleeds, mainly in the night-time; lockjaw; extreme fatigue; low blood pressure; and marks on upper chest and thighs, very similar to other girls in the group.  She also contracted pancreatitis, which is a life-threatening condition.  The doctor had never seen that in a girl of her age group in over 50 years of practice.  This is possibly chronic.  Therefore, we are not only talking about fatigue here, we are also talking about many other issues.  Most of our girls have been tested for glandular fever.  It would be one of the first blood tests that are assessed for antibodies.<br\/><br\/>When my doctor wrote to the NIO and voiced my concerns to it, she said she had a 17-year-old girl with multiple symptoms, including severe headaches, myalgia, pancreatitis and loss of energy, etc.  The reply from the NIO included a statement to the effect that:<\/p><blockquote>The HPV vaccine has been licensed since 2006 and, to date, no causal link has been established between Gardasil, the HPV vaccine used, and chronic headaches, myalgia, loss of energy, low mood and pancreatitis.  Therefore I would refer this girl, as you would normally refer any other patient who presents with the symptoms you describe.<\/blockquote><p>That was the response.  There were no questions and no contact with me as a parent.  This would reflect the 130 girls in the Regret group, so we are not experiencing a great response, either from the HSE or our doctors.  We are lucky in that we have finally found a few GPs who are supporting us and who are linking this with the Gardasil vaccine.  In my statement, I said there was a four-year trial by Merck.  One in 40 of those who took part experienced a serious adverse event and one in 30 experienced a new autoimmune condition.<br\/><br\/>I thank Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in for his support.  Of course, the statement was insulting.  We have exhausted every medical avenue for these girls.  We have been to GP clinics, hospitals and neurologists but they are not recognising this long list of side-effects that are mirrored between 130 girls in our group alone and also internationally.  They are, in fact, stated on the patient information leaflets, PIL, so I do not see why a doctor cannot connect with or acknowledge a long list of symptoms that are unrelated to each other, but directly connected to the PIL.<br\/><br\/>As regards the protection of the HPV vaccine, we know it only covers two strands, but we also know that it is not proven to last more than eight years.  These girls received the vaccine at 12 years of age.  Many of them are so sick that they will not have a boyfriend for the foreseeable future, so by the time they reach an age at which they are sexually active, the benefits of this vaccine will be gone.<br\/><br\/>We need to look at how the benefits are misrepresented, as well as the risks, in terms of the information that parents are receiving before signing consent forms.<br\/><br\/>On the HSE's own website, <i>medicines.ie<\/i>, a clause from the <i>Guide to Professional Conduct and Ethics for Registered Medical Practitioners<\/i>, 7th edition, 2009, section 35.2, states:<\/p><blockquote>As part of the informed consent process, patients must receive sufficient information, in a way that they can understand, to enable them to exercise their right to make informed decisions about their care.  This refers to the disclosure of all significant risks or substantial risks of grave adverse consequences.<\/blockquote><p>How is it that I, as a parent, cannot understand the following paragraph in the patient information leaflet?<\/p><blockquote>As with other vaccines, side effects that have been reported during general use include: swollen glands (neck, armpit, or groin); muscle weakness, abnormal sensations, tingling in the arms, legs and upper body, or confusion (Guillain-Barr&eacute; Syndrome, Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis) [I do not understand that part]; dizziness, vomiting, joint pain, aching muscles, unusual tiredness or weakness, chills, generally feeling unwell, bleeding or bruising more easily than normal [etc.] ...<\/blockquote><p>It is clear and simple what are the side-effects.  I do not see why we, as parents, do not have the basic human right to understand the full risks of this vaccine before signing the consent form for 12 year old kids.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015120300002#H01100","nonspeaker":"Ms Anna Cannon","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1449141300,"counter":775,"content":"<p>One of the difficulties is that there is no themed response to the problems our daughters have experienced.

Since we have been able to go public, we have found that more and more parents are identifying with members of the group.  They find that it is almost a template reaction, in a sense, as to what they have had to go through concerning their daughters' symptoms.

I will be as brief as possible.<\/p> <p>  As has already been stated, the product was licensed by the European Commission and placed on the market across the European Union in 2006.  It has also been approved in 130 countries worldwide and it is estimated that 63 million subjects have been vaccinated.  No regulatory authority in the world has taken any action to suspend this product.  After any medicine or vaccine is licensed, as new information appears and emerges during the marketing experience, the benefit-risk evaluations continue to be carried out by the regulatory authorities which consider if any steps need to be taken where there is a change in the risk-benefit.  As part of the system for monitoring the safety of medicines and vaccines, the HPRA has a spontaneous reporting system by which patients and consumers, and all health care professionals, can report any suspected adverse reactions to us.  These reports are then reviewed and transmitted into the European agency database, which is called EudraVigilance, for inclusion in global activity so that we can see trends as they emerge.<\/p> <p>  Specifically with regard to Gardasil, post-marketing monitoring included: review of all the cumulative data in this database; the published literature; epidemiological studies; and any additional clinical trials that were conducted.  It also includes assessment of periodic safety update reports, which the company must submit, and which are reviewed by the regulatory authorities at regular intervals.  Indeed, the last evaluation was conducted in December 2004 and the EMA determined that the risk-benefit remains positive. <\/p> <p>  I wish to talk a little bit about the current European-wide review.  In July of this year, what is officially called a referral was initiated by the European Commission based on concerns raised by the Danish competent authority - our sister agency in Denmark.<\/p><p>The European Medicines Agency co-ordinated this review and, in accordance with the applicable legal framework, it was conducted by the agency's pharmacovigilance risk assessment committee, PRAC.  The PRAC is a committee of the agency that is responsible for assessing and monitoring the safety of human medicines.  It is composed of experts, including doctors, pharmacists and scientists from every EU member state, and representatives of patient organisations and health care professionals.  The review focused on the two main conditions reported, POTS and CRPS.  Reports of these conditions in young women who received the HPV vaccine had been previously reviewed by the PRAC as part of routine safety follow-up procedures, and a causal link was not established.  In the context of this review, the PRAC reviewed all the available data in the EudraVigilance database and from clinical trials.  It took account of scientific literature, including everything submitted by Denmark in addition to information from Japan.  It also review detailed information submitted voluntarily by the public and patient groups, including patient groups in Ireland.  The PRAC also sought the scientific advice of the expert vaccine committee at the European Medicines Agency and supplemented it with expertise in neurology, cardiology and pharmacoepidemiology.  Following this in-depth scientific review and robust assessment of all the available data, the PRAC members concluded unanimously that the evidence did not support a causal link between HPV and the aforementioned syndromes in children.  The review found no evidence that the overall rates of these syndromes in vaccinated subjects differed from expected rates in the age group, even taking account of possible under-reporting.  The PRAC also considered specifically the overall overlapping syndromes of POTS with chronic fatigue syndrome.  The results of a large, detailed published study showed no link, and that was highly relevant to the review in respect of chronic fatigue syndrome.<\/p><p> The PRAC review concluded on 5 November of this year that there was no reason to recommend changes to the way the vaccine was reviewed or to amend the current product information.  As is standard practice with all these reviews at European level, the recommendation went to the European Medicines Agency's committee for medicinal products for human use, CHMP, which is essentially the licensing committee at the agency.  Again, it comprises experts from all member states.  Extra representation from patient groups was also considered at the time.  The CHMP concurred unanimously with the PRAC recommendation that the available evidence did not support a causal link with the syndromes.  The CHMP also concurred that there was no need for any changes to the HPV vaccines and the way they were used, or to the product information.  That report was published on 20 November.  In accordance with standard practice, the opinion from the European Medicines Agency has been submitted to the European Commission for a legally binding decision that will be applicable in all member states.  We expect that in the spring of 2016.<\/p><p> Let me say a few words on our national reporting experience, as it has been referred to.  At the start of the HSE school immunisation programme in 2010, the Health Products Regulatory Authority wrote to public health doctors and health authorities, as would be normal practice, and asked them to help us with its monitoring by reporting any suspected adverse reactions to us.  Up to the end of October 2015, we received 927 reports.  Each of those was entered in the European database and has been viewed as part of the European review.  The vast majority of the reports reflect the expected pattern of adverse reactions to vaccines, which include syncope - that is, fainting - malaise, headache, myalgia, gastrointestinal symptoms, dizziness and allergic reactions.  There have been some reports of chronic and persistent fatigue, chronic muscle pain and, in some cases, multiple other symptoms of headaches and malaise, as we have heard today.  Again, all of these reports have been entered in the European database and were considered as part of the review.<\/p><p> Taking into account the totality of the available information, the Europe-wide review, which involved experts from all member states, has concluded the evidence does not support the view that the HPV vaccines Gardasil and Cervarix cause these syndromes, and that the benefits of both of these vaccines continue to outweigh the risks.  We will continue to do our job and monitor them, along with the European Medicines Agency and PRAC, in all member states, including Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015120300002#J01600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Joan Gilvarry","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1449141300,"counter":791,"content":"<p>I thank everyone for their statements and presentations.  I was glad to hear Dr. Connolly say no vaccine is 100% safe or 100% effective.  When my children were young and being vaccinated, whether it was the BCG vaccine, the MMR vaccine or the Hib vaccine, there was always a question in the back of my mind as to whether I was doing the right thing.  I trust the general practitioner I have attended for the past four years.  I trust his advice in addition to that of the experts.  I am not an expert on this.  Any parent vaccinating a child will always ask whether he or she is doing the right thing.  I have two girls who have had the vaccination the delegates spoke about.  They were older than the usual vaccination age and were no longer in school but they received it because I felt as a parent that it was important for them.  They believed it was important also.  Since young people are now mixing in all sorts of ways in which I probably did not mix, I believe it is important that we safeguard their health.<\/p> <p>  I was interested to hear Dr. Brenda Corcoran saying 95% of young people in the vaccination age bracket have had two doses of the vaccine.  What about those who have had only one?  What is the outcome for them?  Will the vaccine be less helpful to them than those who have had two doses?  Why have people not had all their vaccinations?  Do the delegates have any concerns about this?<\/p> <p>  I thank Dr. Bonner and Dr. Gilvarry for their presentations, which I found very interesting.<\/p> <p>  Are there any records within the HSE on both the short-term and long-term side effects?  When people ring in asking for advice, are all the details registered?  How is this dealt with?  Are there any figures on this?<\/p> <p>  I believe my last question to be a very important one.  When parents sign a consent form for the vaccination to be carried out, particularly in school, is there space on the form in which to state whether their child has had a previous medical condition?  If this is taken into account, are parents advised at that stage whether the vaccination is suitable for their children?

What we do not need is a collision course between the Department of Health, the HSE and parents.<\/p> <p>  We have two realities, as I see it.  First, a patient information leaflet was not disseminated properly.  Parents were not properly informed.  That leads me to believe that there was in some sense a cover-up.  Why was the correct patient information leaflet not disseminated?  The second reality is that we have sick young girls who are unable to go to school or a debutante ball or socialise at all.  Some are isolated, sleep up to 20 hours per day and are in terrible pain.  I know of one child who has had seven operations for severe abdominal pain.  I accept what Dr. Bonner said and that we are not proving cause and effect.  However, some of the facts hold the key.

It is important to emphasise that we are dealing with two linked but separate problems.  First is the question of whether or not the vaccine programme is appropriate and safe and, second and just as important, is the question of how we, as a system, look after these girls who have experienced a series of problems.  To reiterate, these are linked but separate issues.  On the whole, we have presented a lot of evidence regarding the way we have to make these types of decisions.  How we have made the decisions and how we continue to have to make them is based on the evidence or science that exists around the world and is produced for us in a very systematic and structured way by the bodies, both here in Ireland and in Europe, to which we are party.  I personally have no doubt that we have shown today that we put a lot of effort into making sure the programme we are putting out there for girls is a safe programme.  We have really tried to be party to that.  We have made great efforts to get the information out there and to be party to that debate at a European level, where there is a whole host of information and a whole host of experts involved in those discussions.<\/p> <p>  Clearly, when one has a vaccine that says it will prevent a cancer, one will never see the direct impact of that in the short term, because cancer has a ten-year or 20-year period in which it comes on.  That is a long time period.  We do know the HP virus is involved in the development of cervical cancer.  We know some of the natural history in that regard and we can see the changes that happen.  As well as causing cervical cancer, the HP virus causes two other conditions, as we have heard, namely, anal-genital warts and the direct precursor to cervical cancer, which is called cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, CIN.  What we are now beginning to see around the world, particularly in those countries where a lot of the vaccine has been given and which have a longer history than us of administering it, is the impact of the vaccine on those two earlier parts of that process.  We are starting to see in both the United Kingdom, particularly in Scotland, and in Australia a significant reduction in the number of anal-genital warts in the relevant age group, which is 15 to 25 year olds.  We are also seeing a reduction in CIN.  A woman does not get cervical cancer unless she has CIN.  She will not necessarily get cancer if she has CIN but only women with CIN will go on to get cancer.  We are starting to see evidence of a reduction in the incidence of the precursors, as I said, but we will not see actual evidence of a reduction in the number of cervical cancer cases for another ten years or so.<\/p> <p>  We work closely with our colleagues in the screening programmes both here in Ireland and across Europe in analysing the impact of HPV vaccination programmes on countries' screening programmes.  That debate is ongoing but already people are beginning to see a capacity to reduce the involvement of women in the cervical screening programme into the future.  However, we will not do that until we have clear evidence it is the appropriate thing to do.  The screening programme will continue but, as I said, health authorities in other countries are very hopeful of seeing an impact on their cervical screening programmes.<\/p> <p>  We are very much aware of the need to react better to children who have the types of syndromes we have heard about today.  I am not saying we are the best at doing that.  In fact, we need to improve how we are doing it.  I am involved in a number of ways with some of the senior clinicians in paediatric services to see how we can do that.  It is not easy and I am not saying we will come up with a quick and easy solution to this but we are trying to see how we can do something about it.  We are looking at how we can put in stages and support to help people to get through the systems better.  Given the nature of some of the symptoms people are reporting, however, it does not leave it open easily for that to happen.  We are looking at how we can try to do something about that and we hope to make some changes in the coming months and years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015120300002#N00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Kevin Kelleher"},{"type":"speech","time":1449141300,"counter":830,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Kelleher for his candour.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015120300002#N00700","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1449141300,"counter":831,"content":"<p>There is some overlap between the different questioners.  I will try to cover all the points raised.  It was noted that chronic fatigue syndrome is little known.  It is estimated that perhaps 80% of cases are not reported and not diagnosed.  There should be much more information out there because there is evidence that the earlier the diagnosis, the less severe the condition and the shorter its duration.  Speakers referred to decisions made in Japan and Denmark.  In June 2013 - ironically, a day after the World Health Organization declared the vaccine to be safe - the Japanese Ministry for Health issued a notice that while the HPV vaccine could still be given for free to girls aged 12 to 16, it should neither be proactively recommended nor promoted.  That decision was not made by either the regulators or the equivalent of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee.  With regard to the authorities in Denmark changing the vaccine that is administered there, my understanding is that this was a commercial, cost-based decision.  Instead of giving the four-component vaccine we are using, they are now giving the two-component vaccine and, unfortunately, that means they will see an increase in the incidence of anal-genital warts.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the provision of information, the website of the Department of Social Protection contains an extremely good article on the definition and diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome and the services available through the Department for people suffering from it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015120300002#N00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Kevin Connolly"},{"type":"speech","time":1449141300,"counter":832,"content":"<p>Has there been any attempt to reach out to the REGRET group rather than simply suggesting its members go through a website?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015120300002#N00900","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1449141300,"counter":833,"content":"<p>Not to my knowledge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015120300002#N01000","nonspeaker":"Dr. Kevin Connolly"},{"type":"speech","time":1449141300,"counter":834,"content":"<p>To be fair, I realise this might not be under Dr. Connolly's remit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015120300002#N01100","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1449141300,"counter":835,"content":"<p>I stated very clearly that there should be ready and easy access for the children and their families.<\/p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in said that the figure of more than 900 adverse events is concerning.  It should be noted that adverse events occur in 30% or 40% of people who get a vaccine.  Working on that basis, one would expect perhaps 50,000 reports.  What is more important than the number of events is the severity of those events.  We know there is significant under-reporting of adverse events and there is no legal compunction to report them.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Kelleher responded briefly to the question about when we will know for certain the effectiveness of the vaccine.  There is very good evidence that in Australia, which introduced the vaccine in 2007, the incidence of high-grade changes has reduced to 25% of what its was before the vaccination programme was implemented.  In addition, the incidence of anal-genital warts in young girls has gone down from 18% down to 1%.  There is good evidence, therefore, that the vaccination is effective.  Moreover, the immune response is shown to last up to ten years and there is also very good evidence of what is called a memory response whereby even if the immune blood test is low, if one is exposed to the virus, the memory cells in the immune system are ready to go out and work.  The mathematical modelling suggests that effect lasts for at least 20 years.<\/p><p>Even if it does not, what we do with other vaccines as their immunity wanes is to give a booster, and that should solve that problem.<\/p><p> With regard to the question about multiple doses, one dose is significantly less effective than two doses.  The two doses are more effective if they are given six months apart.  If somebody has had only one dose, she should get a second dose.<\/p><p> On the registration of long-term adverse events, a number of countries have instituted long-term surveys regarding the effectiveness, the immunogenicity and, equally important, the safety of vaccines.  Interestingly, the Nordic countries are one of the groups doing that.<\/p><p> The efficacy of the vaccine and screening was raised.  Some 30% of cancers are not prevented by the vaccine, so screening is very important.  Also, the incidence of cervical cancer under the age of 30 is low because the incubation period is long.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015120300002#N01200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Kevin Connolly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1449141300,"counter":837,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Connolly.

I acknowledge that at its meeting on Tuesday, 24 November, the joint committee focused on the topics that were to be addressed at the EU Council of Energy Ministers meeting later that week.  The main topic of that meeting was energy union.  I welcome the opportunity today to discuss Ireland's energy policy in more detail.  As the committee is aware, I intend to publish the energy White Paper later this month.  This White Paper will set out Ireland&rsquo;s energy policy framework up to 2030 in the context of our long-term ambitions to 2050 and beyond.  A key element of the White Paper will involve putting citizens and community engagement at the centre of energy policy.  This approach was reflected in the extensive consultation process that informed the development of the White Paper.<\/p> <p>  The joint committee has provided a number of important and interesting questions for me to address today.  I would like to respond to them in the context of the three core objectives of energy policy, namely, competitiveness, security of supply and sustainability.   Competitiveness is critical to provide the environment for enterprises to grow, invest and create jobs and to provide affordable energy for domestic consumers.  As Deputy Fitzmaurice said at last week&rsquo;s meeting, we all hope to see the current growth in employment continuing in future years and we need energy policy to support that growth.  In 2014, Ireland&rsquo;s economy grew by 5.2% while overall energy use fell by 0.5%.  As I said last week, this represented an effective and welcome decoupling of economic growth from energy use.  We need to continue to improve the efficiency with which we use energy to support sustainable economic growth in future years.  If we are to maintain competitiveness, we must ensure our energy markets work efficiently and continue to invest in energy infrastructure.  In this regard, a key investment project for Ireland is the North-South transmission link.<\/p><p>As the committee will be aware, EirGrid made a formal application for the project to An Bord Plean&aacute;la on 9 June of this year.  I am constrained, therefore, in what I can say about the project other than in the provision of factual information.<\/p><p> I draw members' attention to the significant benefits the North-South project will bring on both sides of the Border through lower wholesale electricity prices in the single electricity market.  This is achieved through the combined transmission systems operating more efficiently without the current constraints.  In terms of future developments, there is a need for greater interconnection with our European neighbours.  In this regard, the economic case for a potential France-Ireland electricity interconnector is currently being studied.  Such a development could build on the success of the east-west interconnector between Ireland and Wales which opened in 2012 and has led to enhanced competition and downward pressure on the wholesale price of electricity.  An analysis was carried out by EirGrid on the impact of the first year of full commercial operation, namely, from May 2013 to April 2014.  This analysis indicates that wholesale electricity prices in the all-island single electricity market would have been 9% higher if the east-west interconnector was unavailable over that period.<\/p><p> As Deputy Colreavy highlighted at last week's meeting, electricity interconnectors are used to both import and export electricity with the flows driven primarily by the relative market prices.  To date flows on the east-west interconnector with Wales have predominantly been in the import direction.  However, there are periods when electricity is exported.  Once again, this is an example of markets operating more efficiently with greater interconnection.<\/p><p> I will turn now to security of supply.  Investment in interconnection also increases Ireland's security of supply, which is the second core objective of our energy policy.  Ireland's energy import dependency decreased from 89% in 2013 to 85% in 2014 and is expected to fall further in the coming years due to natural gas flows from Corrib and increased levels of renewable energy.  This is very positive from a security of supply point of view.  However, oil still constitutes almost half of Ireland's total primary energy requirement.  In order to mitigate the associated risk, the National Oil Reserves Agency holds 90 days of oil stocks.  In terms of consolidating their effort in this area, last month I signed an agreement with the French Minister, S&eacute;gol&egrave;ne Royal, in Paris that allows for both Ireland and France to hold emergency oil reserves in the other country.  The diversity of Ireland's fuel mix makes a positive contribution to Ireland's security of supply.  In this regard, the future of Ireland's only coal-fired power station at Moneypoint is important.  The operating life of Moneypoint in its current configuration will continue into the 2020s.  Therefore, key decisions on the future of Moneypoint will have to be taken before 2020.<\/p><p> The third core objective of Ireland's energy policy is sustainability, which is encapsulated in our 2020 targets.  These targets include increases in renewable energy and energy efficiency and reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.  Ireland is over halfway to meeting its renewable energy target of 16% and I believe we can reach our target by 2020.  In 2014, 8.6% of energy consumption was from renewable sources.  This includes 22.7% of renewable energy in the electricity sector, 6.6% in the heat sector and 5.2% in the transport sector.<\/p><p> Ireland is also approximately halfway to meeting the 2020 target of a 20% increase in energy efficiency.  Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions reduction target for 2020 includes all sectors of the economy, the most significant non-energy sector being agriculture.  The EPA reported in May of this year that more measures are required in order to meet our 2020 emissions target, including increased use of renewable energy in the heat and transport sectors.  In order to address this need, my Department has recently carried out consultation processes on a potential new renewable heat incentive, which I expect to be in place next year, and an increased biofuels obligation.  An initial consultation has been carried out on a potential future refit scheme for renewable electricity, which I expect will also be in place in 2016.  There will be two further opportunities to contribute at key stages in the design of any new scheme.  To date, onshore wind has provided the most cost-effective source of renewable electricity.  The process of examining a potential future refit scheme will include consideration of other technologies including solar, biomass and offshore wind.<\/p><p> In conclusion, I will re-emphasise the three core objectives of our energy policy, which are competitiveness, security of supply and sustainability, and the need to strike a balance between all three in the actions we take and the measures we implement.  I thank the committee members for their time today and I look forward to their insights and questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015120300002#B00300","speaker":"1024","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1449155700,"counter":903,"content":"<p>I will call members of the joint committee first, with other members to follow.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015120300002#C00200","speaker":"1092"},{"type":"speech","time":1449155700,"counter":904,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and his officials to discuss energy.  The Minister gave me credit on the Order of Business this morning, which does nothing for my street credibility.  Wind power, a policy which was developed in 2007, seems to be the main renewable energy but we seem to have come to saturation point in this regard.  Many commentators, nationally and internationally, say the amount of wind coming on stream at the moment is uneconomical as we go forward and Colm McCarthy has said we will have to have a NAMA for wind if we keep going.  Is it time to have a mix of renewables in the energy generating sector?  I have asked the Minister about biomass and I know the United Kingdom took a huge policy initiative in relation to subsidies in that regard.  There was a sea change in Government policy to fund biomass and to develop the Drax power plant as a biomass facility, even though they are shipping the raw material across the Atlantic.  Where are we in regard to biomass?  Many of the stakeholders have said we should not go down the biomass route just yet but there needs to be a discussion on it.<\/p> <p>  The technology relating to offshore wind is moving on apace but how far are we away from developing it, given the natural resource we have off shore?  Many central European countries have been moving away from wind as fast as they can in recent times.  There is planning permission for a number of solar energy farms, one in mid-Cork, not too far from Macroom, though there is only on the island at the moment, in County Down.  Is the Minister looking at that option?  IBEC spoke with us yesterday on the PSO levy and we were told that high users are particularly affected by the PSO levy.  The White Paper will probably deal with the mix of fossil fuels and others into the future but has the Department any concerns over the powers and the legislative tools the Commission for Energy Regulation has?  <\/p> <p>  The Minister said we had 90 days of oil in reserve.  When the price of oil went down in 2014 it took nearly six months before it showed up in the energy market and at the pumps but when the price of oil goes up it shows up almost immediately.  In the UK and across Europe the bodies overseeing energy markets have the legislative tools to enforce a reduction in price as well as an increase in price.<\/p><p>In the last week we have seen some of the energy providers announcing a reduction in prices with great fanfare.  However, there must be a fundamental examination of the Commission for Energy Regulation in the White Paper on energy and the energy policy that is being developed.  We must have an ard sti&uacute;rth&oacute;ir or a proper commission to ensure there is a State regulatory body in place to enforce what is in the best interests of the State and consumers, be they businesses or households.  There must be a fundamental examination of the legislation.  It is ten years since the original legislation was passed and even last Friday when we were discussing the gas installers, which I accept is a separate issue, it was clear that there must be a drastic overhaul.  The Minister said last Friday in the D&aacute;il that it would be an interdepartmental matter, but all legislation is interdepartmental.  However, there must be a fundamental examination of the Commission for Energy Regulation.<\/p><p> To recap, have we gone too far on wind?  Is it time to look at other mixes?  Has the Minister considered a policy change on biomass or has he even engaged with the various stakeholders on what would be required on solar and offshore energy generation?  I realise the North-South interconnector is before An Bord Plean&aacute;la, but the technology is available to put it underground.  EirGrid was giving us all kinds of information on the savings made from Grid Link and Grid West.  With regard to the North-South interconnector, it is time the Government grasped the issue and decided to put it underground.  I believe there will be public disorder if EirGrid attempts to proceed with it over ground.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015120300002#C00300","speaker":"987","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1449155700,"counter":906,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Moynhihan.  With regard to wind, as I said in my opening statement onshore wind has demonstrated its value and cost-effectiveness.  That is clear and the information and data are available to prove that.  We have installed wind generation capacity of just under 2,400 MW.  The provisional 2014 figure indicates that 18.2% of electricity demand was met by wind generation.  Almost 23% of our electricity is produced from renewable sources and approximately 80% of that, or 18.2% of electricity, is produced from onshore wind.  It has been a successful initiative and has proven itself.<\/p> <p>  Do I think the entire renewable energy story can be reduced to onshore wind in the future?  I do not.  I agree with the Deputy that we must be mindful of the potential represented by technologies such as solar generation, biomass and offshore wind.  On his question of whether we have been engaging, yes we have engaged very much with those sectors, and not just with the industry.  People often wonder if this is driven by industry.  The policy is the policy of the Government, which we hope will be endorsed by the Oireachtas.  The Government must make policy and policy decisions must be made that the market will take up.  We will trigger certain approaches in the market and we will trigger investment.  People who are proposing to invest in a particular sector, not just in the energy sector but in any sector, must have an understanding of what government policy is.  The Government's policy continues to be that onshore wind has played a very effective part in our renewable energy programme and will continue to do so, but it will not be the entire story.  That is the reason I mentioned the consultation process we are engaged in at present regarding REFIT, so we can see what opportunities exist for solar energy, biomass and some of the other technologies.<\/p> <p>  As I said to the committee last week, one cannot help but be impressed by the fact that the cost in the solar area has dropped so much in recent years.  It is a very short period of years.  Some commentators describe it as the price having practically collapsed.  It has certainly reduced enormously from what it was a few years ago.  One must take account of that, but that gives rise to another question for the policy maker.  Will it reach the stage where it is so effective that it might not necessarily need a high level of subsidy?  If something is going to happen and the market is going to deliver a new technology in which people are willing to invest, while we must be careful that we do not wait around for years and not make any decisions we must also be careful not to make decisions too early and commit the people's resources too early to something that might be going to happen in any event.  Putting on a commentator's hat, and people can make up their own minds, there are some countries in Europe that would probably admit they got involved too early in terms of subsidising solar energy, because the price has come down rapidly.  I assure the Deputy that we are very much aware of the potential for solar energy.  Personally, I believe it has very considerable potential.<\/p> <p>  Regarding offshore wind, the Deputy correctly stated that offshore wind also has a very exciting part to play in our future portfolio of renewables.  The issue is the expense involved and the level of investment required this far in advance.  The extent of the development of the technologies is at a relatively early stage.  As I said last week, whoever is holding this portfolio next year, indeed six years hence rather than a year hence, would be looking at a real development in the evolution of our offshore wind.<\/p> <p>  Biomass also has a big role to play but more likely in the heat sector.  I am aware of what is being advocated about Moneypoint; I have read the discussions.  We must keep an open mind about Moneypoint but we will have to make decisions about it when it comes to the end of its current configuration in 2025.  Decisions will have to be made about it in the forthcoming period.  I have read and listened carefully to what is said about biomass as a potential replacement for coal in Moneypoint, but I remain to be convinced that it would make sense to have large scale importation from the US or elsewhere on a regular basis, with tens of thousands of tonnes of wood chip, pellets or whatever else being shipped across the Atlantic to feed Moneypoint.  The type of subsidy that would be required would be considerably more than the subsidy we give to onshore wind at present, so that is a cost for consumers.  It would also have to be converted, of course.  However, none of these things should be rejected or ruled out, and I am not doing that.  We can have a good debate about this.  We do not need to make a decision about Moneypoint now, but we must make one in the five year period ahead.<\/p> <p>  I do not accept that we are at so-called saturation point, as some commentators say.  I gave the figures earlier for the amount of onshore wind that is installed.  We can and must do more in the period to 2020, but we certainly must start bringing our other technologies into the equation then, such as solar and offshore wind as they become viable.<\/p> <p>  With regard to energy prices, there have been reductions and that should be acknowledged.  Most energy suppliers have reduced their prices this year and I welcome that.  There were announcements by Electric Ireland, Bord G&aacute;is and SSE Airtricity of savings to customers.  I encourage other suppliers to follow suit and to pass on the reductions that have taken place in the wholesale sector to consumers in the domestic and business sectors for both gas and electricity.  That is very welcome.<\/p> <p>  The CER plays a very important role.  I heard the Deputy speak previously about conducting a review.  I never oppose reviews.  If there is a reason to conduct a review, it should be done.<\/p><p>If I am not mistaken, the Government has already committed to having periodic reviews of all the regulators and there is no harm in that.  In my view, the regulator has worked well in the sector.  We made a decision and people can have a view as to whether it was right or wrong.  We have a situation where the prices are set in the market.  We no longer have the old situation where a Minister could issue a directive as to what would be the price of gas or electricity.  That is gone and we have a market now.  The other side of the coin must has to be that the market must work for the consumer and the citizen.  There is no point saying we have a market if the citizen is losing out.  The consumer has seen prices come down.  There is some resistance to the phrase that Ministers sometimes use to the effect that people should shop around.  People do not like Ministers saying that because it sounds a bit patronising or whatever.  I do not want to sound that way but it is true that people can make huge savings if they switch.  In fact, we have one of the highest switching rates in Europe at present and people can make savings if they do it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015120300002#D00200","speaker":"1024","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1449155700,"counter":908,"content":"<p>Does it not take an awfully long time from when the wholesale price is reduced to the time it hits the consumer?

In fact, gas is the more relevant to our discussion.  They buy ahead at a price they judge to be a good one.  If the price goes down, they are still, as they put it, stuck with the product they bought at the higher price.  It takes some time for it to work its way through.

This week was obviously an important one with the opening of the conference on climate change which is very much on the agenda.  We all have a responsibility to stop its effects and to reduce our carbon footprint.  The biggest obstacle I see not just for Ireland but for every country is public acceptance and participation.  Communities must feel that they are part of the change.  Two years ago the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government asked communities to have their say, particularly on wind energy.  I do not believe we should have as significant a focus on wind as we do but communities were asked to have their say and to have an input into new, revised wind energy guidelines.  Unfortunately, we are still waiting for those.  I note that the Minister said during Leaders' Questions this morning that negotiations had not broken down between himself and the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  However, the fact that we are still waiting for the guidelines suggests otherwise.<\/p> <p>  In my county, we have a proposal for 46 industrial wind turbines.  The project is developer-led and the community was originally told that the energy was to be exported to the UK.  However, when negotiations between the UK and Ireland broke down, the project suddenly became important for our own national grid.  People have no confidence in what has been said and they have no confidence in the wind sector because of the way it has gone on.  One way we can reinforce confidence in the sector is by publishing revised guidelines which take people's concerns and genuine fears on board.  It would be irresponsible for us as a Government not to resolve this before the end of the current D&aacute;il term.  Is that something the Minister hopes to do?  When was his Department first consulted about the revised guidelines and how many meetings has it had with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government in that regard?  When was the last time the Ministers met to discuss this?<\/p> <p>  Can the Minister explain community involvement a bit more?  Communities feel they are not being involved or included.  How does the Minister expect to deal with current applications?  Is it the case that applications which are being processed now will be left behind and that things will carry on from whenever the new White Paper is published or will companies be held accountable immediately and asked to revise how they have engaged with communities?  How is EirGrid being held accountable in respect of community involvement with people in Meath, Cavan and Monaghan in respect of the North-South interconnector?  EirGrid has not engaged in that regard in the same manner it did with communities in respect of GridLink and GridWest.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015120300002#E00400","speaker":"1180"},{"type":"speech","time":1449155700,"counter":911,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for her questions and observations.  I do not want to start on a discordant note but many people say to me - I accept it as absolutely genuine and in good faith - that they realise we have to address global warming, that serious adverse effects are already visible from climate change, that we have to engage in a plan to decarbonise our economy, that we must move away from fossil fuels and that we need to look at new ways to deploy our resources and energy.  However, they also say that wind is not the answer and that it does not even form part of the solution in some cases.  If we do not address this issue on the renewable energy side through wind, we will be obliged to address it in some other way.  Deputy Moynihan referred to the UK.  I meet Ministers from different European countries, many of which have nuclear energy.  I do not detect any enthusiasm in this country to go back and change the provisions embedded in our law to prohibit nuclear energy in Ireland.  There are other forms of renewable energy, as I acknowledged earlier, which are at different levels of development.  However, we cannot say we will not do onshore wind without saying what we will do instead.<\/p> <p>  I accept that there is a major issue for many people in communities which have had extremely bad experiences, whether as a result of the activities of developers or State agencies, going back a number of years.  They felt, in some cases very reasonably, that they were not listened to and that their concerns were not addressed.  There has been a huge improvement in that regard, particularly from EirGrid.  I very much welcome EirGrid's new approach to public consultation and community engagement.  If we want to have renewable energy and if we accept that renewable energy is necessary and essential, onshore wind will play a very big part.<\/p> <p>  I am not the Minister with responsibility for planning.  As such, I cannot directly answer some of the Deputy's questions on planning, the operation of the guidelines, when they will kick in and whether they will affect existing applications, etc.  I am not trying to walk away from the issue because it is an all-of-Government responsibility.  I accept that there is a tension between the legitimate concerns of citizens and communities on one hand and the imperative to have a renewable energy policy on the other.  It is not just a question of two Ministers.  As a whole Government and a whole society, we must work out how we are going to reconcile this.  We have not done it very well up to now.  We all have a responsibility in this regard.  It is principally a responsibility of Government but all of us are involved.  The Deputy will see in the White Paper we publish in the next couple of weeks an initiative of real substance in terms of how I propose to address the issue of involving communities and citizens in the evolution of our energy policy.<\/p> <p>  I do not direct the following remarks to Deputy McEntee for one second.<\/p><p>I will just make a general point.  As leaders, we cannot say \"No\" to one form of renewable energy that provides up to 20% of our needs without having a realistic, credible view as to what we will replace it with.  It does not matter who is sitting here next year; we just cannot do that.  We have got to take responsibility for what we want to see happening.<\/p><p> In the first instance, the wind energy guidelines are a matter for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, as Deputy McEntee knows.  My Department, in particular, has been engaging with that Department.  I have had perhaps three meetings on this issue with its Minister and officials.  The respective officials in both Departments have had many meetings seeking to work through a set of proposals that would take account of the real concerns that exist, particularly in respect of noise, shadow flicker and amenity.  It is a question of trying to reconcile these concerns with the progression of our renewable energy policy, particularly on wind.  It is not easy to reconcile the two.  I might as well be clear about that.<\/p><p> Meanwhile, we have guidelines - it is not as if we do not, although I accept that they date from 2006, which is nine years ago.  As soon as we can reach a conclusion on these very technical issues, which have been the subject of discussion between the two Departments, I am sure the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government will move on the guidelines.  The White Paper and the change to the whole context for public discussion and debate will be extremely important.  That is my role.<\/p><p> I have a proposal that I believe will interest people and give them some cheer.  It is that we should now start to consider ways of identifying lands, very often State lands held by Coillte, Bord na M&oacute;na or other State bodies, to determine whether we can concentrate much of the technology in those areas.  This is another strand of work I am involved in to ensure we can make progress with onshore wind energy.<\/p><p> On the North&ndash;South interconnector, there is not really a lot that I can add to what I said at the outset.  The matter is in the planning process and before An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  There is a statutory process that needs to take its course.  EirGrid has made considerable strides in regard to community and citizen engagement.  It is fair to say it needed to do so.  It has done so and has done so in a very effective way.  I am aware that EirGrid has opened offices in Navan, Cootehill and Carrickmacross.  It has appointed community liaison officers and agriculture liaison officers, who are all involved in an outreach exercise with the local communities along the intended route of the interconnector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015120300002#E00500","speaker":"1024","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1449155700,"counter":913,"content":"<p>With all due respect, I believe wind has a part to play; I am not saying it does not.

How do we resolve this?  It would be completely irresponsible if the Government did not resolve this before the end of this term.

I also believed that if one considered a set of assumptions and setback distances, it should be very easy to work out what it would mean in terms of lands available for wind turbines and wind farms.  However, it became clear early on that the matter is much more complex than that.  There are different types and categories of land.  It became increasingly complex.  I agree with the Deputy that it is desirable to have new guidelines.  Both the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and I agree on this.  However, we are still trying to bottom out some technical work on the exact implications of having certain setback distances.  We can be pretty clear on the need to do something on noise and shadow flicker.  The issue concerns very long setback distances.  Some of those advocated, not by my colleague but by others, would have the effect of closing down onshore wind energy production, despite what some commentators might believe.  Although it might sound like a cop-out, it is not a cop-out for me to state that I do not decide where wind farms go.  However, I understand why people contact me about particular wind farms.  It is perfectly fine because they regard me as the energy Minister but it must be realised I have no role whatsoever in determining where a specific wind farm or turbine should be located.  Whether it is in Marley Park or somewhere in Laois, I have no powers in that regard.  My role concerns energy policy but one cannot have an energy policy completely isolated from factors such as planning and citizens' interests.  Equally, the planning code has to have regard to other areas of government and policy, such as the energy policy.  We must try to reconcile the two.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015120300002#F00300","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"speech","time":1449155700,"counter":915,"content":"<p>May I ask a question requiring an answer of \"Yes\" or \"No\"?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015120300002#F00400","speaker":"1180"},{"type":"speech","time":1449155700,"counter":916,"content":"<p>We must finish at 4.45 p.m.  Owing to the time constraint, perhaps the Deputies and Minister could be brief in their contributions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015120300002#F00500","speaker":"1092"},{"type":"speech","time":1449155700,"counter":917,"content":"<p>Does the Minister intend to reach a solution with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government before the end of this term-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015120300002#F00600","speaker":"1180"},{"type":"speech","time":1449155700,"counter":918,"content":"<p>I hope so.

The Minister and I accept the scientific data that it poses a really serious problem, and we accept the evidence suggesting we must keep within 2&deg; Celsius above pre-industrial levels.  I believe we accept the premise that 80% of known fossil fuel resources already discovered will have to remain in the ground or this planet will have a serious problem.  Why are we still talking about fracking?  Why are Ireland and other countries still exploring new sources of oil and gas if we can use but a fraction of what is already accessible?<\/p> <p>  I hope community energy projects will be included in the White Paper.  I would like to see a lot of development in this area over the next five to ten years.  It is an area that the public will very much buy into because they will see a direct benefit to themselves.  For community initiatives to be developed, there needs to be a feed-in tariff for solar energy.  Will the White Paper contain anything on that?  Will a feed-in tariff for microgeneration be mentioned in the White Paper?  The voluntary scheme was scrapped last year.  Any individual renewable energy microgenerator must give away excess electricity to the grid for free.  Could, and should, community developments be included in the renewable heat incentive because the consultation draft is only for industrial projects?<\/p><p>Will there be a discussion on how we might facilitate a direct route for communities to access the national grid?  This project will be buried if people have to wait for ten years or more and risk the costs and uncertainty of investing in those projects.  Finally, will we consider requiring developers to give communities and individuals an opportunity to have ownership of part of developer-led projects?  In Denmark, for example, the legislation requires that 20% of wind projects are owned by the communities or by individuals.  That would mean some of the economic returns would go directly back into the communities that host the developments.  To what extent will that be covered in the White Paper?<\/p><p> I do not know what to say about the north-south interconnector.  I have a fear about this project.  So much has been spent on the design and getting it through the planning process to date that I believe the fear of the waste of money and the potential for further delay will drive a decision rather than what is the best thing to do.  One thing we learned from the Grid Link project was that delay was our friend.  It enabled us to assess more accurately the demand requirements over the next decade at least and allowed us to arrive at a much more cost-effective solution.  I realise there is a greater urgency about the north-south interconnector but if the factors that are being considered at present are cost and timeliness, it must be taken into account that there will be far more cost and infinitely more delay unless the solution that is installed enjoys considerable support in the host community.

I am aware that in schools where walls have been insulated and new types of lighting and more efficient boilers have been installed, the cost of energy has been reduced by up to 20%.  We must focus on that area.  Many homes throughout the country could benefit if the retrofit grant was made more widely available rather than a certain amount every year.  I realise we will not resolve all of this in one year but that is where I believe the biggest saving can be made.<\/p> <p>  The Minister spoke about community and citizens' engagement and referred to wind energy.  I gather from what he said that what communities want and what the Minister is talking about will be two different things.  Given the distances communities want for the wind turbines to be set back and what the Minister says, it will not be possible to fit enough of them in the country.  Community engagement or involvement therefore goes out the window.  This argument about wind has been ongoing for the last five to seven years and I could fill this room with engineers and very professional people on the matter.<\/p><p>In fact, I read an article in recent days about how two Google engineers have spent the past ten years studying wind.  They have said it is one of the most uneconomic things in which a country could be involved.  It has come to the stage where, for the benefit of both the public and the country, we need an open forum involving the Department, the people who maintain it is effective and economically feasible and those who can supply facts and figures.  The Minister threw out a figure.  He said 18.2% of electricity is created through wind energy.  That figure does not tell us everything.  The way the figures are taken mean a producer could be producing that amount of electricity on a graph but the real point is the amount used.  Sometimes wind turbines produce at night-time when the electricity is not used and, to put it frankly, it is being dumped.  We are paying investors for something that we are not utilising.<\/p><p> The Minister referred to the 90-day reserves of oil.  If oil is cheap, would it not be a good thing to do a deal with another country to buy it in advance?  The Minister said they could store a certain amount.  Should we not up the ante if oil is cheap?  That would give security as well.  Can we not consider doing more of that?  I know there is an oil well hidden at the bottom of Cork.  We may get more oil wells around the country, if we are lucky enough.  Next year or the year after, Whitegate will be put out of commission.  I understand the Canadians are getting out of it.  What is the plan for the future there?<\/p><p> How much of our own gas are we getting at present?  Is it 60% or 70%?  For how long is this forecast to last?<\/p><p> We have to be honest and straight with people.  We cannot jump away from fossil fuels for many years to come.  Such a move does not happen overnight.  We have talked about this before.  With luck, the number of people in employment in the country will increase by 150,000.  I realise the Minister has discussed decoupling these points.  However, agriculture has a major input into the economy of the country.  I will give some credit to the Taoiseach.  When he was at the summit on climate change in recent days, he called it.  He said Ireland has come through a torrid time.  We cannot go jumping headfirst into something now.  We cannot all live in tents.  We cannot have an ideal world in which we eat nothing or have no money.  That is not the way our world functions.  I have one specific question for the Minister to add to those I have asked already.  Can we cut to the chase as regards the argument on wind energy?  I would love an open forum, televised for the people, where the facts and figures on what wind energy costs, what is being subsidised and what is the net value of this form of energy as against other types of production can be set out.<\/p><p> I agree with the Minister that we will be importing material for biomass.  Electricity prices in England and France are lower than here.  Given the development of interconnectors and the way technology is improving, will we have spent billions on some ideal-world solution?  In that context, our manufacturing people, who create jobs, are still at a disadvantage because France or England could probably sell us electricity at half the price once they perfect the systems they are developing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015120300002#G01300","speaker":"1198","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1449155700,"counter":936,"content":"<p>I agree with Deputy Fitzmaurice on the point about energy efficiency and energy savings.  We have increased our support in the budget cycle and the capital plan to ramp up our energy efficiency strategy.  This will happen by way of direct Exchequer support.  However, the White Paper makes clear that we will explore innovative ways of leveraging finance, whether European money or private finance.  Many countries are examining this possibility at present.  The question is how to finance energy efficiency initiatives in the domestic sector and in business.<\/p> <p>  It is always difficult to persuade people, whether they are under financial pressure or not, to borrow to make changes to their homes - for example, by way of retrofitting - that will benefit them in future.  Last week I referred to the tragedy of horizon that we often see.  People find it difficult, as a result of the many financial pressures they are under, to see the value of investing today in something like energy efficiency, although it can bear major dividends in future.  The Government is keen to ensure that we bring the agenda forward and members will see this reflected in the White Paper.  It is also reflected in capital plan and the budget.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Fitzmaurice made a stark comment to the effect that what communities want is totally at odds with what we want in terms of renewable energy.  I do not accept that the situation is so bad.  Certainly, there are real concerns in communities.  However, I have seen and visited other communities throughout the country where wind farms and turbines are situated and where there is little or no difficulty or issue about them.  That is not to suggest that people do not have legitimate concerns.  Some people do and they are entitled to have them voiced.  However, it is not true to say that there is universal rejection throughout the country in respect of onshore wind, wind turbines or wind farms.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy referred to the idea of an open forum.  He should look carefully at the White Paper.  Much of what Deputy Fitzmaurice and his colleagues have been saying this afternoon will be reflected in the White Paper.  We must address this matter.  We cannot have an energy policy by diktat.  It has to be debated with the people and understood.  At the same time, we have to give leadership and we have a responsibility to give leave leadership.  We had a debate in the Chamber this morning.  The point was made that we represent people.  That is fair enough.  We have to represent their concerns but we also have to give leadership.  I made a point in response to Deputy McEntee's comments.  If we take a view that we are going to migrate from one technology, for example, wind farms or wind energy, then we have to be ready with a credible alternative.  There is no walking away from this issue.  This is here and we have to get a grip on it.  This applies to this Government, this D&aacute;il, the people and the next D&aacute;il.  There are no easy solutions.  There is no point in saying that is not going to happen if we do not have a credible alternate view about what we think should happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015120300002#H00200","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"speech","time":1449155700,"counter":937,"content":"<p>I am not saying the Minister should get rid of everything.

For the betterment of the people, the Minister needs to bring individuals from both sides to an open forum where the issue can be thrashed out and at which the cost of production and the extent of subsidisation can be made clear.  This will make it clear to the people that if we want this type of electricity, then it is going to cost one and a half times or twice as much in real terms.  Let us live in the real world rather than a fictional one.

However, it is not true to say that the economics of wind generation are negative.  We can have a debate in this committee and we can bring forward the data we have.  We have data from the 2015 report of the Council of European Energy Regulators.  The report demonstrates that the per-unit supports for renewable electricity in Ireland are among the lowest in Europe.<\/p><p>I can give the Deputy figures for 2014 on what we have saved in respect of fossil imports as a consequence of the deployment of wind energy, as the SEAI published them last week and they are on its website.  He can see for himself what the saving is and the value of wind.  We are not saying it is the only technology and type of renewable energy we can use, as we can use others as well, but I respectfully say it will feature prominently.  The Deputy is right that we need to get our heads around it as a community and we need to debate it and ensure it is understood, not in a dictatorial way by the Government but in a way that shares information with people.  The ideas outlined by the Deputy are very good.<\/p><p> Sometimes people say that a turbine or wind farm operates only so many days a week or so many hours at day.  We know that wind is intermittent.  I am not directing this to Deputy Fitzmaurice, but it is well understood that wind is intermittent and that there are days when the wind does not blow.  However we also have days such as, if my memory is correct, last Sunday, when 53% of our electricity was generated from wind.  One can see this on the Eirgrid app.  The fact it is intermittent is why we must develop new technologies for storage.  Amazing work is being done throughout the world on addressing and mitigating the problem of intermittency with wind.  If this can be solved it will be an enormous step forward, because we could migrate to renewable energy much more quickly than any of us think is possible at present.  These are the types of issues on which we could do better sharing and debating with the public.<\/p><p> We have a requirement under the directives to keep 90 days of oil reserves.  In the past, the old Irish National Petroleum Corporation, INPC, used to do what the Deputy suggested, which is to buy oil ahead, but I am not sure whether state aid rules would allow us to do so now.  To return to gas, we now have a mix and we have discussed this.  I discussed the transition with Deputy Colreavy, and it seems it is likely that of our fuel mix of oil, coal and gas, gas will be the preferred fossil of the transition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015120300002#H00400","speaker":"1024","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1449155700,"counter":940,"content":"<p>I suggest that Senators Brennan and Byrne ask their questions and the Minister will reply to both.

I was delayed by a vote in the Seanad and we expect another one shortly.  I mentioned at our last meeting the possibility of reducing our energy demands.  I am convinced, even though I say it myself, it is a good idea with regard to emissions and the cost to local authorities of electricity in our towns, villages and motorways.  Our demand for electricity is too high.  The Minister mentioned using State assets such as Coillte and State-owned properties, and this will help to alleviate and minimise the objectors locally.  I am not sure what the reason is, but it will make it easier for the Minister.<\/p> <p>  We have a number of inlets and fjords throughout the country.  I live on a fjord, where the tide comes and goes twice a day every day.  It is not like the wind and it does not stop for anybody.  Has the project which has been on Strangford Lough for the past ten or 15 years been examined?  Electricity is supplied by the turbine to 1,200 to 1,500 domestic houses in the adjacent towns and villages.  Have we examined any of our inlets?  We should look at the possibility of having similar projects such as that on Strangford Lough.  All avenues of alternative energy must be explored.  I agree with the Minister that wind energy is economical.  It would not be used in parts of our country and predominantly in other European countries if it was not an economical proposition.  Wave technology must be explored to the full as we are an island nation.<\/p> <p>  I asked about the North-South interconnector, which is of great concern to me with regard to the proposals for more pylons.  I do not know whether we can run 220 AC supply underground in parallel with the existing interconnector.  Is it technically possible to join them at the beginning and end with both running parallel in between?  I do not expect the Minister to remember, but on the way from the meeting I mentioned to him the capacity of the proposed interconnector between Ireland and France, if and when it happens.

The Minister is being blamed locally by his Government colleagues for the failure to publish guidelines, but he is correct that Deputy Alan Kelly is the Minister responsible.  The Minister, Deputy White, seems to be the bogeyman in Meath at present with regard to wind turbines.  This is probably unfair because the ball is in the court of the Minister, Deputy Kelly and, as the Minister said, it is a matter for the entire Government, both Fine Gael and the Labour Party, to make the ultimate decision.<\/p> <p>  The slowness in dealing with this is contrasted severely with the alacrity with which the Minister has changed the terms of the REFIT 2 scheme over the past week.  He has facilitated wind energy companies, which have lobbied him to make a change to the scheme to facilitate projects which have made planning applications, such as those in Emlagh and Maighne, but have not yet received a grant of planning permission.  The Minister has changed the terms of the scheme to facilitate these projects and allow them to qualify for the REFIT 2 scheme if they obtain planning permission by the end of next year as opposed to by the end of this year.  The Department's website mentions queries from, but I call it lobbying by, energy companies which have made planning applications but which did not have their ducks in a row and were not going to comply with the terms and conditions of the scheme.  The scheme would be of huge financial benefit to them and would probably make the schemes valuable.  These companies do not yet have planning permission and it is certainly unlikely that the project in Maighne will have planning permission by the end of the year, and for that in Emlagh it will be 21 December at the earliest.  Why was this done so quickly?  Why were they facilitated?<\/p><p>Throughout this debate there seems to have been a facilitation of these developments, first, by not publishing guidelines and, now, by changing the terms and conditions of the REFIT 2 scheme which were approved not just by the Government but also by the European Commission under state aid rules.

We are certainly addressing all of the developments taking place and taking account of new technologies, particularly in the production of tidal, wave and ocean energy.  Of all the developments of interest for the future, offshore production of renewable energy seems to be the most exciting.  It is important to note that there is a long lead-in period associated with all of these technologies.  What the Government is concerned with is supporting and funding research.  That is our major contribution in this area.  It is very unlikely that there will ever be a situation where the Government will construct offshore wind arrays and involve itself in tidal or wave energy production.  What it can do is be involved in funding research, understanding what the developments are and where the opportunities will be in the future and supporting the research institutions, including the universities.  I have in mind, in particular, the Beaufort facility at Ringaskiddy, which is a very impressive centre of excellence for research into ocean energy, whether tidal, wave, offshore or wind.  That is our principal involvement in these technologies.<\/p> <p>  Senator Terry Brennan referred to the North-South interconnector project.  I can only repeat what I already have said in this regard which reflects what representatives of EirGrid said when they appeared before the committee.  No two projects are the same.  Whereas it was possible to make changes to the Grid Link project, for example, we are not comparing two projects that are the same if we compare it with the North-South interconnector.  What was done in the case of Grid Link cannot necessarily be done in the case of the North-South interconnector project or any of the other projects being brought forward.<\/p> <p>  On the possibility of constructing an interconnector between Ireland and France, a feasibility study is being carried out with the French authorities.  We look forward to seeing the fruits of that study.  As to what the capacity of that line might be, it is not possible to say at this point.  A cost-benefit analysis would have to be carried out in order to determine what capacity might be possible and affordable in the context of an Ireland-France interconnection.  The process is at an early stage, but we look forward to seeing it progressing.  In the context of energy union, everything is changing very quickly in terms of what may be possible in the future.  Deputy Michael Fitzmaurice has noted that the extent to which we will have interconnections with other jurisdictions may be the determining factor in the future in the use of renewable energy and, ultimately, the value to the consumer in terms of the pressure on prices that it might be possible to deliver.<\/p> <p>  In respect of REFIT 2, I must profess a little uncertainty as to what precisely Senator Thomas Byrne is asking about.
