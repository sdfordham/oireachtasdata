It seems that the HSE still has not released the sections of the Conal Devine report as directed by the Office of the Information Commissioner.  The eight-week appeal period expired over a week ago.  I think it expired on the 24 November or 25 November.  This really flies in the face of what Tony O'Brien, the head of the HSE, said at our previous meeting.  He said he wanted to see the report published as quickly as possible.  So a question arises.  Why the delay?  The report was commissioned using public funds.  The Office of the Information Commissioner is funded through the Exchequer.  The decision has been made.  I do not know where to go with regard to actually making it happen.  It is clear what the intent of the committee has always been.  It is now clear what the Information Commissioner has directed.  Maybe the first port of call might be the Secretary General of the Department of Health, with whom we have dealt on this matter on a couple of occasions, to ask him to expedite it and have it published by the end of the week, which is tomorrow.  If that is agreeable, we should register that intent with the Department of Health immediately.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015120300002#C00200","speaker":"1091"},{"type":"speech","time":1449136800,"counter":27,"content":"<p>Arising from that, we can ask the clerk to contact the HSE and the Department with a view to having their responses before next week's meeting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015120300002#C00300","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speech","time":1449136800,"counter":28,"content":"<p>The Information Commissioner should express his view on this delay as well.

At the end of 2014, a total of &euro;9.3 million was liable for surrender from the Vote back to the Exchequer.  There were two elements to this.<\/p><p>The Department underspent by &euro;8.6 million relative to its budget.  The main components of the underspend were a &euro;2.5 million saving on budgeted administration costs across all programmes, mainly due to the delayed delivery of planned training programmes and delays in the progress of certain IT and accommodation projects, and a &euro;6 million saving on a budgeted spend of around &euro;9 million on a broad category described as consultancy and other services.  The Department also received approximately &euro;750,000 more in appropriations-in-aid than budgeted for, mainly due to recoupment of consultancy costs previously incurred on banking stabilisation activities, which had not been anticipated in the framing of the Estimate.<\/p><p> As indicated in figure 1, the expenditure on the Department&rsquo;s financial services policy programme recorded in the appropriation accounts is &euro;6.8 million.  However, it should be noted that this does not include costs associated with staff seconded to the Department from the NTMA to deal with banking sector issues and certain related consultancy costs.  These costs are borne by the NTMA and not recouped from the Department.  The level of costs incurred in that regard is not disclosed in either the appropriation accounts or the NTMA&rsquo;s financial statements.<\/p><p> I turn now to the finance accounts for 2014.  As provided for in Article 11 of the Constitution, all revenues of the State are paid into the Central Fund of the Exchequer, unless otherwise determined by law.  Examples of State revenue which is not paid directly into the Central Fund include PRSI receipts which are paid into the social insurance fund and the proceeds of motor tax which are paid into the local government fund.  The annual finance accounts present the receipts into and issues from the Central Fund of the Exchequer, together with a set of bespoke supporting statements that analyse the transactions.  The national debt accounts which are prepared by the NTMA and audited separately by me are also presented in full as Part 2 of the finance accounts.  The finance accounts are designed to provide an annual statement of Central Fund transactions on a cash basis and are not a comprehensive set of annual financial statements for the State or central government.  The chapters from my report on the accounts of the public services for 2014 that are the subject of the meeting were compiled to complement the information in the finance accounts by highlighting key aggregates and trends in Central Fund transactions and State liabilities.<\/p><p> Figure 2 shows the trends in overall issues and receipts from 2002 to 2014.  The deficit for the year has fallen each year since 2011.  In 2014 the deficit was &euro;8.2 billion, &euro;3.3 billion lower than in 2013.  Some significant developments during 2014 which the committee may wish to note were as follows: there was a 2% year-on-year increase in the cost of servicing the national debt which in 2014 amounted to a total of &euro;7.6 billion; there was a transfer of &euro;484 million in local property tax receipts from the Central Fund to the local government fund; there were Central Fund loans to the value of &euro;54 million and capital funding of &euro;407 million provided for Irish Water, on which I report in further detail in chapter 11 of my report; and there was the receipt of &euro;405 million in respect of a 20-year national lottery operator&rsquo;s licence which is dealt with in further detail in chapter 7.  That matter was discussed two weeks ago when the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform was before the committee.<\/p><p> The aggregate values of Central Fund receipts and issues increased significantly in 2014 due to the stepping up of repayable cash flow funding provided for the social insurance fund.  In total, &euro;4 billion was advanced to the fund in 2014 from the Central Fund and these advances were fully repaid by the end of the year.  Because of the absence of a balance sheet in the finance accounts, we have included a new \"loans and advances\" analysis in annex A of the chapter.<\/p><p> Revenues from taxation and other charges represent the primary source of State funding, but, as Deputies will know, the State also borrows substantially to supplement annual funding and cover deficits.  Chapter 2 of my report outlines the trends and composition of government debt and the cost of debt servicing.  It also provides an update on Ireland&rsquo;s activity in the sovereign debt market.  The most comprehensive measure of Government debt is general Government debt.  This is an internationally-standardised measure of the total gross debt owed by all Government bodies to third parties outside government.  The ratio of general Government debt to GDP declined to 108% at the end of 2014 from its peak level of 120% at the end of 2013.  This reduction was due to a combination of strong GDP growth and a reduction in the liabilities of IBRC in the course of its liquidation.  The main component of Ireland&rsquo;s general Government debt at the end of 2014 was cumulative borrowing undertaken by the NTMA on behalf of the State, referred to as gross national debt.  Because the deficit for the year was met by a reduction in the Exchequer&rsquo;s cash balances, this decreased by a net &euro;500 million during 2014.  The gross national debt rose marginally in the first six months of 2015, standing at around &euro;201 billion at the end of June.<\/p><p> The NTMA estimates that the weighted average cost of servicing the gross national debt was 3.5% at the end ofJune 2015, down from 3.8% at the end of 2014.  Around 92% of the gross national debt at the end ofJune 2015 was at fixed rates.  A significant factor in the reduction in the average servicing cost was the early repayment of the most expensive portion of the EU-IMF lending.  The first tranche of early repayment was concluded in the first quarter of 2015 and, in total, just over &euro;18 billion, or 81% of the original IMF loan facility, was repaid early.  The repayment was funded by other NTMA borrowing.<\/p><p> In response to the financial crisis in 2008, the State undertook a succession of interrelated measures to stabilise the banking system.  The economic impacts of the measures are both complex and long-term.  Chapter 3 was compiled to provide an estimate, as at the end of 2014, of the net financial cost of these measures.  The sums involved in recapitalising banks, including covering their losses, are relatively straightforward to identify.  Income accruing from the investments and capital repayments or disposals of investments are also generally clear.  Less easy to identify are the costs incurred by the State in funding the investments.  Estimation procedures are required to identify these costs which are substantial and in arriving at a valuation of the State's residual interest in banking assets.<\/p><p> The results of the examination analysis are summarised in figure 3.1 in the chapter.  The overall investment in the banks, including the value of shares accepted in lieu of dividends, totalled &euro;66.8 billion.  Directly or indirectly, this resulted in equivalent State borrowing which cost an estimated &euro;8.7 billion in interest costs up to the end of 2014.  After receipts from disposals, dividend and other payments, fees charged for guarantee protections and the estimated share of Central Bank profits that relate to banking stabilisation measures, the State&rsquo;s net outlay associated with the stabilisation measures, up to the end of 2014, was just under &euro;60 billion.  Against this, the State held an interest in the rescued banks, worth an estimated &euro;16.7 billion at 31 December 2014.  Netting the two amounts results in an estimated net cost to the taxpayer for the State&rsquo;s banking stabilisation measures of around &euro;43 billion.<\/p><p> Members are, of course, well aware that the scale of the State support provided was different for each bank.  Therefore, using the same estimation approach, we calculated the outturn for each of the banks.  We estimated that, as at 31 December 2014, support for IBRC had cost the State a net &euro;36.1 billion, that support for AIB had cost a net &euro;8.8 billion, that permanent tsb was almost at break-even and that there was a net surplus of &euro;2 billion in respect of the State&rsquo;s support for Bank of Ireland.  I emphasise that these estimates are at a point in time and that the final cost of the measures will not be identifiable for some time to come.  The cost of servicing residual banking-related State debt will be an ongoing economic one.  We estimate it to be between &euro;850 million and &euro;1.7 billion annually, if the State&rsquo;s average cost of borrowing is in the range 2% to 4% a year.<\/p><p>The NTMA's average cost of borrowing was around 3.5% at the end of last June, so that cost is likely to be at the higher end of the range.<\/p><p> Of course, other factors will also be at play in determining the final overall cost of the stabilisation measures.  These will include the amount the State ultimately realises from the disposal of its remaining bank investments and the period for which the Central Bank continues to hold Government bonds relating to redemption of the IBRC promissory notes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015120300002#C02800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1449136800,"counter":56,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy.

Sitting behind me is Fiachra Quinn.<br\/><br\/>I would like to focus on the four specific items of today's agenda and provide an overview of performance.  The first item on today's agenda is Vote 7 - Office of the Minister for Finance and the 2014 Appropriation Accounts for the Department.  The Estimate for 2014 was &euro;31.2 million.  Spending in 2014 was &euro;21.9 million, leaving a surrender of approximately &euro;9.3 million.  This surplus arose for a number of reasons.  Recruitment did not progress at the pace anticipated, resulting in pay bill savings of circa &euro;1.7 million and a further &euro;1 million underspend on non-pay administration expenses.  There was also an underspend of approximately &euro;5.3 million on programme-related costs arising from the completion of some work in-house on third-party funding of certain international assignee replacements, there were later timelines than originally anticipated in certain national payment plan projects and lower costs in regard to the shareholding unit.  There were lower than anticipated costs on the medium term economic strategy and the economic planning initiative, because much of the work in these areas was completed in-house and in conjunction with our colleagues across the system, with a saving of &euro;700,000.  The Department also recouped an additional &euro;600,000 in respect of costs associated with the stabilisation of the banking sector.<br\/><br\/>We remain committed to seeking to minimise costs where possible, subject to achieving the best outturn for the State.  In terms of the financial outturn, I draw the committee's attention to the following key points.  Tax revenues, at &euro;41.28 billion, were up &euro;3.48 billion, or 9.2%, year on year and &euro;1.24 billion up against profile, or 3.1%.  Within the figure for tax revenues, the increase was distributed across the three key tax heads.  Income tax grew by 8.9%, corporation tax by 8.1% and VAT by 7.9% year on year.  Total expenditure, at &euro;58.59 billion, was up &euro;2.3 billion, or 4.3%, year on year.  This was driven by increased non-voted expenditure, which showed an increase of &euro;3.23 billion.  General government debt as a percentage of GDP is projected to drop to 97% in 2015, from a peak of 120% in 2012.  This downward trend is projected to continue next year when a debt to GDP ratio of some 93% is forecast, in line with the euro area average.<br\/><br\/>The investment by the Irish taxpayer in the banks has been unprecedented, totalling over &euro;64 billion.  This investment comprised &euro;34.7 billion for IBRC and &euro;29.4 billion for the three viable banks, AIB, Bank of Ireland and Permanent TSB.  Our objective is to ensure the best return to the taxpayer and we are well on the way to recovering almost all our investment in the three viable banks.  The total current value of the State&rsquo;s investments, based on the latest valuations, in the three remaining banks is &euro;18 billion.  A further &euro;11.2 billion has been generated from disposals, fees, including guarantee fees, and other income.  This totals some &euro;29.2 billion against the &euro;29.4 billion invested.  We remain confident that, over time, the aggregate funds the State has invested in the three viable banks will be recovered.<br\/><br\/>I would like to turn briefly to performance and outputs in recent years.  The Department is working towards two broad goals: a sustainable economic environment and sound public finances; and a balanced and equitable economy enabled by a restructured, vibrant, secure and well-regulated financial sector.  After a difficult number of years, the Irish economy is now recovering and the short to medium-term outlook is bright.  Budgetary policies continue to focus on the need to reduce public debt, generate sufficient funding for public services and boost the growth capacity of the economy.<br\/><br\/>A modest recovery in economic activity under way since 2011 has gained momentum over the past 18 months, with GDP expanding by over 5% in 2014, and by close to 7% in the first half of 2015.  GDP <i>per capita<\/i>is now above the pre-crisis peak recorded in 2007.  The expansion in economic activity, initially led by the exporting sectors, has become more sustained, with domestic demand now making a strong positive contribution to growth.  We now have broad-based employment growth across the economy, with increases recorded throughout the country and in virtually every economic sector.  The most recent figures show that 140,000 net jobs have been created since the low point of the crisis.  As a result, the unemployment rate fell to 8.9% in October, representing a decline of almost 6% from its peak in 2012.<br\/><br\/>Putting the public finances on a sound and sustainable footing is a key priority.  Stable public finances are a prerequisite for economic growth.  The general government deficit has fallen from a peak of 11.5% of GDP in 2009 to an estimated 2.1% in October 2015.  Based on the Exchequer returns published yesterday, I anticipate this will be closer to 1.7% at the end of the year.  Gross government debt peaked and is now on a firm downward path.  Gross debt is expected to be around 97% of GDP at the end of 2015.  Appropriate fiscal policies will continue to be necessary to ensure that deficit and debt levels maintain a downward trajectory.  The new economic governance rules agreed in recent years now operate within the framework of the European semester.  Ireland has been a consistent supporter of the new economic governance and fiscal regime.<br\/><br\/>This year&rsquo;s budget also introduced new processes to improve transparency, dialogue and understanding in our domestic arrangements.  The spring economic statement, SES, outlined the parameters that would be applied in the October budget, including provision for additional public expenditure and taxation measures, while still complying with our Stability and Growth Pact, SGP, obligations. The SES is an important development and reform in how we budget.<br\/><br\/>The national economic dialogue in July provided for engagement with stakeholders and created an environment in which all aspects of the public finances and budget could be explored within the parameters set out in the SES.  This initiative allowed for an open and public dialogue on policy choices before the formulation of the budget, set within the strict rules that must apply to the assessment of policy options.  A further potential reform identified in the SES was the possibility of establishing an independent budget office after the next election.  The Department, in partnership with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, has begun to scope out that option.<br\/><br\/>A sustainable tax system is also central to ensuring stable public finances and supporting economic growth.  We have been reforming and modernising the way we develop tax policy advice for several years.  Central to this is a much greater emphasis on open public consultation processes, which lead to better evidence-based policy-making.  Contributions from stakeholders, interest groups and individual members of the public are welcome as part of this process and are carefully assessed.  To ensure policy proposals are robust, in 2015 we introduced new tax expenditure guidelines to assist with <i>ex-ante<\/i>and <i>ex-post<\/i>evaluations of tax expenditures going forward.  The Department also hosted its third annual tax policy conference, at which over 150 stakeholders, academics and policy makers discussed topical tax policy issues.<br\/><br\/>Work continues across a wide range of challenging issues within the banking and financial services sector.  A viable and stable banking system is essential to the proper functioning of the economy.  A key focus of our work in 2015 has been to enable EU regulatory reform measures, such as banking union and Solvency II, in addition to a range of other transpositions.  The European Commission also published its capital markets proposal and action plan in September 2015.  The key objective is to unlock non-bank financing so as to better connect capital to investment projects in the European Union.  The Department will continue work commenced on this during 2016.<br\/><br\/>As I indicated earlier, our objective is to recover our investment in the viable banks.  The State owns just under 14% of Bank of Ireland, which is worth approximately &euro;1.6 billion.  The State owns just under 75% of Permanent TSB, which is worth &euro;1.4 billion.  During the past year, Permanent TSB raised &euro;525 million from the private sector and the State received &euro;509 million in capital receipts from the sale of shares and the repurchase by the bank of our contingent capital notes.  As members know, the State owns 99.8% of AIB and it announced last month that it had reached agreement with the regulator and the Minister to reorganise its capital structure.  AIB remains an extremely valuable asset for the State.  As part of the capital reorganisation, an updated valuation for the bank of some &euro;15 billion was estimated.<br\/><br\/>Since its launch in 2014, some 3,200 Irish SMEs have benefited from Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, loans, with almost &euro;110 million of new lower cost loans drawn down.  The loans offering longer maturities and payment flexibility have been taken up by Irish SMEs across a range of sectors in all regions.<\/p><p>To date, NAMA has redeemed &euro;22.1 billion or 73% of the &euro;30.2 billion senior bonds originally issued and is well on the way to redeeming 80% of the senior bonds by the end of 2016 rather than the previous target of 2018.  NAMA expects to have fully redeemed its senior debt by 2018 and its subordinated debt by March 2020.  Members will also be aware that NAMA recently announced that it would fund the delivery of 20,000 residential units on a commercial basis from its own resources by 2020.<\/p><p> My Department also published a review of the Credit Union Restructuring Board, ReBo, in October 2015.  The review found that ReBo had made significant progress in achieving its overall objectives.  ReBo has assisted 74 individual credit unions in 36 completed restructuring projects.  The Minister recently announced that 31 March 2016 is the final date for acceptance of any further restructuring proposals.  This will enable ReBo to continue to engage with the sector and complete the performance of its functions within its time-bound mandate.<\/p><p> The Department continues to make steady progress in line with our goal to enhance our capacity, to continually improve and become a higher performing Department.  I will mention a couple of specific examples.  The Department&rsquo;s governance framework published earlier this year has been an input into the development of the corporate governance standard for the Civil Service, recently approved by Government.  It is also one of the Department's two shortlisted nominations for this afternoon's Civil Service awards, along with the SME online tool.  The Department was also shortlisted for best learning and development organisation as part of the Irish Institute of Training and Development awards.  The Department achieved an outstanding achievement award following an awards ceremony on 6 March 2015. <\/p><p> I would like to take this opportunity to express my appreciation to the staff at the Department for their ongoing hard work.  It is only through their continuing commitment and dedication that we can deliver on our objectives.  The Department will strive for continuous improvement and develop into the best organisation we can be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015120300002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Derek Moran","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1449136800,"counter":59,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. Moran.

I refer to corporate tax.  As Mr. McCarthy said, they are capital intensive in their nature.  There is a concentration in that the very large multinationals - the top ten groups - pay us about a third of the total corporation tax.  This year is no different from last year in that regard.  The things that are changing are that there is across the board performance improvement; 20% more smaller companies are paying tax this year than were last year; and those which were paying tax last year are paying more this year.  This is with the multinational sector - the big taxpayers - still retaining the same share of what they pay.<\/p> <p>  There are other issues that complicate the matter.  Anybody who prices in dollars has improved their profitability because of the appreciation of the currency.  I am not sure if that explains a huge amount of it but it accounts for some of it.  In addition, during the worst economic times, companies were perhaps not making profits and were carrying losses.  As they move from a loss-making situation into profitability, they burn off those losses and go from zero to paying a substantial amount of tax.  The performance is exceptional by any measure.  <\/p> <p>  We have been talking to the Revenue Commissioners throughout the year.  With the exception of relatively small one-offs, the consistent message is that this is not going to necessarily disappear.

The Revenue Commissioners through what they call their large case division survey the big taxpayers once a year to get an indication of performance but it is a voluntary arrangement that involves them telling  Revenue how things are going.  We did not get anything from that survey that would suggest this type of surge.<\/p> <p>  The key thing throughout the year has been the fact that as this performance has continued, it is a confirmation that this is not once-off.  This is a lift in the overall level.  There is a range of explanations such as improved trading conditions, continued recovery in the US and UK economies and the fact that more companies are paying tax as they come out of the recession with those at the smaller end that paid tax last year paying more again this year.  It will take us some time to drill down into this.  Mr. McCarthy and his team work with the Revenue Commissioners to drill down into this in greater detail because we must understand what has happened and what lies behind it.

While some of the multinationals may skew the figure, it is important to remember that actual receipts from the smaller firms - the SME sector - are growing at a faster pace than receipts from the large cases division.  We have this concentration issue in Ireland.  Some would see it as a risk.  The Secretary General mentioned that the top ten groups pay one third of tax while the top 50 firms pay one half of corporation tax.  By its nature, corporation tax is susceptible to firm-specific and sector-specific developments.  We saw it back in 2012 and 2013 when the patent cliff occurred in the pharmaceutical sector so it does make it very difficult to forecast.<\/p> <p>  I emphasise the role of the exchange rate in overall profitability.  I say this because our profiles for tax revenue were published last February when the assumption was that the economy would grow by about 4.25%.  That was based on the assumption, and we are required to take the European Commission's assumptions under the new European semester, that the euro-dollar exchange rate will average about 1.29-1.30.  Following quantitative easing, we now have an exchange rate that averaged about 1.05 for the year as a whole.  We know that about 80% of firms in Ireland price in dollars so that depreciation of the euro has brought about a massive increase and improvement in terms of corporate profitability.  That is a very important factor in trying to explain the increase in profitability this year so I would not underplay that.  As the Secretary General said, we will need the detailed tax returns over the course of next year to be able to conduct a more in-depth analysis.  <\/p> <p>  What we are doing at the moment is looking at some econometric work in this area to see if additional variables might improve the modelling we use.

That does not explain the problem because profitability and corporation tax revenue typically move one for one over time.  The fact that corporation tax is now between 50% or 52% above for the year as a whole means there is a massive gap between those two variables.  We are looking at the econometric models and so is Revenue.

Ultimately, just to reiterate, for a range of reasons this has significantly overperformed.  We will do the econometric analysis as the data come through to try to understand where this came from and we may have far better answers in due course.  It would have pushed the bounds of credibility in October 2014, in preparing for 2015, to have put in this type of forecast for corporation tax.  There would not have been any basis for it.  We tend to operate off the basis of national accounts estimation of profitability and for next year, I think on budget day we had approximately 8% growth.  To a certain extent, this becomes de-risked, as the performance has been so strong this year that we are close to achieving the target for next year.  Consequently, to achieve that and to keep the budget on target for next year, one does not need any growth and so that removes a bit of the risk.  The interesting thing over the course of the year has been that we planned the budget for 2015 in October 2014, and that budget had a deficit target of 2.7%.  By April, we were saying 2.4%, by October, 2.1% and it now looks as though it will be 1.7%.  All of this essentially is feeding through into the deficit coming down more rapidly, which must be regarded as a positive.  In itself, that removes some of the risk but the performance this year is up very close to the total target for next year.  We know we have a large amount of work to do to try to understand this and we will be doing that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015120300002#J00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Derek Moran"},{"type":"speech","time":1449136800,"counter":150,"content":"<p>I am quite concerned about this because it is quite important.

The US is not at all a disinterested party in this.  So it goes beyond Ireland.  It goes beyond Europe and it reaches out to the US.  Some of the points he was making were, first, that the US is somewhat worried about the over-concentration on US companies by DG COMP; second, that it interferes with its bilateral tax treaties with individual countries, because it does not have a tax treaty with Brussels per se; and also, the risk at the end of the day that retrospective imposition will be regarded as a credit by US companies and ultimately will become a bill on the US taxpayer, among other things.  So that was very interesting testimony in that regard.

Mr. Moran, Ms Nolan and their team are very welcome.  The first thing to recognise is that they have presented us with a good news story.  There have been excellent returns in virtually all categories, including corporation tax, which has been phenomenal.  We should look at it initially from that point of view.  A figure of 140,000 jobs is incredible over a few years.  Unemployment is down from 15.3% to 8.9%.  Gross Government debt is down from 120% to 97%.  The general Government deficit is down from 11.5% in 2009 to 2.1% in 2015.  These are phenomenal results in a very short space of time and the Department should in the first instance be complimented on them.  All the indications are that there will be strong progress in a positive direction in the future.<\/p> <p>  In respect of corporation tax, which has been teased out in considerable detail and on which I will not dwell, I would speculate in terms of getting a final solution.  I hope the Department does come back to us with a more detailed statement as to where all of that money has come from after all the econometric models are completed and the IDA has produced its final report.  Mr. McCarthy spoke about exchange rates and the depreciation of the euro versus the dollar from 1.29 to 1.05 or thereabouts.  That is depreciation of almost 25%.  Considering that the vast majority of the multinational companies are US companies that are trading in dollars or using currency of that nature, this alone would affect a considerable amount of it.<\/p> <p>  It seems that the IDA has done a fantastic job throughout the recession and there has been an unexpected increase in multinational companies' attraction to the country.  It appears that even while the economy was going down domestically, through the global Irish network and the IDA, those critical areas of foreign direct investment not only remained intact, there was a substantial increase in those years and this is now coming to fruition.  Perhaps the second pillar of that was that for the first time ever, small and medium-sized Irish industries were trading abroad because there was no domestic consumer market here.  They have now established bases so there is a strong trading return coming from the international exports stage.  Now that the domestic market has picked up substantially, a double whammy is coming forward when the opposite was true in the past.  This could account for a certain amount of the profits that are now being realised.<\/p> <p>  Despite all of that, the phenomenal increase of 2.2% or 2.3% over 2014 from &euro;4.184 billion to &euro;6.361 billion requires further teasing out and clarification.  I would love to see the details of why and how Mr. Niall Cody, the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, was able to say that this was sustainable going forward and that it was not a windfall but effectively cyclical and sustainable.  Could the witnesses respond?  I do not want to go into any further detail but could they expand on whether this scenario could exist and also expand on what they have already said?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015120300002#O02800","speaker":"1006"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1449136800,"counter":298,"content":"<p>I have no doubt that as we work through the data, we will make that available because it is important for people to understand and have confidence in what is going on.  The Deputy is right to say the flow of foreign direct investment continued throughout the darkest days.  Our colleagues in the IDA have done a remarkable job and have ambitious targets.  When a company sets up, it takes a bit of time before it starts paying tax.  It does not pay tax from day one.  That flows through eventually.  Both Mr. McCarthy and I have said, and it features in the chairman&rsquo;s letter, that the small and medium enterprise, SME, sector, is characterised as the smaller payer of corporation tax, but there are now more SMEs.  Those that were paying tax are paying more.  In respect of the uplift in corporate taxation, the concentration in the top ten groups has not changed proportionally.  It is approximately one third.  It is good news.  We have to be cautious.  At the level we are at, in terms of corporation tax collected and assuming we get what we are expecting in December, we are there or thereabouts in the target for next year which removes some of the risk while we are doing this analysis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015120300002#P00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Derek Moran"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1449136800,"counter":299,"content":"<p>The Deputy makes a valid point about FDI during the very difficult years.

Will Mr. McCarthy give us an idea of the percentage increase year on year in that period, not necessarily now?  What level of trading took place?  For example, I was a Minister of State with responsibility for trade and development, which was part of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  All the embassies were mobilised as economic engines where Irish networks were established all over the world.  Trade missions then went to an area where there were networks of Irish business people plus networks of other business people.  All of a sudden there was business coming to small and medium enterprises that could not trade in Ireland or had never traded abroad before.  I would love to see an analysis of the effectiveness of that because the focus was on the Global Irish Network in Dublin Castle, the ideas it came forward with and the amount of FDI it continued to mobilise for Ireland.  It was able to mobilise SMEs, which could not sell anything at home because there was no consumer market, to go abroad and do that and maintain those high levels of export.  That could be flowing into a particular resolution now in much the same way as the most recent figures for unemployment were down from 9.4% to 8.9%, a drop of 0.5% in one month.  That came out of the blue and nobody asked how.  Why could we have that amazing drop at this time?

We expect it will have paid back the Government-guaranteed bonds by the end of 2018.  The agency is obliged to have 80% of them paid back by the end of next year and to date, it has paid back 73%.  Consequently, NAMA is well on target to make good on 100% of the primary debt.  It also has subordinated debt, which is owed to the banks, and it expects to pay that back by 2020 because that is when it is due and I cannot think of any particular reason NAMA would pay it back early.  In the meantime, one provision in the NAMA Act is that the agency is to consider dysfunctions in the market and at present - a Deputy made reference to it earlier - there is a clear dysfunction in the housing market.  Within that mandate, NAMA has decided it will, through its debtors and others, build 20,000 houses between now and 2020, primarily in the Dublin area but also in other urban centres where they are needed and that work is continuing.  NAMA also has some long-term development work in the strategic development zone, SDZ, area, particularly in the Dublin docklands, where the agency has a lot of property or property interests and that project is ongoing.  There will be a decision whenever we do the review, obviously we will review the agency after it has paid back all the Government-guaranteed debt, as to what it intends to do in the long term with those long-term investments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015120300002#Q00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Ann Nolan"},{"type":"speech","time":1449136800,"counter":329,"content":"<p>At this point in time, we are 50% of the way through NAMA's remit.

That was &euro;32 billion, of which twenty-something billion euro has been paid off.  At this point, NAMA has accumulated a considerable profit and is it not time to review the direction of NAMA?  Is there any advantage at this point, with property prices rising, for NAMA to concentrate on the disposal of property?  Members have been discussing, in this committee room, some of the large portfolios that recently have been disposed of by NAMA.  Is it not time to have a review of NAMA's remit and to focus NAMA as an investment vehicle for precisely those activities, namely, the 20,000 new housing units and the SDZ in the docklands?  The latter is to create 23,000 jobs and NAMA is investing money in it.

I should point out NAMA owes &euro;8 billion that is guaranteed by the Government and which Moody's finally has agreed is no longer a serious threat to the Government.  However, were we to change the strategy and state the agency no longer was obliged to pay back the aforementioned &euro;8 billion, it would not take long for the rating agencies to start saying the Government was responsible for this debt.  What we must get and what we have asked of NAMA under the section 227 review we have completed is that balance between long-term investment where it is needed because there is a disruption in the market, as provided for in the NAMA Act, and the payback of debt at a point to stop this debt being a millstone around the country's neck and damaging growth in the country.

The eventual agreement was that we would have two &euro;250 million funds.  In the event, a number of things happened.  First, I do not think the problems, although they were significant, and very significant in some individual credit unions, throughout the movement were quite as bad as had been estimated.

The credit union movement is renewing itself and has a huge contribution to make.

They are rebuilding their organisation and different branch structures and so on but the regulation that is beginning to have an impact on them is having a negative effect on those who borrow, particularly those on the edge between the moneylender and the credit union.  The amount of red tape people have to jump through to get a loan from a credit union is so significant now that it is almost creating an inflexibility within credit unions to deal with loans applications that come before them that can be paid back but which, for some reason or other, regulation is preventing that from happening.  The credit unions that I have met have a case.  We can over-regulate and over-complicate a sector that has done so much good for the country and for those members it represents.  Given the fact that the credit unions have &euro;7 billion to &euro;9 billion in the banks and are ready to activate it in terms of house construction or loans to small and medium businesses, and I am talking about those single employers or family employers at that level within the small and medium enterprise sector, the Department should be proactive in ensuring that money is released into the economy to a sector that is finding it difficult to borrow.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015120300002#T01400","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1449136800,"counter":435,"content":"<p>We would certainly encourage the credit union movement to develop appropriate extra loans, whether it is in the microfinance area or whatever.

If the money collected within a business was being spent incorrectly, the head of the department responsible would soon be brought in.  It would be pointed out to him or her that he or she was given X and he or she had spent part of it unwisely and must account for that.  For example, &euro;13.5 billion is allocated to the HSE and it does not have a single financial system going back to the dissolution of the health boards and the foundation of the executive, which is incredible.

The thought has just crossed my mind that we should have, and I must recommend it to whoever chairs this committee in the next session, that both Departments, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Finance, should be brought in together to discuss an overview of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report each year so that we can get a handle on it.  I do not accept that the current situation should continue whereby the Department of Finance gives money to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform or other Departments.  I won't say that the Department of Finance is not concerned because I know that it has expressed concern about how moneys are spent.  Taxpayers and struggling businesses, in particular, would like to see greater accountability and a greater sense from each Department that they clearly understand that the taxes collected by Revenue are perhaps not being spent with the same diligence and care that Revenue applies to their collection.  That is my view, having been Chairman of this committee for the past number of years and from my experience of being a member of the committee some years ago.  Someone has to bridge that gap.<\/p> <p>  I suggest to Mr. McCarthy that when the Comptroller and Auditor General's report is published every year there should be an effort made to hold a joint session with both Departments to bridge the collection and spending of taxes with what is found in the Comptroller and Auditor General's account.  We deal with the matter here every year but it is never fully exposed or debated in Parliament.  That is where it should be debated, in a general sense, so that we get a handle on transparency, accountability and having proper systems.<\/p><p>It might have ensured that with the appropriate reporting systems within the HSE the one financial system would have been in place a lot sooner.

The committee will be aware that the Supplementary Estimate is for &euro;15 million and relates, in the main, to meeting increased costs arising under the operational remit of Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, in the areas of sleepover payments and private residential care.<\/p> <p>  An industrial relations settlement relating to twilight hours, or sleepover payments, was not provided for in 2015 as no agreement had been reached at the time of making 2015 allocations.  The cost pressures experienced in the areas of private residential care and private foster care payments are driven by factors in demographics such as an increase in the numbers of children in care due to the fact that children are staying in care longer overall and the complexity of the challenges facing the children coming into these care placements.  Savings targeted for 2015 will not be achieved owing to the need to protect, in so far as possible, front line service delivery.  There are also legal cost pressures which continue to arise.  In the main, these pressures relate to increasing GAL costs and third party costs over which Tusla has no control but which are paid through it.<\/p> <p>  It will be possible this year to offset some of the required additionality in these areas from savings in other areas of the Tusla subhead, including payroll and capital.  The remaining portion of the required Supplementary Estimate is of a technical nature in which the reduced intake of receipts into the Department's Vote is to be offset against a corresponding reduction in expenditure on subhead B8 relating to the intervention programme for children.<\/p> <p>  The request for a Supplementary Estimate for Tusla for 2015 must be seen in the context of the favourable budget outcome for 2016.  As a result of this budgetary outcome, I have been able to allocate significant additional resources to Tusla next year.  I thank my Government colleagues for that too.  The case I made to Government colleagues around this funding was predicated on the management of risk.  This became most apparent in the area of unallocated cases with which members will be very familiar.  What followed was the preparation by Tusla of a business case for investment in children and family services.  This document, Survival to Sustainability, set out the many challenges being faced.  It detailed and quantified the additional resources which will be required over the coming years to address these matters.  It was also clear from both the business case and discussions between Tusla and officials from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs that some of these pressures are being felt in the current year.  This is a contributory factor to the need for this Supplementary Estimate.<\/p> <p>  My appearance today also provides me with a valuable opportunity to briefly reflect on the progress made to date by Tusla since its establishment at the start of 2014.  The agency was established to provide a one-stop-shop for children, by bringing together key services for children from the HSE children and family services, the National Education and Welfare Board, the Family Support Agency and a number of other services, including psychological services and domestic and sexual violence support services.  The establishment of Tusla was a key priority for the Government.<\/p> <p>  The intervening two years has seen Tusla make good progress in the reform and delivery of services to vulnerable children and families at a time of particular budgetary restraint.  In this regard, the committee will be particularly conscious of the issues highlighted by the agency itself and by HIQA that arose in some parts of the country, including counties Laois, Offaly, Louth and Meath.  Tusla has worked intensively to address these matters, both in dealing with the areas of immediate concern and by putting in place special measures to support good practice in the future.<\/p> <p>  The committee will also be aware that for some time, I have been very concerned about the number of cases awaiting a dedicated social work service.  I know this has been a serious concern for the committee also.  At my request, Tusla carried out an audit of these cases which formed an important part of my Estimates bid for 2016.  Action on this area, grounded in a significant and challenging recruitment programme, together with work on developing caseload management, standard business practices and a quality assurance strategy will help Tusla address the demands on the service to enable it to meet the needs of all vulnerable children in the right way, at the right time.<\/p> <p>  In accordance with legislative requirements, Tusla has developed its first three year corporate plan for 2015-17 in response to my Department&rsquo;s performance framework.  The plan includes the agency&rsquo;s key objectives, outputs and related strategies and sets out the agency&rsquo;s medium-term strategy for service delivery and reform.  This corporate plan underpins the agency&rsquo;s annual business plan, which is prepared in response to my annual performance statement.  I issued the performance statement for 2016 to the agency last month and the 2016 business plan is currently being prepared by Tusla in response.<\/p> <p>  The next step for the Child and Family Agency in its start-up phase, having gained a clear understanding of where gaps and solutions lie, is to commence implementing new structures to better resource and to drive service delivery and reform.  Every child who is the subject of a child protection or welfare concern is entitled to expect a timely response.<\/p> <p>  Through 2014 and 2015 Tusla has continued to develop its services and to address a number of key concerns regarding child welfare and protection services.  As Minister, I am fully supportive of the agency&rsquo;s implementation of a wide-ranging programme in this area.  The increased funding available to Tusla in 2016 will allow it to build on these initiatives and the further necessary reform of services will continue to be a high priority.  There is more work to do and Tusla would be the first to say so.  However, it is important to say that in its annual overview earlier in 2015, HIQA noted evidence of improving services and good practice in children&rsquo;s social care in many regions.  It is now important that we all build on the progress to date to further improve service delivery to children and families.<\/p> <p>  I seek the select sub-committee&rsquo;s approval for the Supplementary Estimate, Vote 40, and in doing so, I will be happy to hear any comments and to take questions from members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE22015120300002#C00300","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1449135000,"counter":570,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

No one would dare to argue with an increase in funding to Tusla as it is very much-needed.  Members across the political divide would acknowledge that the agency has struggled to keep up with everything we would like to see it address.  Last year alone, Mr. Gordon Jeyes, the CEO of Tusla, called for &euro;18 million extra just to keep up with the shortfall in social workers.  We have seen a 17% cut to domestic violence services since 2012 while counselling services were cut by 47%.  There has been a 5% cut year on year to the school completion programme and the family resource centres.<\/p><p>Many of the good schemes dealing with prevention and early intervention have not been able to fulfil their obligations and are becoming reactionary and are only getting involved when a problem manifests itself and it becomes abundantly clear State intervention is needed.  That is not what any of us want to see the agency dealing with.  We want to see the agency intervening at an early stage to prevent many problems from manifesting themselves.  While I welcome the extra &euro;15 million, I have grave reservations that it is not enough.<\/p><p> The Minister referred to the recovering economy, which is true and needs to be acknowledged.  However, when one heard of huge increases in revenue returns announced this week, one wonders whether the Minister is selling the agency short by only looking for a &euro;15 million increase.  Mr. Gordon Jeyes is on record as saying that &euro;18 million is needed just to keep pace with the shortfall in social workers alone.  We are not even keeping pace with what Mr. Jeyes said he requires.<\/p><p> A bugbear of mine, which I have repeatedly highlighted, is the amount of money being spent, from limited resources, on legal fees.  Previously, the Minister criticised my party and the fact the GAL system was introduced.  It is legacy issue.  However, this Government has been in office for five years.  At a time of such limited resources, we are spending large amounts of money on an unregulated service.  I am aware the Minister published a draft document in the past four to five weeks on regulating the service.  Will the Minister indicate how much his Department has spent on legal fees, in terms of the administration of the GAL system, over the past four years?  The huge amount of money being spent on legal fees is questionable at a time when people are waiting months to have a social worker assigned to them and when thousands of cases are not being treated with the urgency they warrant.  Will the Minister outline exactly how much has been spent on legal fees in the past four years?<\/p><p> I turn to the other cost pressures.  The Minister spoke about private residential care and private foster care payments and the demographic factors driving these increases.  The Minister said more children are in care for longer periods of time.  Last year, Dr. Niall Muldoon, the Ombudsman for Children, identified the huge delay in assessing children who are vulnerable.  Does the Minister believe this increase in funding is sufficient given the backlog of cases that have yet to be assessed and the potential for a further increase in the number of children who may need to go into foster care or residential care?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE22015120300002#C00500","speaker":"1065","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1449135000,"counter":573,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and his officials for being here and thank the Minister for his presentation.  I have a small criticism.  I would like to get the notes and documentation a little bit earlier so that I would have more time to prepare.  Sometimes the supporting documentation comes in late and it could be late in the evening before we get a chance to look over it.<\/p> <p>  The &euro;15 million is a minimal amount in the overall spend but it does not come as a surprise because it has been well highlighted that Tusla is underfunded.  I acknowledge the Minister has allocated extra funds next year but when one takes into consideration all the different agencies under the umbrella of Tusla, when the money is divvied out, it means very tight budgets for many of these agencies and it is hard to stay within these budgets.  A Supplementary Estimate has been brought forward this year but we cannot bring one forward next year.  If there is an overspend next year, it will be a cause for concern.<\/p> <p>  The Minister said savings targets for 2015 would not be achieved owing to the need to protect, in so far as possible, front line service delivery.  That is a bit strange because the State would have had to provide resources to protect the children anyway, so it is just stating the obvious.  No provision was made for the industrial relations settlement on twilight hours.  Should the Minister not have made a provision, such as a contingency fund, to cover this?  Is this something that came out of the blue for which his Department was not prepared?<\/p> <p>  Tusla's main focus should always be to provide the best care possible in an efficient manner, something on which everybody agrees.  Will the Minister indicate, in the context of spending breakdown, how much funding is allocated to each measure he has put forward?  My other queries were covered by Deputy Troy, so I will leave it at that for now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE22015120300002#D00200","speaker":"981"},{"type":"speech","time":1449135000,"counter":574,"content":"<p>Does Deputy Byrne have a question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE22015120300002#D00300","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1449135000,"counter":575,"content":"<p>No.  I want to hear the Minister's reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE22015120300002#D00400","speaker":"1029"},{"type":"speech","time":1449135000,"counter":576,"content":"<p>We all agree this is a new agency and it is only a couple of years since its establishment.  Clearly, finding the level of funding it requires, and predicting the funding it requires, is more an art than a science for the first couple of years.  I believe we have a handle on it now.  I am pleased the agency was able to conduct the audit of unallocated places I requested of it and to produce and price a business plan.  It is a realistic business plan as it is based on a three-year approach.  People will complain that three years is a long time but this is an issue which has bedevilled successive Governments over many decades.  To finally get a handle on it, to have a plan to deal with it and to be in a position to provide the agency with the money it requested for the first year of that plan, because of our recovering economy, is to be welcomed.  I acknowledge Tusla's efforts in this regard; it has done a very good job.  We have given the money and I met with the board in recent days.  I have made it very clear that it is now up to the agency.  I have every confidence in the agency to deliver.  It has done a very good job to date.<\/p> <p>  The agency faces serious challenges.  It must recruit many staff but due to the recovering economy, there is competition for talent, for social workers and others.  The Department has supported the agency as far as it can with resources but now it is over to it.<\/p> <p>  We are here to debate the Supplementary Estimate and we will have an opportunity next week to debate the broader business plan and services, etc., more fully.  The funding announced for 2016 is very close to what was sought by Tusla, the spending of which represents a major challenge for it.  We have given it sufficient money and today is about the Supplementary Estimate.  Tusla, not unlike the HSE, is a demand-led service.  We cannot predict how many children will need to go into care.  We cannot predict what issues will arise and many of the events which occur in our society are beyond the control of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.<\/p><p>We seek to protect our children and I think we are all committed to that.  I thank the members of the committee for their commitment to that.  We all want to support the Department and Tusla in achieving the best outcomes for our children.  I thank members for their comments.  I do not know that it is particularly useful to over analyse what has happened but let us be clear I concur with Deputy Troy's concern about legal fees.  My Department is developing policy around this issue.  We are looking at best practice in the North of Ireland and elsewhere and it is an issue that does consume us because nobody wants to see money that has been allocated by the taxpayer for the care of children going into the hands of the legal profession, no disrespect to them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE22015120300002#D00500","speaker":"952","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1449135000,"counter":578,"content":"<p>I concur with what the Minister has said and I am conscious that next week we have another opportunity at the quarterly meeting to go into the general scheme of things for next year.  I acknowledge it is a new agency but many of the schemes run by the agency are not new.  For example, the school completion programme, family resource centres, domestic services and the counselling services have been in operation for many years and have proven their worth but have had their funding drastically cut in recent years.  There is nothing in the Supplementary Estimate to restore any of those cuts.  The Minister said nobody can predict what will happen or how many children will come into care at any particular time and there is an element of truth in that but one also has the benefit of previous years of knowing the number of children on average who have come into care in the past ten decades.  He will be aware there has been an increase in the number of referrals because people are much more vigilant than in the past, as a consequence of the awful inquiries we had to conduct into our shameful past on how we treated children.  As a result there are more children who need more intervention and a greater level of support.  We should be able to budget for that but, unfortunately, we have not been doing so.<\/p> <p>  It is not good enough for the Minister in his position as head of the Department to brush over and say that he concurs with my sentiments in respect of the legal costs because he is in a position to do something about it.  I produced legislation 12 months ago in terms of how we might look at regulating this industry based on looking at best practice in other jurisdictions.  I am sure it is easy for the Minister or any of his officials to put a finger on this - how much did we spend on legal fees in the past four and half years at a time when we were cutting family resource centres, counselling services and domestic services?  It is not good enough, after four and half years, to say we are working on the issue and will address it.  In my opinion, the savage downturn in the economy actually gave an opportunity to look at look at where there was waste.  Nobody wanted to see it but there was an opportunity to look at the waste and reprioritise the areas to which funding was being allocated.  In a Department which is so critical in terms of the protection and welfare of our children and so many services in the community that it supports, legal fees would not have been high on the agenda.  One of my first priorities would have been to rein them in and ensure the money was best spent on front line services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE22015120300002#E00200","speaker":"1065"},{"type":"speech","time":1449135000,"counter":579,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Byrne.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE22015120300002#E00300","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1449135000,"counter":580,"content":"<p>I am sorry I did not come in earlier, I was waiting to hear what the Minister had to say.

Tusla has made a huge impact in communities in guiding groups as to how they should and should not function.  If one was to take everything into account, we are in a different space than five or six years ago.  When the previous Government was in office there was a huge duplication of services and money was being poured out to beat the band in communities.  In my own community, I am aware of the amount of money that was paid to different groups and agencies, family resources centres and so on.  It is not all about money, it is about the quality of the service who run it.  Money is important but it is not the be all and end all of everything.  It does not make running a family resource centre or any other agency better.  What makes it better is that it is run properly and that the people in charge are capable of running it.  I can only speak about my community.  In the past money was poured into every agency, every community group and every family resource centre.  Some of it did not make a damn difference because there was a duplication of services.  In fairness to the Department and Tusla, things are starting to show a better picture of how things should be managed.  This is what this is about, it is not about pouring money into services.  It is about managing what one has and being able to distribute it properly and use it with better standards than have been used  previously.  I welcome the funding that is being allocated - whether it is will become known in time.  I am very happy that Tusla has a plan for the next three years and maybe in that time it will have the opportunity to establish what services really work.  There are services out there that are not working, they are a shambles and we need to look at them, parish by parish, at this stage.  There are groups who say they are doing X, Y and Z when I know in my heart and soul they are not doing X, Y and Z.  I welcome the increase in the funding but it is rich of anybody who was a member of the then Government to criticise it given that when there was huge money in this country it continued to pour it in and took no responsibility for the way that money was used in communities.  That is the sad reflection of where we are today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE22015120300002#E00800","speaker":"1029"},{"type":"speech","time":1449135000,"counter":585,"content":"<p>I call Deputy McLellan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE22015120300002#E00900","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1449135000,"counter":586,"content":"<p>While I agree with Deputy Bryne that quality is extremely important, money is also important.

There were no further developments in 2015 and the dispute is ongoing.

The Department must verify that any outstanding issues have been completed and signed off before a retention claim can be paid.  It is expected that these claims will be paid during 2016, provided the necessary works have been completed.  The funding of these claims will be required for this project in 2016.<\/p> <p>  The management services entity, MSE, process relates to costs associated with the requirement for technical expertise to assist in the management of the MSE project, including technical audits of the MANs.  A decision on whether to use internal or external expertise for these services is being considered.  Depending on the outcome, a tender process will be conducted for the services, if required.

I followed up on the matter and was told that broadband in these two towns should be upgraded by this Christmas.  That has not happened and we will be lucky if it happens next year.

I agree with the Deputy that when undertakings are given and plans laid out, it is unsatisfactory if they are not completed within the timescale indicated.  As he is aware, what we have done is map the country between the commercial sector and where there has been State intervention and the test in the case of the commercial sector is whether it will be provided by 2016.  This concerns the national broadband plan in general.  We have carefully examined and scrutinised everything sent to us by the private operators which have stated they will do certain things.  We look into, examine and scrutinise their plans and come to a conclusion on whether the works they state they will undertake will, in fact, be completed by the end of 2016.  That is the basis on which we determine the State's intervention and what reasonably can be concluded as being in the private sector.  It must be remembered that this process concerns the private sector.  Those involved are private operators and we do not have the power to direct them.  However, we have the power to scrutinise what they state to us and not take everything we are told at face value.  We look into what they tell us as best we can and try to ensure the State's intervention is accurate and that the blue part of the map covered by the commercial sector is also accurate.
