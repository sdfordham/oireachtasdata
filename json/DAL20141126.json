Sweden's recent decision to recognise Palestine has brought the issue to the fore within the European Union.  In a number of member states, including Ireland, there have been strong parliamentary expressions of support for recognition, in most cases as an element of an overall solution.  The Foreign Affairs Council, which I attended in Brussels last week, began a discussion among EU partners about the question of recognition.  This discussion will continue over time.  Clearly, if there is no prospect of substantive peace talks resuming in the near future, we will need to take close account of this in evaluating how we can advance our overall goal.<\/p><p> Our position is not set in stone.  Against the background of a deteriorating situation on the ground, I will continue to consider any option, including early recognition of Palestine, which may advance the prospects for peace and help ensure the two state solution still has a chance of being realised.<\/p><p> As Deputies will agree, the question of international recognition of Palestine, while important, is not by any means a magic wand to resolve the conflict.  More than 130 countries have formally recognised Palestine but the conflict continues.  Only a comprehensive peace agreement will end the occupation and allow the full establishment of a Palestinian state in reality as well as in theory.

These requirements have been met by the Socialist Party of Nigeria but none the less the registration has not been allowed.  It is illustrative that the registration was not, formally speaking, rejected because the deadline for rejection of the initial application had passed.

The elite of Nigeria hold massive wealth.  It was recently suggested that the President has personal wealth of $100 million and is the sixth richest leader in Africa.  Multinational corporations, particularly oil companies such as Shell, are making profits from Nigeria of up to $8 billion despite being implicated in human rights abuses such as the hanging of Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other Ogoni activists.  Side by side with massive poverty, three quarters of Nigeria's population is under 25, 68 million of its young adults are without work and more than half its population is living below the international poverty line of $1.25 a day.

The amendment relates to the single person child care tax credit, which replaced the one parent family tax credit last year.  As a result of the change in last year's budget, some parents were out of pocket to the tune of &euro;2,500 - &euro;1,650 by virtue of the loss of the credit and a further &euro;800 by virtue of the loss of the additional band at the lower rate.  The essence of this amendment is to allow the primary carer, who does not have a sufficient taxation liability to absorb the tax credit in full, to transfer any unused portion of the tax credit to a qualifying secondary carer.<\/p><p>  As I said last night, the principle of there being only one tax credit in respect of the child is honoured, because that was the fundamental shift the Minister made last year, but this recognises the reality that when many relationships break up, there is the primary carer and the secondary carer, who also plays a very important role in the upbringing of the child, who pays maintenance payments in the vast majority of cases and who is heavily involved in the day-to-day upbringing of the child and deserves recognition for that role.  It is a very modest proposal and might present some technical difficulties for the Revenue but if the will was there, it would be possible to implement this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600011#J00300","speaker":"993"},{"type":"speech","time":1416999000,"counter":107,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy McGrath for his contribution.  Although I was not here last night, I watched this debate, which was quite constructive in regard to this important matter.  The Minister for Finance wants to thank Deputies Michael McGrath, Doherty and Donnelly for their contributions and clarifications on this issue during the debate last night.<\/p><p> The amendment appears to envisage a number of changes to the current system.  The first is that entitlement of the secondary claimant would be linked to compliance with the court maintenance order, the second is that a parent will have some preference over the possible secondary claimant, such as a grandparent, and the third is that part of the credit rather than the whole credit could be transferred.  It is not clear in the amendment whether the Deputy envisages that the current requirement that the child reside with the secondary claimant for at least 100 days of the year would continue.  <\/p><p>  Linking the transfer of the credit, or part of the credit, to parentage or court-ordered maintenance payments could raise constitutional concerns.  From a practical point of view, it is difficult to see how it would be administered.  Disputes about whether maintenance was paid or not would then give rise to disputes about whether the credit tax was due or not.  As I said, it is not clear whether the Deputy sees his amendment as giving a parent with whom a child resides for only a minimal period of the year preference over say a grandparent with whom a child resides for more than 100 days of the year.  <\/p><p>  While the Minister does not propose to accept the amendment at this time, he will on foot of last night's debate ask his officials to seek the advice of the Attorney General's office on this matter.  As regards relinquishing a portion of the credit, the Minister will instruct his officials to work with the Revenue Commissioners to investigate the administrative, operational and data protection issues involved.  It is worth noting that the relinquishment of a portion of the credit is likely to give rise to significant difficulties in some situations - for example, where the primary claimant has children with more than one partner.  There is also likely to be budgetary implications which will have to be considered but we get the thrust of what Deputy McGrath is trying to achieve in the amendment.  The Minister has outlined the difficulties and the unanswered questions he sees and has asked his officials to engage with the Attorney General's office on this matter.  Once that is done, the Minister will consider the matter further.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600011#J00400","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"speech","time":1416999000,"counter":108,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply, which was reasonably positive and I accept it in good faith.  As he will know, under the existing arrangements, it is possible in certain circumstances for the primary carer to transfer the credit in full to the secondary carer.  That would arise if, for example, the primary carer does not have any employment income and has no use for the tax credit as such.  The transfer of the full credit requires the consent of the primary carer.  That can create difficulties on occasion.

We had an extensive discussion about this on Committee Stage.  Amendment No. 7 proposes that an annual report be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas showing the number of people who have availed of SARP, the number of additional jobs created and the tax foregone as a result of SARP.  I tried to provide some relevant information on Committee Stage and it would be useful to repeat it.  Some 12 employees claimed SARP for the 2012 tax year and the amount of tax foregone in that year was &euro;111,722.  According to the information provided to Revenue by employers in the employer annual return, five jobs were created in 2012 as a result of SARP and a further five jobs were retained.<\/p><p>  In regard to 2013, as I outlined on Committee Stage and as the Deputy knows, the deadline for filing the self-assessed tax returns has just passed and as those figures have not yet been fully processed, I am only in a position to provide the House with provisional figures for 2013 at this time.  The provisional information to date indicates that 36 employees availed of the incentive in that year and that the tax foregone was approximately &euro;300,000.  However, I emphasise that this is not a definitive figure, pending the full processing of the self-assessment returns for 2013.  According to employer returns, an additional 25 jobs were created in 2013 as a result of SARP and four jobs were retained.  <\/p><p>  I can assure the Deputy that the Minister for Finance and I want to ensure the relief is effective in terms of achieving its objective of attracting key executives and decision-makers to Ireland and with them foreign direct investment.  For that reason, in this year's Bill, the Minister for Finance has increased the information which employers are required to provide to Revenue to include matters such as the job title of the SARP employees, a description of the roles carried out by these employees and details of the countries in which these employees worked prior to their arrival in the State.<\/p><p>The purpose of requesting such information is to ensure that the relief can be properly evaluated when it is due to be reviewed again in 2017.

If it is so easy to compile such a report why is the Government opposed to such a measure?  I attempted to oppose this section but was ruled out of order because of the stringent rules placed on the Opposition in respect of money Bills.  The Government is increasing the threshold under which one can apply for SARP.  It was not enough to cover those employees who earn half a million euro but the Government has removed that threshold and made it limitless so people who earn millions of euro will be able to avail of this scheme which deducts 30% of an individual's income, excluding the first &euro;75,000, for tax purposes.  It is a significant benefit for those individuals.<\/p><p>  I have always acknowledged the need to take risks in finance Bills, particularly where they can create employment and spur on secondary benefits for tax take and so forth but they need to be based on evidence and I have not been presented with any evidence to say this is required to remove the threshold from &euro;500,000 up to &euro;1.5 million or &euro;2 million or whatever because there are no limits.  When the Government brought in this controversial measure I questioned the T&aacute;naiste, who stood where the Minister of State now stands, and she said that each person who avails of SARP will be required to create 50 jobs.  It was budgeted for 100 persons to avail of this scheme but the figure is approximately a quarter of that and those jobs have not been created.  Not even ten have been created for each person.  The number is closer to one.  This was intended to create employment but it obviously has not done so.  That is why a very transparent report should be laid before the House which deals with the tax foregone, the number of jobs created and the number of people who avail of SARP.  I say that irrespective of my opposition to what the Government is doing on the threshold because there is no evidence to support such a move now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600012#K00200","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speech","time":1416999600,"counter":115,"content":"<p>It may not sit very comfortably with us as a people but in reality the countries we compete with for inward investment use tools such as SARP.

It would save us all tabling a lot of parliamentary questions if an annual report was given to us because the measure of SARP is whether it delivers additional employment.<\/p><p>  I support the principle of attracting the top executives into Ireland because inevitably jobs and investment will follow.

I support the scheme.<\/p><p>  The idea of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection announcing that one exemption under SARP would create 50 jobs is ludicrous.  I do not know how that statement could have been made.  The point of the programme is not just to attract new investment to Ireland but also to maintain investment here.  We are doing our level best as a nation to compete with the rest of the world.<\/p><p>  Deputy Pearse Doherty has tried, somewhat unsuccessfully, to create a narrative around closing off tax incentives for Ireland which attract multinational investment in this country.  That is flawed and wrong because one small country alone cannot clean up a globally dysfunctional tax system.  This seems to be another backhanded attempt to disadvantage Ireland in competing on taxation with other countries, and particularly with London, our biggest competitor for attracting financial services and other multinational industries and sectors.  I can understand the logic of the amendment seeking transparency but I cannot understand the logic which states that we should not put in place tax arrangements that attract the top executives from around the world whose companies will not come here if they refuse to come here.  If they decide they do not want to stay their companies will also leave because we do not have the talent on our own to sustain and maintain these companies.  We have to attract talent from other regions.

I have stated before that I oppose the increase in the threshold.  People who come from different political ideologies have found a voice now that they are on the other side of the House but when the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection claimed that people availing of SARP would create 50 jobs those individuals were very silent.  I make no apology for bringing forward amendments to close loopholes which the Government has accepted today.  We will deal with them later, in respect of the \"double Irish\" and tax resident companies that are not tax resident anywhere on the globe.  In response to the accusations levelled against me and my party that we are trying to close down incentives for people to take up employment here, that is wrong.<\/p><p> There is no opposition to the extension of research and development reliefs or to many of the other provisions that are in this Finance Bill, or indeed other Finance Bills I have debated in this House on behalf of my party in the years since I was elected to this Chamber.  Where bad tax practices like the double Irish system exist, and where companies are allowed to be incorporated here without having any tax residency anywhere in the world, Sinn F&eacute;in will stand up to say that such loopholes are wrong and to make proposals to close them.<\/p><p> This amendment relates to a tax relief that applies to a small number of individuals.  The statistics show that the individuals who benefit from the relief have not created substantial numbers of jobs in the Irish economy as a result of that relief.  It is important to put this in context.  Those who were absolutely hammered by the austerity that was imposed by this Government, its predecessor and current Opposition Deputies who were previously supportive of this Government are still suffering.  The special assignee relief programme allows individuals to have over &euro;125,000 of their income not declared for tax purposes.  People can allow themselves to have 30% of &euro;425,000 of their earnings excluded for income tax purposes.  I refer to what has been the 41% rate of tax and will now be the 40% rate.<\/p><p> The big problem is that the Minister is introducing a measure in this area without any evidence to back it up.  I am surprised that the so-called Reform Alliance is disputing the idea that we should have evidence when we are debating a proposal to extend a provision that allows people to set aside &euro;125,000 of their incomes for the purposes of direct taxation to a limitless number by allowing them to set aside 30% of incomes of &euro;1.5 million for tax purposes.  That is what is being put before us today.  It is right and proper that these issues should be challenged.  It is fit and proper to demand from the Government the evidence that suggests that a handful of individuals will be able to benefit from having tens of thousands of euro of their incomes exempted from the 40% or 41% rate of direct taxation.  I accept that it will be subject to PRSI and the universal social charge.  The answers we are looking for in this regard have not been given on Committee and Report Stages.<\/p><p> I assume the Minister of State will say that this is being done on the word of IDA Ireland.  I remind him that 150,000 people recently took to the streets of towns and villages across this State with a simple message, which was that water charges should be scrapped.  Many tens of thousands of people will take to the streets on 10 December.  I am sure hundreds of people will take to the street in my own parish of Gaoth Dobhair on Saturday.  Their voices do not find an echo in the corridors of power.  By contrast, the handful of individuals who are able to have massive amounts of money written off their tax bills seem to have no problem getting their voices heard in Government Buildings and in the corridors of power.  It is about time that the Government started to provide evidence of why such a measure should be extended to a limitless income figure.  The Government should start to listen not just to the few, but to the many.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600012#K00600","speaker":"959","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1417000200,"counter":120,"content":"<p>Is the amendment agreed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600013#L00200","speaker":"1065"},{"type":"speech","time":1417000200,"counter":121,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600013#L00300","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speech","time":1417000200,"counter":122,"content":"<p>Do I not get an opportunity to respond?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600013#L00400","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"speech","time":1417000200,"counter":123,"content":"<p>The Minister of State has spoken twice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600013#L00500","speaker":"1065"},{"type":"speech","time":1417000200,"counter":124,"content":"<p>So I cannot respond.

I will not even go down the road of getting into the water debate.  I do not agree with Deputy Pearse Doherty on it.  I will stick to the amendment.  We heard people clearly and we have tried to respond to people's concerns while recognising that we have to invest in water.<\/p><p>  I do not accept the concept that there is &quot;tax forgone&quot;, although it is a wording that I used on Committee Stage.  The whole idea is that this relates to tax that would not otherwise have been paid in this country.  If new people come to this country, they will bring their incomes here.  The Deputy raised the question of their income levels.  Their income is not paid by the State.  Their income levels are not much to the Deputy or to me.  They are being paid privately through business.  I will give an example.  Someone who is on &euro;500,000 is paying approximately &euro;177,000, even under the enhanced special assignee relief programme, in taxes that we would not normally get into the State.  This is tax that we would not otherwise be getting.  I would argue that we are bringing in decision-makers with the capability of creating employment here.  The Deputy is right when he says the numbers have not been massive.  According to Revenue's provisional figures for 2013, there are 29 people in employment who would not otherwise be in employment without this programme.<\/p><p>  When I suggested that some people are trying to throw out all of these initiatives, I was not referring to Deputy Pearse Doherty.  I was alluding to amendment No. 8, which has been ruled out of order.  The Socialist Party tabled that amendment because it wants to scrap the scheme entirely without having any interaction as we have had in this case.  I think I have outlined clearly why we are in favour of this scheme.  I will conclude by commenting on the idea that this was done on the basis of a kind of hunch, or just for the sake of it.  A full review of the special assignee relief programme has been carried out and published on the website of the Department of Finance.  A number of these schemes have been subjected to significant review.  The Deputy is right when he says we listen to organisations like IDA Ireland, which is selling Ireland every day.  I think it is worth taking a chance on this.  I do not think there is any downside to the country.  I think we can get extra tax revenue by locating people here.

We had a good discussion on this issue on Committee Stage.  As regards amendment No. 10, section 18(2)(<i>b<\/i>) of the Bill amends the approved minimum retirement fund provisions in the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  This change will allow the beneficial owner of an approved minimum retirement fund to draw down up to 4% of the value of the assets in the fund each year.  Before now, the capital invested in the fund - a maximum of &euro;63,500 - was in effect locked in, generally speaking, until the owner reached the age of 75 and only the income, profits or gains arising from the fund could be drawn down.  The purpose of amendment No. 10 is to put it beyond any doubt that the option to draw down up to 4% of the approved minimum retirement fund assets can be exercised by the beneficial owner of the fund on one occasion only in a tax year.  The intention of the provision to which this amendment is adding clarity has already been agreed on Committee Stage.<br\/><br\/>Amendment No. 11 corrects a minor drafting error in section 18(4), which deals with the maximum tax relievable pension fund at retirement, known as the standard fund threshold, and its interaction with pension adjustment orders.  Amendment No. 12 relates to section 18(5)(<i>b<\/i>) of the Bill, which inserts a new section 790E into Chapter 4 of Part 30 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  The new section is part of the pensions-related anti-avoidance provisions included in the Bill this year.  It provides that any investment returns to certain pension arrangements linked to the avoidance scheme in question will be subject to income tax in the hands of the trustees or administrators of the arrangement.  The amendment I am now making is a minor technical one to correct a section referencing error in the Bill.  The Bill, as published, included a reference to &quot;section 784(A)&quot; where the reference should have been to &ldquo;section 784A&rdquo;.  In other words, the brackets in the original text should not be there.  These three technical amendments will carry out the provisions we approved on Committee Stage.  I commend them to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600013#L01500","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1417000200,"counter":134,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1417000200,"counter":135,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 11:<blockquote>In page 39, line 28, to delete &quot;is&quot; and substitute &quot;are&quot;.<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600013#L01700","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1417000200,"counter":136,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1417000200,"counter":137,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 12:<blockquote>In page 43, line 39, to delete &quot;section 784(A)&quot; and substitute &quot;section 784A&quot;.<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600013#L01900","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1417000200,"counter":138,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1417000200,"counter":139,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 13, 15 and 16, in the name of Deputy Donnelly, cannot be moved as the Deputy is not present.

My amendment asks the Minister to lay before the House within six months a report on the effect of the deletion of paragraph (c) in section 372AAC of the principal Act.  Under that paragraph, the living city initiative tax relief can be availed of where the basements, ground floors or upper floors of two-storey houses are refurbished.  This condition was included in the original legislation to ensure that the living part of the living city initiative was fulfilled.<br\/><br\/>Three years into the scheme, it is still not up and running.  As a result of EU state aid approval, we are probably at the finish line.  The scheme has been transformed.  Originally, it was envisaged for Georgian houses.  Subsequently, a &quot;relevant house&quot; was stipulated as one that had two storeys, with or without a basement.  Today, the Finance Bill is moving us into a position where a &quot;relevant house&quot; does not need to be a two-storey house, with or without a basement.  Any pre-1915 house within an area designated by a local authority could qualify.  The new definition of &quot;relevant house&quot; will allow for single-storey dwellings to be converted in this way.<br\/><br\/>The Government has argued that if the ground floors of such houses are developed for commercial use, which was always the intention in the original legislation, one cannot necessarily ask the owner to refurbish the living parts as well, as commercial bungalows would not have living parts.  That is a relevant argument.  However, it is a far cry from the original intention, namely, to get people living and businesses operating in city centres again.  There was always a dual purpose to the initiative.<br\/><br\/>I am not opposed to an extension of the scheme to other pre-1915 dwellings, including two-storey houses and bungalows.  Even if this was done there would be no argument for deleting paragraph (c).  That section could still take effect if bungalows were allowed into the scheme.  I will outline the impact of the deletion.  If one had a single-storey pre-1915 dwelling in a relevant area in, for example, Limerick or this city, one could develop it for commercial use and the money spent on it, up to a limit of &euro;400,000, could be clawed back over a ten-year period.  Many people would find this incentive appealing.  That is fine.  However, this legislation allows one to commercialise the ground floor or basement of a two-storey house without also requiring one to do anything with the upper floor.  That is wrong.  We should, at the minimum, live up to the ideas and aspirations contained in the living city initiative.  Let bungalows be commercially developed under the initiative.  That is not my argument.  I have strong views on it and am not convinced but I am always willing to take risks.  We know of the dilapidation in some of our town and city centres.  As such, let us consider this as an option.<br\/><br\/>However, where there is a two-storey house there is no reason to move from what was originally envisaged, namely, the commercialisation of the ground floor and basement with a requirement to refurbish the upper storey.  For this reason, we should not delete paragraph (c).  I oppose the removal of that condition.  Were I to oppose it in an amendment, however, it would be ruled out of order and I would not even be able to debate the issue.  Instead, I suggest that a report on the matter should at least be laid before the House.  My amendment refers to six months, but that timeframe is open to discussion.  Despite my opposition to the deletion of paragraph (c), we should at least consider its effect within an appropriate period.  For example, were the upper living quarters of those Georgian and other pre-1915 buildings reconstructed or was the commercial element the only focus?  Under this Bill, someone could benefit from the commercialisation of one part as well as the living part, but there is no longer any requirement to do both.  I would be interested in knowing whether a swathe of two-storey houses in the scheme only had their lower parts refurbished.  If so, it should be identified and the provision should be closed.  There is no reason to allow it in the first place.  The scheme has not been up and running, so we should allow it to run its course.  If we find that the current requirement becomes an issue, we could consider deleting paragraph (c), but I am not convinced on that front.  Deleting it now is a mistake.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600014#M00100","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speech","time":1417000800,"counter":142,"content":"<p>As the Minister of State knows, I support this initiative.

It was not my finest hour on Committee Stage.  I am willing to acknowledge that it was about as clear as mud by the end, as we got into a technical discussion, produced lofty books and tried to find relevant passages of legislation.  The opportunity to discuss the Bill on Report Stage is welcome.  I accept the Deputy's bona fides on this issue.  He has held his viewpoint consistently since the scheme's introduction.<\/p><p>  The Minister for Finance and I agree that the initiative's operation should be kept under regular review.  For this reason among others, he has decided to insert information gathering provisions in section 31.  It is his intention that all aspects of the scheme will be kept under review, not just the element relating to the deletion of paragraph (c).  The scheme would probably have to operate for at least a year before any useful information was obtained.  The Deputy has implied that the six-month period is open to discussion.  The scheme has been in place for two years, but we have not seen it operate while we have awaited EU state aid approval.  The passage of the Bill will be an important final piece of that jigsaw.<\/p><p>The Minister believes he already has put in place the information-gathering provisions and wants to get the scheme up and running to ascertain how it operates.  There already are mechanisms to gather information, the matter will be kept under review and he sees no reason to legislate specifically for this issue as per the Deputy's own amendment.<\/p><p> On a more general point, the Deputy has questioned a particular modification the Minister has introduced to this initiative.  The Deputy has argued that it severs the link between the living and the commercial elements of the initiative and has suggested this could do irreparable damage to the scheme and Deputy Michael McGrath implied something similar.  I believe the significance of the change being introduced in the Bill is being overstated somewhat and I welcome this opportunity to put the record straight.  The living city initiative, which will apply to special regeneration areas in the six cities, has two separate elements to it, namely, an owner-occupier residential relief and a commercial relief.  For the most part, these focus on different types of property.  The residential element originally applied only to a Georgian house of two or more stories but this subsequently was expanded to include pre-1915 houses of two or more stories in the Finance (No. 2) Act 2013.  In this year's Finance Bill, the Minister proposes to extend this further to all pre-1915 buildings that originally were built as dwellings.  The residential relief allows an individual to claim a deduction from total income for income tax purposes of qualifying expenditure on the dwelling that the claimant occupies as his or her only or main residence.  The commercial element of the relief is and always was envisaged to be completely separate and is given in the form of accelerated capital allowances.  This relief applies to all buildings in the special regeneration areas, not just the pre-1915 dwellings.  This includes buildings constructed in the past 100 years, whether as dwellings or as commercial premises, as well as pre-1915 buildings that had not been constructed as dwellings.  If a commercial operation was located inside the building, there was no requirement to have a residential element in the refurbished building.  As I have stated, the commercial element of the scheme does not solely relate to the pre-1915 properties.  However, there was a requirement that where a commercial development was planned for a pre-1915 dwelling, then the commercial development was restricted to the ground floor and basement and upper stories had to be refurbished or converted for living accommodation.  This is the condition the Minister is removing.<\/p><p> However, he does not believe this fundamentally alters either the residential or commercial elements of the relief since it was a minor element of the initiative in the first place.  The decision was taken after careful consideration of the following practical issues relating to the initiative.  First, the link between residential and commercial, which has existed up until now, is a small but additional complication to a scheme the Government needs to get up and running.  The Minister believes that a simplification of the initiative will achieve a greater good.  Second, many of the buildings to which the relief could potentially apply are very small.  In Limerick, for example, some of the two or three-story buildings are only one room deep and there may be insufficient floor area on the upper floors to form a residence any way, given that the minimum residential floor area must be at least 38 sq. m.  Third, the person incurring the refurbishment expenditure on the ground floor may not actually own the upper stories and consequently, investment in these areas may not be an option.  Fourth, financially the person incurring expenditure on the commercial enterprise on the ground floor may not have access to the resources to refurbish the other floors.  The choice here is between retaining the restriction, which will mean that some pre-1915 dwellings probably will not be refurbished because, for any one or other of the reasons I have just mentioned, it will not be possible or attractive to refurbish it wholly or partly as a dwelling or, on the other hand, removing the restriction and allowing the commercial relief to extend to all properties in the regeneration area.  In addition, I believe strongly that the &euro;200,000 cap that is being introduced in this Bill to the commercial element of the relief will act as an adequate restriction on unsuitable commercial development.  Members already have discussed the European Union state aid issue.  The amount of tax relief that will be available for any individual project now is effectively being capped at &euro;200,000 regardless of how many investors there are.  This is an overall limit and must be shared out among all the participants.<\/p><p> In conclusion, I agree with Deputy Pearse Doherty that in particular circumstances where there would be a commercial development in a residential pre-1915 dwelling, the link between residential and commercial has been removed.  I disagree with him on the significance he has attached to it and am completely satisfied that the change is justified.  Ultimately, as I have outlined, this comes down to a judgment call and in my view and that of the Minister for Finance, the changes being made in the Bill try to get the balance right.  That said - this is important - if it becomes clear after a period that a distortion has been created by the removal of this link, then this matter can be looked at again.  I believe this is the substance of the amendment that Deputy Doherty ultimately is trying to bring about.  However, the attitude of the Government is that this scheme has been announced, it is evolving, the Government is trying to get it off the ground and it awaits European Union state aid approval.  Let us get the scheme up and running and let us ascertain how it actually operates in practice.  However, the Deputy may be sure that the Minister for Finance will keep a close eye on it and Members undoubtedly can have further engagements on this matter during debates on future finance Bills.  However, I suggest the scheme be allowed to operate for a year first and therefore, I do not propose to accept the Deputy's amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600014#M00300","speaker":"1106","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1417001400,"counter":145,"content":"<p>I am disappointed that this is the Government's position.  As for the Minister of State's comments about letting the scheme operate for a year, I argue the same thing, which is to let the scheme operate for a year.  I note the scheme has never operated and yet there have been substantial changes to it, some of which were for the better.  Moreover, some of these did not originate from the Government but from Europe.  When the scheme originally was envisaged, I spoke on how no limit was placed on the benefit people could accrue from it, which was a flawed approach.  A limit has been placed on it now and whether it is appropriate, too low or too high is questionable.  I am not sure and while one must see the scheme in operation, at least some type of limit is in place.  However, as the Minister of State has acknowledged, there was a link between the living part and the commercialisation part for the pre-1915 houses.  I will set out my fears in this regard. This scheme originally was about enticing people back into living in Georgian houses and then into relevant houses, that is, two-story pre-1915 buildings.  I refer to the way in which one would entice people into them and the argument put forward was these Georgian houses and relevant houses are so old - some of them have conservation orders and so on - that it would cost a lot of money to refurbish them.  Consequently, the idea was that people would be allowed to develop the commercial part on the ground floor and basement, they could be rented out so on and one would have the living quarters upstairs.  The Minister has pointed out that there may be pre-1915 buildings that are not suitable to having living quarters and that is completely fine and is a completely relevant point.  I argue that the way to deal with this is not through basically removing the link for all pre-1915 properties but by dealing with that situation by providing that paragraph (c) of section 372AAC of the Principal Act would not apply to those properties in which conversion of the upper stories to living quarters would be deemed not possible.  Areas like this can be examined and can be dealt with.  I am disappointed that the Minister has considered this issue from that point of view.  Members have argued this issue to death on both Committee and Report Stages and I do not believe we will see eye to eye on this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600015#N00200","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speech","time":1417001400,"counter":146,"content":"<p>The Deputy will have an opportunity to come back one more time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600015#N00300","speaker":"1065"},{"type":"speech","time":1417001400,"counter":147,"content":"<p>I will conclude on this point.

There is no point in pretending other than the concept has evolved as there has been an interaction with local authorities and examination of some of the buildings involved.  However, a living city is not simply about sleeping in the city and requires an element of small-scale commercial development.  While the Deputy is correct in respect of the European element, the capping of the tax relief at &euro;200,000 helps to ensure it will be kept to small-scale commercial developments.  The issue will be kept under active review and once the scheme is up and running, Members can always return to the issue.  I will pass on the Deputy's views to the Minister for Finance that it would be useful to have an exchange of some sort on how the scheme is progressing throughout the year.

This matter was discussed at some length on Committee Stage but I just want to reiterate my perspective on it.  As the Minister of State is aware, certainty is a much sought after commodity when it comes to corporation tax.  My main concern regarding this unilateral move on the part of the Government is that it removes the certainty which has obtained historically in the context of our rate of corporation tax.  I accept that the Government is fully committed to the 12.5% corporation tax rate, as are all of the main political parties represented in this House.  Last year's budget brought about a change in respect of stateless companies and this year's is amending the position with regard to the double Irish.  The latter is despite the fact that the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, stated in the House two years ago that the double Irish was not an issue in Irish law at all.  However, he is now moving to change the position in respect of it.<br\/><br\/>Ireland competes with many other countries for inward investment from multinationals, etc.  Our corporation tax regime has given us a critical competitive edge in that regard in recent decades.  I do not want Ireland's competitive advantage to be diluted in any way.  It must be remembered that this is not an abstract or theoretical debate.  Rather, it is a debate which centres on the 150,000 jobs which have been directly created by multinationals and on the many thousands more which have been created as a result of foreign direct investment here.  We do not really have brass plate operations in this country that are availing of corporation tax rules.  The information which emerged as a result of the Lux leaks scandal relating to Luxembourg shows that Ireland really is in the ha'penny place.  The base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, process being advanced by the OECD is really only at an interim stage.  This process is a long way from being finalised.  The Government has made a calculation that there is a first mover advantage to be gained by closing off what many people regard as a loophole.  It may be correct in that regard and I genuinely hope this proves to be the case.  However, my concern is that Ireland is making its second change in 12 months.  Those who are seeking to exploit any potential weakness, namely, our competitor countries, will inform multinational companies which are considering investing in Europe that they cannot trust Ireland because it is willing to move the goalposts and change its corporation tax regime when pressure is applied.  I am concerned that they will state that such companies should not invest in Ireland or create employment here.<br\/><br\/>On Committee Stage, the Minister took action to close off the issue relating to the creation of shelf companies, which issue had been highlighted in the media.  That was the correct course of action to take.  I hope the Government has made the right calculation in respect of this matter.  If I were in the Minister's position, I would not have made the change.  I would rather have waited to see how matters develop internationally.  As stated, the BEPS process has not yet been finalised but it is clear that the Minister's European counterparts, the European Commission and the OECD pressured him into dealing with the double Irish.  Ireland alone cannot deal with the issue of multinationals using aggressive tax avoidance strategies to minimise the amount of tax they pay.  Ireland is but one small cog in the machine.  I sincerely hope, therefore, that we are not in any way disadvantaging this country in the context of the change being made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600016#O01100","speaker":"993"},{"type":"speech","time":1417002000,"counter":162,"content":"<p>I strongly disagree with the amendment.  It is only right and proper that the Government has finally moved to close off the double Irish.  On previous occasions I have made my points clearly in respect of this matter and the transcripts of the proceedings of this House show the engagement I have had with the Minister, Deputy Noonan, on it.  It is obvious that either the Minister was not aware of the situation regarding the double Irish or that he misled the D&aacute;il in the context of his assertions that nothing could be done in domestic law to close off the double Irish.  Today, we are moving to close off the double Irish.  Like Deputy Michael McGrath, I welcome the fact that the Government has also moved to close the loophole in respect of shelf companies.  However, I do not believe one can welcome the closing off of the loophole relating to shelf companies and then be opposed to the ending of the double Irish.  Such shelf companies are being established in order that certain entities might avail of the double Irish for the next five years.  As stated previously, I am concerned that the double Irish will remain in existence for the period up to 2020.  I do not believe there is any reason for this to be the case.<\/p><p>  Ultimately, a very clear signal is being sent out.  We are sometimes overly precious when it comes to making continual assertions about our corporation tax regime.  There are very few major speeches made by members of the Government wherein it is not stated that Ireland is committed to its 12.5% corporation tax rate.  That is a given.  The Government, Fianna F&aacute;il and Sinn F&eacute;in all support the 12.5% tax rate.  Three motions have been agreed by the House to show that there is a united front among the main political parties in respect of this matter.  It must be acknowledged that there are others, including the smaller political parties, who have a different view on this issue.  It is only fair, right and proper that these individuals and entities are able to articulate that view.  However, the vast majority of people elected to this House support our corporation tax rate.<\/p><p>  The fact that widespread support for the 12.5% rate is a given should not be used as an excuse for allowing the use of what, in my view, are bad tax practices.  Such practices can be used by businesses and brass plate operations because our tax code allows this to happen.  I have made this point to the Minister on numerous occasions during recent years.  He responded that it was all in the name and that if it were not referred to as the double Irish, everything would be fine.  The reality is that our tax code facilitated the double Irish.  I am not stating that anyone intentionally set out to facilitate it.  In that context, it is obvious that the double Irish comes into play as a result of the way in which different tax codes interact.  When the tax codes which operate in two different countries interact, the authorities in either jurisdiction have the opportunity to move in one direction or the other.  This State always had the option to close down the double Irish and that is the course of action it is taking today, despite the fact that it will allow the facility to remain in place for a further five years.<\/p><p>  I welcome what is being done in the Bill in this regard because where bad practices exist, they should be brought to an end.  Pressure is mounting in respect of Ireland's corporation tax regime.  Some of the difficulties which have arisen are of the State's own making.  In that context, it should not have facilitated the double Irish in recent years.<\/p><p>This State should not have been allowing companies incorporated in this jurisdiction to have no tax residency here.  We cannot control whether companies have non-tax residency elsewhere in the world but we can control their tax residency here, as happened in last year&rsquo;s Finance Bill.  This State should not have allowed the types of tax rulings made by the Revenue Commissioners to span 15 years without being reviewed.  This subject is part of the investigation the European Commission has launched in respect of Apple.<\/p><p> In all this discussion, we must be mindful that there are thousands upon thousands of companies or corporations that pay corporation tax at a rate of 12.5%.  They are able to avail of reliefs for legitimate purposes, such as research and development, and their effective tax rate is very close to the marginal rate.  However, there are other companies that have abused the system.  They make huge profits and legally avail themselves of the services of super-accountants who try to pick holes in what the Government has introduced in various Finance Bills.  This will happen, and it will happen today.  There is no doubt but there are people in offices today examining what has been done in the Finance Bill with a view to seeing whether there is a way to circumvent it.  They are asking what type of model could be created within legal parameters in this State that would allow a company to secure more profits and pay fewer taxes to the Exchequer.  This will always happen no matter what kind of Government is in place.  There will always be those who will try legally to find a legal benefit for themselves.  Our job is to try to be one step ahead or, when we know this practice is occurring, close it down.  I am glad the loophole is being closed down today.  However, it is not really being closed down today because we are allowing for a five-year tail effect.  At least, there is some movement.<\/p><p> I am dissatisfied with a number of factors.  First, the Minister played the likes of me, my party and others who suggested it was within our gift to end this as fools.  That was wrong and disrespectful, and not just to me.  I am thick-skinned enough to take this but I am elected on behalf of the people in Donegal South-West.  I had to take the previous Government to court to assert my constitutional right and that of the people who elected me to have a by-election this time four years ago.  Given my position, I understand the importance of being able to represent one's constituency and of holding the Government to account.  Consequently, I am disappointed with the type of engagement we have had over this issue.<\/p><p> I have said on the record before that my party and I have found the current Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, and Department, particularly in the first few years of government, far more informative than the previous Government.  I acknowledge that the Minister was open but there has probably been a shift in this regard in the past 12 months.  Whether it is deliberate, I do not know.  The attitude of the Minister to the subject under discussion was actually wrong.  He should have been upright and honest in saying we could make the desired change within the tax code.  He should have outlined why he did not want to do as requested at the time in question.  Perhaps the reasons were those that Deputy Michael McGrath legitimately outlined to the D&aacute;il today.  Perhaps the belief was that a change would create unease and a view that if the Government was open to this, it might be open to other things.  That is a fair response that the Minister should have given.  Instead, however, he said the change was nothing to do with Ireland and that there is nothing in Irish legislation that could actually close the loophole.<\/p><p> Second, we acted under pressure.  It is never good to act under pressure if one can at all avoid it.  What we should be doing is preventing pressure from building up in the first place.  This is why we should have taken the initiative.  There are many people with genuine reasons for advocating the closure of loopholes and a higher corporation tax rate, but there are others of the view that we should have a higher tax rate so their state can benefit from the employment and tax revenue we bring in from multinational companies.  Therefore, we must always be mindful of the various realities and where different people come from.  By allowing bad tax practices to exist, one is bolstering the argument of the latter.  It is not really about stopping certain tax practices but about trying to gain advantage over this State.<\/p><p> Sinn F&eacute;in very much believes this State should have the ability at all times to direct its own tax policy.  However, by having allowed what has occurred to develop for so long, we have ceded ground to those who have a selfish and strategic interest.  I am not talking about those who believe corporation tax should be increased on the basis of their political perspective but about those in jurisdictions such as France and Germany who want it increased because they want some of the benefits Ireland has been able to obtain.<\/p><p> I oppose the amendment.  The loophole should be closed.  The Government should have gone further as a five-year tail is far too long.  At least, it is finally happening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600016#O01200","speaker":"959","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1417002600,"counter":164,"content":"<p>As Deputy McGrath said, we had a very lengthy exchange on this on Committee Stage.  We also heard exchanges on corporation tax in general on a number of occasions on Committee Stage.  Those in this House who advocate increasing corporation tax &mdash; I am not referring to those from Fianna F&aacute;il, Sinn F&eacute;in or the Government &mdash; would want to do a bit of reading and interacting regarding the impact of the charges.  If these people are serious about wanting to play a part in government, they will have to determine the impact of their rhetoric on employment.  It is not rhetoric from me because, on budget day, a number of documents were published, as was the ESRI report.  The report examined the impact of increasing corporation tax from 12.5% to 15.5% and 22.5%.  According to the ESRI report, had the corporation tax rate been increased to 22.5%, there would have been 50% fewer new foreign direct investment opportunities in the country.  That is worth saying.  It is encouraging to note that there was a report issued this week by the World Bank showing that, yet again, Ireland's headline rate, versus the effective rate, is very favourable.  I am sorry to deviate from the amendment but believe this is worth saying.<\/p><p>  I accept Deputy Michael McGrath's sincerity and bona fides on this.  He approached the matter in good faith but we disagree.  I accept he hopes we are right on this because the country needs to be right on it.<\/p><p>  We discussed this issue on Committee Stage already.  It has always been clear that the double Irish arrangement is not part of the Irish tax offering; it is just one example of the many international tax planning arrangements that have been designed and developed by tax and legal advisers to take advantage of mismatches between the tax rules in two or more countries.  It is important to note that the idea that a Government or official in Merrion Street tried to devise a double Irish arrangement does not stand up to scrutiny.  My colleague, the Minister for Finance, made the point that the double Irish arrangement was not devised in this country.<\/p><p>  International tax law predates the independence of this State.  However, the reality is that our company tax residency rules have not kept pace with international developments.  Being associated with the double Irish arrangement, and the term &quot;double Irish&quot;, is damaging Ireland's reputation.  The corporation tax offering and the foreign direct investment offering are associated with the three Rs: rate, regime and reputation.  We have discussed the rate.  The four large parties are in support of its maintenance.  With regard to the regime, we are introducing a number of measures in the budget to try to improve the offering of Ireland.  Reputation is important.  The phrase &quot;double Irish&quot; was damaging Ireland's reputation so the Minister decided to act.  In essence, the residency rule has meant that companies that were not tax resident in Ireland could be presented as Irish because they were incorporated here.  The change introduced by this Bill will mean it will no longer be possible for a company to use an Irish label of a corporation without it also being tax resident here.  Removing the element of the structure that gives it the double Irish name should help restore our international reputation in the context of current EU and OECD initiatives to combat aggressive tax planning.<\/p><p>  Ireland does not make changes in respect of corporation tax lightly.  The Department of Finance consulted widely all interested parties on this issue through its broader public consultation process, launched in May 2014, well in advance of the budget.  It is important to note that this change is but a small part of a much broader initiative set out in A Road Map for Ireland's Tax Competitiveness, which contains a comprehensive package of competitive tax measures designed to position Ireland to reap the benefits of sustainable foreign direct investment in the changed international tax landscape.  This new roadmap will provide the foundations for Ireland to advance and prosper as a thriving hub for foreign direct investment.  That map and the decision to end the double Irish provision have been warmly welcomed by the business community and many representative bodies.  Deputy Michael McGrath was kind enough to acknowledge this on Committee Stage.  We are, therefore, not in a position to accept the amendments.<\/p><p>  Let me consider the points of Deputy Doherty, who comes at this from a different perspective, characterised by a desire to end the arrangement sooner.<\/p><p>We have, as both Deputies acknowledged, provided measures in the Finance Bill at Committee Stage to rule out shelf companies.  It is really important that this closes with immediate effect for any new company trying to establish after 1 January, but that there is certainty and that there is time for those in transition to make arrangements.  Certainty is so important to investment.  Businesses plan their investment on the basis of a five-year period or thereabouts, and it is prudent that we would give this time.  Therefore, I am not in a position to accept Deputy Michael McGrath's amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600017#P00200","speaker":"1106","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1417003200,"counter":166,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.\r\n\r\n^ Topical Issue Matters^<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1417003200,"counter":167,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 27A and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputies Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in and Se&aacute;n Crowe - the proposed symphysiotomy redress scheme; (2) Deputy Terence Flanagan - the processing of medical card applications in the primary care reimbursement service; (3) Deputies Sean Fleming and Billy Kelleher - the number of executives the Health Service Executive has recruited over the past three years; (4) Deputy Patrick O'Donovan - the need to implement immediately the recommendations of the Internet content governance advisory group report; (5) Deputy Michael McGrath - the loss of routes and reduction of services at Cork Airport; (6) Deputy Eoghan Murphy - the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland's interpretation of its code of fairness, objectivity and impartiality in news and current affairs; (7) Deputy Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l - the need for the officially agreed terms and conditions for future fixed period promotions for the members of the 9th potential officer class to be adhered to; (8) Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall - the need to update regulations under the misuse of drugs legislation to curb the open street trading of benzodiazepines and Z-drugs; (9) Deputy Joe Costello - the need to ensure that the 99 new units at Fr.

She involved herself in detailed discussions and Dr. Travers, the former president of St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra, was appointed as a chairman.  The Minister offered a compromise here, that 60% of the marks in the junior cycle should be allocated on the basis of an examination at the end of the third year - down from 100% - which will continue to be set and marked by the State Examinations Commission for all subjects and that 40% of the marks should be allocated for school-based work, such as portfolios and projects, which thousands of students do at third level colleges every day of the week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600018#Q00800","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1417003200,"counter":174,"content":"<p>We know all that.

She was recommended as the sole candidate for appointment, following a rigorous and independent scrutiny, analysis and interview process.  This selection was part of an international competition for persons who considered themselves sufficiently competent to carry out these responsibilities and to fill this role.  The selection committee comprised a number of very competent people, including the former chief of police in Boston and Seattle, Kathleen O'Toole, together with the appointed chairperson of the independent police authority and the Secretary General of the Department of the Taoiseach.<\/p><p>  This is a reform process.

The Bill proposes to strengthen the role and remit of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.  The independent review mechanism, consisting of a panel of counsel, is examining more than 300 complaints alleging Garda misconduct or problems with investigating misconduct.  The Fennelly commission of investigation is continuing its work.  The report of Mr. Justice Cooke's inquiry into reports of unlawful surveillance of GSOC, has been published.  The review of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Haddington Road agreement, which is expected to be concluded shortly, encompasses all aspects of the administration and the operation of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

Today, on behalf of the Government and the Fine Gael Party, I convey my deepest sympathies to his wife, Jo, who is not with us in the House today, his son Fergal, his daughter Louise and extended family.  Louise is watching this broadcast in Sydney, Australia.<br\/><br\/>Ted Nealon is sadly missed by all those who knew him in his personal and political life.  Many of the younger and newer Members might not have known Ted Nealon as a person or a politician.  Some who may not have been in politics at the time will have seen some of the programmes he conducted when he was a television broadcaster and political commentator.<br\/><br\/>It was a privilege and quite something to work with him and to be a beneficiary of what was a unique political brain of enormous capacity.  It is something about which we know very clearly in Leinster House and the D&aacute;il, as do those who were privileged to work with him in what, by any standards, was an exceptional career in politics and journalism.  In the political aspect of his career he served proudly under two former taoisigh, Liam Cosgrave and the late Dr. Garret FitzGerald, and he did so with distinction as Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and later as Minister of State at the Department of An Taoiseach with responsibility for arts and culture.  He was later appointed Minister of State at the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.<br\/><br\/>In every role he gave of his best, not alone as an exemplary public servant but as an exemplary compassionate and dignified human being.  In every interaction he recognised the other person's humanity and dignity, which explains why when Ted's passing was announced it was met with such personal sadness and fond affection in the former constituency of Sligo-Leitrim.  He touched people's lives with his sincerity and the common sense and insight for which he was well noted and for which he is now so deeply and personally missed.<br\/><br\/>Ted Nealon loved his county and everything about it.  He loved the stories and the engagement of the characters of the day.  He followed on from the late Eugene Gilhawley and the late Joe MacLachlan, two different personalities who represented the Sligo-Leitrim constituency.  He loved Ben Bulben, Lissadell and Streedagh Strand where the lost armada lies.  He was intrigued by the science of politics and the enthusiasm created by so many people.  He was always excited about the political challenge and the stories that had to be contented with.  He wrote many of them down in the book he published on tales from Leinster House.<br\/><br\/>He made a remarkable contribution to politics in Ireland, both as a practitioner and an analyst.  I recall when he first came here to join the Fine Gael Party, working for the late Dr. Garret FitzGerald.  He was the first person I saw in the House to use what was then described as the golf typewriter, on which all of the letters were on a central console.  Ted, being a journalist, used to churn out letters, epistles and leaflets and eventually produced a paper for the party, which was very well received in Dublin and throughout the country.  Those who were members of a much smaller party always wanted to be featured in it at some point.<br\/><br\/>I believe his fascination with politics was something that was infectious because he was very enthusiastic about it, not only because of policy statements or political interviews but because he crystallised all of this fascination into a specific resource that every aspiring politician, every student of politics and every political columnist and broadcaster has now as the foundation stone of their competence or their aspiration.  It is known as <i>Nealon's Guide<\/i>, which he launched more than 40 years ago.<\/p><p>How many people around the country have thumbed through those pages looking at the photographs of the different constituencies and the different parties, the first count, the second count, the elimination process and eventually the line-up of those elected?  It is an extraordinary series of books, encompassing an entire social and political history throughout the country.<\/p><p> Sadly along with Ted Nealon, this month the nation mourns the loss of another great broadcasting icon, the presenter, author and academic Brian Farrell.  On Irish television in black and white in the early days of the 1960s Ted Nealon and Brian Farrell worked very closely together on the current affairs programme &quot;7 Days&quot;.  Many men and women now in their late 40s, 50s and 60s remember the silence that was called for in the kitchen or the sitting room that the &quot;7 Days&quot; programme demanded and got.  Brian and Ted made necessary - even compulsive - viewing in what were often difficult times for our country.<\/p><p> I recall when Ted Nealon, God rest him, was appointed as a Minister of State.  He was invited to speak in the Imperial Hotel in Castlebar, where Michael Davitt held many of his meetings after the Land League was started, to talk on the vista that lay ahead for agriculture.  He gave a strong presentation on what was in store for farmers.  At the end of the Minister of State's contributions the chairman on the night called for questions.  The question had nothing to do with the Minister of State' presentation on the agricultural vista that lay ahead, but asked whether the Minister of State would be in a position to re-infect the rabbits in Ballyglass with myxomatosis as they had eaten all the ditches in the surrounding parish.  This is one of the many stories Ted Nealon used to love to recount and be involved in through his enjoyment of politics.<\/p><p> To Jo, Feargal, Louise and the extended family, I offer our heartfelt thanks for his contribution to Ireland and to politics.  I express our deepest sympathy.  It was an honour to serve with him in the House here and to enjoy his company, and to learn from his journalistic and broadcasting brain about the science of politics and what made it work for him.

He was appointed Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture in the Fine Gael-Labour Government of 1981-82, and went on to serve as Minister of State with responsibility for Arts and Culture in 1983 - a period that will be very well remembered - and Minister of State at the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. <br\/><br\/>Ted Nealon carved that rare path from prominent current affairs journalist and broadcaster to Minister of State.  His journey on that route was marked by excellence in journalism and service - and love as the Taoiseach has said - as Deputy for his native Sligo-Leitrim constituency.<br\/><br\/>Ted spoke with an authoritative voice, and was convincing and knowledgeable about public affairs and about the business of politics.  His success in journalism saw him presented with a Jacob&rsquo;s Award, which was bestowed on those who had given an outstanding contribution to Irish television.  He received the award for his anchoring of RTE&rsquo;s coverage of the 1973 general election, a ground-breaking time in Irish politics.  He was a pioneer of broadcasting in Ireland, and brought that deep understanding of political and social affairs to politics and service not only of his native county and constituency, but also of the country. <br\/><br\/>As the Taoiseach has said, he was editor and founder of what was knowns as <i>Nealon&rsquo;s Guide<\/i>to the D&aacute;il and Seanad.  It was one of the most important works in introducing the innate love most Irish people have of the political systems here and giving us the factsheet to work on.  Since its first outing in 1973, the guide has become the repository of each and every statistic from each general election, and an indispensable guide for all practitioners, professional journalists, working politicians and anybody with an interest in public affairs.  As the Taoiseach has said, it is a poignant and sad coincidence to lose Ted Nealon and Brian Farrell in the same time period.<br\/><br\/>As Minister of State in the Department of the Taoiseach with responsibility for arts and culture Ted brought his trademark energy and creativity to the role, as he did in his capacity as Minister of State in what was then the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  His success in politics can be glimpsed through the simple statistic that he was re-elected at every general election from 1981 to 1997, securing and keeping the trust of the people of Sligo and Leitrim.<br\/><br\/>On behalf of the Labour Party, I thank Ted Nealon for his contribution to journalism, to politics and to his country.  I express my condolences to his wife Jo; his son, Fergal; his daughter, Louise, and all his extended family.

In many ways I always had a strong affinity and affection for him.  I can trace my real engagement with politics to the &quot;7 Days&quot; programme that has been mentioned.  When I was a young second-level student in Col&aacute;iste Chr&iacute;ost R&iacute;, we had a teacher whose instruction was, &quot;Boys, will you go home tonight and watch &quot;7 Days&quot;?  I'll ask ye questions about it tomorrow morning&quot;.  Invariably about three or four of us would watch &quot;7 Days&quot;.  When the rest of the class saw the pattern developing they would say to a couple of us, &quot;Would you get him talking about &quot;7 Days&quot; again because we've no homework done&quot;.  Ever since, &quot;7 Days&quot;, Ted Nealon and the late, great Brian Farrell were synonymous with that bit of mischief going on in a classroom in a second level school.<br\/><br\/>I trace my own motivation to become engaged with and involved in politics to the captivating broadcasting skill that Ted Nealon, Brian Farrell and others had.  We can talk about all the junior certificate CSPE programmes we like, but that raw talent and ability to capture young people's imagination, to be engaged in a subject matter like politics, was a rare gift that we remember today when paying tribute to a person of the calibre of Ted Nealon.<br\/><br\/>He was highly capable and very intelligent, and was eloquent in his speeches and contributions to public life.  As has been said, he moved from the media world where he had a key role in politics to politics, itself.  Fundamentally what we acknowledge and remember today is the <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre<\/i>of political life - giving of oneself to the public and being of service to the public, and he did that in an exceptional manner.<br\/><br\/>He was elected to represent Sligo-Leitrim in 1981 and served his constituents exceptionally well until 1997.<\/p><p>Most Members of the House and those who knew him will remember him with fondness because he was a genuinely pleasant, friendly individual and people will always have fond recollections of that humanity and engagement.  He excelled in everything to which he turned his hand, whether that was on the football field playing for Sligo, being a national newspaper editor or a television presenter.  The people had trust and confidence in him and he was easy with people, which is an important trait in any public representative.  <br\/><br\/>Reflecting on his life, it was a varied one.  For people contemplating politics, such a varied life and the different experiences one has in life can contribute to a more effective political life.  There are lessons to be drawn from that.  He had a fantastic and varied career.  He started his days with <i>The<\/i><i>Irish Press, <\/i>not a newspaper overly associated with the Fine Gael Party, soon after he became editor of the <i>Sunday Review<\/i>and he wrote a column which everybody read because of the behind-the-scene information, gossip, leaks in the days when, allegedly, there were no leaks.  He had a great dry wit as well.  Long before Twitter and Facebook, people relied on people like Ted Nealon for the real news.  He played an enormous role in Irish broadcasting, both in terms of &quot;Seven Days&quot; and in terms of farming and rural life in the &quot;On the Land&quot; programme, which was a significant one in its own right.<br\/><br\/>There was an election in 1973.  As a 13 year old, and being the emerging nerd that I was, Ted Nealon's uncanny predictions of that election and the exact results that materialised outdid the computer, rudimentary as it was at that time.  We did not particularly like the predictions but they came through in any event.  His capacity to analyse constituencies, voters, geography, transfers and so forth was incredible.  Basil Chubb, one of our original pioneering political scientist, described Ted Nealon as having an &quot;encyclopaedic and detailed knowledge of people, places, local events and opinions&quot;.  He was the founder and editor of <i>Nealon's Guide,<\/i>which has become the bible in terms of research, quickly wanting to reference various elections, Deputies, Senators and so forth.  That is one of his lasting legacies that has informed the work of many people who cover and analyse politics to the present day. <br\/><br\/>He was, in many respects, ideal for politics, public life and membership of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  The Taoiseach referenced his role as a press officer or Jack of all trades for the Fine Gael Party in earlier times when he was Government press secretary in 1976.  He knew politics from every side of the coin, every angle and every perspective.  As a Minister for State, he was particularly effective, particularly in the arts and culture portfolio which I would single out.  He had a particular gr&aacute; for that and that was in the days before we have a full ministry for the arts and culture.  He also served as Minister of State in the Department of Agriculture and Minister of State in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.<br\/><br\/>He did great work in Sligo, particularly in working for the establishment of the North West Hospice, which owes a great deal to his work and contribution.  He will be remembered for his integrity as a public servant and politician, as a legendary raconteur and for his story telling capacity and as a very well liked and very able politician across this House and across politics in general.  His family can be very proud of his contribution to Irish life in its many and varied forms.  We extend our sincere sympathies to his family and to the Fine Gael Party who have lost one of their true friends and great contributors.

Mar a d&uacute;irt an Taoiseach agus daoine eile, mar Theachta D&aacute;la agus saor&aacute;nach, rinne Ted Nealon obair gal&aacute;nta ar son mhuintir an St&aacute;it agus ar son a Dh&aacute;il cheantair f&eacute;in.

Ba mhaith liom mo chomhbhr&oacute;n a dh&eacute;anamh fosta le Fine Gael.<br\/><br\/>Fine Gael was very much a part of Ted Nealon's life and he enriched it as has been said and acknowledged by his contribution over many years.  I did not know him personally.  I read <i>Nealon's Guide <\/i>and I saw him on RTE programmes, particularly on &quot;Seven Days&quot; with Brian Farrell.  As others have pointed out, he was elected to this House in 1981.  I remember that year well because it was the year of the hunger strikes.  Kieran Doherty and Paddy Agnew were also elected and Joe McDonald narrowly missed being elected in Sligo-Leitrim.  That was Ted's second attempt to be elected and he went on to hold that seat for 16 years, winning six successive general elections before he retired.  As is well known, before he became a full-time politician, he was a journalist.  I want to associate myself with the Taoiseach's remarks and other remarks about Brian Farrell.  These two men modernised people's understanding of politics, particularly in the detailed approach that they took and the encyclopaedic knowledge they both had.  I noticed a few times in the days of black-and-white broadcasting that he clashed with people with whom he would later share government.  His work as a journalist obviously empowered him and gave him particular insights as to how he would function as a Deputy.  <br\/><br\/>I read Ted Nealon's <i>Nealon's Guide<\/i>.  Some members of the current Fine Gael Party might not appreciate the fact that his very well researched work was utilised by Sinn F&eacute;in to assist our electoral engagement but I am sure Ted Nealon would be delighted because it is very clear that he loved politics, electoralism, Parliament and all that goes with it.<br\/><br\/>On top of all of this, we must remember that, aside from the being a public figure, he was a husband and a father.  To Jo, Fergal, Louise, and his extended family, I express my sincere sympathies because it is they who will have the huge gap in their lives.  I hope they will take comfort from the tributes paid here and those I am sure that were paid locally and that they will know that in his long life he helped many people and that he was generally liked and respected by friends and political opponents alike.  That is something that is hard to achieve - to be liked by one's political opponents as well as by one's friends.

I knew Ted Nealon and was here when he was a Minister and a Deputy.  He brought to this House a full and very fulfilled life and, as other speakers have said, a great knowledge of the outside world, which was the basis and foundation of his expertise in politics when he came here.<\/p><p>  He wrote the book to which everybody has referred after 1973 when he starred in that famous programme and defied all the other predictions which were being made by experts, including computers, in forecasting during the programme that the party, which he was later to join, would form a government.  That was because he had done an extraordinary amount of work and carried an enormous amount of knowledge about the detail of every village and town in this country.<\/p><p>I believe his heart and head happily coincided on that occasion, which gave him both the result he wanted and the correct result.  That was a pleasant coincidence.  He then went on to become Government press secretary in 1976 and to be elected to the D&aacute;il in 1981.  At the same time, his book continued to be published.  <br\/><br\/>I think I am right in saying that the references to his Gaelic football career are correct but this was combined with a rather versatile career in sport in that he also played rugby league for Lancashire.  I am sure he was the only person who played rugby league for Lancashire that also played Gaelic football for Sligo.  That is a magnificent achievement.  While it is probably not his greatest achievement it is one that is probably unlikely to be repeated.<br\/><br\/>The Taoiseach was probably massaging the truth when he referred to Ted having written a book entitled <i>Tales of Leinster House.  <\/i>The book was actually entitled <i>Tales from the D&aacute;il Bar.<\/i>The D&aacute;il bar was a pleasant place in which to meet Ted Nealon because, as others have said, he was a magnificent raconteur.  He was, if I might say so, pretty well party blind in the choice of his friends in that he did not appear to distinguish between those who sat on the Government side of the House and this side of it.  He was so entranced and absolutely intrigued by the business of politics that he would talk about it to anyone and share his great knowledge with anybody regardless of colour.<br\/><br\/>We have lost someone with a great fascination with and knowledge of politics and who made a great contribution to politics.  I again sympathise with his family.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600023#V00500","speaker":"953","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1417006800,"counter":334,"content":"<p>I am honoured to be a part of this formal acknowledgement by the Oireachtas of a former Member, colleague and friend, the late Ted Nealon.  I welcome members of his family to the Distinguished Visitors Gallery.  Ted's wife Jo is unable to be with us today but she is here in spirit.  We are joined today by Ted's son, Fergal, and his wife, Sinead, his daughter, Louise, live from Sydney via the Oireachtas television service, his nephew, Ted Nealon, and members of the Loughnan and Townsend families.  Their presence today reminds us all that while we have lost a much respected former colleague, they have lost a much loved husband, father and friend.  It is appropriate that this commemoration is taking place today as yesterday would have been Ted's 85th birthday.  He was born on 25 November 1929 at Coolrecuill, Aclare, County Sligo.<br\/><br\/>As Ted represented Sligo-Leitrim in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann for 16 years and I followed in his footsteps as a Deputy for Sligo-Leitrim, I came to know him very well, both as a political expert and as a person.  It is to Ted Nealon the person that I pay tribute today.  The full scope of Ted's life and times, his outstanding achievements as a sportsman, journalist and politician are well-known and documented.  For the record, he played with distinction with Sligo GAA for many years and also played with Connacht in the Railway Cup competition.  Two of his most outstanding personal qualities were his wisdom and his sense of compassion.  His personal wisdom was a combination of exceptional intellectual capacity, evident from an early age in the many council scholarships he won and in his unique ability to analyse and understand the political process from an early age.<br\/><br\/>Ted was a distinguished journalist and current affairs broadcaster who made a successful transition into politics, which is very much the exception.  It is important to note that he was a reporter and presenter with the RTE program &quot;Seven Days&quot; and was part of a heavyweight team that included the late Brian Farrell, Bill O'Herlihy and John O'Donoghue.  It was the first television programme that brought a new cutting edge to current affairs.  Cross-examination was very new at that time.  Ted won a Jacob's Award in 1973 for his coverage of the then general election.  His analytical side was well-complemented by a strong sense of sympathetic understanding of people.  Ted lost his mother when he was a young child and this sad experience sharpened his sense of compassion for others in adversity.  As he wrote in his book, the only visual memory of his mother that he carried through life was of the lid of the coffin leaning against the wall of the house as they prepared to take her to the church.  It was these particular qualities of intellectual capacity, analytical ability and compassion for people combined into one personality that made him one of the foremost political commentators and election forecasters this country had ever seen.<br\/><br\/>The <i>Nealon's Guide to the D&aacute;il and Seanad<\/i>, published in 1973 and following every election since, has become the indispensable bible for those interested in Irish politics.  Ted was extremely proud of his agreement with <i>The Irish Times<\/i>that it continue in publication into the future.  Never one to take the easy road, Ted then decided to leave the role of commentator on politics for the more onerous role of actually being in politics.  Again, he devoted all his skills and energy to being a very successful local representative for his native place and later became Minister of State.  Being the first Minister of State with responsibility for arts and culture and being vested by the French Government with the very distinctive honour of Commandeur dans l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres were two of his proudest achievements.<br\/><br\/>I am taking a short cut through his time as a Member of the D&aacute;il because I want to get to speak a little about what is probably his greatest legacy to us all as politicians, namely, his book entitled <i>Tales from the D&aacute;il Bar<\/i>.  Ted's book, in a spirit of generosity and understanding, speaks of politics and politicians in a style that is illuminating yet kindly and humorous.  In the tales he chooses to relate, he speaks to us of his own sympathetic understanding of the challenges facing anyone who wishes to be in politics: the clinics, the funerals, the election campaign canvassing and - a favourite of mine - the everyday challenge of trying to remember the names of a vast number of people and how to try and skate past the problem when a name you actually know becomes trapped on the tip of the tongue and refuses absolutely to move any further.<br\/><br\/>At the other end of the scale, Ted takes in a vast sweep of economic and social history into his story about the clinic for the poit&iacute;n maker.  First, he tells of how new EU agriculture policies led to the demise of the widespread production of poit&iacute;n.  He then comments on the rural folklore that poit&iacute;n was a valuable alternative medicine in the prevention of flu and colds, a comment that would be credible enough were it not immediately followed by the advice that if the poit&iacute;n did not work as a preventative therapy, it was also a great cure for anyone with a bad flu or cold.  The tales he chose to write of in his book speak to us of his wisdom and compassion, but it is in the gentle and humorous way he tells the stories that we can come to understand fully his sympathetic view of politics and politicians and of his great insight into and empathy for everyone.  Apart from some very witty stories about election rallies and politician retorts to hecklers, he speaks little about the campaigning clashes and policy battles fought within and between parties during election campaigns, preferring instead to focus on the human and personal side of politics within Leinster House.  In his modesty, the few stories he tells of his personal involvement in some great political drama are told mostly as a compliment to some outstanding quality of another politician.<br\/><br\/>In his time as a Member of this House and in his <i>Tales from the D&aacute;il Bar<\/i>, Ted was generous in his comments about colleagues. It is appropriate that in this formal acknowledgement by the Oireachtas to the memory of our colleague and friend, we are also generous in the memories of him that we share today.  I join the Taoiseach and all other Members in expressing sympathy to the Nealon family on the death of Ted.  I particularly wish to express my sympathies to his wife and children, his extended family and many friends.

I welcome his family to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  I knew Ted Nealon.  My first engagement with politics was during the H-Block hunger strikes.  Up to that point, I had kept a lengthy distance from politics.  The H-Block hunger strikes drove me to try to bring about change in this country.<\/p><p>My first engagement with what I would call a senior politician was with Ted Nealon.  I had engagement with politicians because I was deeply involved in the Joe McDonnell election campaign but it was more about trying to save his life than it was about getting him elected.  We were trying to get him elected in order to save his life and the lives of others.  I had engagement with many politicians, in particular with Deputies in Sligo-Leitrim and throughout the north west.  <\/p><p> I will say now what I have said down through the years.  Ted Nealon was the best of the senior politicians I met during that very traumatic time.  Ted Nealon was a gentleman, a consummate politician and a humanitarian.  Some of the Deputies would not talk to me while others talked to me and said they would do something but nothing happened.  On several occasions, Ted Nealon took me in, sat down and explained to me the concern he had not only for the hunger strikers but for society and for the destabilising effect politics was having on people.  He explained what he was doing to try to help resolve the situation.  He also explained the limitations of a senior politician and the limitations of what he could and could not do.  He was superb.  He was greatly loved and respected by the people of Sligo-Leitrim.  He is probably one of those rare breeds - a gentleman who went into politics but who did not lose the gentlemanly aspect.  May the good Lord rest him and may the family be proud of him because the people of Sligo-Leitrim will always be proud of Ted Nealon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600024#W00300","speaker":"1083","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1417007400,"counter":337,"content":"<p>While I did not share a constituency with Ted Nealon, our constituencies of Donegal South-West and Sligo-Leitrim bordered one another.  I got to know Ted very well before I was elected to this House through his television programmes and so on.  I had the privilege and the pleasure of sharing 15 or 16 very enjoyable years with him on the third floor of Leinster House.  Ted Nealon was a national figure even before he became a Member of this House.  He was a very versatile man, a very talented man and a very talented footballer,which we, in Donegal, know all about.  He was a journalist, a television pundit, a Deputy and a Minister of State.<br\/><br\/>He was a very talented journalist who started off with <i>The Monaghan Argus<\/i>and ended up as a political correspondent in <i>The Irish Press<\/i>.  Many times he told us that late in the evening, he would get a telephone call from the chief - Deputy Martin will know who the chief was - suggesting to him in a very gentle way what would be a suitable headline for the next day's edition of the newspaper.  I believe Ted always paid heed to what the chief suggested.  <br\/><br\/>In the 1960s, he went on to become one of the anchormen on &quot;7 Days&quot; and succeeded in bringing politics and the workings of this House into every sitting room and to every fireside in the country.  He was also a pioneer in his journalistic career and became editor of <i>The Sunday Review<\/i>, which some Members may remember.  I think it was a sister paper of <i>The Irish Times<\/i>.  He brought a new type of political comment to that newspaper.  <br\/><br\/>I mention the well-known Mayo man, the late John Healy, who the Taoiseach would have known very well and who was probably a friend of his.  Saturday would not have been Saturday for those of us who were interested into politics unless we read Backbencher because we were all convinced that whoever Backbencher was, if he was not a Cabinet Minister, then he certainly had a seat underneath the Cabinet table.  &quot;Today Tonight&quot; was also a great programme.  <br\/><br\/>He also made an iconic programme which had to do with my county.  He went to Donegal and stood at the top of a mountain near Glenswilly.  He had two gentlemen with him, the late Mandy Kelly, who was the Fine Gael man, and the late Tony Gallagher, who was the Fianna F&aacute;il man.  They started off at the top of that glen.  At O'Donnell's house, Mandy was told it would be his while at the next house, Tony was told it would be his.  At the next house, Tony was hold he was one of his while Mandy was told she was on his side.  He went through every house in that glen and designated the politics of every person in every house with the exception of the parish priest's house who Ted said had enough on his plate and that they would pass him by.  They did not divulge his politics at all.  That was one of the iconic programmes he made and I am delighted RTE still has it in its archives and shows it now and again.<br\/><br\/><i><\/i>What is known as<i>Nealon's Guide<\/i>, which is the bible for anyone interested in politics, was mentioned.  I remember being abroad a number of times, including at British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly meetings, where people always had a biographical note of who we were and where we came from, which was always taken from <i>Nealon's Guide<\/i>.  I will make a confession to this House that there was one inaccuracy in that guide, of which only Ted Nealon and I were aware.  Ted is gone to his eternal rest but I am still here.  I suppose at this stage of my political career, it is not worth divulging what that mistake was.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600025#X00200","speaker":"1000"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1417007400,"counter":338,"content":"<p>(Interruptions).<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1417007400,"counter":339,"content":"<p>I remember we were at the great Washington conference in 1996, which all Border Deputies and politicians from the North attended.

We arrived in Boston before the hotel rooms were ready and the lady in the hotel said we had to wait for a few hours but we could not decide what would we do early in the morning.  There were leaflets about a tour of Boston on the desk with two prices, &euro;18 and &euro;12.  Remember this was 1996, almost 20 years ago.  I asked what the difference was between the two prices.  The lady said there was no difference except that the &euro;12 price was for senior citizens.  Ted said we would have two of those.  Whatever about Ted's age, I felt my age that day.<br\/><br\/>He was a great friend and raconteur.  He worked in the Government Information Service from 1973 to 1977 and there are many stories about that era which have not yet been told.  Not only was Ted a colleague but he was a friend.

I am satisfied that there are independent mechanisms in place to fairly and squarely interview people.  People from within an organisation are just as entitled to be appointed as people external to it.  I understand the talk about appointing an outsider but it was detrimental to many good personnel inside An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who had a legitimate right to aspire to this position.  We need to be very careful not to go all the time for that kind of sentiment.  Deputies should refrain from interfering in selection processes for public appointments.<\/p><p>  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Amendment) (No. 3) Bill 2014 dealing with the new policing authority, is relevant to this.

The immigration Bill that was moving through the legislative process, and to which many amendments were proposed, will not proceed any further.  It will be replaced by the international protection Bill, the principal purpose of which will be to reform the international protection, or asylum, system here in Ireland through the introduction of a single application procedure whereby all elements of a person's application to be permitted to remain in this country will be dealt with in one process.  The Bill will comply with the UN refugee convention and the related EU directives.  The Deputy will be aware that international protection can be offered to a person who is eligible for refugee protection on the basis of a well-founded fear of persecution in his or her country of origin, or to a person who is eligible for subsidiary protection on the basis of a real risk of suffering serious harm if he or she were to be returned to his or her country of origin.  This is a complex issue, as Deputy Adams is well aware.  The asylum process in many countries fails because there is no definite period in which a person's application for asylum in a specific country is dealt with one way or another.  In many cases, an asylum seeker who went to a country for a period of time is still there 20 or 25 years later without a determination having been made.  I would say it will probably be the middle of next year before the international protection Bill is published.  It will deal with the principal issues by providing for a single application procedure and complying with the UN refugee convention and the EU directives.  It is hoped that it will bring a sense of clarity and certainty to the process.

Recently, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, announced a new model for dealing with these matters.  Yesterday, he introduced guidelines that he will ask Ministers to implement.  However, these voluntary guidelines will not be satisfactory.  The public requires a clear statutory process that they can be satisfied will be implemented in full.  For that reason, I have introduced this Bill.<br\/><br\/>Since coming to power in 2011, the Government has introduced &quot;new arrangements&quot;, as it called them, for appointments to State boards.  On 30 September, the Government announced &quot;further reforms&quot;.  Yesterday, the Minister published &quot;guidelines&quot;, as part of which a database of State boards will be published next year, but in respect of which there is no timescale for the inclusion of State companies like Irish Water.  Despite all of that, there is still no statutory basis for the appointments process.  As such, I have taken this approach.<br\/><br\/>I have included in my draft legislation a more extensive Schedule of organisations than the Minister included in his voluntary guidelines.  While he listed public bodies, commercial State companies, non-commercial State companies and other State organisations, I have also included bodies the appointment to which should be dealt with by legislation, for example, the Labour Court, An Bord Plean&aacute;la, the Competition Authority, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Revenue Commissioners, Revenue's Appeal Commissioners and all ombudsmans and regulators.  The Minister has embarked on a public appointments process, but only to some extent and on a non-statutory basis.<br\/><br\/>Under my legislation, a Minister or Government shall only appoint to State boards people who are recommended by the Public Appointments Service, PAS, in accordance with the provision of the Bill.  The Minister has included a number of the provisions in his guidelines but he has also listed some exemptions.  People will be surprised to note that he exempted appointments to the boards of Irish Water, Bord G&aacute;is-Ervia, the ESB, EirGrid, Bord na M&oacute;na and Coillte, all of which are called NewERA companies.  Separate provision must be made for them, but no timetable for such was given yesterday.  It is important that these bodies be included in the legislation from the beginning.<br\/><br\/>The PAS would need to advertise all vacancies by way of a transparent assessment process.  It would be required to consider an applicant's relevant expertise, educational qualifications and personal attributes before making a recommendation to the Minister.  It would also be required to consider the skill sets of current board members.  The Minister has included most of these provisions in his guidelines, but I would prefer to do this by way of legislation.<br\/><br\/>My proposed Bill would require a Minister to ensure a gender balance in appointments to State boards.  The Minister, Deputy Howlin, should be able to accept this proposal.  I have also included a provision that he has not, namely, that direct or indirect canvassing by a person on his or her behalf or on behalf of a candidate for a position to a State board should not be permitted.  This point needs to be stitched into the legislation, as that is how the PAS does its business.<br\/><br\/>The essential difference between this legislation and the Government's proposal is that Fianna F&aacute;il believes the matter must be dealt with on a statutory basis, not by way of guidelines that have been drawn up to assist Ministers.<\/p><p>While the Minister probably will state they are mandatory, I note mandatory guidelines still are only guidelines and do not have the effect of law.  If, as the Minister, Deputy Howlin, states, the Government is genuinely serious about political reform and if it is committed to real openness and transparency, I believe it will accept this legislation because much of what I propose mirrors much of what is contained in the Minister's guidelines.  I have a few additional points in my legislation and I believe that if the Government is sincere about openness and transparency in respect of appointments to State boards, it will accept this Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600028#AA01400","speaker":"1100","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1417009800,"counter":383,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600029#BB00200","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1417009800,"counter":384,"content":"<p>It is not opposed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600029#BB00300","speaker":"1098"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1417009800,"counter":385,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1417009800,"counter":386,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600029#BB00500","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1417009800,"counter":387,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600029#BB00600","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1417009800,"counter":388,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Membership of Committee: Motion","time":1417009800,"counter":389,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600029#BB00800"},{"type":"speech","time":1417009800,"counter":390,"content":"<p>I move:<blockquote>That Deputy Charles Flanagan (<i>Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade<\/i>) be discharged from the Committee on Members&rsquo;

The national car test, NCT, is a vitally important innovation.  It has saved lives and made our roads and vehicles safer.  Most people are obliged to have their cars tested every three years.  An issue arises, however, in the context of the long waiting lists for car tests in some areas, particularly where I reside.  I am aware of one centre at which the waiting period for an NCT is four months and of another at which it is three and a half months.  These waiting times are unreasonable.  People should be able to expect to have their cars tested within one month of applying.<\/p><p>  This is becoming an extremely serious issue because the penalties for not having a current certificate are severe.  One's car can be impounded, one can be fined up to &euro;2,000 or one can be imprisoned.  I suggest, therefore, that the Minister consider changing the regulations in order that such penalties might be waived in instances where people already have appointments for tests but where the relevant date is beyond the expiry dates on their current certificates.  I am aware that people can apply 90 days prior to their certificates expiring and all kinds of advertising campaigns, etc., are in train to try to encourage them to do so.  However, people are only human and they often wait until a month or six weeks prior to expiration before applying for the test.  They then discover that they will be obliged to wait for four months for a test.  Does this mean that they are obliged to keep their cars off the road for a month or six weeks while they await tests?  Does it mean that when they drive to the test centre, they are breaking the law?  Will such people have the penalties imposed if they are intercepted by the Garda?  As I understand it, this is a straight-to-court offence.<\/p><p>  As already stated, this is a serious matter and it is unreasonable to expect people to wait for up to four months in order to obtain a car test.  In order to overcome this problem, the number of test centres should be increased, facilities should be put in place to ensure that people can have their cars tested in an efficient, effective and timely manner or that the penalties should be waived in circumstances where someone can prove that he or she applied for the test - in good faith - and that his or her car is due to be tested at a date which is later than the expiry date listed on his or her NCT certificate.  This is a reasonable proposal and I ask the Minister to consider it.  From the end of the current year, serious changes will be made to the system.  People should be able to apply for the test a month before their NCT certificates are due to expire and they should be given an appointment for a test within a reasonable period thereafter.<\/p><p>  Perhaps the Minister might indicate what are the current waiting times at each of the 47 NCT centres throughout the country, particularly in respect of online bookings.  Obliging people to ring up and wait for a cancellation before being granted a date for a test is a cause of stress.  Motorists must often take time off work in order to have their cars tested.  This is a serious issue for all kinds of reasons.  Will the Minister outline what is the average waiting time and what are the longest and shortest times?  Why is it that it can take up to four months to have one's car tested in some areas, whereas in others it takes much less time?  Will the Minister indicate the number of people who have been offered free NCTs this year as a result of their not being offered a test within 28 days?  If he does not have that information with him, perhaps the Minister might forward it to me.  Will he indicate the number of cars on the waiting list for tests in general and also the number that are on the emergency or urgent waiting list as a result of the fact that the certificates relevant to them are due to expire within 28 days?<\/p><p>  I do not want to name particular locations but, as already stated, there is one centre where the waiting period is four months and another at which it is three and a half.  I checked the position in respect of a number of centres this morning and discovered that people who apply for tests today will be obliged to wait until 10 February, 18 February, 24 February or 25 February before they can have their cars checked.  Obviously, such dates lie well beyond the period in which one is reasonably expected to have one's car tested.  This is a serious matter and I ask the Minister to deal with it in a serious fashion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600030#CC00200","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speech","time":1417010100,"counter":404,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Stanton for raising this important matter.  I will not be able to provide answers to all the questions he posed.  I will, however, revert to him on those to which I am not in a position to respond now.  I will be able to address some of the broad points he has raised.<\/p><p>  I agree with the Deputy regarding the importance of NCT certificates and the difference they make in terms of ensuring the safety of cars and their occupants.  It is correct that there is currently a strong demand for car tests but I have been informed by the Road Safety Authority that, in national terms, the system is well capable of meeting existing demand.  I have figures in my possession to support this assertion.  If the Deputy is in possession of figures which indicate that this is not the case, I would be very interested in his supplying them to me in order that I might follow up on the matter.<\/p><p>  I wish to make clear that, as Deputy Stanton noted, since 2009 it has been an offence to use on public roads a vehicle which does not have a valid NCT certificate.  At present, this is a straight-to-court offence which attracts five penalty points on conviction.  What I will be doing shortly - by commencing section 10 of the Road Traffic Act 2014 - is bringing this offence within the fixed charge payment system.  This will give people who are found not to have valid NCT certificates the option of receiving three penalty points on payment of the fixed charge rather than, as is currently the case, being automatically required to go to court where they will then receive five penalty points on conviction.  There is a change taking place in order to allow for a larger proportion of the work relating to these offences to be deal with outside the court system.  People who take the option to which I refer will, as already stated, only receive three penalty points.  I am seeking to have the change in question implemented soon and this has given rise to the increased demand to which the Deputy refers.<\/p><p> The National Car Testing Service, NCTS, is required to achieve an average waiting time of no more than 14 days for full tests and no more than seven days for retests, with no individual test centre having a waiting time exceeding 21 days for full tests or 14 days for retests.  The average waiting time in 2013 for a full test was 11.6 days and 4.4 days for a retest.  In the first quarter of this year, the average waiting times were 11.6 days and 3.5 days, respectively.  In quarter 2, these times were 12.1 and 3.3 days, respectively and in quarter 3 they were 10.9 and 2.88 days.<\/p><p> The RSA informs me that the NCTS met all performance standards in regard to waiting times in 2013 and to date in 2014.  There has been some suggestion that there is currently a large backlog of customers waiting three months or more for a test.  I am informed that this is not the case nationally.<\/p><p> Customers who need an early test are currently getting a test appointment, on average, within two weeks, with the vast majority getting their appointments within four weeks.  Retest appointments are, on average, booked within three days.  I will respond further when I hear what the Deputy has to say.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600030#CC00300","speaker":"1007","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1417010700,"counter":406,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his response.  I invite the Minister to go online, enter a car registration number and see what appointment date he is given.  We did it this morning and noticed waiting periods of four months and three and half months in two test centres in my part of the country.  In other areas, we were given the date of mid-February.  Averages are averages but I am interested in individual areas where there are spikes and considerable demand.  Our research this morning does not confirm what the Minister just said, unfortunately.  Perhaps I am missing something.<\/p><p>  People are now being urged to apply for their test 90 days in advance.  This indicates there is considerable pressure on the online system.  This means some test centres are working very hard and doing great work.  This is essential and I am not in any way saying it is not but I am saying certain people are under pressure to have a test done on time and to obtain a valid certificate.  If their cars are not tested on time, they must take them off the road or ring up to try to get an emergency date.  An emergency date might not suit because people may be at work or otherwise, as the Minister knows.<\/p><p>  I invite the Minister to get his officials to check individual test centres around the country to determine the online position of each of them.  In some, the waiting period might be a number of days but I know from the information I gleaned this morning that the waiting periods in some are months.  A very close friend of mine applied on 27 October and received a date of 26 January.  I saw the documentation and know that is exactly the case.<\/p><p>  This is an important issue.  If it cannot be resolved and long delays continue to obtain, will the Minister consider being lenient in the shorter term towards people who apply in good faith and are given a date way beyond the expiry date of their certificate?  They apply in good faith but cannot have their vehicles tested on time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600031#DD00200","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speech","time":1417010700,"counter":407,"content":"<p>Let me respond to the various points the Deputy put to me.  The first concerned the online indication as to when an appointment can be secured.  I have discussed this with the Road Safety Authority and have been told that the indicator shows the average waiting time but that if somebody who needs an NCT to meet his legal requirements telephones his centre directly, he will receive an appointment time inside the required deadline in the vast majority of cases.  From my contact with the Road Safety Authority on this matter, which has been raised with me by constituents and other Oireachtas Members, I have learned the authority is clear that if the time on the website does not meet the needs of the vehicle owner, he should contact his test centre.  All steps are being taken to give people an appointment time that suits their needs.<\/p><p>  Regarding the second point the Deputy made, I will certainly check further to determine whether there is any regional trend behind the national average times that should be of concern.  I have been assured by the Road Safety Authority that this is being managed to ensure people can get their NCT certificate granted or renewed.<\/p><p>  Let me consider the Deputy's final question, on changing the implementation period or lead time.  This has been advertised for quite a while and it has been the subject of radio advertising to raise awareness.  I am planning to enact the measure in early December to make the important change happen.  I expect that if people's NCTS test date is due to fall within a reasonable period, the Garda will exercise discretion.  I will examine the regional allocations to note whether they correspond with the trends alluded to by the Deputy.  However, I must stress again, from having checked with Road Safety Authority, that if contact is made with the NCTS by telephone, an appointment can be given in the timeframe that meets one&rsquo;s needs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600031#DD00300","speaker":"1007"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Housing Provision","time":1417010700,"counter":408,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600031#DD00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1417010700,"counter":409,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, and the Minister of State, Deputy Kevin Humphreys.  I welcome the investment made by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, in social housing.  It is the largest investment in the history of the State and amounts to &euro;3.8 billion.  It is likely to produce in the region of 100,000 units of accommodation in the next five to six years.  Ironically, that is the exact number that was produced in one year alone, 2006, the last great boom year of the Celtic tiger.  The houses that were built then were not suitable for accommodation because of their locations and the incentives that were given.  There were holiday homes, etc., all over the country.  Housing was largely private and there was almost no social housing.  Despite the bumper number of houses built, which was roughly the same as the number built in the same year in England, with its population of 56 million, Ireland, with its population of 4.5 million, was actually building the same number of social houses before the crash as after it.  We now have waiting lists, a severe housing crisis, a problem with people sleeping rough on the streets and homelessness.  The problem is particularly bad in my constituency, to the extent that a new group, Inner City Helping Homeless, has been established to deal with homeless people and rough sleepers in the area.<\/p><p>  What the Minister is doing is extremely welcome but in the short term there is a need for accommodation.  In Gardiner Street Upper in my constituency, 99 units of accommodation, built at a cost to the taxpayer of &euro;17 million, have been lying idle since July, or almost six months.  They are lying idle because of an unseemly row between Dublin City Council and the Catholic Housing Aid Society.  Dublin City Council insists on the differential rent so it will be reasonable for its tenants, who will be taking up 75% of the accommodation.  The Catholic Housing Aid Society insists on what it calls an economic rent.<\/p><p>This means that there must be a deposit of &euro;500 to &euro;600 presented first and then the rent will be between &euro;500 and &euro;700 per month, which is well in excess of social housing anywhere.  We have reached a stage where there is no progress being made on either side.<\/p><p> Tenants who left their accommodation in 2006 at the height of the boom were told by the Catholic Housing Aid Society that they would be back within two to three years, and eight years later they are still not back.  Even though some of them have been allocated the places in the housing they are moving into, there is no sign that they will move in before Christmas.<\/p><p> Six months down the road, new bright warm accommodation developed to the best standards is ready and lying idle.  If tenants moved into that, it would create vacancies elsewhere which would be enormously beneficial to those in overcrowded homes in the present housing crisis.<\/p><p> I call on the Minister of State, Deputy Kevin Humphreys, and the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Kelly, to ensure that the State investment of &euro;17 million is secured and those for whom it was intended get that accommodation before Christmas.  Let that be the Christmas present they get.  There is no reason they should not move in.<\/p><p> The Archbishop of Dublin, on the other side, should be putting pressure on the Catholic Housing Aid Society to ensure that it does not continue to make those demands.  The Catholic Housing Aid Society made the same demands when the funding was being made available from the Government and it had an unseemly wrangle with the Government as it was not satisfied with the funding.  Now they are having this with the tenants and it is the poor tenants who are losing out in the long term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600031#DD00500","speaker":"1006","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1417011300,"counter":411,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Costello for raising this matter.

Both myself and the Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, share his concerns that this modern purpose-built facility has not yet been tenanted and I understand that officials from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government are working closely with Dublin City Council to resolve the matter urgently.<\/p><p>  As Deputy Costello will be aware, this facility was funded under the Department's capital assistance scheme, which provides essential funding to approved housing bodies to give an opportunity to get a decent home to those in categories he outlined, especially those with disabilities, the homeless, emigrants returning from England and elsewhere, and victims of domestic violence.  The Catholic Housing Aid Society is the approved housing body involved with the Fr. Scully project.  The Deputy is correct that &euro;17 million has been spent by the Department on this project.  Officials in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government have been working closely with Dublin City Council during the construction and completion of this building, which, the Deputy will agree, is a fine facility on Gardiner Street.<\/p><p>  In February last, in excess of &euro;26 million was allocated to local authorities nationally by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government in respect of commitments on projects under way under that Department's capital assistance scheme.  A further capital investment of more than &euro;46 million to approved housing bodies for the construction of accommodation was announced in May last to provide a total of 416 units of accommodation for those with special housing needs, including the elderly, persons with an intellectual or physical disability and homeless persons.  Dublin City Council received an allocation of more than &euro;13 million under this programme.<\/p><p>  However, the City Council advised the Department during the summer of difficulties in its negotiations with Catholic Housing Aid Society in agreeing the rent on these units.  Deputy is absolutely correct that this is unseemly.  There are tenants who need to move into that accommodation urgently.  The Department and the Dublin City Council chief executive met on this issue as recently as Monday last.  I understand that the rent levels proposed by Catholic Housing Aid Society in respect of these units exceed the general rents for units funded under the capital assistance scheme and are more in line with market rents, despite &euro;17 million coming from the State.  It is proposed that the rent structure should more reflect the rental accommodation scheme payment or differential rent.<\/p><p>  With the urgent need for housing, this is an intolerable position.  We, as a Government, need to move urgently on it.  As Deputy Costello stated, there are 99 units.  There is a meeting scheduled for Friday next and both the Department and the city council will bring maximum pressure to bear to resolve the issue.  As the Deputy stated, this has a domino effect.  If we can get those units filled, it will create other vacancies.  It involves more than these 99 units.  Dublin City Council has nomination rights over 75% of those 99 units which is part of the conditions of receipt of the &euro;17 million.<\/p><p>  I fully support the Deputy's proposal.  The Minister, Deputy Kelly, is proactive in this regard.  Certainly, we will update the Deputy and the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, of the outcome of Friday's meeting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600032#EE00600","speaker":"1033"},{"type":"speech","time":1417011300,"counter":416,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for the reply.

I have tenants coming along to my advice centres who were moved out of their accommodation in 2006.  Some tenants died in the meantime.  They all were elderly at that time.  The tenants have been given the numbers of the accommodation they are to move into - this would be the 30% that the CHAS has to allocate - but now it appears that none of them will move in before Christmas.  It is a totally unsatisfactory situation.  Dublin City Council cannot do anything about other 70% it has to allocate and it has persons on the waiting list who are in urgent need of accommodation.  Of course, there is the domino effect.  This will create space for others, especially at this point in time when we are in such urgent need of interim housing before the big housing programme comes on stream.<\/p><p>  We need immediate action from the Minister and the voluntary housing association.

That is a rise of 11%.<br\/><br\/>The number of senior managers has increased by that amount over the three and a half years even though there has been a significant reduction in the budgets over the same period.  According to an internal HSE report, the increase took place at a time when the number of nursing and support staff reduced.  The report was presented by the HSE to a joint committee chaired by an official in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s office.  The committee includes a representative from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Health.  The reason the group exists is because the Taoiseach decided more than a year ago to take &ldquo;a hands-on approach&rdquo; to the dysfunctional Department of Health.  That was the beginning of the process to side-step the Minister of the day.  The Taoiseach has ultimately seen that through and we have a new Minister.  Perhaps the new Minister will be able to rescue the Department of Health from the Department of the Taoiseach.<br\/><br\/>This is one issue I know the Minister will wish to raise himself.  He will want to know why there is an increase in the number of white-collar staff at the expense of nurses and doctors in white coats.  I would like the Minister to respond to a point.  I am told a number of hospital managers have made requests for top-up payments and that 85 cases have been referred to the Department of Health for a decision.

The point is quite clear.  The programme for Government outlines the dismantling of the HSE and the establishment of another agency to deliver health care and to bring it under the auspices of the Department of Health.  When Fine Gael was in opposition, it was very clear that it wanted to dismantle the HSE.  It said it was bureaucracy gone mad and wholly inefficient, and other terms were used to describe it on a continual basis to make political capital out of the HSE.  However, we now find that, in government, not only has the bureaucracy the party so much reviled not been reduced, but it has increased.<\/p><p>  The figures, as outlined by Deputy Fleming, are quite shocking.  Senior hospital management has increased by 11% at the same time as there has been an attack on front-line services right across the health service from consultants down.  Could the Minister refocus and reprioritise in order that a recruitment process could be initiated for consultants and others involved in the delivery of key health services that are most needed, namely, front-line services, and that we would stop the feathering of senior hospital management, which is something Fine Gael was opposed to only four years ago?  Could the Minister outline the actions he is taking to ensure funding is available for the delivery of priority front-line services and not for the recruitment of senior hospital management?<\/p><p>  There has been a reduction in staff among the lower clerical grades of 4% at the same time as there has been a huge increase in the number of senior hospital management grades.  There has been an increase in that staff cohort from 273 to 303, an increase of 11%.

At the end of 2014 there will be approximately 97,000 whole-time equivalent, WTE, employees working in the health service.  The figure rises to 102,000 when home helps, graduate nurses on the nurse graduate programme, and staff participating on the support staff intern scheme are included.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>In March 2009, in response to the financial crisis, the Government of the time decided that the numbers employed across the public service must be reduced in order to meet fiscal and budgetary targets and introduced a moratorium on recruitment and promotion in the public service, which the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, has now ended.<br\/><br\/>In order to mitigate the impact on front-line services of the overall reduction in employment numbers, the priority was and is reform of how health services are delivered in order to ensure a more productive and cost effective health service.  The revised working arrangements provided for in the Haddington Road agreement are a pivotal element of that.<br\/><br\/>I will outline the facts in that regard.  There has been a significant reduction of 15,893 employees or 14% of the workforce in the HSE since 2007.  The reduction in the number of staff working in management and administration roles was even higher at 18%.  In contrast, the number of midwives and doctors has gone up since 2011.  The number of nurses has certainly reduced.  We have lost far too many of them, but not as many as might appear to be the case, when one includes the graduate nursing programme and the very large number of nurses who are now employed through agencies.<br\/><br\/>Senior management roles, that is to say, roles at grade 8 and higher, have fallen since September 2007.  It is important to say that this group of managers represents just 1% of all health sector staff and approximately 6% of management and administrative staff.  Numbers employed in middle management roles in the HSE have also fallen since 2007.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>The Haddington Road agreement made provision for the regularisation of long-term acting posts.  Under the agreement, employees who had been working in an acting capacity at a higher grade for a period of two years up to 31<sup><\/sup>December 2012 were to be appointed to these posts on a permanent basis as long as certain conditions were met.  Close to 400 staff in the management and administration category have been regularised in this process, including the 30 senior managers referred to in the article in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>yesterday.  What was not said in the article is that applying the exact same principles, an additional 848 nurses and midwives, 248 social and care professionals, and 26 doctors and dentists were regularised in the exact same way.  Very many more doctors and nurses had their positions regularised than managers or senior managers.<br\/><br\/>In return for the Haddington Road agreement, significant change was sought with regard to how posts of a promotional nature would be covered during periods of future absence.  With effect from 1 October 2013, no payments are made to staff who take on temporary acting-up appointments to cover annual leave, sick leave, special or other leave, or to allow for the completion of a recruitment process.  Instead, staff are expected to take on the role and responsibility of the higher post for such periods without additional pay, provided this period does not exceed three months.<br\/><br\/>While it is a matter for the HSE to determine the composition of its staffing complement, it is important not to underestimate the significant role that management staff play in the direct support of front-line services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600033#FF00600","speaker":"948"},{"type":"speech","time":1417011900,"counter":425,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for the information he supplied.

Perhaps the Minister will be able to provide some indication of the actual savings in the Department of Health and the HSE as a result of the Haddington Road agreement on a year-by-year basis for the period 2013 to 2015, as the agreement is due to expire in 2016.<\/p><p> I note the Minister did not deal with the issue of the top-up payments for senior managers.

As the Minister is aware, commitments were made by this Government to protect front-line staff and that the numbers would be increased where such was needed.  It is evident that there is pressure on all of the major front-line services, such as accident and emergency departments, maternity and theatre services.

Among the things given back was that people who had been acting up and working in a post above their official posts were upgraded into those posts and this included more than 800 nurses, just under 30 doctors and 30 senior managers.  This provision was part of the agreement and it was applied across the board, it was not some form of special deal which only applied to senior managers.<\/p><p>  In reply to Deputy Fleming, I do not have the year-on-year figures for the agreement but I can make them available to the Deputy's office.  Deputy Kelleher may be interested in the figures for the difference between September 2007 and October 2014, which are the most up-to-date figures.  The number of directors has decreased from 218 to 195; the number of senior managers has decreased from 1,013 to 975; the number of middle managers has decreased from 3,736 to 3,516; and the number of general administrative staff has decreased from 13,253 to 10,268 - that is 3,000 of the famous 5,000 middle managers who are now gone.  In that period the number of doctors and midwives has increased but I accept that the number of nurses has decreased and it is an issue I intend to reverse in the coming year.  The recruitment embargo is gone, thankfully, but that does not mean we are awash with cash but it means we have more flexibility within our payroll budget and we can move some of the agency staff back into regular posts, in particular, nursing posts.  I hope to improve the graduate nursing programme to make it more attractive to nurses to encourage more of them to take up those positions and to stay in the country.  If we can agree pay scales with the IMO, we hope to be in a position in the new year to advertise for more than 200 consultant posts.  It will make a big difference if we can agree on the salary.<\/p><p>  The number of top-ups started with about 200 cases and this number has been reduced to 85 over which there remains an argument.  It appears that the people are contractually entitled to those payments.  The alternative is to go to law but the HSE must ensure that it does not incur significant costs in legal fees only to lose the case.  It would make much more sense not to end up spending a fortune on legal fees if the HSE is contractually obliged to make those payments.

This is in marked contrast to the other instances I have cited and yet there are no appeals allowed.  We need to recognise that some women still do not know that they were subjected to this horrific procedure.  There are women who, for emotional reasons, cannot yet bring themselves to come forward.

They know that if they do not accept the Minister's terms their entitlements die with them.  It is a shameful way to treat innocent women who have already been so cruelly treated.

Only medical consultants will give these reports and State-appointed doctors will not.  The scheme will not pay for independent medical reports so this is an attack on less well-off women.  The scheme is procedurally flawed.  Contrary to the UN human rights committee recommendation the scheme offers no individualised assessment nor any right of appeal.  Why is this the case?

Many are elderly and may not want to experience the delay, publicity and financial risks that sometimes come with a court case.  I met the three support groups representing the women last September and their views helped to shape the scheme.  The scheme is supported by two of the three groups.<\/p><p>  Ms Justice Maureen Harding Clark, a retired High Court judge. has been appointed as independent assessor for the scheme.

Women may opt out of the scheme at any stage in the process, up to the point of accepting their award.  It is only on accepting the offer that a woman must agree to discontinue her legal proceedings against any party arising out of a symphysiotomy or pubiotomy.

In my view most of the women will get the higher award because the definition of severe disability in the scheme is three years of symptoms including instability in walking and back pain.

The fines applicable for an offence of evasion, or attempted evasion of excise duty on excisable products were increased significantly in Finance Acts 2008 and 2010.  For a summary conviction, the fine was increased to &euro;5,000 in Finance Act 2008.  For a conviction on indictment, the maximum fine was increased ten-fold under Finance Act 2010 to &euro;126,970.<\/p><p>  The Deputy seeks to separate out the penalties for offences relating to excise duty on mineral oil from offences relating to the other excisable products, that is, tobacco and alcohol products.

On the increase proposed in the maximum fine for an indictable offence to &euro;150,000, the Minister for Finance points out that the courts decide on the fine to be applied in any particular case and in practice do not apply fines up to the existing limits.  Therefore, at present, the Minister is not convinced that any purpose would be served by the proposed increase.  However, I share the Deputy&rsquo;s concern to ensure that penalties are a deterrent and the Minister will keep this matter under review, particularly as more cases are finalised in the courts.<\/p><p>  The Minister does not believe that the penalties and fines for offences relating to excise duty on mineral oil should be set at different levels from those relating to excise duty on tobacco and alcohol products.

The Revenue Commissioners are doing outstanding work in this regard.  They have had considerable success and deserve our full support and backing.  We should encourage everyone with information about those who may be involved in diesel laundering to make that information available to the authorities so that the existing regime can be applied against those involved in an illegal activity that is very damaging for the economy and damaging to many legitimate businesses, particularly those in Border counties.  It is something we should continue to work on.<\/p><p>  I will accept what the Minister of State has said in good faith.  I will not press the amendments.

I raised this issue with the Minister of State in the House last week.  If we cannot secure criminal convictions, we need to ensure that the information that has been collated by the Revenue Commissioners is made available for a civil action because it may be possible to have a civil class action in the future.  The Minister of State was to take the matter up with the Revenue Commissioners.  If he has any response from them, I ask him to furnish me with that response or come back to me later.  Based on SIMI figures, up to 800 people have been affected by petrol stretching across the country.<\/p><p> I asked the Minister on Committee Stage if he examined the possibility of providing financial assistance to people who have been affected, particularly those whose insurance does not cover them or those who have only third party cover.  It is estimated the total cost to motorists of petrol stretching since June of this year is approximately &euro;3 million and in that respect the Exchequer has taken in roughly &euro;400,000 in VAT alone.  If that money could be recouped by those people who cannot access compensation, it would at least provide them with some financial assistance.  The Minister was to examine that issue for Report Stage.<\/p><p> The third issue I wish to raise is one I raised with the Minister for Finance last week, namely, that there is a differential in the standards required in regard to diesel compared to those required in regard to petrol.  The returns and paperwork required of retailers in regard to diesel by the Revenue Commissioners are far higher than those required in regard to petrol.  We need to make sure we can successfully prosecute those who have been involved in this practice.  We also need to consider what financial assistance we can give people and ensure we do not find ourselves in this situation down the road.  The only way to do that is to ensure the level of policing in regard to diesel laundering that has been introduced by the Revenue Commissioners is also introduced in regard to petrol stretching.  The Minister made the argument on Committee Stage that the reason there was a far higher level of scrutiny in regard to diesel was because of the huge potential loss to the Exchequer.  I made the point to him that the potential loss to motorists as a result of petrol stretching is far greater than is the case with diesel laundering and that we need to have similar standards in place.  I hope those issues can be taken on board and that the Minister of State can indicate some progress on those three important issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600036#JJ01400","speaker":"1177","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1417014300,"counter":459,"content":"<p>I support the comments made by my colleagues, Deputies Michael McGrath and Naughten.  The Minister of State will not be surprised to see me on my feet again speaking about petrol stretching.  There is an issue of confidence around petrol supply.  Legitimate retailers who employ people and go through all the necessary steps are being hit in the same way as those who have caused this situation to happen.  Given that 57% of every litre of fuel goes back to the Exchequer through tax, the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners have a duty to restore confidence to the retail fuel market.<\/p><p>  Diesel laundering has been an issue in this country for many years.  I welcome the initiatives in that respect that have been taken by Revenue because there is no doubt such practice has been used to fund illicit activities, attacks on the State etc.  As Deputy Naughten has laid out, we now need urgently to tackle the problem of petrol stretching but there is no sign of such urgency.  It is August since this problem first came to light and we are no further on in terms of the public seeing a response or outcome to the investigations.  I emphasise the damage that has been caused in an area stretching from County Mayo to County Roscommon up as far as County Meath.  This has caused people inconvenience socially and in respect of their family life and also financial damage but people do not see any response to tackling it.  If they went out with green diesel in their car in the morning, Revenue would be down on them like a tonne of bricks testing them.  Some people have been left with two cars in the yard that they cannot use because they went in good faith to buy petrol from a legitimate and branded operator, like we all do, and they are now suffering the consequences but they do not see anybody responding to their situation.  The Minister, the Revenue Commissioners and Customs and Excise have a duty to restore confidence in our retail fuel market because if they do not, they will drive more people to the illicit operators.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600037#KK00200","speaker":"1071"},{"type":"speech","time":1417014300,"counter":460,"content":"<p>I want to pick up on the issue of petrol stretching.  This saga has been going on for months and we know the Revenue Commissioners and the Garda have been investigating it.  Rather than repeat the points that have been made, I would like to have clarity on whether Customs and Excise has got a handle on the chain of supply, namely, from where this fuel came.  In particular, the Minister of State might confirm if reports stating a contaminated batch of petrol in Bournemouth in May or June, which was deemed unfit for use in the UK, was subsequently imported into this country.  What testing of such fuel entering the country was done by Customs and Excise?  What testing of trucks is being carried out on roadsides?  Since the problem came to light, petrol tanks in filling stations are being tested.  That can be compared to the situation that prevails in regard to diesel which has been happening as a matter of practice.<\/p><p>  There still seems a great many unknowns and there have definitely not been the prosecutions with people being brought to justice that we would like to see, considering the shocking damage and financial loss suffered by many ordinary citizens as a result of petrol stretching.  We need to see some answers formulated and some quality assurance for people that when they go to petrol stations and fill their petrol tanks that the fuel they purchase is of quality and will not damage their vehicles.  While there are many components in petrol perhaps an initiative could be funded by petrol suppliers and wholesalers to provide an independent assessment or quality assurance in respect of fuel for customers and the process tightened up.  I know investigations are taking place but there does not seem to be too much by way of answers.  The Minister of State might respond to the point I raised about contaminated fuel having been imported into the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600037#KK00300","speaker":"1070"},{"type":"speech","time":1417014300,"counter":461,"content":"<p>The debate has moved on considerably from the amendment tabled by Deputy McGrath and that is understandable and perfectly acceptable given the seriousness of the issue.  I will not have all the answers to hand on some of the wider issues outside of the Finance Bill but I have discussed this with my officials and I will ensure that we revert to each of the Deputies on the issues they raised.<\/p><p>  To pick up on Deputy Naughten's comments, I know he had an exchange with the Minister for Finance on Committee Stage and he asked that consideration be given to an amendment to provide the same reporting conditions for petrol as currently apply to diesel.  The Minister has given this consideration.  Section 101 of the Finance Act 1999 provides that all mineral oil traders dealing in marked mineral oil, petrol or auto diesel must hold a mineral oil trader's licence issued by the Revenue Commissioners.  Section 101(7) of the Act provides that the commissioners may specify the conditions applying to an auto fuel trader's licence and a marked fuel trader's licence and they may specify different conditions, having regard to the activities to which the licence relates.  Accordingly, under the current legislation, the commissioners are empowered to apply the same reporting conditions to the supply of all mineral oils.  However, until recently fuel fraud was largely confined to diesel laundering and in view of the low risk and large volume of petrol transactions up until recently, it was not considered necessary by Revenue to impose the additional administrative burden of daily reporting on the mineral oil trader for petrol transactions.  However, in light of recent events and concerns that have been expressed by Members in this House and during the Committee Stage debate, the Revenue Commissioners, at the request of the Minister for Finance, are now reviewing this approach with regard to the reporting of petrol transactions.  That is important and welcome.<\/p><p>  As the commissioners are already empowered to specify that mineral oil traders dealing in petrol and diesel are subject to the same conditions and as it does not provide any additional assistance in that regard, the Minister would not be minded to accept an amendment but the Deputy will be able to see where the Minister wishes to go.  We can assure the Deputy that the situation is being actively reviewed.<\/p><p>  We already discussed on a previous occasion in this House the fact that staff resources within the State laboratory have now been prioritised in regard to this area.  That is quite important.  A large number of samples are awaiting testing.  Speaking from memory, I think I gave figures to the House on the last occasion that one prosecution was pending and that there is a possible second prosecution.<\/p><p>  From midnight on 31 March next year, there will be a new marker in use for all marked fuels, including kerosine, that will make the detection of the presence of marked fuels more effective.  The new marker will be implemented in Ireland and in the UK simultaneously.<\/p><p>The Minister for Finance is taking this issue seriously.  I hear clearly the frustration of Deputies on all sides of the House in relation to the frustration being expressed to them in their constituencies by people who have been adversely affected.  The Minister has considered the issue of a VAT rebate on car repairs post-petrol stretching.  We are guided by the EU VAT directive with which Irish VAT law must comply.  EU VAT law does not allow for reductions in VAT based on a particular category of purchaser: in this case, persons affected by fuel crimes.  A charge of VAT is based on the nature of the particular good or service supplied.<br\/><br\/>While we are not minded to accept the amendments put forward by Deputy McGrath I understand the logic by which they were put forward.  As I have outlined, the courts do not currently apply the existing maximum levels of fines available to them.  Obviously, a practical difficulty arises in relation to a summary conviction and the level of charge permitted within the District Court.<br\/><br\/>This is a matter which we are taking seriously.  I think the Minister had a good engagement with Deputies on it on Committee Stage.  I hope Deputies will welcome the progress made in terms of Revenue reviewing its approach to petrol <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>diesel.

I would like further clarification on the provision of financial assistance in this area similar to that provided in the context of the home refurbishment incentive scheme which has been extended to landlords.  In that case, landlords or private home owners do not get a VAT refund but they do get an allowance against their tax at the VAT rate of 13.5%.  Last week, I made the point to the Minister that the equivalent of a VAT refund is being paid to people under the home refurbishment scheme through a roundabout mechanism while a couple in my constituency whose cars are eight years old and ten years old and who both earn minimal wages and have three young children have no cars to get to work tomorrow morning because of damage caused by petrol stretching.  For them, Christmas has been cancelled.  The Exchequer is taking in &euro;400,000 on the back of the measure introduced to address petrol stretching.  Surely, it is possible to introduce some type of innovative mechanism to assist families affected by damage caused to their cars owing to petrol stretching.  I understand that the amount that could be provided would be only small and that it would not solve their problems, but it would be of some assistance to them in situations where their insurance provider, even though they have comprehensive insurance, refuses to cover them.  In the case I mentioned, that family cannot afford comprehensive insurance and because they have had only third party insurance, they are not covered at all.<\/p><p>  Deputy Mulherin referred to contaminated fuel having been taken off the market in the UK and the concern that that batch of fuel may have ended up here.

I do not expect the Government is going to make any move on this.  In fact, I do not believe any of the Report Stage amendments will be accepted.<br\/><br\/>This amendment relates to the pension levy.  The Minister, Deputy Noonan, made a promise to the pension industry which it took at face value but he then broke that promise.  He said that the pension levy would be abolished within a timeframe that was shorter than that for which it had been in existence, but it is still in place and causing many problems in the pensions industry.  We face a serious challenge over the next few years in terms of private and public sector pensions.  We are starting to see the collapse of private and semi-State pensions, as happened in relation to Aer Lingus.  There is a great deal more of this to come.<br\/><br\/>Public pensions, which I mentioned yesterday in this Chamber, are not safe either.  The ratio of workers to pensioners is moving from 5.5:1 to 2:1.  By the time we get to 2:1, based on the fact that public sector pensions are funded out of current taxation, there will not be enough workers to fund them.  People who are currently clocking up public sector pensions and hoping to retire in 20 or 30 years need to think about this too because there are not going to be enough workers to pay their pensions.<br\/><br\/>Part of the problem is the private pension sector and what the Government has done and continues to do every year in this area.  Essentially, the Government is taking people's assets.  What it is doing is the equivalent of reaching into everybody's deposit accounts and taking money out of them every year.  It is not a tax on the profits or the yield from the pension fund every year, rather it is a grab on the actual amount within it.  That is no different from reaching into people's current bank accounts and taking their money out.  The fact that the levy is still in place is as damaging as its introduction because the pensions industry no longer believes this Government.<br\/><br\/>This amendment seeks to signal clearly to the industry that the pension levy is being phased out.  It seeks not that it be eradicated in the first year but that what is currently provided for is halved, with the intention of it being fully eliminated the following year.  As I said earlier, I do not expect the Government to accept this amendment but it is worth making the point that the Government's behaviour and, in particular, the behaviour of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, in terms of his having broken his promise to the pensions industry has caused an awful lot of damage and should be recognised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600038#LL01500","speaker":"1107"},{"type":"speech","time":1417015500,"counter":477,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Donnelly for his amendment and for the engagement on this issue.  As the Deputy outlined, in last year's budget and in the subsequent Finance Act, the Minister introduced an additional levy of 0.15% on pension fund assets for 2014 and 2015.  He did this, in the main, to continue to help fund the jobs initiative, launched in 2011.  The measures included, in particular, the VAT reduction to 9% on tourism-related activities.  They have been successful in both protecting and creating employment in the economy and it is an initiative the Minister is eager to continue.  The original 0.6% levy on pension fund assets ended this year and the 0.15% levy will end after next year.  We can give an absolute assurance on that matter.

I am very concerned about the Government's plans to essentially introduce a new, or an expanded, tax on inheritance.  Put simply, what the Government proposes to do is to limit tax exemptions for a parent who wants to provide support to his or her child if that child is over 18 years of age, or is not in full-time education, to &euro;3,000 per year.  This is on top of the 33% lowering of the threshold over the lifetime for tax relief on gifts or inheritances from a parent to a child which has taken place over the past three years, specifically since 2012 when these changes began.<br\/><br\/>What I would like to highlight is the unfairness that exists when one starts to look at the distinction that can be drawn between two children, one of whom goes directly into full-time education at 18 years of age and another who does not for a variety reasons.  In these straitened times, many children are not going directly into full-time education.  They are delaying it, deferring it or are doing it in a part-time capacity, none of which will be covered by the exemption in the legislation.  I consider that to be an entirely unfair scenario.  Another example is where a child is over 25 years of age and has faced illness, or who for some other reason, does not potentially benefit from the same exemptions as is currently the case.<br\/><br\/>The Revenue Commissioners issued a statement last week or the week before that the changes would not include the imposition of a tax on board or lodgings, food or other services provided by a parent to children over 18 years of age or over 25 years of age, depending on the circumstances, but we do not have any detail or clarity as to how the Revenue Commissioners intend to implement this amended legislation.  This information should be published prior to the adopting of this legislation and not after it.  We simply do not know how it will operate. <br\/><br\/>Some &euro;3,000 per year in tax free gifts from a parent may sound somewhat reasonable but what is not said is that every gift from a parent to a child is included and many of them are gifts we would take for granted, for example, a deposit towards a house, paying for a wedding, which is the norm in this country, a car or money to start up a business.  All of those payments or gifts valued above &euro;3,000 in a year will increase the amount of tax liability for a child when, or if, he or she inherits from their parents.  <br\/><br\/>Currently, there is a lifetime tax relief of &euro;225,000.  It is a significantly diminished amount from where it was a few years ago.  This lifetime tax used to be linked to inflation in the economy.  This was the case for decades so as to avoid a situation where, if house prices increased rapidly, children would not be left with huge tax bills and huge liabilities on inheritance.  This changed in 2010 in order to meet various troika targets.  The cap was lowered and indexation was eliminated.  That did not have a particularly negative impact in 2012 when house prices were on the floor but things have changed.  The average house price in Dublin now is &euro;242,600, which is &euro;25,000 above the current threshold for tax exemption for inheritance on once-off gifts.  If a parent dies in the morning and leaves his or her house to his or her children, they will have to pay a 33% tax on that &euro;25,000 difference.  That is just an average house price but in Dublin, many house prices are a lot higher than that.  That is assuming that the parent did not give their children any other help along the way by way of the kinds of gift I mentioned, whether a deposit for a house, assistance with a loan for a business or paying for a wedding.  If the parent gave them other assistance when they were over 18 years of age or over 25 years of age, that will now be taxed at 33%.  A child will, in essence, be paying on the double.  <br\/><br\/>For every investment a parent makes in his or her child over the age of 18, if the child is not in full-time education, or over 25 years of age in a case where the child was in full-time education, which is above &euro;3,000 a year, that will increase the amount of their inheritance, which will be taxed at 33% in the future.  It is profoundly unfair.<\/p><p>It mitigates against the sort of society where families help each other and are not reliant on the State for a range of supports that they would otherwise need.  It is illogical.  It would be more honest if the Minister of State would tell us this is not a tax focused on the super wealthy but that it will affect ordinary people the length and breadth of the country.  The Government is forecasting a 20% rise in the amount of revenue it will collect next year.  For context there was a virtually identical number of deaths in 2011 and 2012 according to the Central Statistics Office, CSO, but the tax collected on inheritance in those years increased by 20%.  That is illuminating because it shows the intention of the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Finance and the Minister for Finance is to raise additional revenues by broadly applying this to ordinary citizens.  The notion that this closes a loophole for the super wealthy does not stack up.  The proof is in what has happened over the past few years and the fact that this will apply to everybody.  It will disadvantage parents who work hard, pay their taxes honestly and want to support and help children, particularly those who are trying to improve their lot in life or children who have fallen on hard times and need financial support from their parents.  They will be punished for getting that support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600039#MM00600","speaker":"1186","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1417016100,"counter":484,"content":"<p>I could not have put it better myself.

There is a second issue which the Revenue Commissioners have clarified but which I would like to hear the Government clarify as well.  The fact that the Revenue Commissioners had to clarify it means that this is a badly written and badly thought through amendment to the principal Act.  The issue is that people could be taxed for living with their parents.  The Revenue Commissioners have said that is not the case but that is their interpretation.  I hope that is not what the Government proposed.

I have great regard for them and assume they have identified a pattern of abuse which leads to this change.  If wealthy parents dole out tens of thousands of euro to Johnnie every year to circumvent the lifetime threshold that loophole should be closed off.  The Minister of State needs to clarify the type of payments that will be permissible under the new regime as proposed.  He tabled an amendment on Committee Stage to deal with ongoing payments in respect of a grown-up child with a disability, a mental or physical incapacity.  That was warmly welcomed.<\/p><p>  A bigger issue is that over the past few years the threshold of the allowable lifetime gift from a parent to a child has been reduced by 60% to &euro;225,000 and the rate of capital acquisitions tax has gone up from 20% to 33%.  For many families when a house is passing from one generation to another a very substantial inheritance tax liability would be triggered which will force the sale of the property to settle the tax liability.  That is a separate issue and I agree with Deputy Creighton that the threshold should be index-linked again.  That would be a very modest change.

Many of these families struggle to make ends meet on a day-to-day basis.

There is a degree of uncertainty as to how this provision will be interpreted.  What is the position where, in a situation of relationship or marital breakdown a spouse, civil partner or cohabiting partner succeeds in getting a lump sum payment order from the courts to facilitate paying for educational and support expenses for a child over 18 years of age, and that lump sum order is of a substantial amount - it may be intended to pay university fees over a four to six year period, and include postgraduate or doctorate fees?  In the context of this provision could that have unintended tax consequences?  Could it be taken into account for the purpose of capital acquisitions tax at a time when the court making the order did not intend that would be the case?<\/p><p>  I have a great deal of sympathy with some of the problems raised in this area and Deputy Michael McGrath might find it odd to discover that we have one concern in common although the increase in the thresholds occurred during the lifetime of the previous Government.  As someone who was a member of the current Government for three years I know the increase in capital acquisitions tax in these areas, in the thresholds and the rates was part and parcel of very difficult action that had to be taken at a time when the State was teetering on the edge of bankruptcy. <\/p><p>Funding had to be identified and obtained from different sources to meet the day-to-day expenditure of the State and to assist in the balancing of the books.  The change in the thresholds appeared to be reasonable a couple of years ago, when residential property prices had crashed and were still in enormous difficulty.  I will give a practical example.  Residential property prices and values in the city and county of Dublin had decreased by 50%.  I believe these thresholds are no longer appropriate in the context of where the residential housing market is today and where it is anticipated it is likely to go over the next couple of years.  It is of crucial importance for this area to be revisited in the next budget.  It is also crucial that Fine Gael is not constrained by the Labour Party into prescribing penal rates of capital acquisitions tax in return for a deal on some other aspect of the budget.<br\/><br\/>It is important and in the public interest to highlight where we now stand.  I am particularly concerned with the position of the children - sons and daughters - of deceased parents.  As Deputy Creighton rightly pointed out, the 33% rate of inheritance tax kicks in from a threshold of &euro;225,000, regardless of whether it is inheritance <i>simpliciter<\/i>or a mixture of inheritance and gifts.  The 2014 threshold of &euro;225,000 is actually more penal than the threshold that applied in 1995, when the threshold before inheritance tax arose was &euro;226,267.  Given that the value of money has substantially changed in the intervening 20 years, it is clear that we are now providing for inheritance tax to be applied at a substantially lower level.  That comparator is very stark.  In 1995, one could inherit &euro;226,000 worth of property or assets in any part of the country without having any tax liability.  In 2014, one can inherit &euro;225,000 worth of property without liability.  I have not done a computation to assess what the monetary value of &euro;226,000, as it was in 1995, would be in today's terms.  I suspect that if I took a reasonable stab at it, I would find it is not less than &euro;325,000.  We now have what I would describe as a penal threshold for the payment of inheritance tax.<br\/><br\/>In the period between 1 December 1999 and 19 November 2008, inclusive, the rate of inheritance tax was 20%.  We had a lower threshold and a less penal rate at that time.  The rate was increased to 25% during the lifetime of the previous Government and it is now 33% as a result of a decision taken during the lifetime of this Government.  I believe sons and daughters should be allowed to inherit a reasonable amount of property from their parents, who have lawfully and properly acquired assets, paid taxes and met their financial and personal obligations, without having to incur penal tax rates.  In a sense, inheritance tax is a little like the robber baron coming back for a second time.  Even though taxes relating to the acquisition of property and taxes on the acquisition of income were previously paid by the deceased, the State dips into the pockets of the deceased again to secure for the benefit of the State and to meet State expenditure a portion of properties and assets lawfully acquired by the deceased.<br\/><br\/>Most countries in the EU and across the world have some level of inheritance tax.  In principle, I think it is defendable, but not when it reaches expropriation levels.  My concern is that the legitimate issues which are being raised here would be of less importance if the threshold was higher and the rates were not as penal.  The real problem here is that in years to come, when parents pass on, the primary inheriting generation is likely to be the generation that has lived through the economic and financial collapse.  Many people in that generation are currently over-burdened with borrowings and in negative equity.  We should not apply a penal inheritance tax threshold and rate to the same people all over again.  The problem that is being raised with regard to the technical drafting of this section of the Finance Act and the uncertainty about how it might be applied is hugely exacerbated by the threshold being too low and the level of payment being so high.<br\/><br\/>I will explain why the threshold is now inappropriate.  One of today's newspapers - I am speaking from recollection, as I do not have it in front of me - reported that property prices in the Dublin and County Dublin area have increased by between 16% and 18% over a 12-month period.  We are now in a space where we expect property prices to continue to increase for a time.  The blindingly obvious reason for that relates to the type of property collapse that was experienced by this State.  Traditionally, property falls to at least 20% below what should be its real value.  In this case, it had climbed to substantially above its real value during the property bubble.  When the State's finances stabilised, as has now happened, there was always going to be a bounce, as opposed to a second bubble.  The effect of the recent bounce means that the current threshold is dramatically out of sync.  I do not think Members of this House, particularly those who represent urban areas, will disagree with that.  I know property prices in rural areas are recovering at a slower rate, not as dramatically as in the cities and certainly not as dramatically as in Dublin.<br\/><br\/>I do not believe a son or a daughter who inherits a property in the city or county of Dublin now - a house, an apartment or a bungalow or whatever other residential form it comes in - will be regarded as inheriting something of great luxurious value if its current value is &euro;225,000.  There are apartments in this State that one might have been able to buy for less than &euro;200,000 four years ago, but that one could not buy for less than &euro;300,000 now.  There has been a substantial and dramatic change.  If we do not want to unduly burden individuals who lawfully inherit property on which tax has already been paid, we need to substantially increase the thresholds.  I think that is the first issue.  I hope the thresholds will be increased to a minimum of &euro;300,000 in the next budget.  Ultimately, we will need to consider reducing the 33% rate that has to be paid when one exceeds the inheritance threshold of &euro;225,000.  I suggest that the retention of the current rate will force young married couples who inherit property to sell their property to generate the payment that needs to be made or to raise borrowings unnecessarily and thereby burden themselves with the repayments that arise in circumstances in which, in the past, no such repayment would have arisen.<br\/><br\/>Finally, I think it would be instructive when comparing the positions in 1995 and 2014 to look at where we were in 2009.  In 2009, a son or daughter could inherit property to the value of &euro;542,544 without any inheritance tax liability arising at all.  That was the threshold.  I can understand why some Members of this House might argue that such a threshold for inheritance tax liability was somewhat high.<\/p><p>Unfortunately, I can recollect how, at the time of the property bubble, that threshold in Dublin would have got one a fairly modest semi-detached home for a family with a relatively small garden.  That is where we were at that time.  I am not necessarily advocating that the threshold should come up to &euro;544,000, but it is an extraordinarily dramatic difference between having had no inheritance or, indeed, gift tax liability until one acquired from one's parent an asset the value of which exceeded &euro;544,000 and, when one had to pay tax, it was at a rate of 20%, and being in a position where, if one inherits assets to a value in excess of &euro;225,000, one now pays tax at a rate of 33%.  This is a serious issue that requires addressing.  I appreciate it was not possible to address it in the current budget.  It is very important that this issue be revisited and addressed next autumn.  In the intervening period, it is important that the issues the Deputies opposite have raised about the application of these particular sections in this year's Finance Bill be clarified.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600040#NN00500","speaker":"1025","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1417017300,"counter":490,"content":"<p>There has been a great deal of media commentary on this section.  That commentary has stemmed from Arthur Cox, a law firm with many clients at the top levels of Irish society.  I am not sure that they are sons or daughters whose parents are passing small or moderate amounts of money on to them.  However, that does not take away from the issues with this section of the Bill that have been genuinely or otherwise highlighted.<\/p><p>  As with other matters that we addressed on Committee Stage, Revenue has issued guidelines on how this process will apply, but there is a degree of uncertainty about it.  As Deputy Michael McGrath stated, if this is a question of closing the loophole, and keeping in mind what Revenue or departmental officials have stated about people trying to make cash payments of &euro;150,000, such transactions should not be allowed.  It is as simple as that.  There is probably an ideological debate to be had about whether the State should interfere if a parent wants to give something to a child.  It could be genuinely argued for, although I would disagree.  Aside from that, I also disagree with the idea of taxing a parent's provision of lodgings, small gifts and small supports to a child, which I understand is not the intended case.<\/p><p>  The debate has entered into a wider field to address the appropriate threshold to tax children's inheritance from their parents.  I assume the reverse would be applicable like it currently is, with a threshold of &euro;225,000.  I actually believe that this threshold is fine.  It has to do with the debate of whether there should ever be a tax on a transfer from a parent to a child.  The high thresholds of the past were inappropriate.<\/p><p>  There are ways around paying inheritance tax, for example, if one lives in a house or apartment for a number of years before being gifted it, establishing of trusts, etc.  People are constantly availing of these methods.  Those who are well-off and have multiple properties can avail of the expertise that allows them to do this.  However, exempting &euro;225,000 from inheritance tax is fair.  Property prices are escalating rapidly, for example, by more than 25% and 23% this year for apartments and houses, respectively, in the capital city and by 16% across the State.  We need to remain cognisant of that situation, but increasing the thresholds because of the possibility of an emerging property bubble is not an appropriate Government response.  Rather, we must deal with the issues underlying the rapid increase in house prices.<\/p><p>  When someone inherits something from a parent, although the first &euro;225,000 is exempt from tax, it remains an asset for that person.  It is not his or her family home.  Rather, it is a rental property or a property that he or she will sell on regardless.  It is sometimes suggested that inherited properties are kept as shrines to mothers or fathers.  That may be the case in some scenarios, but the properties are sold in many cases and the benefit accrues to the children.  Deputy Shatter argued that to do this would be to tax them twice.  I have difficulty trying to find anything that is not taxed twice.  If a company down the road creates a bar of chocolate, we tax the company on the supplies needed to make it, we tax the company on its profits, we tax the shop the bar is sold in, we tax the consumer who buys it and, when the wrapper is disposed of, we tax the waste company.  Anyone who understands taxation will know that the bar is taxed approximately eight times.  Inheritance tax should be no different.<\/p><p>  Reverting to the substantive issue, we need clarity on the questions raised today about whether this section of the Bill will be too burdensome.  Will it achieve the Department's stated intention of closing a loophole or can it be abused by penalising those parents who support their children in modest ways?  I hope the Government's aim for this section is not the latter, but to clamp down on those who use the loophole to transfer substantial amounts of wealth to their children without paying tax on same.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600042#PP00200","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speech","time":1417017300,"counter":491,"content":"<p>I concur with most of the contributions made so far.  I have an ideological difficulty with the concept of an inheritance tax.  Recently, I read an historical document about a landed estate that ceased to exist during the early part of the last century because of the payment of debt duties.<br\/><br\/>No less than other Deputies, I get around quite a bit.  I have never met anyone who likes paying tax.  Most people are compliant because they are concerned they might be caught out, but they would avoid paying if they could get away with it.  That is human nature and it is important that we acknowledge this.<br\/><br\/>In Adam Smith's <i>An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations<\/i>, one of the four desirable characteristics of taxation is fairness.  Something is inherently unfair in a tax that, to be paid, could necessitate the property's sale by a family member.  I do not care what perceived echelon of society one is in, be it Arthur Cox's, Arthur Fox's or whoever's.  It is immaterial.  If a tax is unfair, it is as unfair in Carnsore Point as it is in Malin Head or Merrion Square.<br\/><br\/>Deputy Creighton referred to students, lodgings, etc.  It is impossible to see how that system could be implemented.  Another desirable characteristic of taxation is that implementing it must be possible.<br\/><br\/>This issue will not bring people out onto the streets.  We will not have marches about it.  While it has received some publicity, most people will not be aware of it until they face the difficult situation of, following a bereavement, they are told by their solicitors or accountants that a large payment must be made.  We have all encountered people who were unaware of certain elements of the tax code until they were hit with them.  It can cause a great deal of difficulty.<br\/><br\/>I hope that the Minister of State will accept this amendment.  If he does not, it is imperative that the Government articulate why this change has been made.  At least let people know about it.<\/p><p>I do not expect to see Government backbenchers on the plinth trying to sell this as something that will gain them favour with the public.  However, there is an onus on the Government to point out these things.  I believe Deputy Shatter mentioned a threshold of &euro;542,000 in 2009 and, if I am correct, the rate then was still at 20%.  There has been a huge change during the downturn in recent years.  I note rather cynically that were one to encounter a speeding fine back at the height of the Celtic tiger, it was &euro;80.  It still is &euro;80 and Members have never sought to reduce that fine.  Taxation should be upfront and should be on the wealth one creates, not the wealth one accumulates, because it does not encourage people to invest in a country if it has such penal rates of taxation on something one has created and one wishes to pass on to one's family.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600042#PP00300","speaker":"1184","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1417017900,"counter":493,"content":"<p>I thank Members for their wide-ranging contributions on this issue and on these amendments.  This has been useful and I will endeavour to respond to as many of the queries raised as possible.  At the outset, it is important to state this is not a new tax and the idea is not to introduce an expansionary tax.  The idea is to address a reality on which the Government has been advised by Revenue.  In this context, I will respond to Deputy Michael McGrath's call to give some tangible examples of what precisely the Government is responding to from Revenue.<\/p><p>  We have a scenario in which an exemption is being applied in situations in which it was never intended to be applied by any party in this House during the debate on any Finance Bill.  It is also important to state that, as some Deputies have observed, no tax at all is paid until the aggregate of all gifts exceeds &euro;225,000.  One does not pay a single euro until one reaches that point.  I wish to inform the House that the Revenue Commissioners, in the course of their compliance programmes, have established that this exemption, designed to cater for normal everyday payments related to the provision of support, maintenance and education for people's children, is being abused.<\/p><p>  For reasons of taxpayer confidentiality, the Revenue Commissioners will not give the Government a list of names, but they have provided some anonymised examples, which are worth sharing with Members.  The first example is where an exemption was claimed where a wealthy individual gifted a house worth &euro;400,000 to an adult child.  In the second example, an exemption was claimed in respect of a &euro;90,000 cash gift to an adult child to purchase a car and furnish and maintain a house.  The adult child was not a dependant, that is, not one of the dependent relatives discussed earlier and had a substantial income in that person's own right.  The third example with which Revenue has provided me is of a taxpayer who has given free use of a credit card, through which more than &euro;150,000 was gifted over a two-year period.<\/p><p>  These are realities that are being faced by Ireland's taxing authority today and in a time of scarce resources, the Oireachtas at present is allowing this to carry on.  The Government is endeavouring to close that loophole in this Finance Bill.  This is an attempt to rectify the fact that, currently, an exemption that never was meant to be used for such a purpose is being so used.  I doubt it is a purpose for which this House ever intended its use.  It is also important to note that over and above payments for support, maintenance or for education, the legislation also exempts from capital acquisition tax gifts of up to &euro;3,000 in any one year from any one person.  Thus, two parents can gift &euro;6,000 to each child in any year without giving rise to a capital acquisitions tax liability.  Gifts over this amount only give rise to such liability if the group tax threshold of &euro;225,000 pertaining to parents and children is fully used.  Beyond these exemptions, it is difficult to justify making any further allowance to parents who seek other means of making tax-free gifts to their children by trying to bring them within the terms of section 82 of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act 2003.<\/p><p>  As for some of the points raised, one logical and important point concerned wedding gifts.  Each parent can make a gift of &euro;3,000 in any year to each of the persons getting married.  In effect, this means it is possible that a gift of up to &euro;12,000 can be given by parents without incurring a capital acquisitions tax liability.  Obviously, if only one parent is involved, the maximum tax-free amount is &euro;6,000.  If the amount of the gift is more than that, the gift would be subject to gift tax, but, of course, the gift again would not give rise to a tax liability unless the &euro;225,000 exemption threshold available to the child has been used against other gifts or inheritance from his or her parents.  While I think Deputy Michael McGrath and others may have clarified this matter, I refer to adult children who are permanently incapacitated by reasons of physical or mental infirmity and who are dependant on parents.  Obviously, the amendments being proposed by the Government in the Finance Bill do not apply and there is no change to that scenario, and rightly so.<\/p><p>  In respect of the discussion on property prices - there also was a broader contribution by Deputy Shatter - the property market continues to improve, with positive developments that originally had been restricted to the Dublin area now manifesting themselves in other areas of the country, albeit thus far not to the same extent.  I recognise there are supply issues in certain areas of the Dublin property market.  The group tax-free thresholds are kept under review in the same way as other relevant tax provisions, and in this regard, it is important that the Government bears in mind for future budgets the comments of Deputies Shatter, Creighton and others in respect of these thresholds.  As Deputy Shatter quite correctly outlined to the House, the Government has found itself constrained on many levels in its three and a bit years in office.  However, as we move into a different period of economic recovery, these issues are being kept under review by the Minister for Finance.<\/p><p>  It is important to put some figures on the record of a House.  As one is only taxed on amounts over &euro;225,000, a child who inherits &euro;250,000 will pay a tax of approximately &euro;8,000.  The question for the House is whether that is penal and I do not believe it is.  A child who inherits &euro;300,000, which is a huge sum to ordinary people, will pay approximately &euro;25,000.  However, I acknowledge the issue of thresholds is a valid point that no doubt will be looked at and reviewed by the Minister for Finance.  As for the question posed by Deputy Shatter, whose legal knowledge is much greater than mine, I am informed by my officials that the transfer of assets on the dissolution of a marriage or civil partnership is exempt from capital acquisitions tax under section 88 of that Act, but I would be happy to have further engagement with Deputy Shatter on that issue.<\/p><p>  For these reasons, the Government does not propose to accept the amendments.  Constructive comments have been made in respect of thresholds and the need for them to be kept under review in the context of changing and rising property prices.  However, the point is that the purpose behind the Government's action is genuine and sincere and is informed by Revenue.  As has been alluded to by many speakers, the Revenue Commissioners have made a statement with regard to the bed and board issue.  I take them in good faith and do not propose to accept the amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600043#QQ00200","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"speech","time":1417017900,"counter":494,"content":"<p>A few thoughts arise from the contributions made on the amendments, and as I did not hear some of the earlier ones, I hope I am neither failing to grasp a point already made nor doubling up.  However, I refer to some situations that may arise, especially after the recent credit collapse and destruction of the economy.  There could be some cases in which a parent clears half a million of debt for a son or daughter as a result of negative equity.  Is that a gift?  The Minister of State might think about that.  On top of clearing the debt, one has tax to pay off the difference between &euro;500,000 and &euro;225,000, which would be absurd when the essence of clearing the debt is to improve the economy.  There are other situations, such as expensive elective surgery for relations.  For instance, I believe Deputy Adams was in the United States for highly expensive surgery.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600043#QQ00300","speaker":"1183"},{"type":"speech","time":1417017900,"counter":495,"content":"<p>Sorry, leave out personal things.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600043#QQ00400","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1417017900,"counter":496,"content":"<p>I am saying it in a respectful way.  The Minister of State cited some anonymous examples but these actually are real-time examples.  In addition, as Deputy Shatter pointed out, the threshold has come down from &euro;542,000 in 2009 to &euro;225,000 now and one is told there has been a recovery in asset prices.  While I can demonstrate that is exaggerated, the entire thing appears to be driven by some kind of agenda that is not being declared openly.  For instance, if one takes the example of somebody who has accumulated capital of &euro;100 million, it could reasonably be expected that the home or residence element of that &euro;100 million net might be &euro;2 million, &euro;3 million, &euro;4 million or &euro;5 million.  As that would be reasonable accommodation for a family, the rest of the capital that might be left to family members is what one calls mobile capital.<\/p><p>Such capital has easy market realisation.  On the basis that it is a gift, this would be taxed at a rate of 33%.  This means that for the super-wealthy, the rate of tax on the exposed amount of assets is the same as that which applies to someone with a modest level of capital of, for example, &euro;500,000.  A house in a modest suburban area of Dublin which is inherited by one child could easily realise a value of &euro;500,000.  Some &euro;275,000 of this amount would be exposed to tax at a rate of 33%.  Multimillionaires would be taxed at the same rate.  On a capital taxes basis, this provision is somewhat regressive as a result of the exemption limit being brought so low as to correspond with prices on the secondary housing markets in Dublin and Cork.<br\/><br\/>There is a need for an open discussion on this matter rather than seeking to separate out the complexities of and the subscript algebra relating to the tax.  The problem with taxes in this country is that they are too complex.  Deputy Creighton referred to the taxes which new businesses in the start-up or early growth phase must pay.  Those taxes are depressingly complex and severe in nature.  The authorities in the United States give much greater recognition to the framework parameters required in the area of taxation, regardless of whether it is income, capital or capital gains tax.  In his book <i>Capital in the Twenty-First Century<\/i>, Thomas Piketty highlights the fact that the returns to capital are far higher than those brought about by labour or individual personal effort.  As a result, those with super-accumulations of capital are much more capable of bearing taxation and contributing resources to exchequers.<br\/><br\/>Efforts must be made to consider the bigger picture in respect of this matter.  When one gets down to examining the nitty-gritty arithmetic involved, one can almost become depressed.  An exemption is suddenly being introduced in respect of farms that are either on or near the borderline of the &euro;225,000 exemption.  That is because one does not want people to become discouraged and leave the land.  Neither does one want to break up holdings which are small enough in any event.  As a result, those involved are given an exemption.  What is the difference in this regard in terms of the capital platform of &euro;150,000 or &euro;200,000 that might be needed by the members of a family who have grown up and attended school in the suburbs - accumulating the language and skills of business along the way - in order to start a business?  That money will be taxed at 33% before the business even gets off the ground.<br\/><br\/>These matters must be given due consideration.  There is no evidence to convince me that there is good thinking behind the provision in the Bill.  As was the case with water services, the message has not emerged.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600043#QQ00500","speaker":"1183","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1417018500,"counter":498,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  Unfortunately, I cannot say I am satisfied with it.  I appreciate that tax evasion takes place.  There is tax evasion in every walk of life in Ireland and across the globe.  We are all well aware of that and we all want to eliminate tax evasion.  However, the provision set out in the Bill is a blunt instrument.  It is too broad, it is not sufficiently specific and is lazy in its construction.  If the Revenue Commissioners are finding it difficult to clamp down on fraud, they should have brought to the Minister, Deputy Noonan, a provision that was better thought out and that would not discriminate against families, which is what this actually does.  It is unacceptable that the Revenue Commissioners are refusing to publish their so-called guidance document in advance of Members voting on the Bill.  The Revenue Commissioners have indicated that they will publish the document when the legislation has been passed.  That is not acceptable because Deputies are being asked to vote in the dark.  It is incumbent on the Minister of State and the Minister to ensure that there are much greater levels of - to steal a phrase that has been trotted out by every Minister in the past two weeks in respect of Irish Water - certainty and clarity.  There is neither certainty nor clarity with regard to how the mechanism outlined in the Bill will function in practice.  What we do know is that anybody of 18 years of age or 25, if he or she is in full-time employment, will be caught by this provision, which is not targeted at or focused on individuals who are evading tax by gaming the system.<\/p><p>  I reiterate my view that the threshold which, as Deputy Shatter pointed out, has dropped by 60% to &euro;225,000, is inadequate.

Currently, if one owns a property with pyrite, which is valueless, in order to get the exemption one is required to spend thousands of euro to have a hardcore infill test carried out on the property in order to avail of what will be an exemption of hundreds of euro over a period of three years.  Nobody could possibly stand over that scenario.  It is particularly offensive when one considers that the Government, in response to pressure from affected home owners, set up the Pyrite Resolution Board.  The criteria for houses to be remediated under the State scheme does not require an underground hardcore infill test to be carried out.  We have a ridiculous scenario where homes have been approved for remediation under the Government pyrite scheme, but they cannot get a property tax exemption because no infill test was done.  That is frankly ludicrous.  The matter must be addressed urgently because at the moment those home owners are getting letters from Revenue, and in some instances the money is being forcibly deducted.  In instances where an exemption has been given, the money is being taken back from them.  They are people whose backs are to the wall.  That is a serious problem.<\/p><p>  My proposal is not that a person should get an exemption just for the sake of it, but a home owner with pyrite must confirm that he or she has a building condition assessment rating of two or one plus progression, which means there is significant damage to the property and has either been approved by the remediation board or be in an area in which the remediation board is well aware pyrite exists.  Those two measures give the State adequate protection but make it easier for people to avail of an exemption.  I am curious to see how the Minister could possibly stand over a situation where to save hundreds one has to spend thousands, which is the way the legislation is currently framed.<\/p><p>  When I raised the matter in correspondence in recent months, I was initially told the Departments were examining the matter and that the statutory instrument could be amended.  On the previous occasion when I inquired, I was told the responsibility lay with the primary legislation, which is the reason I have tabled the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600047#UU00300","speaker":"1192"},{"type":"speech","time":1417019700,"counter":528,"content":"<p>I wish to speak initially to amendment No. 50, which proposes that the local property tax, LPT, would be a deductible expense for landlords when calculating their taxable rental income.  There is something of a political consensus in this country that landlords should be hammered into the ground in so far as possible, but of course that has one very direct consequence, namely, that rents continue to increase.  The issue should be addressed.  It was recommended in the Thornhill report that LPT would be tax deductible for landlords.  The Minister has signalled by way of reply to parliamentary questions that he is in favour of such a measure, in principle.  I suggest the Minister would make a move in that direction in the Finance Bill.<\/p><p>  Amendment No. 51 is similar to an amendment we discussed on Committee Stage.  It relates to the valuation date in the local property tax legislation of 1 November 2016.  As the Minister is aware, properties are currently valued in respect of the LPT as of May 2013 and they are locked into the relevant band for another two years up to 2016.  People will be required to revalue their properties in 2016.  Given the direction in which property prices are going, that will become a very serious issue, in particular in urban areas and most acutely in Dublin, but also elsewhere.  Since the May 2013 valuation, property prices in Dublin have increased by at least 40%.  We can see from statistics available today that prices in Dublin have increased by 24% in the past 12 months and now prices are beginning to rise at an accelerated pace elsewhere in the country.<\/p><p>  I accept there is still time to deal with the issue because the amount people have to pay next year and in the following year is fixed and nothing we do in the Bill can change that.  However, people essentially face a time bomb.  For every band one jumps up in the LPT, one pays an additional &euro;90 per year and some people certainly face the prospect of going up by two bands, which would mean an increase of &euro;180 per year.  The Government has been of the view to provide certainty for people for the next four years on water charges but they do not have the same certainty on the property tax.  Many Government backbenchers, especially in Dublin, are very exercised about the issue.  The Minister could provide clarity now that there will not be a further valuation of properties required in 2016, by way of accepting the amendment.  Amendment No. 52, which is related, is essentially a repeat of amendment No. 50 and therefore I intend to withdraw it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600047#UU00400","speaker":"993"},{"type":"speech","time":1417019700,"counter":529,"content":"<p>I support amendment No. 49.  Some of us engaged with the Pyrite Resolution Board for a period prior to the remediation scheme being put in place.  Essentially, the object of the exercise was not to force people to incur needless expense.  If a condition survey had been carried out and it was obvious that bits of a house were literally falling down on top of people, then it was not necessary for every house in an estate to go through an assessment.  A sensible approach was to be taken.  People who are affected by pyrite are in a very stressful situation because they see their house literally disintegrate.  Some might not yet be in category two.  While the board might wish to group houses together, I am aware of one housing estate where three or four houses require urgent remediation but other houses are not at that stage yet.  It would be wrong if one side of Government were to take one approach and another side of Government were to take a punitive approach in terms of property tax relief.  The Government&rsquo;s approach must be consistent.<\/p><p>  If one lives in a housing estate with pyrite, there is a blight on the estate and the houses are valueless in that nobody will want to buy them until the remediation has taken place.  It is important that we do not put further pressure on people and that we do not make them jump through hoops or expend large amounts of money that might not be necessary.  The Pyrite Remediation Board will not require every house to do a core test.  We have been told that if one house in an estate has pyrite and the house next door looks like it has similar damage, the board will not require each and every house to carry out a test.  There must be a relationship between the pyrite remediation scheme and the corresponding measure on pyrite in the Finance Bill.  For that reason I support Deputy Clare Daly&rsquo;s amendment, which I hope she will put to a vote if the Minister does not accept it.

Could the Minister consider the introduction of a cap on the level of local property tax paid or a change in the band ratings?

Officials of my Department, along with officials of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, have been examining the alternative other than testing that will be available in order to confirm entitlement to local property tax exemption, with a view to coming up with an early viable solution for all.<\/p><p>  The Deputy's amendment removes the requirement for sub-floor hard core testing and replaces it with either acceptance by the Pyrite Remediation Board for remediation or location in any area where the presence of pyrite has been established.  As I am sure the Deputy is aware, the Pyrite Remediation Board's pyrite resolution scheme is limited to properties with a damage condition rating of two and this requirement would therefore be of no use to a property with a damage condition rating of one with progression.  As the Pyrite Remediation Board's pyrite resolution scheme is a scheme of last resort, it would also be of no use to properties being remediated through other avenues, for example, through insurance or directly by builders.  It is important that any changes that may be made to the LPT legislation do not go beyond the objectives of providing a temporary exemption for homes with significant pyritic damage.  As I have advised on many occasions in the past, a liability to LPT should apply to all owners of residential property with a limited number of exemptions.  Limiting the exemptions available allows the rate to be kept low for those liable persons who do not qualify for an exemption.  The other option proposed by the Deputy, that is, location in any area where the presence of pyrite has been established, does not in itself establish the presence of pyrite in any particular property.  In this regard, I believe the Deputy's proposal is too broad and could result in the relief being available to those beyond the intended target group.<\/p><p>  The local property tax operates on a self-assessment basis and it is a matter for the property owner in the first instance to calculate the tax due, based on his or her assessment of the market value of the property.  Where a property owner does not qualify for an exemption, when making an assessment, issues such as the presence of pyrite in a particular area would be one of the factors that he or she could take into account in valuing the property.  For the reasons outlined above, I am not accepting the Deputy's amendment although I hope the issues she has raised can be resolved outside the Bill.  I can confirm that while I am not accepting the amendment, officials are and will continue to examine how the issue - which is problematic - can be dealt with.  We will continue in discussion with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to see if we can arrive at an appropriate solution.<\/p><p>  Deputy McGrath's amendment deals with the local property tax deduction for landlords.  Chapter 4 of Part 8 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides for the charging to tax under Case V of Schedule D of income arising on rent from property in the State.  The income chargeable under Case V in respect of such property is computed by making the deductions for expenditure authorised by section 97(2) of the Taxes Consolidation Act from the gross rent.  These deductions include, for example, expenditure on rates, maintenance, repairs and interest on a loan used to purchase, improve or repair the rental property.  Amendment No. 50 seeks to add to these allowable deductions by proposing a new deduction for local property tax paid in respect of rental property. <\/p><p>  Deputies will be aware that as part of the process leading to the introduction of local property tax, an interdepartmental group on property tax was tasked with the design of the tax.  In its report to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, generally referred to as the Thornhill report, the group suggested that there seemed to be an argument for allowing at least a portion of LPT paid in respect of a rented property to be deductible for tax purposes in the same way as commercial rates are so deductible.  However, having regard to the pressures on the public finances and the need to bridge the gap between expenditure and revenue, the report also suggested that consideration be given to phasing in deductibility, having regard to the prevailing budgetary situation, over a period of years.  This approach was accepted in principle by the Government.<\/p><p>   As I stated in my budget 2015 speech, both the taxation and expenditure sides of this year's budget are designed to support and broaden the economic recovery that the country is now experiencing.  As such, available resources have been carefully targeted at initiatives that will build consumer confidence, support jobs and strengthen demand in the domestic economy.  In this context, I consider that now is not an opportune time to introduce a deduction for local property tax paid in respect of rental property.<\/p><p>  Amendment No. 52 requires me to issue a report, within six months of the enactment of this Act, detailing how and when I will introduce a deduction for local property tax paid for the purposes of computing taxable rental income.  I consider that the question of if, or when, such a deduction is to be introduced and the extent of any such deduction is best considered as part of the budgetary and finance Bill process rather than by issuing a report on the matter in the manner suggested by the Deputy.  For all of these reasons, I am not accepting these amendments.<\/p><p>  Deputy McGrath's amendment No. 51 wishes to give broad discretion to the Minister as to when properties should be revalued for LPT purposes.  As the local property tax is a new tax, the Government wished to provide certainty to home owners and for this reason valuation periods of three years were introduced, with the exception of the first valuation period which covers three and a half years.  In addition to providing certainty, it also eases the administration burden on home owners by not having to revalue their houses each year.<\/p><p>  The Deputy may be aware that under the LPT legislation, where a property is not a relevant residential property on a valuation date, that is, not liable to LPT, with certain exceptions, that property will not be a relevant residential property until the next valuation date.  In the interests of equity to those who are compliant payers of the local property tax, it is important to have regular valuation dates so that newly built properties are brought into the LPT net.  It also provides certainty to those home owners as to when they will become liable for LPT.<\/p><p>  In the absence of further valuation dates, new properties built after 1 May 2013 would not be liable to LPT and would not have a valuation for LPT purposes.  Should those properties be brought into the scope of LPT using a different valuation date, it would be inequitable to those home owners as their LPT liabilities would be assessed using a later valuation date, where property prices are increasing, compared to those currently on the register.<\/p><p>  While I am very conscious of the concerns of home owners over increasing property prices and the effects this will have on their LPT liabilities, particularly in urban areas, I do not believe the Deputy's amendment is the most appropriate way to address these concerns.  The next valuation date is not until 1 November 2016.  In advance of that date, in conjunction with my officials, I will be examining the LPT and any impacts on LPT liabilities due to increasing property prices.  However, any consideration at this stage would be premature.  For the reasons outlined, I am not minded to accept the Deputy's amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600048#VV00200","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1417020300,"counter":533,"content":"<p>I am looking for clarification from the Minister on amendment No. 49.

We should be under no illusions as the additional taxes heaped on landlords in recent years have directly resulted in rents increasing.  They have certainly been a factor.  Part of the story is with regard to supply, but the additional costs have simply been passed on to tenants.

The Minister should address the issue as to when the review he will undertake in respect of the local property tax will be completed.  I welcome the fact the Minister will do a review because people are concerned about this revaluation of properties, which is coming down the track very quickly.  Somebody in band three, whose property was valued at just under &euro;200,000 in 2013, faces a bill of &euro;315 per annum.  If the property is now worth just under &euro;300,000 the annual bill will be &euro;495, which is an increase of &euro;180.  As a result of how it is structured, with the liability linked directly to the market value of the property, this scenario has arisen.

I remind the Minister that when the exemption was introduced, Government backbenchers in the relevant constituencies went around and told residents they had obtained this exemption for them and they did not have to worry about the property tax.  All we are looking for is that homes affected can avail of the exemption intended for them in the first place.<\/p><p>  We are speaking about properties which have a certain level of damage, not category two but category one with progression, because Deputy Wallace is quite correct this means the property is valueless, and in an area where everybody knows there is pyrite.  In essence, if it looks like a dog and barks like a dog, the chances are it is a dog.  If the interpretation of the Pyrite Remediation Board is that if a house is damaged and in an area with pyrite, and it accepts it has pyrite for the purposes of remediation, surely to God the same criteria would apply for the purposes of exemption to the property tax?  It would not be much comfort to people whose homes have been damaged to the extent that remediation will cost tens of thousands of euro, as we are speaking of an exemption that would benefit them to an amount of &euro;1,000 over the course of the three years it will apply.<\/p><p>  I note the point made by the Minister that the Department and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government recognise there is a problem and they are looking at alternatives.

If local authorities could decide what they wanted to do with the property tax, it would be appreciated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600049#WW00600","speaker":"1053"},{"type":"speech","time":1417020900,"counter":540,"content":"<p>I thank Deputies for their contributions.  Deputy Daly has again illustrated that there is an issue which is problematic and I agree with her that there is an issue.  I would like, and have instructed, my officials to do everything they can to resolve the problem.  My difficulty with the amendment is different.  It does not solve the problem without raising other issues.  The issue can be resolved outside of the legislative process and I would like to have another go to see whether this can be done as quickly as possible.<\/p><p>  Dealing with the pyrite issue may require an amendment of the pyrite regulations and possibly the legislation.

Again, I do not mean this in a derogatory way.  I was told in answer to a recent parliamentary question on the issue that it had to be dealt with through legislation.  Originally I sought for the problems to be dealt with by changing the statutory instrument which was implemented to give effect to the exemption.  I was told this could not be done and it had to be done by way of legislation.  I do not think the amendment I have drafted is perfect, but it is better than what is there at present.<\/p><p>It means that a house, which has considerable damage and is in an area where it has either been accepted by the board or where we know pyrite is in existence, will be covered by the exemption.  That will practically cover every relevant home owner.<\/p><p> I note the Minister did not respond to the point Deputy Wallace made.  In answer to the important issue the Deputy raised, I believe the Minister of State in essence said that somebody whose house had pyrite but only a damage condition rating of one should not get the property tax exemption.  That is a complete and utter reversal of what Government backbenchers told their constituents.  Deputy Wallace is quite correct in pointing out it does not matter what level of pyrite a house has.  Any house with pyrite is unsaleable.  The idea that a tax would be levied on the owner of such a house is an absolute insult to families who in most cases are in the commuter belt and paying for overpriced properties that they bought at the height of the boom.  In many cases they are in negative equity.  In some cases their family circumstances are such that they would like to move on and they are basically shackled to that redundant property.  It is incredible that they would be charged a tax on that property.<\/p><p> I believe the Minister wants to sort it out, but it is not that hard.  All he needs to do is sit down with the Pyrite Resolution Board.  A pyrite survey was done of where it exists throughout the country.  The Minister could easily do it and protect the taxpayer.  Failure to do so would indicate that the exemption was a scam in the first place.  The Government does not really want people to be able to avail of it.  It was just a fig leaf to pretend it was giving something to those afflicted home owners.<\/p><p> I will press the amendment given the way the Government behaves on these issues.  I expect it to be lost, but it is important to lay down a marker.  If that is the case, I appeal to the Minister to pursue the avenues he said he would to get justice on this issue for the people who deserve it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600049#WW00800","speaker":"1192","continuing":true},{"type":"vote","time":1417021800,"counter":543,"content":"<p>Amendment put:<\/p><p>The D\u00e1il divided: T\u00e1, 46;

The main purpose of this Bill is to specify the risk equalisation credits and corresponding stamp duty levies from 1 March 2015.  In addition, the Bill will specify the allowable rate of the net premium payable for young adults and provide for the transfer of an insured person from a restricted membership undertaking to another registered undertaking without any additional initial waiting period.  I will also make some technical amendments to the Health Insurance Acts 1994 to 2013.  <\/p><p>  I recently announced a series of measures to address the rising cost of premiums for private health insurance.  This follows completion of the second phase of Pat McLoughlin's report on health insurance costs, which was developed with the assistance of private health insurers, the Health Insurance Authority and the Department of Health.  Taken together, these measures aim to ensure that private health insurance is affordable to as many people as possible in a sustainable, competitive market.  The continued improvements in the economy create a positive backdrop.  Employment grew by 2.4% in 2013 and the Economic and Social Research Institute is now forecasting a 1.8% growth in employment in 2014 and 2.7% growth in 2015.<\/p><p>  It is reasonable to expect that the introduction of lifetime community rating from 1 May 2015, combined with the improvements in employment, will result in the numbers insured either holding steady or increasing modestly over the next year.  The improvement follows a sustained period of problems in the industry - serious growth in costs and falls in membership of health insurance plans.  For example, coverage of health insurance fell from a peak of 50.9% of the population in 2008 to 44% in June 2014.  Average claims costs per insured person rose by 12.6% from 2008 to 2012.  <\/p><p>  However, more recent data are a little more positive.  There was a welcome fall of 2% in average claim costs in 2013 and a reduction in the rate of claims inflation.  We will monitor data to assess whether this is part of a continuing downward trend or just a blip.  In particular, I am pleased that the size of the market contracted less in the year to July 2014 than it did during the previous 12 months.  The reduction has improved from a fall of 63,460 members in the year to mid-2013 to a reduction of 36,000 in the year to mid-2014.  As Garret FitzGerald might have said, the rate of decrease is decreasing.  In fact, in Q3 of 2014, we recorded a small increase in the number of people with health insurance for the first time in many years.<\/p><p>  I recently announced a number of important measures for the health insurance market.  These include lifetime community rating, reduced rates for young adults, a reduction in the levy for the Health Insurance Authority and no change in the stamp duty levy for the risk equalisation scheme.  I will detail each of these measures in turn.  <\/p><p>  I am introducing lifetime community rating from 1 May 2015.  Lifetime community rating is a modification of community rating to reflect the age at which a person first takes out health insurance.  Its primary purpose is to encourage people to purchase health insurance at a younger age.  This spreads the costs of older and less healthy people across the market, helping to support affordable premium levels for all.  Those who take out private health insurance earlier in life and retain it will pay lower premiums compared to those choosing to join when they are older.<\/p><p>  From 1 May 2015, there will be late entry loadings for those aged 35 years of age and over who purchase private health insurance for the first time or renew after a break in cover of more than 13 weeks.  The loadings are set at 2% per year starting at age 35 up to a maximum loading of 70% at age 69 and over.  There is a grace period until 30 April 2015 to allow as many people as possible to take out health insurance.  During this period, no penalties will apply.  Following expiry of the grace period, there will be credits for previous periods of health insurance cover and credits of up to three years for unemployment since 2008, to reflect the impact of the recent recession.<\/p><p>  The Health Insurance Authority will run an extensive communications campaign to publicise this significant change to the health insurance market.  It is important that the public has enough notice of its introduction and sufficient opportunity to take out health insurance before the introduction of loadings.<\/p><p>  I have decided in this Bill to remove the single very large step-effect increase in premia rates that occurs for most young adults after their 21st birthday.  For many, premiums can increase by 100% or more.  The Bill provides for the introduction of a young adult rate of premium that is age-based rather than student-based and is designed to smooth out the rise in premia between the child rate and a full adult rate.  Insurers will retain the discretion whether to provide young adult rates.  Where an insurer chooses to provide young adult rates, it must provide the full range of rates within the specified bands.  This policy change will also remove the requirement to be a dependant of a policyholder or a full-time student dependent on parents.<\/p><p>  I have also looked closely at the levy payable by insurers under section 17 of the Health Insurance Act 1994.  This levy funds the work of the Health Insurance Authority, the statutory regulator.  Regulations made in 2010 set the rate at 0.12% of insurers' premium income.  In its annual report for 2013, the HIA reported a surplus of &euro;10 million.  As a contribution towards lowering costs in the industry, I have decided to reduce the levy to a nominal rate of just 0.01% for two years, with savings to the industry of &euro;2 million in both years.  Thereafter, the levy will be set at 0.09%, still a reduction of 25% on current levels.  The HIA is satisfied that this level of funding is appropriate to fund its ongoing operations and the rate of levy will be subject to periodic review by my Department.  I signed the statutory instrument for this earlier this week.<\/p><p>  The risk equalisation scheme is designed to protect community rating by making it easier for older people to afford private health insurance.  I am committed to making the scheme as effective as possible in a way that promotes fair and open competition.  This scheme is funded by stamp duties levied on health insurance policies and the money generated is used to pay risk equalisation credits to take account of the higher costs of older and sicker people.<\/p><p>  In recent years, it has been necessary to increase significantly the stamp duty on all policies in order to fund the rising costs of an increasingly older and less healthy population of insured people.  The increase last year on advanced products was &euro;49 per adult and &euro;15 per child.  I am pleased that with the agreement of the Minister for Finance, there will be no increase in stamp duty rates for products providing advanced cover in 2015.  The levy will remain unchanged at &euro;399 per adult and &euro;135 per child.  In addition, there will be a reduction in the levy rate for products providing non-advanced cover.  The levy for an adult will be reduced by &euro;50, down from &euro;290 to &euro;240, and for a child, it will be reduced by &euro;20, down from &euro;100 to &euro;80, achieving reductions of 17% and 20%, respectively.<\/p><p>I am glad that at least one of the four insurers has already confirmed that it will pass on this reduction.  These changes will apply from 1 March 2015 and follow the formal advice of the Health Insurance Authority, HIA.  The effectiveness of the risk equalisation scheme, RES, is measured by the extent to which it compensates for the higher costs of older customers.  The overall changes to the RES in 2015 improve its effectiveness for older age groups.  In fact, most people over the age of 70 hold products providing for \"advanced cover\".<\/p><p> In this category, the revised rates will compensate for 81% of the higher claims costs for those over 70 and 88% of higher claims costs for those aged over 80.  These changes are in line with the risk equalisation policy statement announced by my predecessor, the Minister, Deputy Reilly, in November 2013, which set a target of increasing effectiveness to 85% for those over 70 years and 90% for customers aged over 80 years by 2016.  This target is subject to the advice of the HIA, the requirement not to over-compensate any insurer and to Government budgetary decisions each year.<\/p><p> This year, the Department and the HIA commenced work on a more refined health status measure using diagnosis related groups, DRGs, to enhance the risk equalisation scheme by improving support for less healthy people of all ages.  The HIA carried out an analysis of international regimes and submitted a report to me on incorporating DRGs into the risk equalisation scheme.  I will use this report to inform the changes that will be proposed from 2016 onwards.<\/p><p> I am determined to address the issues contributing to increased costs in the health insurance sector.  In 2012, the Consultative Forum on Health Insurance was established to generate ideas to address the issue of health insurance costs.  In June 2013, Mr. Pat McLoughlin was appointed as independent chairperson of the forum.  The measures I have outlined here today are closely aligned to the recommendations of Mr. McLoughlin's two-phase report on private health insurance costs.  The first report was published in December 2013 and the second was published last week.  Mr. McLoughlin recommends a scheme of lifetime community rating and discounted rates for young adults.  Both measures are before the House today.<\/p><p> I have also accepted the recommendations relating to the implementation of a case-based charging system using DRGs for private patients in public hospitals under the money follows the patient or activity-based funding model.  I have also accepted the establishment of a steering group to build on the reforms under way in the area of the prevention of chronic disease.  This will focus on the provision of an integrated model of care for patients with chronic conditions.<\/p><p> Other recommendations being implemented include an increased focus by private health insurers on combatting fraud in the private health insurance market and the establishment of a working group with the HSE and the health insurers on the recommendations relating to claims processing.  Mr. McLoughlin's independent reports make several important recommendations under the headings of controlling costs, care settings and resources, age structure, clinical audit and utilisation management, private psychiatry, fraud waste and abuse, chronic disease management, claims processing, and admission and discharge processes.  I have instructed the Department to pursue these, in conjunction with the private health insurers and the HSE, as appropriate.  These measures, combined with the recent decision by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, not to decrease tax relief on health insurance premia and the freezing of hospital bed charges, all aim to support a competitive health insurance industry.  From now on I want to place the consumer's needs at the centre of decision making and policy formulation. <\/p><p> I will now outline the specific sections of the Bill.  Section 1 defines the principal Act as the Health Insurance Act 1994.  Section 2 amends section 7(5)(b)(i) of the principal Act.  The proposed amendment will provide for a sliding scale of young adult rates for health insurance premiums up to and including age 25 and will remove the requirement to be in full-time education or to be dependent on the policy holder.  A new subsection 5A provides that where a health insurer proposes to offer young adult rates it shall offer the full range of rates within the specified bands.  Insurers will retain the discretion whether to provide young adult rates, although it will be possible in future legislation to make this mandatory.<\/p><p> Section 3 amends section 7A of the principal Act.  The regulations to provide for lifetime community rating take effect on 1 May 2015.  From 1 May 2015 there will be late entry loadings for those aged 35 and over who purchase private health insurance for the first time, and are renewing after a break in cover for more than 13 weeks.  This amendment clarifies that the obligation on insurers to impose lifetime community rating loadings as provided for by regulations is mandatory, by replacing &quot;may&quot; with &quot;shall&quot; and by clarifying in subsection 3 that the obligation to require the payment of late entry loadings is subject to the regulations signed into law on 7 July 2014.<\/p><p> Section 4 amends subsections 8(3) and 8(5) and deletes subsection 8(6) of the principal Act.  The additional provisions proposed in 8(3) and amendment of 8(5) are made to clarify that people transferring from one health insurance policy to another health insurance policy are not required to serve additional waiting periods other than those applying to an upgrade in cover.  Section 8(5) is also amended to provide for the transfer of served waiting times for people transferring from restricted membership undertakings to open market insurers, without the application of any additional initial waiting period.  Subsection 8(6) is consequently deleted.<\/p><p> Section 5 amends section 1 Ic of the principal Act to provide for 1 March 2015 as the effective date for revised risk equalisation credits to be payable from the fund.  Section 6 amends Schedule 3 of the principal Act to provide for the revised amount payable from the risk equalisation fund for the hospital bed utilisation credit.  This will cover health insurance contracts renewed or taken out from 1 March 2015.  Section 7 replaces table 2 in Schedule 4 to the principal Act with effect from 1 March 2015 whereby the applicable risk equalisation credits payable from the risk equalisation fund for certain classes of insured persons are revised.

We have been calling for many of the measures announced in the Bill with regard to lifetime community rating and the need to ensure there is risk equalisation that is fair and supports those who most need it.<\/p><p>  While we welcome the Bill, it comes against a backdrop of great uncertainty about the Government&rsquo;s policy on health insurance in general.  It opposed risk equalisation in the past.  It was vehemently opposed to the concept whereby the market would support those who most need it, older people and those with illness.  We welcome its recent conversion.<\/p><p>  The broader issue of where we are with regard to the roll-out of universal health insurance, which is still a central plank of Government policy on funding health care in the years ahead, is central to this debate.  We are still unsure of what the Government intends to do.  I believe that it wants to slowly abandon this policy, to judge by the Minister&rsquo;s language and tone.  He speaks about &ldquo;universal health care&rdquo; and universal health insurance has been dropped from his vocabulary.  Can we have clarity on that because it is critically important that we know what the Government intends doing?  The industry and society deserve an honest appraisal of what it intends to do with regard to universal health insurance.  If it was committed to the fictional universal health insurance model it espoused prior to the election, we would not be discussing community lifetime rating at all because everybody would have to take out health insurance.  This Bill seems to accept that we will not be going down the road of universal health insurance.  How we fund our health services and provide the care that is required every day is critically important to the insurers, to those who wish to take out private health insurance and to others who cannot afford it or have an ideological objection to it so that they can make up their own minds.  How we fund health services in the years ahead is central to our debate.  It is evident from the context and content of this Bill that the Government is slowly but surely abandoning its universal health insurance model.<\/p><p>Significant resources were spent on that approach, for example, when people were sent abroad to examine the various models that are in place throughout the world.  There was a commitment to publish a White Paper on universal health insurance.  We were told there would be a consultative process.<\/p><p> I assume the Bill before the House is an indication that this policy is being abandoned.  The reason it is being abandoned is very clear, to be political on this matter for a moment.  Fine Gael has clearly made a calculated decision.  It has realised that if it pursued the universal health insurance model espoused by the previous Minister for Health, it would be asking its supporters to pay their taxes and private health insurance premiums before being informed when the health insurance model came into being that everybody was on the same list together.  Obviously, Fine Gael's supporters would not accept that.  I assume the universal health insurance model is slowly being abandoned because it would not offer preferential treatment to people with private health insurance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600054#BBB00200","speaker":"983","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1417023600,"counter":564,"content":"<p>That is an original theory.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600055#CCC00200","speaker":"948"},{"type":"speech","time":1417023600,"counter":565,"content":"<p>It is not; it is a very factual theory.

The contrary is the case in terms of the Minister's commitment to universal health insurance.  It has actually been dropped from his lexicon and his vocabulary.  He never speaks about it anymore.  Instead, he speaks about universal health care.  There is a fundamental difference between care and insurance, in terms of how we fund the health services in the years ahead.  We will continue to pursue this issue to find out exactly what is the position of Fine Gael and the Government as a whole on the universal health insurance model that was proposed in the programme for Government.<\/p><p>  Any society would judge itself on how it looks after those who are most vulnerable and most in need of our support.  The Minister's party has had a latter-day conversion to the risk equalisation model, which is a critically important component in ensuring we have a vibrant health insurance market.  More importantly, it helps to ensure people are not penalised as they get older and sicker and therefore have a greater need to draw on health insurance.  A central tenet of any modern society is to ensure people are not penalised as they grow old.  We should not uphold this tenet because it makes us feel better - we should do so because the people in question deserve it.  They have served this country well.  Many of them have been paying private health insurance for many years.  The idea that they should be penalised as they grow older is simply unacceptable.  That is why my party has always supported the concept of risk equalisation.  If I wanted to look at how it evolved, I would mention that the opposition to it in this House was quite dramatic for many years.  We were led to believe it would force families to abandon health insurance.  Of course if there was no risk equalisation, older people would be forced to abandon private health insurance.  That is the concept we endorsed and put through.  Thankfully, most parties now agree to that very civilised principle.<\/p><p>  Reference has been made to the impact of the Australian model of lifetime community rating in that country.  I think it is a good idea.  We called for it for a long time.  It is quite clear and evident that since 2008 there has been a steady decline in the number of people taking out private health insurance.  The primary age cohort that has been dropping out of health insurance comprises those under the age of 35.  To put it simply, as the number of people taking out private health insurance has been decreasing, the burden that needs to be carried has been falling on fewer and fewer people.  As a result, the spiralling cost of private health insurance has further exacerbated the problem of people dropping out of such insurance.<\/p><p>  Government policies that added dramatically to the cost of private health insurance are a hidden part of this problem.  The Minister said in his speech that &quot;these measures, combined with the recent decision by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, not to decrease tax relief on health insurance premia and the freezing of hospital bed charges, all aim to support a competitive health insurance industry&quot;.  That seems to be an indication that the policies pursued by the Government when it capped the tax relief on premiums and its policies with regard to hospital beds did not add to the competitiveness of the market.  If the Government wanted a more competitive market, it should be going further by rowing back on the decisions it has made to date.<\/p><p>  There is no doubt that last year's decision to cap tax relief was announced without consultation.  The previous Minister for Health looked quite shocked when the Minister for Finance announced in this Chamber that he intended to cap tax relief on gold-plated health insurance premiums.  By any stretch of the imagination, the measure that was introduced was not confined to gold-plated premiums.  I think there is now an acknowledgement that the average premiums which families try to maintain on a yearly basis were also affected.  Hundreds of thousands of people were directly affected by the increased cost that was imposed on health insurance premiums.<\/p><p>  Many people are making great efforts on a continual basis to provide for their own health cover.  Obviously, there are ideological arguments inside and outside this House about whether private health insurance is acceptable.  When we consider whether it is right that private health insurance forms part of how we fund our health services, we must admit that people who take out such insurance are doing the State a service.  They are alleviating the burden on the State, which is obliged under legislation to provide health care for everybody.  People are willing to forgo certain luxuries, or have no luxuries at all, and to make huge sacrifices in order to pay for private health insurance.  I find the idea that it is somehow wrong for them to do that very distasteful.<\/p><p>  We have the system that we have.  Following the abandonment of the universal health insurance model, it looks like we will have it for a while.  Therefore, we should encourage people to take out private health insurance.  We should not penalise them.  This Government has consistently penalised ordinary families when they take out private health insurance.  As I have said, last year's budget, which was a direct attack on families that pay private health insurance, is a case in point.  We need to make it clear that if everybody decided to withdraw from private health insurance, the public health system would be lumbered with the cost and would, in effect, collapse as a result.  Private health insurers pay out &euro;1.8 billion in respect of health care each year.  If that money was no longer available, the Government would have to put an equivalent amount of extra capacity into the public health system.  Everybody should accept that the public system simply could not cope in such circumstances.<\/p><p>  The attraction into private health insurance of young people must be a critical component of any effort to develop a sustainable private health insurance market.  Competition, encouragement and social and inter-generational solidarity must also be features of such a market.  We need to make sure the young subsidise the old.  This straightforward and simple concept should be encouraged rather than discouraged.  It has been quite evident for the last three or four years that something needs to be done to stimulate the uptake of private health insurance among younger people.  Nothing has been done for a number of years.<\/p><p>  We are now very much in a crisis situation.  The age profile of people in private health insurance is exceptionally worrying.  As I have said, the burden is falling on older people to subsidise older people.  That is simply not sustainable.  I hope this legislation will address this key area, which needs to be addressed.  The prevarication that continued for three and a half years, when there was a pretence that universal health insurance would be introduced, has come to an end.  The introduction of this legislation is, in effect, an admission that the Government is not going to go down the road of universal health insurance.  The problem is that the unsustainable model which prevailed in recent years discouraged young people from coming into the health insurance market.<\/p><p>  I would like to comment on the age structure of the market.  There has been a significant ageing of the insured population.  In 2003, the percentage of the insured population over the age of 60 was 13.3%, but this had increased to 19% by the second half of 2012.  There has been a dramatic increase in the age profile of the insured.<\/p><p>If it is not underpinned by a continuous flow of younger people into the market, the sustainability of same is undermined.<\/p><p> The Minister referred to the advice of the Health Insurance Authority, HIA.  That he has taken it on board is a welcome departure.  The previous Minister for Health never took the HIA's advice.  He continually dismissed logical advice on how to contain the cost of private health insurance for families and how to ensure a basic model of risk equalisation, which was important for social and intergenerational solidarity.<\/p><p> For all of the reasons I have listed, trying to provide cover proved difficult for families.  The increases in premiums ranged from 7.3% in 2011 to 12.1% in 2012.  In 2008, the average premium per insured person was &euro;729.  In 2013, it was &euro;1,250, representing a dramatic increase in the cost of health insurance.  There are many reasons for this, but Government policy and its neglect of the private insurance sector have been contributory factors.  Introducing the instability of not knowing whether people would need to take out mandatory health insurance undermined people's initiative to join.  Why would anyone have taken out health insurance in recent years if stated Government policy was to force people to do so in 2018 or thereabouts?  In such circumstances, it was illogical to believe that anyone would take out insurance for the next six years.  Thanks to the Government's policy, we are still in a vacuum.  Sometimes, its policy may be at variance with the Minister's policy, but we need to know what the Government intends to do with universal health insurance.  That insurance would be compulsory in a couple of years' time contributed to young people in particular not taking out insurance of their own.  This Bill is an indication that the situation may be changing.<\/p><p> Health insurers and providers have an obligation to try to curtail costs.  Much work remains to be done in this regard.  There will be occasional clinical audits of payments, but people still hold the view that the level of service increases above what is necessary once a private health insurance card is shown.  People are concerned about supplier-induced demand.  We must aggressively ensure that an auditing system to prevent this is in place.  We do not want clinicians and other medical professionals to cut corners, but people must not be incentivised to provide unnecessary diagnostics or other forms of care just because patients have private health insurance.  That the system might contain such incentives is wrong, including ethically.  The Minister should consider this matter.<\/p><p> In September 2013, VHI insured 54% of the market, Laya insured 23%, Aviva insured 15% and GloHealth insured 4%.  One could argue that it is competition that will sustain the market, in that insurers and health service providers will compete with one another to get market share, but I wonder whether that is really the case.  We have a dominant insurer in VHI.  In terms of the cost of care for private patients, I wonder whether service providers are negotiated with aggressively.  This matter should be also considered.  Private health service providers are under financial pressure, but an upturn in the economy, more people entering the market and proper clinical auditing of treatments might help.<\/p><p> Turning to the question of how we will fund the health service in the years ahead, the Minister and others have often accused me of not having a determined health policy.  Whenever I open the pages of a newspaper, though, the Government seems to be reverting to the policies that we would have pursued, namely, a publicly funded health system with the option of private health insurance.  Pitting one against the other or removing private insurance entirely would disadvantage others.  If no one took out private insurance, we would all be disadvantaged because the public health system would not be able to support everyone.  It is fine if people take out private health insurance and the insurer has a contract with a health service provider, but the difficulty with this is that the public health system is underfunded.  There is no point in trying to deny it.  Consider the recent and alarming figures detailing the number of people awaiting inpatient and outpatient appointments.  That the previous Minister scrapped the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, and pretended that the special delivery unit alone would address the underlying issue, namely, the capacity of the public health system to deal with the throughput, was farcical.  This must be realised at some stage.<\/p><p> A patient who is in the public system should not be penalised by having to wait for a long time.  If the public health system does not have sufficient capacity to ensure this, the patient's care should be contracted out to a private provider.  This is not an irrational thought.  It worked well in the case of the NTPF.  There is no reason that the fund cannot be resumed.  Under its guidelines, if someone was waiting for a certain period of time and the public health system could not deal with him or her, the patient's care was contracted out to a private provider.  People were dealt with in a timely fashion.<\/p><p> In the tail end of 2014, we have reached crisis point.  We are awaiting publication of the HSE's service plan for 2015.  The figures are alarming.  Judging by the amounts announced in the budget, the public health system will not be able to deal with those figures in 2015 alone.  Something will have to be done to alleviate the pressure of patients who wait inordinate and unacceptable lengths of time for procedures.<\/p><p> Those in the public system see private insurance policyholders receiving treatment quickly.  This is unfair, but it is not the fault of the private insurers.  Nor is it the fault of families that, having worked hard and saved money, take out private health insurance.  The unfairness lies in the State's failure to provide adequate resources to the public hospital system.  We should not demonise people who slave continuously to retain their private health insurance for &quot;jumping the queue&quot;.<\/p><p>It is the public health system, because of the lack of funding, that is delaying people's timely and speedy access to diagnostics and to care.  This is where the fault lies and I reiterate that Fianna F&aacute;il intended to go for a seismic shift over to a new system of funding the health services.  Everybody would be assessed in a timely manner and everybody would get treatment based on their clinical need.  However, the same principle should apply as it is.  People should get their treatment based on their clinical need and if one is a public patient, one is entitled to treatment as quickly as a person who has private health insurance.  The delay is not the fault of the person who takes out private health cover.  The delay and the fault is with the Minister, the Government and the Health Service Executive, HSE, in providing sufficient resources to ensure that public patients are not waiting an inordinate length of time.  Members would then not be having this debate because the system would be fair and equitable in the sense of access to health care, be it public or private, in a timely manner.  This is the Minister's difficulty.<br\/><br\/>Obviously, on the broader issue of the insurance market itself, Fianna F&aacute;il also examined some of the insurance models and while we did not send off teams of officials to examine the various models, we were able to get information from around the place and universal health insurance is far from being a utopian model.  The Minister should fight tooth and nail for adequate funding and resources to be put in place to ensure the public hospital system has the resources to deal with patients in a timely manner.  If this means being obliged to transfer some of them into the care of private health service providers, this should not be a difficulty.  I note this is being done on an <i>ad hoc <\/i>basis and from time to time is done in a panic mode.  The pressure comes on, waiting lists lengthen and the special delivery unit then makes a few telephone calls and acquires treatment.  However, what really should be done is to put in place a proper structure whereby the State, through the HSE, could put out to tender a number of procedures in areas such as orthopaedics and ophthalmology or whatever are the areas in which there are inordinate waiting times.  That work should be contracted out in order that people are dealt with quickly, effectively and in a timely manner.  I am quite definite that in terms of value for money, this approach is worth re-examining because regardless of whether people had an ideological objection to it or otherwise, the National Treatment Purchase Fund was addressing the waiting lists.  It was able to refer people into private health care in a timely manner and that capacity in the private hospital system has grown in recent years with the opening of other facilities.  I assure the Minister that nobody minds where they are treated, albeit not in the geographical sense but in the context of public versus private, as long as they are treated quickly, efficiently and in a timely manner in a safe environment.  This point should be reiterated through all Government policy in the short to medium term.<br\/><br\/>Thereafter, in the run up to the next general election, Members will have a broader debate on how the health services will be funded in the years ahead because the people have a right to know.  The people in general have a right to know what precisely the Government intends to do.  This will take into account both the funding of the health services and broader taxation policy, the question of who will pay, how it will be paid and who will own the health service.  As matters stand at present, I am unsure who will be the final arbitrators in the delivery of health care in Ireland.  If one goes down the universal health insurance model, coupled with the hospital groupings themselves in a scenario in which they are all bidding and tendering against one another, it quickly will become evident that the insurers will be the ones that will dictate the amount of care provided to people.  The Minister can talk about all the baskets he likes in the context of universal health insurance cover but financial realities will dictate quickly.  This has happened in the Netherlands and elsewhere where the various fruits slowly were taken from the baskets and only extremely basic cover was left.  If one then broadens this out to the issue of primary care, I note it is under huge pressure in some countries that have the model until recently was being espoused or promoted.<br\/><br\/>Overall, Fianna F&aacute;il welcomes this Bill.  It is urgent because the prevarication over the past three years has meant there has been a weakening of the health insurance market in terms of the age profile of those taking out private health insurance.  One cannot sustain a position in which one now is asking older people to support older people, as was the case with regard to the age profile of those who had private health insurance and the fact that nobody was being encouraged into the market for many reasons.  I accept the downturn in the economy obviously had an impact on the number of people taking out health cover.  However, there also was no incentivisation and with the other issue of compulsory health insurance hanging over people's heads, there was no incentive for people to even consider private health insurance.  For all these reasons, I would appreciate an expeditious passage of this Bill to ensure that Government policy retains a vibrant health insurance market and does not overburden it with costs, as has been the case with the policy decisions of the Minister for Finance and the previous Minister for Health, which lumbered additional funding costs onto those who already were hard pressed.  More importantly, Members must get a clear and concise statement from the Minister or somebody in government outlining precisely whether the Government intends to proceed with the pretence of a universal health insurance model or whether Members will revert to having a genuine discussion on how the health services will be funded in the years ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600055#CCC00500","speaker":"983","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1417024800,"counter":570,"content":"<p>Ar&iacute;s eile, t&aacute; Bille os &aacute;r gcomhair a dh&eacute;anann iarracht fadhbanna an ch&oacute;rais sl&aacute;inte a leigheas.

Some of the Bill continues what I acknowledge, as the health delivery system currently is structured, is the necessary system of community rating, which helps to ensure that consumers are charged the same premium for a particular plan regardless of age, gender or health status, thus preventing price discrimination against those more likely to require medical treatment.  Unfortunately, it also is but a way of propping up the ailing health system.  Members still await details of the Government's long-promised universal health insurance proposals.  In the interim, many people continue to take out private health insurance because they cannot rely on the health service when they or their loved ones are unwell and this in itself is a tragedy.<\/p><p>  As I have stated previously on this issue, as long as the type of health insurance market and the type of health funding system that exist in this State are retained, the regulatory regime provided for in this Bill will be necessary.  It involves a complex system of risk equalisation to support the community rating principle.  This entails the transfer of compensation from insurers who carry lighter risk burdens to those who carry heavier risk burdens.  All this requires regulation, monitoring, enforcement and as provided for in this Bill.  Without such legislation, the unregulated market would discriminate against the old, the sick or any other group or individuals which insurance companies decided were a greater risk.  The legislation therefore is supposed to be a protection against the working out of the raw profit motive in the health insurance sector.  It is supposed to be based on solidarity between generations and between the healthy and the sick.  This is welcome, in so far as it goes.<\/p><p>  However, we in Sinn F&eacute;in would go much further in extending the principle of solidarity to the way the entire health care system is funded, organised, structured and managed and I will return to this point later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600057#EEE00200","speaker":"969"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1417024800,"counter":571,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Estimates for the Public Services 2014: Message from Select Committee","time":1417025400,"counter":572,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600058#FFF00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1417025400,"counter":573,"content":"<p>The Select Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality has completed its consideration of the following Supplementary Estimates for Public Services for the year ending 31 December 2014 - Votes 20 to 22, inclusive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600058#FFF00200","speaker":"1185"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Human Rights Budgeting: Motion (Resumed) [Private Members]","time":1417025400,"counter":574,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600058#FFF00300"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1417025400,"counter":575,"content":"<p>The following motion was moved by Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan on Tuesday, 25 November 2014:That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann:\r\n\r\nacknowledges:\r\n\r\n&mdash;

This is one of those times.  In July of last year, Sinn F&eacute;in introduced the Equal Status (Amendment) Bill 2013.  We were seeking, by means of this Bill, to amend existing legislation and provide for equality proofing of Government policy and budgets and public bodies through impact assessments.  Our Bill was rejected.  Had it been accepted and passed, it would have ensured that in exercising their functions Government and public bodies would do so in a way that is designed to reduce the inequalities of outcome which result from socioeconomic disadvantage.  The legislation in question also recognised those additional sectors of society which require enhanced protection from the State in the context of policy and spending decisions.  I refer here to rural dwellers.<\/p><p>  If we used equality budgeting, we would ensure that equality is placed well and truly at the centre of any decisions concerning public expenditure and income.  We now know that the economic policy measures introduced since the beginning of the economic crisis are having a disproportionate impact on certain sections of society and that the problems of inequality and poverty have been exacerbated as a result.  Women, particularly those with children, are more reliant on public services and welfare provisions, all of which are currently being severely curtailed by the Government.  Reductions in health expenditure have resulted in reductions in services for people with disabilities.  We have witnessed, and continue to see, increases in inequality and poverty and there is growing evidence highlighting the disproportionate impact economic policies have had on disadvantaged groups since the beginning of the economic crisis.  Equality budgeting has been internationally accepted as a means to effectively deal with inequality and poverty.  Over 60 countries worldwide have either adopted or are working toward introducing equality budgeting.  The time has come for Ireland to follow suit, make a stand and provide a more just and equitable society for all.  This is our duty as republicans.  Equality budgeting makes sense and it is fair.<\/p><p>  The motion calls for a reduction - over successive future budgets - in the income gap between social welfare rates and the income required for a minimally adequate standard of living.  The Government amendment states that detailed distributional impact analysis of tax changes is already included in budget documentation.  It is great that it is included but does the Government actually intend to take action?  There is no commitment to equality in what is outlined.<\/p><p>  The Government also states that there is a commitment on its part to invest substantial resources in increasing and improving the social housing stock.  It also lauds the housing assistance payment, HAP, as a method of supporting social housing needs.  HAP is a repackaged rent supplement which offers the ability to work as the only improvement in a climate of job scarcity and at a time when wages are decreasing to a point where many workers are not better off being in employment.  The Government's strategy on housing is to spin and repeat and recycle figures in order to pretend that it is doing great things.  The Government's announcement earlier today amounts to a budget of just &euro;633 million per year during the next six years.  That is just &euro;36 million more than what has been spent in the current year, when homeless figures rose along with the numbers on the housing waiting list.  In the six years between 2008 and 2013 almost &euro;1 billion more was spent on housing than the Government is promising to spend during the next six years.  Most of the investment it is promising to make relates to a time long after it will have been thrown out of office.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600058#FFF00600","speaker":"1022"},{"type":"speech","time":1417025400,"counter":578,"content":"<p>I am speaking in support of the motion and I commend Deputy Maureen O'Suilivan and the other Members who proposed it for using their Private Members' time to facilitate a debate on this important issue.  Since I only have five minutes - and given that others have covered the detail so admirably - I will stick to discussing the broader issue.<\/p><p>  We need to ask more from our budgets than merely balancing the books.  Instead, we must ask if each budgetary proposal or measure - regardless of whether it relates to spending allocations or cuts, tax increases or reductions - vindicates or violates the fundamental human rights of our citizens.  For example, we should ask whether a proposal to remove medical cards is consistent with the human right to health, whether a proposal to reduce local authority budgets result in contravention of the human right to housing and whether a decision to increase third level fees interfere with the human right to education.  We should also ask whether the decision not to restore the respite care grant - despite having fiscal room for manoeuvre - respects the human right to an adequate standard of living or whether it fails this test.  If the answers to such questions reveal that human rights impacts are negative and that citizens rights are being violated, then the reality is that the decisions to which they relate will end up costing us - taxpayers and the State - more in fiscal, social and human terms.<\/p><p>  In so far as they provide a way to identify and reduce associated externalities, applying human rights standards to budgetary decisions makes economic sense.  This all the more true in times of recession, when there is less to go around.  However, this human rights-based approach to budgeting is the very antithesis of the austerity model favoured by the establishment parties.  That surely explains the Government's decision to amend rather than support the motion.  Both the Government's amendment and its members' explanatory remarks have failed to address what I believe to be the core question.  Will the Government commit to introduce formal, statutory mechanisms for consistently evaluating the foreseeable human rights impact of all budgetary proposals before committing to them?  Will it also put in place effective monitoring to consistently scrutinise the human rights outcomes and impacts of budgetary decisions once they have been made and implemented?  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, has been consistently evasive when I have asked him this directly, specifically in respect of equality budgeting.  He will not say &quot;No&quot; but, more significantly, he will not say &quot;Yes&quot; either.  This characteristic fudge is not good enough for a Government that includes members of the Labour Party in Cabinet and on the Economic Management Council.<\/p><p>My party has made a clear commitment to introduce a statutory human rights audit of all budgetary decisions.  This would be both analogous and complementary to a standard value-for-money audit.  If the Comptroller and Auditor General has a mandate to scrutinise public accounts for spending irregularities, surely this should and could be augmented by a statutory role for the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission to scrutinise these same accounts for externalities arising from a failure to meet human rights standards.<\/p><p> I wish to draw the attention of the D&aacute;il to a report recently published by Amnesty International on applying Ireland's economic, social and cultural rights obligations to budgetary policy.  This report has implications for the work of all Ministers, not just those on the Economic Management Council but also the Cabinet as a whole.  It has particular relevance for the work of the Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and the Committee of Public Accounts.  I have requested that each of these committees consider the aspects and recommendations that are specifically relevant.<\/p><p> As my party and I pointed out last week in the debate on our legislation that would have introduced a constitutional right to water, no single Government's commitments on basic rights are ultimately enough.  When it comes to protecting the fundamental rights of citizens, this is the main role of the State's Constitution.  Ordinary legislation is not enough to protect those rights from the whims of future Governments.  For more than four months, the Government has delayed in responding to the recommendation of the Constitutional Convention that the 1937 Constitution be amended to introduce enforceable guarantees of fundamental economic, social and cultural rights.  We have publicly stated our support for this proposition which commanded overwhelming majority support at the convention, but the Government has refused to do the same.  The people deserve to know.  In particular, they deserve to know the position of the Labour Party, which has at various times as a coalition partner claimed to support a constitutional guarantee of such rights but which apparently will not now be pinned down on this issue.  Once again, I call on the Government to make its response known and to set a date for the long overdue D&aacute;il debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600058#FFF00700","speaker":"1008","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1417026000,"counter":580,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan for her contribution yesterday evening and for introducing the motion.  She made some very good points with which I do not disagree.  I agree in spirit with the Deputy's proposal but I am not so sure about how it could work in light of the exclusion of those on the minimum wage.  I do not know how it could work in addressing unfairness in the tax system.  The subject matter of the motion is the standard of living of people on social welfare, who in many cases are without adequate means, but there is no point in denying that, in addition to those on welfare, there are those on very low pay.  This creates difficulties for parliamentarians when stepping up to deal with the thrust of the Deputy's proposal.  There are thousands upon thousands on low pay and on wages below the minimum wage.  Those of us who represent working-class areas will know from our clinics that this is an issue.  It is one that we must address as the economy improves.<\/p><p>  The second and third paragraphs of the motion refer to the recovery.  People on this side of the House, including me, recognise it as a very limited and slow recovery.  We have never asked the people to go out on the street to celebrate it, and we should not adopt that attitude.  In addition to trying to give people on social welfare more disposable income, we should also try to give people hope.  The average person, especially an individual with small children, has gone through hell because of the collapse of the gombeen capitalist system we have.  There has been no regulation, as stated by Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan last night.  I will now make the point in my own way, perhaps.  If we had had a mechanism in this regard in 2004 or 2005, we might not have gone out of kilter.  We did not have a mechanism but that is an argument for another day.  I acknowledge the link between what Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan is trying to say and the point I am making on people on very low wages, including those on the minimum wage, whom this D&aacute;il should monitor.<\/p><p>  No budget is perfect but we should all admit that we must get away from the old model of budgeting.  This is an opportunity not only to bring fairness into the tax system but also to do, in spirit, what Deputy O'Sullivan is calling for.<\/p><p>  I welcome the post-budgetary announcement by the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, that there is to be an increase in child benefit and the Christmas bonus.  This may not mean a lot to us here because we have well-paid jobs but it means a lot to somebody who has a very small income.  As some people have said to me, it is a start.  These things are welcomed by families with very little disposable income.<\/p><p>  Deputy Ellis mentioned homelessness and housing.  I am glad to be able to tell him the largest investment in social housing in the history of the State, since the British left, was announced today by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly.  It is worth almost &euro;4 billion and will result in 35,000 houses in the next five or six years.  This is certainly worth noting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600059#GGG00200","speaker":"1038"},{"type":"speech","time":1417026000,"counter":581,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan for bringing this matter before the House.  I welcome the opportunity to speak on it.  It is always important to take stock of the impact on citizens of decisions we make.  Everything we do should be grounded in such thinking and we must consider all aspects.  When one considers the social impact and social set-up of many people, one realises hard-pressed people include not only the unemployed but also people on lower incomes.  In many ways, those on lower incomes have fewer supports.  The system makes it more costly to go back to work on a lower income.  On the other hand, there are people with seemingly good incomes living in big houses who cannot afford to put heating oil in the tank.  People in such circumstances may have debts, owing to business or other commitments, and they are trying to pay them back.  I have encountered cases of people who are unable to send their children to college.  Ironically, if the parents were not working, the children would qualify for grants and could go to college.  However, the income criteria are such that the children do not qualify.  Therefore, there is much upset and discontent over many of the inequalities.  This is a feature across the board.  As Deputy Durkan reminded me a moment ago, much of this boils down to money, where one spends it and the effort to stretch a very limited budget across the whole spectrum of competing interests.<\/p><p>  On the day that is in it, I very much welcome the social housing strategy for the period to 2020.<\/p><p>The commitment is to provide 35,000 additional social housing units, to look at the provision of housing through the private rented sector, and, in particular, that there would be mixed tenure developments because that is about social integration.<\/p><p> It must be acknowledged that since budget 2008 there have not been increases in social welfare payments and the budget sought to give something back, and the 2015 budget did that, by raising the entry point for the universal social charge, increasing the income tax standard rate for a single individual and reducing the top of rate of income tax.  Ironically, one is a high earner in this country if one is on &euro;33,800 - previously it was &euro;1,000 less than that.  We restored 25% of the Christmas bonus.  We provided the back to work family dividend to help families move from welfare to work.  We will increase child benefit come January 2015 by &euro;5, and by &euro;5 per child the following January, and the living alone allowance has been increased to benefit 180,000 elderly people.<\/p><p> None of this could be done but for the economic backdrop that we have created with economic recovery gaining momentum, 80,000 net jobs created, unemployment having fallen from 15% to 10.9% and, pertinent to the rural regions where I am from, a regional action plan for jobs to be launched shortly by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, to stimulate investment and create more jobs in the regions as opposed to the centres of population where one would naturally expect that growth would begin.<\/p><p> I welcome all of the capital investment programme that has been set out by Irish Water.  It will make a big difference in a county such as my own, where we have serious problems with water and sewerage treatment.  I also welcome the investment and ambitious plans for the roll-out of broadband to rural Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600059#GGG00300","speaker":"1070","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1417026600,"counter":583,"content":"<p>I am glad to have an opportunity to speak on this important subject.  I thank Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan for bringing the matter before the House.  She does so positively to focus attention on this important issue.<\/p><p>  As previous speakers have said, we found ourselves in a very difficult position in this country over the past five or six years.  There is not much sense in saying that we did not do it or who did it, or blaming somebody else.  We were where we were at the particular time.  The people of this country made massive sacrifices in order to claw their way back out of the depths of depression that they were in.<\/p><p>  It is true that many suffered greatly.  That was going to happen.  When the finances are restricted, whatever was happening beforehand obviously gets worse in that situation.  Commentators have been criticising what they call austerity over the past number of years.  It is austerity when one has a choice.  One introduces austerity or tax increases in order to slow down an economy.  In this case, the Government had no option whatsoever.  It was as simple as that or cut the quality of services right across the board.  If we as a people did not do the right thing, we could have found ourselves losing everything.  We could have lost 65% of all salaries, wages and social welfare payments.  I refer to 65% of every payment, not only bits here and there, or only curtailment.  To those who say we should look at Greece and other countries, I say we should have a look at them and ask ourselves what is the average industrial wage in some of those countries that went a different route, although I am not criticising them.<\/p><p>  These kind of situations are not new.  They have arisen here previously.  Some of us have been around for more than one of them, but this was the worst one.  Society has suffered greatly.  It has found a resilience that previously it did not know it had.  The danger now would be that society would say it all is over, everything is free from here on in and we should go for broke.  It would be a sad and tragic mistake if that were to happen.  Incidentally, that has happened down through history as well.  If we were to do that, we would find ourselves back where we were five or six years ago.  That is not a place we want the people of this country to be in.<\/p><p>  Let us not forget that in times of fiscal difficulty, economic difficulty and general stress, if the wealthy suffer, the poor suffer more.  It automatically follows, as night follows day.  How else can it happen?  When somebody comments that people are poorer than they were, of course they are.  They have suffered an awful tragedy.  They have knuckled down and they have worked hard at it, and I think they have done a great job.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600060#HHH00200","speaker":"957"},{"type":"speech","time":1417026600,"counter":584,"content":"<p>Deputy Durkan has one minute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600060#HHH00300","speaker":"950"},{"type":"speech","time":1417026600,"counter":585,"content":"<p>It is sad.

These are improvements that will directly impact and assist those who are unemployed.  Previous Fianna F&aacute;il budgets cut the carer's allowance, the blind pension, the Christmas bonus and child benefit, to name just a few.  This Government protected the most vulnerable over four budgets by protecting the core social welfare rates of jobseeker's benefit, carer's allowance and State pension.<\/p><p>  If we are assessing budget fairness, then let us be fair and look at the economic context the Government has been faced with.  The Government has spent the past three years dragging the country, which was almost written off as debt-burdened and unrecoverable and one of the PIGS countries, out of an economic recession.  Today, interest rates are at 1.4% and the unemployment rate is at 10.9%.<\/p><p>  The budget deficit in 2011, when this Government came to power, was unsustainable at 8.6% of GDP.  We have now set a target for 2015 of 2.7% of GDP.  This Government has stabilised the economy.  This 2.7% target is a direct result of strong and wise management of each budget since coming into Government.  Reflecting these improvements, our credit rating has seen repeated upward revisions by ratings agencies.<\/p><p>  Last week, 220 jobs were announced.  The week before, 1,755 jobs were announced.  This month is the 28th month in a row that the unemployment rate has decreased.  The facts are that last year 27,700 persons entered the workforce, with 94% of them getting full-time employment.  Since 2012, some 80,000 more people are at work.  This is a fact.  Sometimes when I listen to the minority of the Opposition I think they do not want to hear about the unemployed getting jobs.  They prefer to peddle doom and gloom.<\/p><p>  Creating jobs is what it is all about.  Creating jobs means we get the people back to work and help lift those poorest and most vulnerable out of that poverty trap.  Mothers I meet tell me that they do not want to see their child jobless.  No mother wants to see her child reliant on social welfare.  No mother wants to see her child emigrate.  Unemployment is the greatest inequality in society.<\/p><p>  This budget has ensured that the richest in society bear the larger share of the burden and that the poor and most vulnerable are protected as far as possible.

While the recovery is fragile, it has been built in no small way on the policies implemented by the Government in the past three and a half years.  We know the statistics on job creation.  The only route out of the economic abyss the country was led into is through getting people back to work.  The more people in work, the more one can build one&rsquo;s tax base and have a social dividend to distribute.  Unfortunately, when one&rsquo;s credit line runs out and very few people will lend one money, then one has to make decisions in order to balance the books.  Some people do not believe in that approach.  Deputy Maureen O&rsquo;Sullivan is not one of them.  Some believe that if one digs a hole deep enough in the back yard, sooner or later one will strike oil.  However, that never happens.  I do not know of any such hole where one finds a crock of gold in this country other than those associated with Darby O&rsquo;Gill.<\/p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s counter-motion goes a long way towards what Deputy Maureen O&rsquo;Sullivan seeks to achieve in terms of the commitment to interdepartmental discussion on aspects of budgeting in future.  We already have pre-budget submissions from many of the people referenced in the motion.  The more of that type of open discussion we can have, the better.  I would welcome more public discourse by Ministers, including the Minister of State, Deputy Harris.  It is not necessary to put such an approach into legislation or to set targets or percentages.<\/p><p>  I note the Finance Bill was passed by the D&aacute;il in recent hours.  Deputy Maureen O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s motion is relevant to the Finance Bill, which was opposed by Sinn F&eacute;in, who is represented in the House currently by Deputy Dessie Ellis.  Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s proposal was to maintain the standard rate of income tax at 41% but to introduce three increments of 7% per annum, amounting to 21% which would increase the total to 62%.  One must then add on 13% for the universal social charge, USC, and PRSI, coming to a total of approximately 15% and one soon reaches 75% for the so-called wealthy in society.  According to Sinn F&eacute;in, a garda married to a teacher would fall into that category.  Sinn F&eacute;in would seek to take 75 cent in the euro from them.  If one was unfortunate enough to have 41 acres of marginal or bad land on which one had a few heifers or ewes, Sinn F&eacute;in would then impose a wealth tax on those people.  If one had an antique chair that one inherited from one&rsquo;s grandmother, Sinn F&eacute;in would also want to tax it.  The counter-proposal from the Deputies opposite &ndash; I do not include Deputy Maureen O&rsquo;Sullivan among them &ndash; is to tax people into oblivion in the hope that the country will recover.  That will never happen.  While I support the Government&rsquo;s amendment, I applaud Deputy Maureen O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s sincerity in tabling the motion before the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600061#JJJ00400","speaker":"1058"},{"type":"speech","time":1417027200,"counter":591,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the motion and I thank Deputy Maureen O&rsquo;Sullivan for tabling it.  The issue is important and I accept we all have a responsibility to look at the social impact of decisions reached.  Politicians have a responsibility to lead but also to try to bring people with them.  It does not mean people will always agree with policy but I like to think the decisions we reach are intended to benefit society as broadly and equally as possible.<\/p><p>  The Department of Social Protection has done a very good job in challenging times.  Many people called for a cut to headline rates of social welfare but we did not do that.  Many found themselves in need of social protection because they lost jobs through no fault of their own.  The economic meltdown from which we are finally recovering is something we do not wish to revisit.  To give back &euro;1 billion in the budget, as we did, would have been almost unthinkable a few years ago.  Other Deputies referred to the increase in child benefit payments, the back to work allowance, the family dividend and the living alone allowance.  All of those things are important.<\/p><p>  I accept there has been much criticism of JobBridge, but it is important for people to get experience.  I would like the JobBridge programme to be expanded to allow employers to contribute an additional &euro;50 or &euro;100 to the employee and bring the earnings closer to a living wage.  The proposal was not accepted.  However, I hope the Minister will re-examine the proposal because it is important to give young people a chance to gain experience in a work environment, especially an SME environment where one has to be hands-on.<\/p><p>  The fall in the unemployment rate to 10.9% is very important.  It signals to people that we are moving in the right direction.  When the full impact of the budget is evident, a couple with two children who earn &euro;59,000 will find they gain almost &euro;600 a year.  It is important that people see an impact in terms of the money in their pocket.  Everyone has contributed to the recovery by cutting their cloth to suit their measure.  It has been a very difficult time and it is important to see a return now.<\/p><p>  I wish to mention also the JobsPlus scheme.  It is important to give an employer a subsidy of &euro;10,000 to employ someone.  Many social issues will be addressed by virtue of people being in work but the jobs must be credible.  I hope the scheme will be continued for a number of years.  We must concentrate more on such schemes.<\/p><p>  The Department of Social Protection will publish a social impact assessment on budget 2015 using an ESRI switch model.  It will be interesting to see the results.  The social housing strategy has been published.  A total of 35,000 new social housing units will be provided at a cost of &euro;3.8 billion over the next six years.  In addition, 29,000 construction jobs will be provided, which is important, as people involved in the industry have suffered greatly.  I also welcome the investment in Irish Water of &euro;500 million each year for ten years.  Currently, more than 1.9 million are at work.  Our target should be to have in excess of 2 million in work.  Tonight&rsquo;s debate will focus our minds.

It is important to have such a debate not just about the economy, but society, which is about people, families and communities.  One must look at the context of the recession we have had for the past three years.  Technically, we are in recovery stage currently but the primary goal when the Government came to power was to save the State.  Budgets 2012, 2013 and 2014 were about doing what the troika had laid out for us in terms of closing the gap between what we spend and what we take in through taxation.  That is a challenge.  It is not an easy task for any of us and involved many difficult measures.  The challenge was to increase charges and taxes or to cut services.  We had to try to balance those options.<\/p><p>  It is important to recognise that social welfare is a safety net on which many people will call during their lives.  It is an important element of society that must be factored into overall Government spending.  Its purpose is to support people in need.  In the context of the troika, if we had not played by its rules we would not have been given money to spend on social services in recent years.<\/p><p>The Economic Management Council has been dealing with the economy for the past three years and now the debate is moving on to other issues such as the living wage.  The<b><\/b>low pay commission is under the auspices of the Minister of State, Deputy Nash.  In this Government's first budget we reversed the decision of the previous Government and we increased the minimum wage.  We removed payment of the universal social charge for 300,000 people in that first budget.  In budget 2015 we continued that policy by removing another 100,000 people from the universal social charge.  We have cut the lower rate of the universal social charge and we increased the threshold at which people must pay the charge at the lower rate.<br\/><br\/>As well as saving the economy the focus for the past three years has been on job creation and implementing initiatives to help deliver jobs.  The 12.5% corporation tax rate has provided certainty to a very important sector of society, in particular, in my constituency in Galway it has encouraged job creation and job retention and investment.  The 9% VAT rate is focused on incentivising the hospitality sector which provides full-time and temporary jobs at lower rates of pay.  The jobs action plan provides specific targeted measures across all sectors of the economy and Departments.  The focus has been on jobs and latterly on cutting taxes.  We began that process in the last budget and we need to continue cutting taxes for those who are working.  In this context the back to work dividend initiative is excellent.  It may be helpful to those who could not afford to take up employment in that this initiative gives them an incentive to take up employment where possible.<br\/><br\/>I support the Government amendment with regard to the construction sector and the housing strategy.  Badly needed housing stock is to be provided along with construction jobs.  I commend Deputy O'Sullivan for tabling the motion and I am happy to support the Government amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600061#JJJ00600","speaker":"1110","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1417027800,"counter":594,"content":"<p>I welcome the debate on this subject and I thank Deputy O'Sullivan.  She has pursued this subject in the Chamber and in private discussion with me when we have had chats.  No one individual has the sole right to a social conscience.  All of us have a social conscience; we may not always agree in debate but at least we try to reach the same conclusions in that regard.  <\/p><p>  I refer to the first supplementary budget introduced by this Government in which, as Deputy Kyne said, 300,000 people were taken out of the universal social charge and the VAT rate was reduced to 9% in order to encourage the hospitality sector to hire more employees.  There was also a redistribution of wealth by means of a pension levy on pension funds because middle-class people pay for their pensions but the bulk of pension funds was made up of those people who sought to avoid paying tax.  Deputy O'Sullivan might agree with me on that point, that it was beneficial for those on low pay or those looking for work.<\/p><p>  I refer to a report I did in 2011 which stems from a report done by the Department of Social Protection, which was a review of applications for unemployment benefit and assistance scheme conditions for workers not employed full-time.  At that time, many people were employed part-time while now, more than 90% of workers are in full-time employment.  There seems to be an unfair anomaly whereby people who are willing to work part-time, ten hours a week, are not being treated fairly.  A person who does ten hours work spread over five days is not entitled to social welfare payment.  If a person does ten hours work over two days, he or she is entitled to three days' payment.  In any man's language that does not seem fair.  We are trying to encourage people back to work and part-time work is often the first step.  Now that the economy is beginning to improve - although a recession is never over until people feel the difference in their pockets and we are not there quite yet - and when in the next few years unemployment is at an acceptable level of 5% or 7% I suggest that we could consider initiatives to help people who want to get back to work.  I suggest that social welfare payments could be paid for hours worked rather than for days worked.  I support Deputy O'Sullivan in her efforts.  The Government amendment is in partial agreement with her motion.  I welcome the debate and I will support the Government amendment to the motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600062#KKK00200","speaker":"1053"},{"type":"speech","time":1417027800,"counter":595,"content":"<p>Deputy Joan Collins is sharing time with Deputies Tom Fleming, Clare Daly, Catherine Murphy, Mick Wallace and Michael Fitzmaurice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600062#KKK00300","speaker":"950"},{"type":"speech","time":1417027800,"counter":596,"content":"<p>There may have been a slight economic recovery but it has been on the backs of ordinary people who have paid for it.  The ordinary people, the taxpayers, workers and social welfare recipients, have borne the brunt of &euro;30 billion being taken out of the economy in eight years.  This has been a very blunt instrument to impose on a people within the space of a short period of time.<\/p><p>  In the recent budget those on low incomes have received a tax relief of &euro;2 a week compared to a tax relief of &euro;17 to &euro;18 a week for those on high incomes.  That shows which way this Government is again transferring the wealth to those who earn more.<\/p><p>  The Government's amendment aims to turn this debate into another chorus of self-praise for its recent budget.  This debate should be about inequality and the reality that we live in a very unequal and therefore, unfair and unjust society.  We live in a world dominated by global capitalism.  Inequality is not just an unfortunate by-product of the working out of the capitalist system; it is an integral part and essential component of the system.  For capitalism to work, there must be a situation whereby capital, the means to invest and produce new wealth, is held by a minority, a small minority which is becoming smaller, while the majority have no capital and are forced to work for a small capitalist class.<\/p><p>  I refer to the recent Oxfam report which states that the 85 wealthiest people in this world earn $500,000 every five minutes while people at the bottom are struggling to feed their kids, to put a roof over their heads, to find decent employment.  This is the root of all the inequality, unfairness and injustice in the world every day.<\/p><p>  An example of this inequality, unfairness and injustice is the effect of the Ebola virus crisis in Sierra Leone.  Ebola is a vicious virus but any health professional knows that the rate of attrition would be well below the current levels if it were not attacking people who live just above starvation in a country with a non-existent health service.  As long as we tolerate this system and fail to consider that there are alternatives, these problems will persist.  <\/p><p>  Inequality, unfairness and injustice, like poverty, will always be with us.  Irish society is one of the most unequal in an unequal world.  Since 1975, average incomes in Ireland have doubled which is a significant achievement.  However, incomes for the top 10% of the population have tripled and real incomes for the top 1% have grown five times.  That does not take into account the six years of austerity which has hit those hardest who can least afford it.<\/p><p>  Using statistics collated by the United Nations, the Oxfam report states that Ireland has by far the highest level in Europe of income inequality before taxes and welfare payments are taken into account.  According to the UN report, if it were not for the effect of redistribution of those taxes and welfare, over 50% of our population would be living in poverty.<\/p><p>  Government policy has had a significant effect in reducing inequality and poverty but it has not eliminated either.<\/p><p>It is better to live in a society with progressive redistribution policies, where taxation takes from those who are better off and gives, including services, to those who are less well off, with a good social welfare system, first class universal health care, an education system which gives equal opportunities to all and good community services.  I am sure all of the parties here aspire to this, but it has never been achieved.  What progress had been made has been more or less dismantled over the past six years.  The UNICEF report this year showed the number of children living in poverty rose by 10% between 2008 and 2012.  An extra 130,000 children are experiencing poverty, increasing the amount to a scandalous 28% of all children.<\/p><p> Last night one of the Fine Gael Deputies stated funding for the social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP, had been reduced from &euro;70 million to &euro;62 million.  This means &euro;8 million has been cut from communities which most need support.  Are we now speaking about the equalisation of misery and poverty in the country rather than increasing this funding and ensuring all areas get the proper funding they should?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600062#KKK00400","speaker":"1193","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1417028400,"counter":598,"content":"<p>Cuts in the health service are unacceptable, particularly when vital supports and resources for organisations dealing with disabilities are deprived of the necessary vital funding to carry out their core services.  For instance, Kerry Parents and Friends Association, KPFA, was informed last week by the HSE that its budget from 1 July to 7 November this year was cut by &euro;44,447.  This is a draconian cut in the circumstances and is proportionate to a reduction of more than &euro;130,000 per annum, which is appalling.  It appears a full cut will be made in 2015.  I hope this is avoided and staved off.  I ask all Ministers to ensure the full budget is retained.  In particular I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Simon Harris, who is a very capable person, to convey the message to the Minister for Health.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, is doing excellent work in disability services and I am sure she will give recognition to this difficulty.<\/p><p>  The organisation is now in a crisis due to personnel and funding deficits.  The announcement is detrimental to its future viability.  The association is under serious pressure because of the projected high costs of HIQA registration, the high costs associated with the need to manage emergencies given the age profile of those they support, and the need to increase the number of senior personnel to manage the volume of work which has been placed on a very small team.<\/p><p>  The reduction is a dereliction by the Minister for Health and the HSE of the provision of resources to allow people with intellectual disabilities in County Kerry to live full lives as equal citizens.  It epitomises the difficulties faced by all providers of services for this vulnerable sector in society.  There is a growing gap between the need and demand for supports for people with intellectual disabilities and their families and the resources available to meet their needs.  It is time to bridge this gap to sustain and build these essential supports.  Disability organisations have experienced substantial budget cuts over the past seven years, resulting in a reduction of more than 20% in funding.  Service providers have made every effort to protect essential services with reduced resources, and it is no longer possible to continue to provide quality supports in this way.<\/p><p>  The substantial increase in waiting lists for residential services for respite and other supports can only be dealt with through additional investment.  Some service providers are extremely prudent and do everything possible to minimise costs and maximise efficiencies, but the adoption of HIQA quality standards throughout the services is creating significant additional demands on already reduced resources and it will not be possible to meet all of the requirements of the standards without vital additional investment.<\/p><p>  There is extreme concern about the future viability of the KPFA and its ability to deliver front-line services.  I appeal to the Minister for Health to restore the shortfall of &euro;44,000 immediately and ensure the HSE will provide the necessary amount of funding to the KPFA in 2015.<\/p><p>  The delivery of services by St. Francis Special School in Beaufort has also been affected due to a shortage of therapists for the essential multidisciplinary requirements of the pupils.  The HSE has increased the caseload, but the number of therapists is the same.  This has been exacerbated by the relocation of therapists and therapy hours from one area to cover another area.  The management of the school, parents and the HSE have been reviewing matters and making some progress on these issues, but there is still some way to go in addressing and finalising satisfactory solutions to these matters.  There is also a need for more respite care for some of the pupils and their parents.  I call for this matter to be examined and resolved.  Services are carried out in conjunction with St. John of God's services, but there is a need for more funding to solve the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600063#LLL00200","speaker":"1050"},{"type":"speech","time":1417028400,"counter":599,"content":"<p>I congratulate Deputy O'Sullivan on tabling the motion.  She is one of a very small number of Deputies who has a consistent human rights-based approach to these issues, and that includes the Government benches and not just the Opposition.  It is important because too much of what goes on in here is based on short-term electoral gain or kowtowing to sectoral interests and there is not enough standing back and looking at the bigger picture, which is precisely what this motion seeks to do, which is why we are all here.<br\/><br\/>I am a socialist, which means in a traditional sense I look at the world turned upside down or, as I would put it, right side up, whereby the interests of ordinary people are dealt with first and foremost and everything else is subservient to this.  I listened to the contributions from some of the Government backbenchers and I must ask what planet they are on.  Obviously we have asked ourselves that since listening to the appalling handling of the water situation last week.  We know there is an enormous disconnect between the real world and the way in which the Government views it.  Even the statistics and research in this area show that the Deputies who spoke earlier are completely wrong.<br\/><br\/>The OECD report of 2013, Crisis squeezes income and puts pressure on inequality and poverty, stated income inequality in Ireland is four times the OECD average.  Our economic policies are certainly redistributing wealth, but in reverse to the way in which Robin Hood did it; they take money from the poor and give it to the rich.  Inequality has been increased in the lifetime of the Government.  When commenting on the recent budget, Social Justice Ireland stated the gap between rich and poor has been extended.  Those who took the biggest hit during the crisis were left behind again as priority was given to reducing the top income tax rate.  John Douglas of the Mandate trade union made the point that the &euro;405 million giveaway in income tax changes to the top earners could have been used to invest in Irish Water or other measures, but the Government chose not to do so.<br\/><br\/>A blog written by our former colleague, Luke 'Ming' Flanagan MEP, about the experience he had when he brought his baby to the hospital over the weekend and the reality of propaganda versus real life was illuminating.  He told the story and captured the phrase, &quot;Is surviving the new thriving?&quot;.  Many people responded to it because it tallies exactly with the experiences they have had.  People get up early in the morning and work harder and longer for less.  An article in the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>today showed average wages have decreased &euro;700 in the past three months despite the fact the hours of work have increased.  The types of jobs that Deputy Mitchell O'Connor lauded are generally low-paid part-time zero-hour contracts as the gap between rich and poor in society develops.  The race to the bottom carries on unimpeded as the Government seeks to implement a vicious neoliberal economic approach where public services have been decimated.  The economic wage means the types of conditions in which people live now will mean the generation of young people now will be the first generation to be worse off than their parents.<\/p><p>How mad is that when the accumulated knowledge in society is greater than ever before?  As a simple aspiration, is it too much to ask for a roof over one's head and not to be living in a hostel or on the streets?  Is it too much to expect that when people are sick they might be able to get health care, that their children would get an education opportunity to allow them to develop to the best of their potential or that when they retire they might get the pension they paid into all their working lives?  The things that people two generations ago thought were here forever have been taken away in the struggle to earn super profits for the very wealthy at the top of our society.  That is an absolute condemnation of those in power, not just in this country, but across Europe and particularly in the United States where things are even worse.<\/p><p> Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan has pointed out that the Government could put different policies centre stage, but has chosen not to do it.  Martin Luther King made the point that change does not come in on the wheels of inevitability but only through continuous struggle.  The Irish people are educating themselves and realise that by them taking action outside the door of this Chamber they can better deliver a fairer society than those they voted for in the misplaced aspiration that they for would do it for them.  I am very glad the people have realised that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600063#LLL00300","speaker":"1192","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1417029000,"counter":601,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan for tabling this timely motion.  It gives us the space to consider what should happen into the future and just as importantly how it should happen.  We need to make it happen because it will not happen on its own.  Too often we have been a hostage to the past and present when we need to be aspiring to something far better in the future.  Equality or a more equal society is actually very good for us.  If we start with that premise, everything else starts to fall into place.  We have long way to go.  First, we collectively need to accept that is what is needed.  Second, we need to look at where we are.  Based on the data from <i>Towards a Second Republic<\/i>, a book published two years ago, Ireland is one of the most unequal countries in the world behind the United States, Russia and Mexico.  Ireland is an outlier within the European Union - we are the third worst in the EU 27 when it comes to equality.<br\/><br\/>We are one of the worst performers in the amount of money we spend on education, which is the route out of poverty for so many people.  At one of the worst points in history in the middle of the Second World War, William Beveridge had the visionary idea of a welfare state and was able to bring people with him on that journey.  That is the kind of thinking we need to have at this point.  There is no point in coming out of a crisis just to exist to pay bills and pay back debts that we should never have incurred and were never ours in the first place.  We need to have a vision for something that is much bigger and better - a more equal society.<br\/><br\/><i>The Spirit Level<\/i>is a book by two very capable professionals who both did their PhDs on the subject.  Their findings showed that equality is very good for society.  More equal societies have better health and lower crime rates.  In more equal societies people are more interested in a more egalitarian and inclusive society rather than one in which people wish to dominate.<br\/><br\/>We are approaching the centenary of the 1916 Rising and we need to use that as an opportunity to consider where we were then, where we are now and where we want to be in the future.  It would be a wasted opportunity if we just commemorate that as a point in history and do not use it to define some vision for the future, and not only define a vision for the future but actually consider how to get there.  The word &quot;how&quot; is incredibly important because it is not possible to have leadership without using the word &quot;how&quot;.<br\/><br\/>The terms of the motion provide a way for us to look at the money that is available to us and see how that measures against inequality in society.  We then need to decide how to spend that in a way that produces a more equal society that is better for us all in the long run.  It will be a missed opportunity if we do not do that.  I am disappointed that the Government did not accept the motion and use it as that opportunity.  If we are to emerge out of this crisis, we need to emerge in a better place.  I heard much of that being said before the last general election, but I have not seen anything from the Government that gives me any kind of encouragement that this is what is intended.  Its objective is merely to survive the crisis, do the bookkeeping and talk about targets with no real vision driving it into the future.  That is an awful wasted opportunity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600064#MMM00200","speaker":"1052"},{"type":"speech","time":1417029000,"counter":602,"content":"<p>We all have our own ways of presenting things.  I thank Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan for tabling the motion and creating a stimulating debate on the issue.  We can massage figures and play with words, and when it is done in the Chamber here it is called spin.  Everyone is capable of it in their own way.  When the Government came into power, its Members thought they could never spin it like the previous Government.  However, in fairness to them, they have got better at it and have learnt a lot in the nearly four years they have been in power.  We are at the mercy of considerable Government spin at present.<br\/><br\/>We are told that Ireland is growing faster than any other country in Europe.  However, of the EU 28, only Romania, Hungary, Lithuania, Latvia, Croatia, Greece and Bulgaria have a higher percentage of people at risk of poverty or social exclusion among their own nationals, and we fare better than all but one of these countries by only a percentage point or two.  According to recent EUROSTAT figures, the Government has presided over a situation where nearly one third of all people born in this country live either in or are at risk of poverty or social exclusion.<br\/><br\/>The Government often advises us to look at the bigger picture, that everything is getting brighter, and that the impressive growth figures mean a lot to the country.  While, of course, they help, as we have pointed out many times of late, sadly they do not reflect the real lives of many people who look at the small picture and see many problems and challenges.<br\/><br\/>The very clear-sighted writer Richard McAleavey, speaking of the Government, has said it has presided over:<blockquote>The suffocation of public finances to pay off banker debt; attacks on the working majority in the form of wage cuts, withdrawal of vital services, free labour schemes for employers, regressive indirect taxation measures that attack the poor whilst creating a tax regime that favours the rich even more, scapegoating and criminalisation of people dependent on social welfare payments ... and presented them all as measures in the public interest.<\/blockquote>The T&aacute;naiste has outlined how the Department of Social Protection publishes a social impact assessment each year with the help of the pro-business lobbyists in the ESRI.  Each year the Government manages to give the least help to those who need it most.  Budget 2015 gave the largest tax breaks to those on the top rate of tax, which goes to show that the Department of Social Protection does not practise what its name would imply.<\/p><p>Either the ESRI is getting it wrong or the Department of Social Protection is codding us.<\/p><p> The fact that those in government constantly talk about the spending money people have in their pockets acutely demonstrates that they cannot see the wood for the trees.  The quality and availability of public services are central to any debate about the welfare of the people of any country, but the Government seems to box them off as if they were not relevant to our collective well-being.<\/p><p> It is little wonder then that the social impact analysis did not do much to deter the Minister, Deputy Noonan, from planning massive public spending cuts every year up to 2018.  In October, Michael Taft performed a budget analysis using data from the Government's budget report that adjusted for inflation and the IMF's predictions for population increases in Ireland.  He found that total spending on public services, social transfers and investment will fall by more than 9% by 2018.  He claims that funding for schools, hospitals, policing, transportation, enterprise supports - all our public services - will fall by more than 8%.  Government investment, which is vital for our infrastructure, will fall by 15.4% by 2018.  Those in government constantly talk about the necessity to make this country an attractive place for the international market but it would be good if it changed tack a bit and made this a more attractive place for Irish people who want to start up their own small business or who are trying to keep the existing one going and gave those people a little more help.  We keep forgetting that the domestic economy employs 75% of our people and it is very problematic for most people trying to work within that area at the moment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600064#MMM00300","speaker":"956","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1417029600,"counter":604,"content":"<p>I compliment Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan on this motion and it is a testament to her commitment.

There is talk about growth and turning the corner but the reality is that in different parts of the country tonight there are people who have been waiting for 20 weeks to access the fair deal scheme.  Those are people who gave to this country year after year and now they are being left on their own and families are being decimated over what is being done.  Mothers and fathers are bringing their children to hospitals only to find that the service they need is not available, as was highlighted by Luke 'Ming' Flanagan MEP when he spoke about the state of the accident and emergency department in the hospital in Ballinasloe in County Galway.  One finds that a few miles down the road the accident and emergency department that had been operating is now closed.  What hope does that give people?  Does that constitute human rights or good budgeting?  It does not.  The consequences of many of those decisions are isolation and suicide but do we really care and, if we do, what are we doing about it?  In most parts of Ireland the Government has taken resources away from people but it has not put anything back in their place.  Nothing has been done to enhance economic stability.  The Government has taken everything away, not given anything back and it still believes people can survive in different parts of the country.<\/p><p>  We talk about helping people with disabilities and of all the good people who help others but in recent days Ability West telephoned me to advise that its budget has been cut and I got another telephone call from the Brothers of Charity to advise that its budget has been cut.  Regardless of how the spin doctors dress it up, if one is getting &euro;100 and one's payment is cut by &euro;20, one will only get &euro;80.<\/p><p>  We have to think outside the box.  I have talked to many young people who are employed who want to work with people but find they are forbidden from doing so under the current system.  These are 18 to 25 year olds who want to be given a chance to feel they are doing something for their country.  There is nothing available, even in a scheme, to let them grasp the nettle and get on in life.<\/p><p>  I listened to an interview with a representative of a body that looked into the medical cards issue on &quot;Morning Ireland&quot; this morning and they dressed it up and danced around it but the reality is that a child who is brain damaged in Sligo tonight has been left without a medical card.  We can stay here all night and talk about human rights budgeting but we should be honest and if we are going to say something, we should stand behind it.

There is talk of a plan to build 35,000 houses with an allocation of &euro;3.5 billion in the first year.  I know a little about building and I can tell the Minister of State that the Government needed to start four or five months ago with the foundations to get ready for next year.  It needs to line the ducks up.  There was an announcement in the budget and there was another announcement today and we welcome all those initiatives but if we do not fast-forward all these projects more and more people will be living in places that they will not have any hope of owning.<\/p><p>  There are families who will be evicted from their homes in the next few weeks and we have not done anything for them.

It is very well deserved.  She is respected on all sides of this House as an individual who is extremely sincere in her commitment.  I echo Deputy Clare Daly's comments on Deputy O'Sullivan's human rights record and I have seen some of that with her work with UEPA in this House and in countries like Mozambique.  I am grateful to have an opportunity to participate and engage with her on this motion this evening.<\/p><p>  Some common ground, perhaps more than some would like to admit, has been reached during this debate on the importance of social impact assessments of budgets and the importance of examining the social impact of decisions as we move forward.  The word &quot;timely&quot; has been used and this debate certainly is timely.  We have moved on from the troika programme and there is an economic recovery and I accept that one can argue the benefits of it, but there are economic metrics.  The Government has choices.  When one has choices and is in an era of recovery in terms of the issue assessment and making sure that recovery is shared out, it is appropriate we would have this debate and discuss this issue. <\/p><p>  I emphasise that the overall goal of the Government's policy has been to put the public finances on a sound footing and to return the economy to growth, not only growth in terms of GDP but in terms of jobs, which the Government believes is the best way to help the most vulnerable in the country.  We have already seen the benefits of this approach in the very strong employment performances in the past number of years with more than 80,000 people now at work compared with a low point of early 2012, according to statistics only published today in the Quarterly National Household Survey from the CSO. <\/p><p>  Deputy Catherine Murphy talked about targets, and I am not sure if this was the point she was making, but at times we on all sides of this House and those in the media can become so obsessed with talking about targets, figures and numbers that perhaps we forget that there are people behind each of those targets.  We can argue this whatever way people wish to argue it, but 80,000 more people have jobs.  They are not only targets or numbers behind each number is a real person and story.  Wee in this House sometimes fail to make that connection between the macro figure and the real life impact, and that works in both directions.<\/p><p>  I must also emphasise to Deputies that through this period of fiscal adjustment the Government has endeavoured to protect the most vulnerable in so far as possible.  When one takes out &euro;30 billion of an extraction from the economy in terms of taxes and cuts over a number of years, it is almost impossible for that not to have an impact on every family in the country.  it has been a difficult number of years for people but we have taken efforts to try to protect the most vulnerable.  During the debate yesterday a question was raised over whether certain budgets over the period of adjustment were progressive or regressive.   <\/p><p>On this question, I point to the most recently available analysis by the ESRI published after budget 2015 which covers the budgets from 2009 to 2015.  This indicates that in terms of household income distribution the top quintile, or one fifth, of households lost almost 14% of their disposable income.  This compares to losses of approximately 10% for the other quintiles on lower incomes.  That is not to suggest that there was not a loss or that the impact was not severe.  However, given the many statistics we have heard during this debate, those are ones worth noting too.  In addition, the ESRI has also produced research showing that over budgets 2009 to 2013 there were no materially different impacts between genders.  Gender is an issue that arose during the context of this debate last night.  This reflects the fact that the tax and welfare system does not discriminate based on gender.<\/p><p> More generally, the Government recognises the importance of building the capacity to understand the varying impacts of budgetary policy.  With this in mind, the capacity of Government Departments to conduct more advanced distributional analysis is continually being explored and expanded.  The steering group for the SWITCH model run by the ESRI includes representatives from the Departments of Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, Social Protection and Health.  For example, the SWITCH model is currently being expanded to include the ability to analyse the housing assistance payment as well as medical cards.  This builds on previous expansions to include the ability to model water charges and the property tax.  These changes can only benefit our capacity to understand the impacts of budgetary policy as well as wider Government policy.  This is something which I hope can be welcomed by Members on all sides.<\/p><p> I note the emphasis the motion puts on human rights and their place in formulating budgets.  This Government also acknowledges the importance of human rights in wider policy formulation and not only as part of the budget process.  For this reason, the programme for Government contains a commitment to require all public bodies to take due note of equality and human rights in carrying out their functions.  Furthermore, the Cabinet handbook requires a statement on the likely effects of the decision sought on equality and persons experiencing or at risk of poverty or social exclusion to be included in all memoranda to Government.<\/p><p> This is an area we need to continue to develop and keep under close scrutiny as we enter a period of economic recovery.  Deputy Catherine Murphy spoke of the need for a vision for the future.  While we might disagree on how to get there, there is more common ground between us than we would like to admit in terms of what is that vision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600065#NNN00300","speaker":"1106","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1417030200,"counter":607,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this worthwhile and important Private Members' motion and commend Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan on bringing it forward.<\/p><p>  We need a new budgetary process in this State.  There is has been much talk of the need for evidence-based decisions but there does not appear to be much action in this regard.  Every year, we are treated to the leaking of most of the budget proposals to the media but we never see leaks on the basis of the choices that can be made.  Every decision that the Government makes around budget time has consequences but there is no discussion in advance of the budget of the choices that Government faces.  With evidenced-based decision making, the reality of those choices can be seen in advance and the rational for the decision can be looked at and considered.  It is the prerogative of the Government to make the decisions that it wants but it must be able to stand over them and accept the choices made.  If human rights budgeting was part of the process, would we have seen the cutbacks to disability payments for young people in the 2012 budget?  Would Government have walked itself into the mess of the medical card probity budget of 2014?  Evidence-based decision making could have saved this Government from some embarrassing climb downs and could have given it some credibility with citizens.<\/p><p>  If a Government wants to make decisions based on ideology, so be it.  That is why we have politics and democracy.  However, if a Government makes decisions that harm sectors of society, then it should be able to stand over them on ideological grounds.  I believe we need a process that is more open and discusses options openly.  Whether that is called equality budgeting or human rights budgeting, it does not really matter.  We need a process that can show the possible impacts in advance.  The Government and the D&aacute;il can then make decisions based on all the facts.  I believe that we should always attempt to make the least bad decisions.<\/p><p>  The papers today reported on the longitudinal study Growing up in Ireland that has some interesting findings in relation to children growing up in a recession.  According to one of the authors of the report, the findings of lingering stress were surprising.  In this regard, she said: &quot;It did not fade away in the space of two to four years.  It is worse to be stuck in poverty than to get out of it, but we are finding an effect later.  That would be a concern.&quot;  She went on to say: &quot;Financial stress can manifest itself in children being less confident and more fearful.  Some have problems concentrating and others feel low.&quot;  That is just one example of the impact of decisions that Government makes.  Obviously, the recession would have happened anyway and the Government is not responsible for it but it is responsible for the decisions that were made by it, which increased stress on society.  What would a study that looked at the impact of the recession on the disabled, the elderly and carers have to say about the stress and strain of existing in the current climate?  I am sure the results would be the same.  <\/p><p>  I have listened tonight to Government Deputies use the &quot;There Is No Alternative&quot;, TINA, excuse.  The reality is that there was and are alternatives.  Much depends on whether Government wants to look at them or not.  The Government did not have to introduce a budget this year that gave more back in tax to better off workers, with those earning over &euro;70,000 gaining more cash-in-hand than a worker on the minimum wage.  That was a choice.<\/p><p>  The implementation of human rights budgeting would test the changes against basic principles.  We on this side of the House would make our decisions based on human rights, not on benefiting the constituency that this Government wants to represent.  Even if we accepted the TINA excuse for the budgets up to this year, the Government can no longer hide behind it.  Now is the time to use the recovery to assist those that have carried the can for the regressive budgets of the past six years.  Now is the time to refocus budgeting on human rights and equality, making sure that the inequalities in our society are addressed.  This Government failed to use the recession to protect people.  Perhaps it will use the recovery to benefit them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600066#OOO00200","speaker":"1001"},{"type":"speech","time":1417030200,"counter":608,"content":"<p>For years I have been calling on the Government to equality and poverty proof the budget and to bring together the relevant Departments and agencies in a joined-up manner to inform State policy and work in collaboration to achieve change and social justice for all of those living in poverty and social exclusion.  The Government is aware of the need to do what is proposed in this motion.  The problem is that it does not want to know the result of such an analysis.<br\/><br\/>Departmental analysis of last year's budget states: &quot;Households worst affected by the measures being proposed are<sub><\/sub>those with children, in particular lone parent families.&quot;  In actual fact, the latest figures show that 16.4% of one-parent families, as compared to 6.9% of the rest of the population, live in consistent poverty and the Government is doing little to address this.  Figures also show that half of the people living in below-average private rented accommodation are at risk of poverty, a figure which is undoubtedly attributable to the cap on the rent allowance that is causing such despair for people.<br\/><br\/>The Government is in no doubt as to the strong correlation between its policies and the disproportionate decline in well-being among our more vulnerable groups, including children, the elderly and the disabled.  It is aware that children are going to school hungry.  This country's child poverty rate, as measured by EUROSTAT, increased from 18% to 28.6% from 2008 to 2012, a net increase of more than 130,000 poor children in Ireland.  The policies of this Government have placed us close to the bottom of a UNICEF list in terms of the impact of the recession in Ireland on children as compared with 41 developed countries.  That is shameful.  The same UNICEF report states that 16.1% of 15 to 24 year olds in Ireland are not in any form of education, employment or training.  They are, according to UNICEF, &quot;a generation cast aside&quot;.  Cuts to front-line supports and community based training initiatives by the Government ensure that these young people will grow into adulthood feeling marginalised and excluded from mainstream society.<br\/><br\/>In regard to the Minister of State's commentary around helping the most vulnerable, the UNICEF report, entitled &quot;Children of the Recession<i>&quot;, <\/i>states that Irish families with children have in five years lost the equivalent of ten years of income progress yet other countries beholden to the IMF during the same period did a far better job at protecting their children.  Particularly alarming was how quickly standards slipped.  According to a UNICEF report published four years ago, Ireland was one of the top ten best places to be a child. <\/p><p>However, political decisions to pay billions of euro back to unsecured bondholders had the knock-on effect of decimating health, education, housing and welfare support.  Clearly, the well-being of our most vulnerable was not at the top of the Government's priorities during the economic recession.  We are being told the recession is over but the question is whether the Government will be shamed by the international evidence as presented by UNICEF into changing its approach by independently evaluating the social impact of previous policies, recognising the poverty threshold in this country and stepping in so that generations of families are not doomed to live forever beyond the line.<\/p><p> Studies all over the world have consistently shown that children living in poverty are more likely to become impoverished adults and have poor children, creating a sustained inter-generational cycle of poverty.  If the Government is not prepared to address the income gap between the basic social welfare rate and the recognised income required for an adequate standard of living, it is condemning further generations of Irish children to a lifetime of endemic poverty.  It is creating another generation of children in care, of early school leavers and of unemployed.  All children have a right to a better future.  The Government has a moral duty to ensure they are given every chance.  Surely supporting this motion would be a monumental step in that direction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600066#OOO00300","speaker":"1094","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1417030800,"counter":610,"content":"<p>T&aacute; s&eacute; do-chreidte nach bhfuilimid go l&eacute;ir ar aon intinn maidir le na t&eacute;arma&iacute; sa ghn&oacute; pr&iacute;obh&aacute;ideach seo.  Cheapas go mbeimid go l&eacute;ir ag tac&uacute; leis na t&eacute;arma&iacute;.  I feel an air of disbelief that we are actually going to vote on this Private Members' motion because who could vote against principles of human rights and equality?  Who could vote against that aspect of the motion that calls for a guiding vision for Ireland that would see policy coherence and a commitment to the common good?  I cannot understand the objection to the part of the motion that calls for a narrowing of the gap between the basic social welfare rates and the income required, as measured by the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice, for a minimally adequate standard of living and for that gap to be narrowed gradually.  Some Members will vote against a Private Members' motion which acknowledges the positives in the economic recovery.  They will also be voting against human rights which, as I outlined last night, are part of our country's obligations under international human rights treaties.<\/p><p>  It is disappointing that because of the amendment to the motion and the vote, we have not had what I had hoped would be a more philosophical debate on the principles and ideals that would guide us over the next few years.  One of the ways to get it right is if human rights are at the core of what we do in budgets and in policies.  I know there are challenges when it comes to a human rights-based budget analysis, such as accessing data and the capacity skills for those who would do the work, but they are not insurmountable.<\/p><p>  Joseph Stiglitz is often quoted and I am struck by one short quote that every downturn comes to an end.  We hope it is coming to an end but what some people suffered during that downturn must be acknowledged, from the forced 100% repayment to reckless banks and bondholders, who gambled and lost but who really did not lose at all, to the cost to the Irish people that was foisted on them, without their agreement.  We know the cost to families and communities.  Some 500,000 people emigrated.  We know the cost in terms of the growth in poverty, the growth in unemployment and the growth in homelessness.  It is all the more vital that we get it right if we are in recovery and that we do not get complacent and say that happened before but it will never happen again.  It can happen and that is why it is vital we put human rights and the common good at the heart of what we do.<\/p><p>  When tax incentives are offered in a budget, are they proofed from a human rights perspective?  Will the Government consider a sunset clause after a certain number of a years - a review that the objectives of the incentives have been met and that this would include a human rights audit?  Can the Government put its hand on its heart and say that the tax policy here is compatible with the obligation to use the maximum available resources to realise economic and social rights?  On the international stage, we are a respected voice for human rights but we also must be a voice for tax justice, against tax havens and against illicit flows of capital.  That must be part of our guiding philosophy.<\/p><p>  We all agree on the principles of accountability, transparency and participation.  Deputy Catherine Murphy and I were members of the Constitutional Convention, which was a very good example of participatory democracy.<\/p><p>  I acknowledge the work and assistance of Social Justice Ireland, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and Christian Aid.  I used some of their work in my speech last night and do so again tonight and I thank them for their insights and dedication.  I also thank everybody who contributed to the debate last night and tonight, especially my colleagues in the Technical Group because, collectively, we have been a voice for justice and equality and are concerned for those who get lost in the GDPs, the percentages and the statistics.<\/p><p>  We can acknowledge the positives.  Every positive must be welcomed but the question is who is benefiting most from those positives.  We all respect the work of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and I was struck by something in its magazine recently.  It said that Government, media etc. want to give the impression that the country has entered recovery and that the era of austerity is over but what it is finding in its day-to-day work with people in severe deprivation, lack of money, shortage of the necessities of life and worries about maintaining a roof over one's head.  It is most directly involved with the people who are suffering in this country.<\/p><p>  I had hoped for more philosophy, so I will finish with a quote from Nelson Mandela.  He said: &quot;Action without vision is only passing time, vision without action is merely day dreaming, but vision with action can change the world.&quot;  We must get our vision right, then we will get our action right.  We can create a better country because every action must be accompanied by a vision.  If our vision is equality and the common good, then our actions must match that also.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600067#PPP00200","speaker":"1005"},{"type":"vote","time":1417030800,"counter":611,"content":"<p>Amendment put:<\/p><p>The D\u00e1il divided: T\u00e1, 70; N\u00edl, 44.<\/p><br\/><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Deputies Paul Kehoe and Emmet Stagg; N\u00edl, Deputies Maureen O'Sullivan and Michael Fitzmaurice.<\/p><p>Amendment declared carried.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600067#PPP00250","aye":["1062","980","946","1079","989","1030","1042","975","1092","988","1031","972","1041","1093","1087","1099","1006","986","968","1007","1011","1103","957","1078","1014","1085","1009","1051","1076","995","1106","1089","949","1033","1012","1098","1021","1110","1053","990","982","1023","1194","1000","997","977","1038","1004","1070","1034","1056","1045","955","1018","1060","1058","1073","1061","1081","966","947","952","1074","961","978","1010","1095","948","950","1185"],"nay":["1066","1190","1071","1193","1057","1083","1037","1192","959","1107","976","1022","1047","1198","1050","1108","1094","960","1049","962","983","999","1008","1017","1090","993","965","981","992","1183","1052","969","1044","1054","1028","984","1005","1001","1178","970","1102","1080","1065","956"]},{"type":"vote","time":1417030800,"counter":612,"content":"<p>Question put: \"That the motion, as amended, be agreed to.\"<\/p><p>The D\u00e1il divided: T\u00e1, 70; N\u00edl, 44.<\/p><br\/><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Deputies Paul Kehoe and Emmet Stagg; N\u00edl, Deputies Maureen O'Sullivan and Michael Fitzmaurice.<\/p><p>Question declared carried.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112600067#PPP00275","aye":["1062","980","946","1079","989","1030","1042","975","1092","988","1031","972","1041","1093","1087","1099","1006","986","968","1007","1011","1103","957","1078","1014","1085","1009","1051","1076","995","1106","1089","949","1033","1012","1098","1021","1110","1053","990","982","1023","1194","1000","997","977","1038","1004","1070","1034","1056","1045","955","1018","1060","1058","1073","1061","1081","966","947","952","1074","961","978","1010","1095","948","950","1185"],"nay":["1066","1190","1071","1193","1057","1083","1037","1192","959","1107","976","1022","1047","1198","1050","1108","1094","960","1049","983","962","999","1008","1017","1090","993","965","981","992","1183","1052","969","1044","1054","1028","984","1005","1001","1178","970","1102","1080","1065","956"]},{"type":"unspoken","time":1417030800,"counter":613,"content":"<p>The D&aacute;il adjourned at 9.30 p.m. until 9.30 a.m. on Thursday, 27 November 2014.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
