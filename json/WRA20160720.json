By this measure Ireland has a relatively large proportion of wage earners who would be classified as low paid, ahead of the UK and Portugal.  This is confirmed by recent research from Logue and Callan (ESRI, 2016), which indicates that, for Ireland, while the median wage increased between 2005 and 2013, the proportion of low wage employees was broadly stable for 2005, 2008 and 2010 at 20%, although it increased to 23% in 2013.<\/p>  <p>  However, under this Eurostat definition, the threshold for low pay is set relative to the level of earnings in an individual country, rather than to the absolute value of the wage itself.  Thus, a person earning &euro;10 per hour in a country where the median wages are &euro;16 per hour would be deemed to be low paid, whereas a person earning &euro;8 per hour in a country where the median wages are &euro;12 per hour would not be deemed to be low paid.  <\/p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s mean hourly earnings are, in fact, the second highest in the EU after Denmark (Eurostat, 2014).

In practical terms, for example, an employee in Ireland, where the median earnings are &euro;16.43 per hour (see LPC Report 2016, based on EU SILC data for 2014 &ndash; latest available) who earns &euro;10.90 per hour (or &euro;22,100 per year) would be deemed to be low-paid, whereas an employee in a country with median earnings of &euro;12 per hour who earns only &euro;8.10 per hour (or &euro;16,400 per year) would not be considered to be low-paid.<\/p>  <p>  The authors of the ESRI paper point out, also, that Irish wage rates are among the highest in the EU on a purchasing power parity basis (Eurostat, 2015).

The Living Wage is voluntary and has no legislative basis and is therefore not a statutory entitlement. It is different to the National Minimum Wage which is a statutory entitlement and has a legislative basis. <\/p>  <p>  The Low Pay Commission was established last year and its primary function is to, on an annual basis, examine and make recommendations on the national minimum wage, with a view to securing that the national minimum wage, where adjusted, is adjusted incrementally over time having had regard to changes in earnings, productivity, overall competitiveness and the likely impact any adjustment will have on employment and unemployment levels.

I chair this Group, and I will continue to do so as part of my Department&rsquo;s ongoing response as developments unfold at EU level and bilaterally with the UK.<\/p><p>Also on that day, I met with representative business organisations, including IBEC, ISME, the SFA, and the Irish Exporters Association, to provide an update on immediate responses to reassure business in the aftermath of the result. <\/p><p>Since then, I have had meetings with a range of other representative organisations, including American Chamber of Commerce Ireland (AmCham), Dublin Chamber of Commerce, and the Irish Farmers Association.<\/p><p>I have also written to my newly-appointed counterparts in the new UK Government &ndash; Liam Fox, the Secretary of State for International Trade, and Greg Clark, the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy &ndash; to confirm my intention to work together with them as the upcoming negotiations develop, and to request an early opportunity to discuss our priorities.<\/p><p>In addition, the enterprise agencies under my remit will continue to deliver on their commitment to supporting business and jobs in this period of heightened uncertainty.<\/p><p>In this regard, on the day after the referendum result, the CEO of IDA Ireland, wrote to the 1,200 Foreign Direct Investment companies who have operations in this country.  That contact was designed to reassure those companies regarding Ireland&rsquo;s ongoing commitment to the EU and on our commitment to FDI.

Each of the Regional Implementation Committees has met at least once, with the first meeting of the Dublin APJ Committee due to take place in September.<\/p><p>The Regional Action Plan process is underpinned by robust reporting arrangements, with twice yearly updates to be published in each region, setting out the progress on each of the actions due for delivery.  The first Progress Reports on the implementation of the Plans, covering the period to end-June 2016 are currently being prepared and will be completed and published in Q3 2016.<\/p><p>The Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) were established in April 2014 as the &ldquo;First Stop Shop&rdquo; support service for micro and small businesses in each Local Authority area. Their aim is to promote entrepreneurship, foster business start-ups and develop existing micro and small businesses to drive job creation and to provide accessible high quality supports for their clients&rsquo; business ideas. <\/p><p>Under the terms of the Service Level Agreement between Enterprise Ireland and each Local Authority, the LEOs are required to produce annual Local Enterprise Development Plans (LEDPs) setting out clearly what the LEO intends to deliver over the following 12 months, including jobs directly related with each investment. The Plans identify and prioritise the key enterprise sectors and entrepreneurial capacity challenges that need to be targeted in each LEO&rsquo;s functional area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016072000071#WRD01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1247"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of An Taoiseach","counter":106,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016072000071#WRD02100"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Titles","counter":105,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016072000071#WRD02000"},{"type":"question","counter":106,"qnumday":75,"qnumall":"[23355\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016072000071#WRD02100","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"when or if his Department will utilise section 6(1) of the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act 1939 to confirm a new title for his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1245"},{"type":"speech","counter":107,"content":"<p>I have no plans to change the name of my Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016072000071#WRD02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1245"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Justice and Equality","counter":109,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016072000071#WRD02400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Visa Waiver Programme","counter":108,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016072000071#WRD02300"},{"type":"question","counter":109,"qnumday":76,"qnumall":"[23177\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016072000071#WRD02400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her plans to issue a visa waiver programme for diplomatic passport holders from Georgia; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1228","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":110,"content":"<p>The requirements for which countries are visa required to come to Ireland are kept under regular review in consultation with my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.  <\/p>  <p>  The Government is pursuing a strategy of greater co-ordination and co-operation on visa issues with the United Kingdom in the context of the Common Travel Area (CTA).

Under this section it shall be an offence, where, in the context of prostitution, a person purchases a sexual service from another person.  The person offering sexual services is not liable to any offence under this section.  <\/p>  <p>  On foot of Government amendments introduced during Committee stage in the Seanad, persons who offer sexual services were removed from the existing solicitation and loitering-related offences under the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993.  This was in recognition of the exploitation associated with prostitution and the need to decriminalise the women and men involved in offering sexual services.  People who solicit the sexual services of others &ndash; that is the buyers and pimps &ndash; remain subject to prosecution for the solicitation and loitering offences under the 1993 Act.<\/p>  <p>  This did, however, give rise to concerns that the Garda&iacute; would be left with no means of combating any public nuisance if sexual services were to be offered, for example, in a residential area.  There was also concern that the provision could be exploited by criminal gangs or others.    <\/p>  <p>  In order to address these concerns, an amendment was made to section 8 of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994.  That section addresses a number of behaviours, for instance intoxication in a public place, for which a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can issue a direction to a person so behaving to leave the area.  Failing to comply with that direction can give rise to an offence.  Loitering for the purpose of offering sexual services has now been added to the behaviours covered by section 8.  <\/p>  <p>  The effect of the proposed amendments will be that on-street prostitution will not be an offence, but the Garda&iacute; will still have the power to move persons offering sexual services on from a public place, when necessary. <\/p>  <p>  It is currently an offence under section 11 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 to keep or manage a brothel.  While I understand that this provision can prevent persons offering sexual services from working together with others, I am particularly concerned that any decriminalisation of brothel-keeping would create a legal loophole ripe for exploitation by the organised crime gangs involved in the trafficking and exploitation of women in prostitution.  Women would come under pressure to claim they were working independently when that is not the case and the Garda&iacute; would be limited in the actions they could take to close brothels and disrupt the activities of criminal gangs.  For this reason I have no plans to amend provisions relating to brothel keeping at this time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016072000072#WRE02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Titles","counter":162,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016072000072#WRE02050"},{"type":"question","counter":163,"qnumday":96,"qnumall":"[23352\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016072000072#WRE02100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"when or if her Department will utilise section 6(1) of the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act 1939 to confirm a new title for her Department; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":164,"content":"<p>The name of my Department remained unchanged on the formation of the new Government on 6 May 2016.

This survey series, currently being conducted by Red C on behalf of my Department, is the most comprehensive survey of SME credit demand in Ireland, covering 1,500 respondents and involving over 6,000 direct telephone calls to SMEs.  SMEs of all sizes and trading in all sectors, excluding property development and speculative activities, are included. \u00a0The survey covers demand for credit from both bank and non-bank sources.<\/p>  <p>  I would draw the Deputy's attention to the most recently published Department of Finance SME Credit Demand Survey covering\u00a0October 2015 to March 2016, which can be found at www.finance.gov.ie.  The results of this survey shows that, when pending applications are excluded, 89% of credit applications to banks were approved or partially approved (up 4% from the previous survey).  Working capital requirements were provided as the main reason for applying for bank finance with 39% of respondents stating that they required finance for working capital (down 9%). \u00a0When asked about sources of finance for working capital, internal funds\/retained earnings were the main finance source of working capital with 67% of working capital coming from this source (up 4%).\u00a0 The survey also showed continued positive trends in terms of trading performance, profitability and employment.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has been involved in a range of initiatives to encourage access to credit for small and medium sized businesses. \u00a0The SME State Bodies Group provides a forum for the development and implementation of policy measures to enhance SMEs' access to a stable and appropriate supply of finance.<\/p>  <p>  Some of the main policies introduced to encourage access to credit for small and medium businesses include:<\/p>  <p>  - The Supporting SMEs Online Tool, a cross-government initiative, was launched in May 2014.  On answering 8 simple questions, the small business will receive a list of available Government supports.\u00a0 The Supporting SMEs Online Tool is available at www.supportingsmes.ie.<\/p>  <p>  - The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland has been established as a means of ensuring that SMEs are provided with sufficient finance for growth. \u00a0The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) is an initiative designed to increase the availability of funding to SMEs at a lower cost and on more flexible terms than have recently been available on the Irish Market. \u00a0The SBCI does not lend directly to SMEs.  It uses a network of lending partners known as 'on lenders' to make its funds available to SMEs.  More information on the SBCI can be found on www.sbci.gov.ie.<\/p>  <p>  - The Credit Guarantee Scheme encourages additional lending to small businesses by offering a partial Government guarantee to banks against losses on qualifying loans to eligible SMEs.<\/p>  <p>  - The Microenterprise Loan Fund, administered by Microfinance Ireland, provides support in the form of loans for up to &euro;25,000, available to start-up, newly established, or growing micro enterprises employing less than 10 people, with viable business propositions.\u00a0 Microfinance Ireland works in partnership with the Local Enterprise Offices nationally to administer this fund (www.microfinanceireland.ie).<\/p>  <p>  - The Credit Review Office helps SME or farm borrowers who have had an application for credit of up to &euro;3 million declined or reduced by the main banks, and who feel that they have a viable business proposition. \u00a0They also examine cases where borrowers feel that the terms and conditions of their existing loan, or a new loan offer, are unfairly onerous or have been unreasonably changed to their detriment.\u00a0 This is a strictly confidential process between the business, the Credit Review Office and the bank. \u00a0The Credit Reviewer and his team have overturned more than 50% of the refusals that have been appealed to the Office.\u00a0 Further details are available at www.creditreview.ie.<\/p>  <p>  - The Government remains committed to the SME sector, as reflected in the recently published Programme for a Partnership Government, and sees it as a key engine of ongoing economic growth.\u00a0 In this context, the Action Plan for Jobs 2016 includes a dedicated chapter and associated integrated set of actions to support the financing for growth in the SME sector.\u00a0\u00a0My Department and the Credit Review Office, working with the other relevant Departments and Agencies, will continue to monitor the availability of both bank and non-bank credit on both a macro and sectoral basis in order to ensure that sufficient access to finance is available to facilitate participants in the SME sector to reach their full potential in terms of growth and employment generation.\u00a0 This work will be particularly\u00a0important in light of the outcome of the UK's referendum on\u00a0membership of the EU.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016072000072#WRE02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Customs and Excise Controls","counter":171,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016072000072#WRE02650"},{"type":"question","counter":172,"qnumday":99,"qnumall":"[22954\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016072000072#WRE02700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the reason for the withdrawal of the drugs sniffer dog from Ireland West Airport, Knock; the reason no dog is available for the entire Border, midlands and west region; when a replacement dog will be provided for the airport and a separate dog for the Border, midlands and west region; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1316","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":173,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that their Customs Service currently deploys seventeen detector dog teams, nine of which have drug detection capabilities.

In April 2015 the Central Bank wrote to each bank setting out supervisory requirements with regard to mortgage arrears resolution that conform to their published Internal Guidelines on Sustainable Mortgage Arrears Solutions.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In relation to homeowners in financial difficulties, the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA), a statutory code under Section 117 of the Central Bank Act 1989,\u00a0is\u00a0designed to provide appropriate and effective consumer protection measures and to ensure that borrowers are treated in a fair and transparent manner.  The CCMA applies to all regulated mortgage lenders operating in the State when dealing with borrowers facing or in mortgage arrears on their primary residence, including any mortgage lending activities outsourced by these lenders.  Lenders are required to comply with all aspects of the CCMA and non-compliance with the CCMA is enforceable against regulated entities by the Central Bank.<\/p>  <p>  In June 2015, the Central Bank published the outcome of a themed inspection of lenders' compliance with the CCMA.  As part of this theme seven lenders were inspected under 4 keys area.  The Themed review found that while all of the lenders had implemented frameworks as required by the CCMA, weaknesses of varying degrees were identified across a number of lenders as well as a number of good practices.  Formal supervisory requirements, with specific timelines for remediation, have been imposed on those lenders where risks to borrowers were identified and all lenders that were subject to the CCMA themed inspection have provided responses to the issues raised with them.  The Central Bank of Ireland continues to engage with these lenders as part of\u00a0their on-going supervisory engagement to ensure compliance with the CCMA. <\/p>  <p>  The CCMA\u00a0requires all regulated lenders\u00a0to wait at least eight months from the date the arrears arose, before legal action can commence against a co-operating borrower.  Separately, regardless of how long it takes the lender to assess a case, and provided that the borrower is co-operating, the lender must give three months' notice to the borrower before they can commence legal proceedings where the lender does not offer an alternative repayment arrangement or the borrower does not accept an alternative repayment arrangement offered by the lender.  This gives co-operating borrowers time to consider other options such as a Personal Insolvency Arrangement. <\/p>  <p>  In addition my Department continues to monitor and publishes Mortgage Restructures data on a monthly basis that covers mortgage accounts for the six main lenders.  The figures in the latest publication for\u00a0May 2016 (published on 14\u00a0July) show that Primary Dwelling Home (PDH) mortgage accounts in arrears continue to decline and now stand at 65,458 representing an improvement of 19% compared to May 2015. <\/p>  <p>  In conclusion, I must reiterate that active engagement by indebted borrowers\u00a0with their lender\u00a0is key to achieving a\u00a0sustainable resolution, and I would urge borrowers in arrears, who have not already done so, to take that first step by contacting their lender directly or to contact the Dedicated Mortgage Advisory Service at MABS for an\u00a0independent assessment of their situation and\u00a0advice on available resolution options.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016072000073#WRF00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Economic Competitiveness","counter":185,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016072000073#WRF00650"},{"type":"question","counter":186,"qnumday":103,"qnumall":"[23086\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016072000073#WRF00700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the extent to which the economy continues to remain competitive when compared to other competing jurisdictions within the European Union and without; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":187,"content":"<p>Significant progress has been made in improving Ireland's competitiveness in recent years.  The latest figures from Eurostat estimated\u00a0that nominal\u00a0unit labour costs (a widely used measure of competitiveness internationally) in Ireland declined\u00a0by 4.2 per cent annually\u00a0in 2015, the largest decline across all EU Member States for which data\u00a0are available.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The decline in unit labour costs in 2015 is a continuation of the trend of substantial improvement in Ireland's economy-wide cost competitiveness since 2008 (the peak year for unit labour costs in Ireland).  It is estimated\u00a0that\u00a0nominal\u00a0unit labour costs in Ireland\u00a0fell by\u00a020 per cent between 2008 and 2015.  This compares\u00a0with increases of 9 per cent in the UK, in the euro area and in the European Union as a whole, over the same period.<\/p>  <p>  Following the crisis, Ireland's relative competitiveness as measured by the real harmonised competitiveness index has continued to improve as a result of reductions in relative prices together with favourable exchange rate movements.  In addition, relatively low consumer price inflation\u00a0in recent years\u00a0has contributed to the improvement in Ireland's competitiveness as\u00a0Irish price levels have fallen considerably relative to those of our euro area peers.  For instance, annual HICP inflation in Ireland has been below or equal that of the euro area every year since 2008. <\/p>  <p>  Nevertheless, as a small regional economy in a single currency zone, Ireland is vulnerable to losses of competitiveness.  The UK's vote to leave the European Union has caused some volatility in the currency market.  Challenges for Irish exporters would arise should there be a prolonged period during which the sterling rate was low against the euro. <\/p>  <p>  The gains in Irish competitiveness achieved since 2008 have been hard-won through productivity improvements and\u00a0wage and price moderation.  It is important that this competitiveness is\u00a0preserved and continues to support growth and the improvement in real living standards.  In this regard we must be cognisant that favourable exchange rate movements can reverse, as can be seen for example in the recent strengthening of the euro against sterling. Similarly, gains from the fall in oil prices\u00a0may unwind in the future.  This highlights the importance of maintaining competitiveness-oriented policies to help address emerging uncertainties.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016072000073#WRF00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Bank Charges","counter":188,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016072000073#WRF00850"},{"type":"question","counter":189,"qnumday":104,"qnumall":"[23087\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016072000073#WRF00900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the extent to which he and his Department continue to monitor the levels of bank charges being imposed by various banks; the basis for such charges, nationally and internationally; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":190,"content":"<p>As I have said in my answer to the Deputy's Parliamentary Question No. 113 [7735\/16] on 20 April 2016, all credit institutions in Ireland are independent commercial entities.

","asker":"1361","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":206,"content":"<p>The Central Statistics Office (CSO) last week published national income and expenditure results for 2015.  These figures indicate that real GDP grew by some 26 per cent last year.  This is significantly stronger than the previous estimate of 7.8 per cent.<\/p>  <p>  This substantial upward revision is largely related to the activities of a small number of large multinational firms and reflects a number of exceptional factors which have limited impact on actual activity in the Irish economy. <\/p>  <p>  The main channels through which these factors affect Irish GDP figures include:<\/p>  <p>  - The effect of 'contract manufacturing' where Irish headquartered multinationals contract the production of goods to third party companies abroad but these products are recorded in Ireland's trade balance;<\/p>  <p>  - The relocation of intellectual property-related assets or patents to Ireland.  Ceteris paribus, this will reduce the level of royalty imports and as result increase Irish GDP;<\/p>  <p>  - An increase in new aircraft imports to Ireland for international leasing activities generating substantial fee income without significant employment effects;<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that these\u00a0factors do not reflect activity levels we are seeing on the ground.  Although these revisions have significantly boosted investment and net export growth, they do not have a direct bearing on employment and wealth creation for Irish citizens. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to stress that whilst these headline GDP figures have clearly been distorted and are exaggerated in an Irish context, more concrete indicators of the underlying levels of economic activity point to a continuation of a now firmly-rooted recovery.  Specifically, indicators such as consumer spending, tax trends and labour market developments all confirm that Ireland's economic fundamentals remain strong.<\/p>  <p>  It is also important to stress that the figures published by the CSO are compiled in accordance with best international practice and statistical standards.  They measure what they are supposed to measure.  However, in a small, open and very globalised economy such as Ireland, it is clear that relevance of these figures as a metric by which underlying economic trends and changes in living standards can be assessed is considerably less than elsewhere.<\/p>  <p>  With this in mind, the Central Statistics Office is to put together a group of experts to provide guidance on how a more relevant indicator could be produced and published alongside these figures in the future.  My Department will\u00a0be\u00a0represented\u00a0on this group.<\/p>  <p>  The national income and expenditure results are the definitive measure of Irish national output and reflect all available information at the time at which they are published.  However, GDP in all countries, but especially in Ireland, is always subject to revision.<\/p>  <p>  Irish GDP is volatile by comparative standards due to the small open nature of the Irish economy.  The best way to mitigate risks associated with this volatility is through prudent management of the public finances and competiveness-oriented policies.  That is what the Government will continue to do.<\/p>  <p>  In light of the exceptional nature of these growth figures I also wish to make clear that the Government will not formulate policy on the basis of these inflated figures.  Rather, policy will continue to be designed on the basis of more normal growth rates in the region of 3&frac12; to 4 per cent per annum over the coming years. <\/p>  <p>  So, in other words, these upward revisions to GDP for largely technical reasons are not being used to formulate policy.  Similarly, in the event of a downward revision for purely technical reasons, there would be no reason to react from a policy perspective.<\/p>  <p>  In summary, the figures for last year greatly overstate the \"true\" level of economic activity here.  The figures measure what they are supposed to measure, but for a small, open and globalised economy, GDP must be interpreted with caution.  However, it is clear that the economy is growing solidly and the Government will form policy on the basis of \"normal\" growth rates.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016072000073#WRF02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"VAT Rate Reductions","counter":207,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016072000073#WRF02150"},{"type":"question","counter":208,"qnumday":111,"qnumall":"[23264\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016072000073#WRF02200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if his Department or a body under its aegis has undertaken any analysis of the return on investment to the Exchequer of the introduction of the special 9% VAT rate; if so, the analysis undertaken and its findings; and if his Department has estimates for the direct loss in revenues as a result of the reduced VAT rate on these services.

The objective was to boost tourism and create additional jobs.  While the VAT rate was due to revert to 13.5% in 2014, it was decided to retain the 9% rate on tourism activity in Budget 2014 because the initiative had proved to be a major success, helping create over 15,000 new jobs at that time, as well as protecting existing jobs.  This decision was informed by statistics on VAT and tourism by the Revenue Commissioners and the Central Statistics Office, as well as a Report undertaken by my Department entitled \"Measuring the impact of the Jobs Initiative: Was the VAT reduction passed on and were jobs created?\", published by the Department of Finance in November 2012 with the Department's Medium-Term Fiscal Statement.<\/p>  <p>  In my last Budget I did not make any changes to the rate, stating that while the case for retaining the measure for the hotel sector in Dublin is diminishing each year, with room rates rising particularly during major events, the case for retention of the measure for the rest of the country remains.

This is contributing to what we know is already a considerable strain on some students and their families to participate in higher education with knock-on effects on completion rates.  The reality is that dealing comprehensively with this issue will only take place as part of a more general programme to address the major housing and homelessness issue.<\/p><p>  Accordingly, my colleague Mr. Simon Coveney T.D., Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, yesterday (19 July 2016) published &quot;Rebuilding Ireland &ndash; an Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness&quot;, following Government approval of this comprehensive and ambitious Plan.  The full plan can be accessed at: <i><\/i>.<\/p><p>  This Plan provides a multi-stranded, action-oriented approach to achieving many of the Government's key housing objectives, as set down in the Programme for a Partnership Government, to significantly increase the supply of social housing, to double the output of overall housing from the current levels to at least 25,000 per annum by 2020, to service all tenure types, and to tackle homelessness in a comprehensive manner.<\/p><p>  This whole-of-Government Plan has been developed in close collaboration with other key Government Departments and Agencies, under the oversight of a dedicated Cabinet Committee chaired by An Taoiseach.  The Plan was also informed by the Report of the Special Oireachtas Committee on Housing and Homelessness (published on 17 June 2016), as well as through extensive consultation with stakeholders.  <\/p><p>  My Department has worked closely with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government in the development of this Action Plan, with a specific focus on Student Accommodation, and the following measures detailed in the Plan are of direct relevance to this issue:  <\/p><p>1. The Department of Education and Skills in conjunction with a number of other key stakeholders will prepare and publish a national student accommodation strategy, which will set out a broad framework for delivery of an enhanced level of accommodation and which will inform local authority housing strategies and the land management process in general, in order to provide suitably located and affordable sites.  This will be prepared with a view to developing a national policy on specific needs and mechanisms for the development of appropriate on-campus and off-campus student accommodation.<\/p><p>2. My Department will work with stakeholders to prioritise and progress viable projects to provide additional student accommodation in key urban areas.  This will be done with a view to bringing onstream proposals capable of delivering an additional 7,000 student accommodation places by end 2019, on or off campus, in addition to projects already committed to.<\/p><p>3. Dedicated delivery structures, such as Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs), will be established in the Higher Education Institutions (HEI) sector to access Housing Finance Agency (HFA) funding and complete any required policy, regulatory or legislative changes necessary.  This will be done with a view to providing additional funding mechanisms for the HEI sector, in conjunction with the HFA.<\/p><p>4. My Department will help to fund a Student Housing Officer to work with the Union of Students in Ireland, local authorities, AHBs and housing providers to identify and expand short-term capacity enhancing measures in the student accommodation sector.  This will be done with a view to assisting students in finding appropriate accommodation.<\/p><p>5. Funding mechanisms will be established for Institutes of Technology to support the development of their student accommodation capacity.  This is to facilitate the Institute of Technology sector in developing their potential for on-campus student accommodation through addressing current borrowing capacity and funding constraints.<\/p><p>6. The Department of Housing Planning and Local Government in conjunction with the Department of Education and Skills will carry out an assessment of scope for provision of additional student accommodation on local authority or other publicly-owned lands with a view to maximising the potential for student accommodation provision on suitable sites as part of mixed developments.<\/p><p>7. The Department of Housing Planning and Local Government will enable student accommodation projects for 100 units or more to go straight to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, as well as maximise the opportunities for joint venture projects on local authority sites to proceed through the Part 8 process and prepare guidance on planning policies around student accommodation developments.  This will be done to enhance certainty and reduce delivery timescales and costs associated with bringing student accommodation proposals forward.<\/p><p>The Actions in the Plan in relation to Student Accommodation build on the report, Student Accommodation: Demand &amp;amp; Supply, which was published last year by the Minister for Education and Skills and which sets out clearly that the demand for student accommodation outstrips supply in certain areas, and will continue to do so in the coming years.<\/p><p>The full report can be accessed at <i><\/i>.<\/p><p>  The previous Minister for Education and Skills introduced two immediate actions following the publication of this report. <\/p><p>  Firstly, funding was provided by the HEA to the Union of Students (USI) in Ireland to progress short-term solutions for students in need of accommodation.  This funding will allow USI to develop their homes.<i>usi.ie<\/i>website, to communicate more effectively to student and homeowners, and to carry out research into this important issue.<\/p><p>  Secondly, the establishment of an inter-departmental steering group to examine the recommendations contained in the HEA Report and to provide a co-ordinating mechanism to ensure that the higher education institutions have access to information on new potential funding and delivery models.  <\/p><p>  In addition to this, I should point out that a number of our Higher Education Institutions have Student Accommodation projects ongoing, or in the pipeline, with a number of additional on-campus Student Accommodation bed-spaces to come online from September 2016.  Maynooth University has 296 new on-campus bed spaces, and UCD has 350 new on-campus bed spaces, which are due to come onstream in Autumn 2016.  Six other Higher Education Institutions are currently engaged in, or going through the planning phases for student accommodation projects, namely, National University of Ireland Galway, Trinity College Dublin, University of Limerick, Dublin City University, University College Cork and Dublin Institute of Technology.<\/p><p>  However, an even greater level of provision of student accommodation is required and accordingly this Action Plan commits to the development of a National Student Accommodation Strategy in 2017 by the Department of Education and Skills in conjunction with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and other stakeholders including the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Finance.  This will set out a broad framework for delivery of an enhanced level of accommodation and will inform local authority housing strategies and the land management process in general in order to provide suitably located and affordable sites.<\/p><p>  I very much welcome the commitments contained in the plan and I look forward to working with colleagues on a cross-Departmental basis to ensure that the commitments contained in the Plan are implemented as soon as practicable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016072000074#WRG01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Higher Education Institutions Staff","counter":244,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016072000074#WRG01350"},{"type":"question","counter":245,"qnumday":123,"qnumall":"[22922\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016072000074#WRG01400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he plans to take decisive action to ensure that postgraduate students who are hired as academic staff are afforded the necessary working conditions, incorporating pay and duration of contract, to deliver high quality education to students; if not, if he will put plans in place; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1311","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":246,"content":"<p>Those undertaking postgraduate study at Masters and PhD levels are considered as students, not employees.

Furthermore, it means that, before an employer opts to recruit a further person as an SNA(s), they must ensure that all existing part-time SNAs in their employment, in order of seniority, have been offered a full-time position in the school or, in the case of ETBs, a full-time position in a school within the ETB scheme. <\/p><p>  The only exception that can be made to this rule is where a school\/ETB has a determination in writing from the NCSE\/SENO stating that their allocation must be split amongst a specific number of SNAs and\/or stating that the allocation must be implemented in a specific fashion to address the care needs of the pupil(s).  In cases where this exception is being invoked by a school\/ETB then this written determination from the NCSE\/SENO must be provided to the existing part-time SNA(s) affected.  It should also be noted that the position in relation to the allocation and distribution of Infant days, which is a distinct and specific feature of the SNA scheme, remains unaffected. <\/p><p>  If an SNA believes that Circular 0035\/2016 regarding the allocation of extra hours to current SNAs was not adhered to in their school i.e. they were not furnished with information regarding either a written determination from the NCSE\/SENO and\/or the invocation of the Infant Days principle then they should contact the dedicated e-mail address (<i>snasupplementpanel@education.gov.ie<\/i>) and my officials will ensure that the relevant information regarding the matter is provided to them by their employer.<\/p><p>  The Supplementary Assignment Panel arrangements are reviewed by my Department on an annual basis in consultation with the school management bodies and the two unions representing SNA staff (IMPACT and SIPTU).<\/p><p>  Finally, as already outlined, my Department has set up a dedicated e&ndash;mail address with all queries in relation to the SNA Supplementary Assignment Panel and any queries in respect of the operation of the Panel can be directed to this dedicated e&ndash;mail address: <i>snasupplementpanel@education.gov.ie<\/i><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016072000074#WRG01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects Applications","counter":253,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016072000074#WRG01950"},{"type":"question","counter":254,"qnumday":126,"qnumall":"[22975\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016072000074#WRG02000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if a school (details supplied) in County Mayo will soon be issued with a decision in respect of a funding application; if he acknowledges the merits of the proposed project; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1335","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":255,"content":"<p>I can advise that the school referred to by the Deputy submitted an application for significant capital funding.<\/p><p>I am aware that my Department's technical staff visited the school and the outcome of the visit is currently being considered.

NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties.

The operation of the price freeze by the industry will be closely monitored by Government and, in the event of evidence being presented of the agreement being breached, legislative options will be considered to address the issue.

In this regard, it is intended to roll out a comprehensive education and awareness programme on pay by weight so that more householders can make an informed decision around their pricing plan.

The project was delivered by the Walkinstown Association for People with an Intellectual Disability (WALK). <\/p>  <p>  The objective of the DACT programme was to explore a variety of routes towards ensuring that people with disabilities were enabled to avail of progression, education and development opportunities within the world of work. Similar to many other projects with EU funding, a key criterion used when selecting projects for the programme was that appropriate learning should be capable of being independently mainstreamed into the future.  Given governance issues and procurement requirements, it was never intended that the funding for these projects would continue in the long-run or that they would become ongoing service delivery organisations in their own right.<\/p>  <p>  The WALK PEER programme was subsequently successful in obtaining additional funding from the HSE and a private-sector organisation, which allowed the project to continue for another year until July 2016.

Where young people do not find work relatively quickly, additional supports may be offered, both through reserved places on existing employment and training schemes and through youth-specific measures.

In particular, the role of entrepreneurs and the self-employed will be central to this ambition.  They are a diverse group and include farmers, tradesmen, small business owners, professionals, freelancers and consultants, some work part time, others work every waking hour every day. <\/p>  <p>  Core to the provision of a more supportive environment for the self-employed is the commitment in the new programme to introduce an improved PRSI scheme for them. In addition, we will also ensure that the Earned Income Tax Credit available to the self-employed will match that available to employees, over a number of budgets.  This process commenced in Budget 2016 with the introduction of a &euro;550 tax credit. <\/p>  <p>  I want to ensure that appropriate sustainable supports are available to the self-employed in the event of certain contingencies arising.  The self-employed already have access to State pension (contributory), widow&rsquo;s, widower&rsquo;s or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s pension (contributory), guardians payment (contributory), maternity benefit and adoptive benefit on the same basis as employees.  They will also gain access to the new paternity benefit which will be introduced later this year. <\/p>  <p>  However, unlike the position with employees, they are not covered for certain contingencies such as long-term illnesses or disability.  I have already indicated that extending social insurance coverage to the self-employed is a personal priority for me as Minister.  I intend to extend, over a period of time, the range of benefits which the self&ndash;employed can access through social insurance.  I want to start by providing access to benefits for long-term illness\/incapacity and to treatment benefits.  So, a self-employed person injured or incapacitated during the course of their work or on the way to or from it, will have a stronger safety net to protect them. <\/p>  <p>  The former Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare published a report in 2013 which examined the options for extension of cover to the self-employed.  The Group recommended that the rate of contribution for Class S self-employed should be increased and paid on a compulsory basis in order to pay for cover for long-term illnesses.<\/p>  <p>  The Group concluded that &ldquo;extension on a voluntary basis, through either an &ldquo;opt in&rdquo; or &ldquo;opt out&rdquo; basis, could lead to the selection of bad risks and would undermine the social solidarity and contributory principles that underline the social insurance system.&rdquo;<\/p>  <p>  My Department is currently examining the costs and financing an extension of benefits as well as the phasing in of access to the benefits.  This examination includes a survey of a random sample of the self-employed population who rely on Class S social insurance benefits. <\/p>  <p>   The survey is being carried out by my Department to get their views on priorities for increasing access to social insurance entitlements and the level of contribution the self-employed would be willing to make for more benefits.  <\/p>  <p>  The result from this survey will help inform and shape the development of future social insurance policy for the self-employed.  Therefore, I encourage any self-employed individuals invited to participate to make every effort to do so. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016072000081#WRO03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Exceptional Needs Payment Eligibility","counter":590,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016072000081#WRO03500"},{"type":"question","counter":591,"qnumday":240,"qnumall":"[23132\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016072000081#WRO03600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"if his Department will consider providing loans to social protection recipients for exceptional needswhere repayments can be deducted from their weekly payments; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1318","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":592,"content":"<p>Under the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme, my Department may make a single exceptional needs payment (ENP) to help meet essential, once-off and unforeseen expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income.

Over 1,200 loans have been drawn down under the scheme to date, with an overall value of over &euro;720,000.  The average individual loan value drawn down is &euro;500.  The focus of the pilot scheme was social welfare recipients who availed of the loans from their Credit Union and were facilitated, with their consent, in the repayment of such loans through the Household Budgeting facility, operated by An Post.

In doing so it is hoped to promote competitiveness and productivity. <\/p><p>Reflecting the impact of government policy, and the overall improvement in the labour market, youth unemployment has fallen substantially to just over 15% in June 2016.  This compares with a figure of almost 21% just one year ago, and with a peak level of over 31% in mid-2012.<\/p><p>The key objective of Ireland&rsquo;s policy response to the EU Recommendation on a Youth Guarantee is to help newly unemployed young people find and secure sustainable jobs.  In this regard there is monthly engagement by case officers with young people to assist them to prepare, review and, if appropriate, revise personal progression plans.  Where young people do not find work relatively quickly, additional supports may be offered, both through reserved places on existing employment and training schemes and through youth-specific measures.  Most such offers (over 70%) are in existing further education or training programmes.  Others are in existing community-based employment programmes such as CE, Gateway and T&uacute;s, or through the JobsPlus employment subsidy for private employment.<\/p><p>Places on most of these programmes are demand led. While it was anticipated that take-up on the relevant programmes in 2014 might be as high as 28,000, actual take-up was 23,000.  As the economy has improved, inflows into these programmes have decreased further, reflecting the drop in youth unemployment.  Overall, over 19,100 opportunities were taken up on the relevant programmes in 2015 (see details in Table 1 attached to this reply). <\/p><p>Pathways to Work 2016-2020 continues to prioritise these measures for the young unemployed and further commits to a number of additional measures.  These include increasing the share of workplace-based interventions for youth unemployed; ensuring that monthly engagement, at a minimum, is consistently applied and maintained; restructuring the First Steps programme; and implementing the Defence Forces Skills for Life programme.<\/p><p><b>Table 1.

This meeting will provide another valuable opportunity to meet with our UK colleagues from the British Government and the devolved institutions in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales, as well as representatives of the Crown Dependencies, and to collectively consider the key challenges arising from the UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU and how we best work together in that new context.<\/p>  <p>  As Ireland will continue as a fully committed member of the European Union, we will also work with our EU partners to ensure the greatest degree of understanding of Ireland&rsquo;s unique position as we, as part of the Union of 27 Member States, negotiate the terms of the UK&rsquo;s exit.  I have had many conversations in recent weeks with various EU colleagues where I sensitised them to the particular concerns of Ireland as the only Member State that shares a land border with the UK.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the steps taken to identify the implications of a British exit from the EU, contingency planning was carried out across Government in advance of the referendum, and a summary of the contingency framework was published on 24 June.  This contingency planning is a dynamic and ongoing process which takes into account the most recent developments to allow for more targeted and effective engagement, both in relation to dealing with issues as they evolve and in responding proactively to opportunities that arise.  <\/p>  <p>  Some restructuring is also underway to develop capacity in key areas &ndash; for example, in the Department of the Taoiseach and in my own Department, including in key Embassies abroad, as well as in other relevant Departments.  In addition, the Taoiseach has announced that he will chair a new Cabinet Committee to oversee matters relating to the UK departure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016072000083#WRQ01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Diplomatic Representation","counter":676,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016072000083#WRQ01550"},{"type":"question","counter":677,"qnumday":268,"qnumall":"[23178\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016072000083#WRQ01600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if, as part of his review of the embassy service, he will consider opening an embassy in Georgia; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1228","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":678,"content":"<p>At present, Ireland&rsquo;s diplomatic network includes 61 Embassies, 7 multilateral missions, 11 Consulates General and one Representative office.

Consequently, the figures included in the pre-Budget\u00a0forecast\u00a0in the SES use the aggregate overall increase\u00a0of c. &euro;0.4 billion in respect of demographic related costs\u00a0for 2019, adjusted for a lower amount being available for reallocation within expenditure from Live Register savings in subsequent years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016072000084#WRR00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Titles","counter":706,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016072000084#WRR00750"},{"type":"question","counter":707,"qnumday":281,"qnumall":"[23353\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016072000084#WRR00800","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if or when his Department will utilise section 6(1) of the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act 1939 to confirm a new title for his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":708,"content":"<p>In response to the Deputy's question my department will not utilise Section 6(1) of the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act 1939 as the title of my Department has not changed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016072000084#WRR00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","counter":710,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016072000084#WRR01000"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Waterways Ireland Staff","counter":709,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016072000084#WRR00950"},{"type":"question","counter":710,"qnumday":282,"qnumall":"[23011\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016072000084#WRR01000","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the number of staff employed by Waterways Ireland in 2008; the number of staff currently employed, specifying the number of office-based staff and operational staff; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1349","askee":"1249"},{"type":"question","counter":711,"qnumday":283,"qnumall":"[23012\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016072000084#WRR01100","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if she considers that the numbers employed by Waterways Ireland are still representative of the 85:15 split in funding; and the measures in place to provide permanent employment in each of the areas where the employment levels have fallen since 2008.","asker":"1349","askee":"1249"},{"type":"question","counter":712,"qnumday":284,"qnumall":"[23013\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016072000084#WRR01200","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if moves towards part-time or casual employment is in the best interests of Waterways Ireland employees and staff.","asker":"1349","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":713,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 282 to 284, inclusive, together.<\/p>  <p>  As of 31 December 2008 Waterways Ireland employed 335 staff, comprised of 118 Professional, Technical and Administration staff (who are primarily office based although Waterways Ireland does not classify staff by such a category) and 217 Operational (Industrial) staff, including 9 fixed term operational (industrial) staff and 15 agency Professional, Technical and Administration staff.<\/p>  <p>  Waterways Ireland currently employs a total of 336 staff, comprised of 130 Professional, Technical and Administration staff (primarily office based), and 206 Operational (Industrial) staff,  including 38 fixed term operational (industrial) contract staff and 9 Professional, Technical and Administration staff.<\/p>  <p>  The 85:15 ratio referred to by the Deputy does not relate to the staff within the organisation.

These organisations vary in scale and complexity, ranging from large acute hospitals to local community based organisations providing social care services.  Funding provided to agencies for the provision of services under Section 38 of the Health Act 2004 relates to 23 non-acute agencies and 16 voluntary acute hospitals currently within the HSE Employment Control Framework. <\/p><p>Section 38 agencies have played a very important role in the development of our health and social care services.  Some agencies delivering services under Section 38 arrangements are amongst the very best we have in terms of the quality of care provided and the systems of governance employed.  However, there is a requirement for all such agencies to continually review their governance processes in order to ensure these are sufficiently robust.  <\/p><p>The HSE has a Governance Framework in place which incorporates national standardised documentation, and guidance documents, that enables the HSE to contractually underpin the grant-funding provided to all voluntary and non-statutory Service Providers.  This Framework seeks to ensure the standard and consistent application of good governance principles, which are robust and effective, to ensure that both the HSE and the Providers meet their respective obligations.  It is reviewed and updated as required.<\/p><p>The HSE established a Compliance Unit in late 2014 to strengthen the system of oversight for Section 38 and 39 Providers.  A key element of this oversight are the Service Arrangements Part 1 &amp;amp; Part 2, which underpin the HSEs relationship with the Service Providers and in this context, a comprehensive review of the SA documentation (Parts 1 and 2) was conducted in 2014\/2015 to further strengthen the governance with Providers.  This review involved input from all relevant internal stakeholders and also an extensive engagement took place with representative bodies from the voluntary sector.  This has resulted in a strengthening of oversight arrangements for these agencies.  <\/p><p>Service Arrangements with agencies under Section 38 and 39 of the Health Act involves the purchase of health and social services from agencies in accordance with strict criteria set out in governance documents and outlined in the National Financial Regulation, <i>NFR- 31 Grants to Outside Agencies <\/i>and detailed in a comprehensive operational manual.<\/p><p>I have no plans to amend the Health Act to change the current arrangements.  The HSE will review all Section 38 Providers during the period 2016-2018.  These reviews involve an examination of key governance processes and documents, including obtaining confirmation that there are internal financial controls and that formal financial procedures are in place in these organisations.

It is not about closing Emergency Departments or diminishing services.  There are currently no plans to close or remove trauma services from any hospital.  To put this in context, Emergency Departments provide 24\/7 access for emergency and urgent presentations across the spectrum of medical and  surgical conditions and major trauma patients represent a very small percentage of total Emergency Department activity.<\/p>  <p>  A trauma patient needs access to the best service that has the right resources to match their often multiple and critical needs in the shortest time possible.  The aim of developing national policy on trauma networks is to ensure that trauma patients are brought to the right place at the right time for the right care so they can make the best recovery possible.  It is about building on the strengths of pre-hospital care, all of our acute hospitals and post-acute services to provide an optimal configuration of trauma services.  The implementation of Hospital Groups provides an opportunity for hospitals to work together to enhance trauma services for patients.  Each Hospital Group will develop a Strategic Plan to describe how they will provide more efficient and effective patient services and reorganise their services  across the Group to provide optimal care to the populations they serve and future arrangements for trauma management will be informed by  trauma policy . <\/p>  <p>  The need for a national trauma system has been recognised for many years.  In June 2015 the National Clinical Programme for Trauma and Orthopaedic Surgery published the Model of Care for trauma and orthopaedic surgery and strongly recommended that a national approach to trauma services should be taken.  The RCSI (the professional body representing all surgeons and emergency medicine specialists) also called for its establishment at their annual scientific meeting last year.  <\/p>  <p>  Last year, the then Minister for Health appointed a National Steering Group to develop policy on a major trauma system for Ireland.  This is a joint initiative from the Department of Health and the HSE, developed in recognition that we do not have a coordinated trauma network structure in Ireland.  <\/p>  <p>  The Steering Group has been working with the Department of Health, the HSE and all relevant HSE National Clinical Leads, including Surgery, Pre-Hospital Emergency Care, Critical Care, Orthopaedics and Trauma on the development of the policy.  The group has not yet reported, I have  not seen any output from this group and the Group's recommendations are not expected until later this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016072000085#WRS02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Services for People with Disabilities","counter":776,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016072000085#WRS02650"},{"type":"question","counter":777,"qnumday":306,"qnumall":"[22998\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016072000085#WRS02700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to increase the number of speech therapists and occupational therapists for children with disabilities; his plans, if any, to co-ordinate with the Department of Education and Skills to facilitate the delivery of these required services while the children are in school; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":778,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives, provide greater independence in accessing the services they choose and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.

The Act  obliges the HSE to assess whether a person is unable, without undue hardship, to arrange general practitioner services for himself or herself and his or her family, having regard to his or her overall financial position and reasonable expenditure and every application must be assessed on that basis.  Under the legislation, having a particular illness, in itself, does not establish eligibility for a medical card and therefore, the medical conditions of applicants for this scheme are not monitored on that basis.  Where the applicant's income is within the income guidelines, a medical card or GP visit card will be awarded.<\/p>  <p>  On foot of the Keane Report, the HSE established a Clinical Advisory Group to develop clinical oversight and guidance for the operation of a more compassionate and trusted medical card system.  The Director General of the HSE, on accepting an interim recommendation of the Group, made a decision to award medical card eligibility to all children under 18 years of age with a diagnosis of cancer from 1 July 2015, with the card to be held for a period of five years.  The Clinical Advisory Group is continuing its work on the development of guidance on assessing medical card applications involving significant medical conditions and its final report is due shortly. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware the agreed Programme for a Partnership Government states that the Government will extend medical cards to all children in receipt of the Domiciliary Care Allowance (DCA).

Notwithstanding this increase in demand, the number of patients waiting on trolleys in EDs has decreased; for Q1-2, 2016, we have seen a reduction of just over 7% in numbers of patients waiting on trolleys, in comparison with 2015. <\/p>  <p>  The increased pressure on our hospital system results in part from demographics; preliminary results from Census 2016 indicate population increases of 3.7% since 2011.  Census 2016 results have not yet available in terms of age profile, however, from 2002 - 2011, the cohort of the population aged over 65 grew by 23% and is projected to rise further.  Adults over 65 years of age (12% of the population) use 53% of hospital in-patient care.  <\/p>  <p>  The HSE has therefore estimated the rate of increase in demand at approximately 3% per annum; however, recent 2016 hospital attendance reports would indicate that 3% is at the lower end of the scale.  The Minister for Health met with the HSE National Director for Acute Hospitals on Friday, 15th July, regarding the recent rise in numbers of patients on trolleys and proposed measures to address trolley numbers.  It was agreed that the HSE Special Delivery Unit will continue to maintain a strong focus on ensuring that hospitals improve performance in managing ED pressures, as well as on expanding care pathways for frail elderly people who present in EDs.<\/p>  <p>  Ongoing efforts to address ED overcrowding include the development of more Primary Care Centres and widening the range of services that primary care can offer and expansion of Community Intervention Teams.  Hospital capacity has recently been increased by opening or reopening 374 additional beds and employing more than 750 nurses and almost 80 consultants; reducing delayed discharges from hospitals; and improving how hospitals manage surges in demand for emergency care.  Funding of &euro;40 million has been provided for a Winter Initiative, which will provide for expanded services over the next two winters.  <\/p>  <p>  General measures to reduce hospital overcrowding include commitments to progress new ED facilities for University Hospital Galway and Beaumont Hospital, Dublin.  These are in addition to capacity expansions already underway in University Hospital Galway and Our Lady Of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda, and new ED facilities which have already opened at the Mater Hospital in Dublin, in Wexford General Hospital and St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital Kilkenny.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016072000086#WRT02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":813,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016072000086#WRT02900"},{"type":"question","counter":814,"qnumday":318,"qnumall":"[23066\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016072000086#WRT03000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the degree to which waiting times can be reduced for elective procedures in hospitals throughout the country; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":815,"content":"<p>A key challenge for our health system is ensuring timely access to health services.  There has been a considerable increase in demand for care in our health system in recent years.  100,000 patients have an elective in-patient procedure and 800,000 have a planned day case procedure.  Up to the end of May 2016, there has been an increase of over 19,000 scheduled in-patient \/ daycase procedures, in comparison to the same period in 2015.<\/p>  <p>  The key issue for patients is how long they wait.  It is important to note that approximately 60% of patients wait less than 6 months for their required inpatient\/daycase procedure and that 91% of patients wait less than the maximum permissible waiting time of 15 months for that procedure.<\/p>  <p>  I met with the HSE National Director for Acute Hospitals on Friday, 15 July, regarding proposed measures to tackle waiting lists.  I requested that the HSE prepare an action plan, setting out specific measures that the HSE will implement, in conjunction with hospitals, between now and the end of 2016 in order to tackle waiting lists.  I have agreed with the HSE that the action plan should focus on process improvement in how hospitals manage their waiting lists, with a particular focus on validating waiting lists, as well as on actions to reduce waiting times for those patients waiting longest.  The HSE will report to my Department on a regular basis regarding progress on implementing the action plan. <\/p>  <p>  This Government recognises that a sustained commitment to improving waiting times is required.  Consequently, the Programme for a Partnership Government commits to &euro;15m funding to the NTPF to address waiting lists in 2017, as part of the Programme&rsquo;s commitment to a continued investment of &euro;50m per year to reduce waiting lists.  This commitment seeks to utilise the expertise of the NTPF to further assist the HSE in addressing specific waiting list pressures.

The plan is being rolled out at a regional and local level and involves full consultation with stakeholders.<\/p><p>The Programme for Government contains a commitment to continue to move people with disabilities out of congregated settings, to enable them to live independently and to be included in the community.  Currently, 2725 people live in congregated settings and our objective is to reduce this figure by one-third by 2021 and ultimately, to eliminate all congregated settings.<\/p><p>The HSE has established a subgroup, under '<i>Transforming Lives<\/i>', the Programme to implement the recommendations of the Value for Money and Policy Review of Disability Services, which is developing an implementation plan for moving people from institutions.

The HSE estimate that a further 100 people could benefit from this initiative. &euro;1 million in ring-fenced leasing funding is also being made available by the Department of the Environment in 2016 to support people moving from institutions into suitable social housing in the community.  This demonstrates the joined up commitment of both Departments to support the de-congregation programme.<\/p><p>The HSE has developed a three strand approach to accelerate transitions from institutions in the period 2016-2021, with a target of 900 people to move to more suitable accommodation in this period.<\/p><p>-  Strand 1- is focussed on large institutional settings at high risk of not meeting HIQA Standards; <\/p><p>-  Strand 2- is focussed on moving people into suitable social housing in the community through the Department of Environment schemes; and <\/p><p>-  Strand 3- is focussed on remaining service users in congregated settings who could move to suitable accommodation.<\/p><p>As the HSE is responsible for leading out on the recommendations on &quot;Time to Move on from Congregated Settings - A Strategy for Community Inclusion&quot;, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive (HSE) for direct reply to the Deputy.

However, while the Government's objective is to deliver a high quality, integrated and cost effective health care service the mechanism and timescale for delivery of primary care centres is dependent on a number of factors.  Regardless of the delivery mechanism, all potential primary care infrastructure is subject to suitable locations being offered \/ provided \/ available, to successful planning processes and GP commitment to sharing accommodation and delivering health care services with HSE staff.  In addition the operational lease mechanism is subject to market pressures such as the developers' access to adequate financing.

These twin imperatives informed Ireland&rsquo;s approach to the negotiations in 2012 and 2013, and they continue to inform the process by which the various elements of CAP reform are now being delivered. Indeed, the protection of farm incomes and the support of the next generation of farm families are also central elements of the new Programme for a Partnership Government.<\/p>  <p>  Taking the direct payments system as an example, the Deputy may recall that Ireland proposed an alternative approach to the redistribution of direct payments than that originally advocated by the European Commission, precisely because we wanted to ensure that the direct payments system could be made fairer and more equitable while at the same time ensuring that the level of transfer of payments between farmers was not of a scale that might jeopardise our objectives for the development of the sector.  We now have a system which satisfies these two requirements.  Last year&rsquo;s payments under the Basic Payment and other schemes represented the start of a process that, by 2019, will see a considerable shift in the balance of payments from those previously receiving very high rates per hectare to those previously receiving much lower rates of payment.  I believe that this not only makes the direct payments system fairer, but also ensures that it continues to provide support and income stability that will allow farmers to respond to the demands of the market.  As such, it also provides a vital tool to help us achieve the objectives outlined in the Food Wise 2025 strategy.   <\/p>  <p>  Significant steps have also been taken to encourage the participation of young farmers in agriculture, which is vital in terms of securing the critical role that farm families play in the development of the sector.  In addition to providing for a top-up of direct payments, young farmers are prioritised in the allocation of payment entitlements from the national reserve.  These direct payments measures are further complemented by supports under the 2014-2020 Rural Development Programme where, for example, enhanced support for capital investment by young farmers has been made available under the TAMS schemes.<\/p>  <p>  More generally under Pillar 2 of the CAP, I am focussed on the socio-economic development of our farms and of our rural areas so that all farm families have an opportunity to realise their potential.  Schemes for improving sustainability (such as GLAS and the Beef Data and Genomics Programme) and competitiveness (such as TAMS) are complemented by continued strong support for disadvantaged areas (now known as Areas of Natural Constraint).  I believe this combination provides a vital range of supports that will allow farm families to continue to benefit from the CAP in an equitable manner while supporting their development over the coming years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016072000090#WRX02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Basic Payment Scheme Payments","counter":1002,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016072000090#WRX02400"},{"type":"question","counter":1003,"qnumday":382,"qnumall":"[23094\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016072000090#WRX02500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the extent to which all farm support payments already due this year have been paid up to date; the number outstanding for technical or other reasons; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":1004,"content":"<p>Payments under the 2015 Basic Payment Scheme have issued to in excess of 126,000 beneficiaries (over 99% of eligible applicants).

Third Country markets are an increasingly important alternative outlet for the industry.

However, my Department plays a vital role in the enforcement of this legislation under service contract to the Food Safety Authority of Ireland.  Currently my Department is assisting our colleagues in the Department of Health on the drafting of a new Statutory Instrument to bring the labelling of loose pigmeat and poultry into line with the origin labelling rules for packaged meat brought in on April the first 2015.  This requires businesses who sell meat loose in their premises to clearly identify the country of rearing and slaughter of the animal from which the meat is derived.  Once the SI has been finalised my Department will arrange for it to be placed on the Technical Regulation Information System for notification to all EU Member States and following on from the obligatory three month standstill period I would be confident that the Minister for Health will be in a position to sign the SI, bringing it into force.<\/p><p>Primary responsibility under EU law for the safety and traceability of food placed on the market lies with food business operators.  The role of National Competent Agencies is to verify compliance with this requirement.  This is done via a combination of inspecting establishments and auditing the food safety management systems which operators have in place.  These controls are applied at different stages in the food supply chain.<b><\/b>Regulation (EC) No. 178 of 2002 sets out the general principles and requirements of EU food law and stipulates that food business operators must, at all stages of production, processing and distribution within their business, ensure food law requirements are satisfied. In regard to traceability, the regulations require that food business operators have systems to identify any person who supplies the business with a food, and a system to identify other businesses to which their product has been supplied.  This is referred to as the &lsquo;one step forward, one step backward&rsquo; traceability system.  There are additional requirements for certain fishery and aquaculture products under the Control Regulation (Regulation 1224\/2009 and Implementing Regulation 404\/2011) from first sale to subsequent stages of production, processing and distribution up to retail. <\/p><p>My Department has a permanent veterinary presence at all its approved slaughter plants.  Controls at plants only engaged in secondary processing are carried out at a frequency based on an annual risk assessment.

Labelling and documentary checks are routinely conducted by the Department.<\/p><p>The import of products of animal origin from third countries is governed by a comprehensive and robust legislative framework laid down at EU level, controlled by Member States in the first instance, and audited by the European Commission&rsquo;s Directorate General for Health and Food Safety (formally the FVO), to ensure compliance with all of the relevant food safety standards.  The legislation imposes health and supervisory requirements designed to ensure that imported products meet standards equivalent to those required for production and trade between Member States.  Border Inspection Posts are operated by my Department.  Import control procedures on products of animal and fish origin are highly prescriptive and strictly audited by the Directorate to ensure compliance.

This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network rollout plan.  A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional,\u00a0Rural and\u00a0Gaeltacht Affairs.  A detailed rollout plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place.<\/p><p>In the meantime, my Department continues to liaise closely with industry and relevant other Departments and agencies to assist in the commercial deployment of telecommunications networks.

In 2015, it is estimated that 6.8% of heat was derived from renewable sources.<\/p>  <p>  In the transport sector, Ireland aims to meet our renewable target mainly through the increased use of sustainable biofuels, with electric vehicles also making a small contribution.\u00a0 In 2015, 5.7% of our energy needs in the transport sector were met from renewable sources. <\/p>  <p>  The Energy White Paper, Ireland's Transition to a Low Carbon Energy Future, published in December last, sets out a vision for transforming Ireland's fossil-fuel based energy sector into a clean, low carbon system by 2050, while the\u00a0Programme for Government also sets out important objectives in the energy sector that build on this vision. \u00a0The clear focus of my Department is on implementing the range of actions that are aimed at meeting our energy and climate change targets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016072000091#WRY02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Service Obligation Levy Yield","counter":1056,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016072000091#WRY02550"},{"type":"question","counter":1057,"qnumday":402,"qnumall":"[23142\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016072000091#WRY02600","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the amount collected from the public service obligation levy on energy bills for each of the past five years in tabular form.

The PSO levy consists of a set of support schemes designed to facilitate the achievement of national electricity policy objectives for renewables, indigenous fuels and security of supply.  It also supports employment in the renewables industry and in the peat industry.  The proceeds of the PSO levy are used to contribute to the additional relevant costs incurred by PSO-supported electricity generators which are not recovered in the electricity market.\u00a0 Recent international studies have shown that Ireland has had one of the lowest per unit supports for renewable energy in the European Union.<\/p><p>The overarching objective of the Government&rsquo;s energy policy is to ensure secure and sustainable supplies of competitively priced energy to all consumers.  The PSO has supported the connection of more than 2,000 MW of renewable energy to the electricity grid and will continue to support the development of renewable energy so that the target for 40% renewable electricity penetration by 2020 is met.<\/p><p>My Department is currently working on the development of a new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) and a consultation will issue later this year.<\/p><p>The PSO Levy is a charge on all electricity customers without exception and is determined by the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER).  The legal basis for the PSO levy and its method of calculation by the CER are set out in Regulations made under the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 (S.I. 217 of 2002).  The total amounts spent, and details by category, such as the amounts for peat, renewables and security of supply plant, for each of the past five years, as calculated by the CER, are already available in the public domain.

It will end limitations in access to public contracts, open-up services market, and offer predictable conditions for investors.  <\/p>  <p>  The agreement covers virtually every aspect of economic activity, and it is extremely important for Ireland.  It offers significant opportunities for growth in trade for with Canada.  The agreement opens up public procurement markets in the Canadian provinces giving Irish firms increased access to Canadian public sector purchasing.  Ireland also gains unlimited tariff free access for most of our important food exports. Irish firms will also benefit from the recognition of product standards.  In addition, Ireland successfully campaigned for a low beef import quota from Canada to the EU thereby safeguarding our important EU market in this area.  <\/p>  <p>  At the EU Council of Trade Ministers on 13 May 2016, the Council had an exchange of views on CETA and the process towards signature and provisional application of the agreement.  The European Commission and Member States highlighted the high quality of the agreement reached with Canada and expressed the desire to work towards signature of the agreement at the October EU-Canada Summit.  At the meeting, I made Ireland&rsquo;s approach clear, that based on our assessment of its provisions, we viewed CETA as a mixed Agreement, in terms of EU and Member State competency.<\/p>  <p>  The Commission published its proposals for signature, conclusion and provisional application of the agreement on 5 July 2016.  The Commission has now decided to submit CETA to the Council for decision as a mixed agreement.  <\/p>  <p>  It will be a matter for the Council and the European Parliament to decide on the signature and provisional application of CETA.  Following a decision by the Council with the consent of the Parliament, it will be possible to provisionally apply CETA.  Its full entering into force will be subject to the conclusion by the EU, through a Council decision with the consent of the Parliament, and by all Member States through the relevant national ratification procedures.  This means that the Oireachtas will be part of the final decision to ratify the agreement.<\/p>  <p>  The provisional application of Free Trade Agreements is standard practice.  What is at issue is what should be within scope in such application. We&rsquo;ve argued that only those areas directly within exclusive Commission competence should be covered by provisional application.  The Commission has already accepted that the CETA is a mixed agreement.<\/p>  <p>  The provisions of the CETA on investment dispute resolution relate solely to the CETA as a multinational trade agreement.  International trade agreements are not part of domestic law.  This is why separate adjudication arrangements are required in the event of disputes under the agreement. <\/p>  <p>  The issue of mixity and the extent of EU competence in a Free Trade Agreement is before the European Court of Justice.  I understand that a decision is expected in 2017.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016072000094#WRBB00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1247"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Small and Medium Enterprises Supports","counter":1161,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016072000094#WRBB00900"},{"type":"question","counter":1162,"qnumday":440,"qnumall":"[23078\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016072000094#WRBB01000","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if she is satisfied that all means of assistance available to the indigenous business sector here are readily available and accessible; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1247"},{"type":"speech","counter":1163,"content":"<p>The Local Enterprise Offices and Enterprise Ireland are the main Agencies within my Department that offer advice and support to indigenous companies. <\/p><p>The Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) are the &lsquo;first-stop-shop&rsquo; State support service for micro and small businesses in each local area.

One-in-five private sector jobs in the economy result from IDA Ireland-supported FDI, both directly and indirectly, and represent a vital economic contribution by the multinational sector.  2015 saw the highest level of employment in the Agency&rsquo;s history, with 187,056 people employed in IDA Ireland client companies.<\/p><p>Our efforts to continue to attract international investment in Ireland will be guided by both my Department&rsquo;s Policy Statement on Foreign Direct Investment and IDA Ireland&rsquo;s own five-year strategy <i>&ldquo;Winning - Foreign Direct Investment 2015-2019&rdquo;. <\/i>The strategy details both how the Agency will broaden its target sectors further and seek new markets over the next five years.  Its ambitious targets include boosting FDI in Ireland by over 40% and creating 80,000 new jobs in the economy. <\/p><p>When considering investing in Ireland FDI companies consider a range of factors, including: regions of scale with appropriate urban centres, supply of skilled people, international connectivity, energy infrastructure, telecommunications, R&amp;amp;D capabilities, sub-supplier and services infrastructure.<\/p><p>Ireland has many factors that make it an attractive location for FDI including a stable macroeconomic environment, pro-enterprise policies, high-quality education and skills development, a proven track record and a competitive and transparent corporate tax regime.  <\/p><p>Property availability is of particular importance when a FDI company is considering locating in a regional area.  In this regard, in February 2015 the Government unveiled a five-year strategy that included the delivery of a &euro;150 million IDA Ireland property investment programme to attract foreign direct investment into different parts of Ireland.

The Regional Action Plans for Jobs are the mechanisms for delivery.  Their objective is to increase employment by 10% to 15% in each region, resulting in the generation of a total of 246,000 jobs by 2020, even higher than the Programme for Government target.  This goal is underpinned by key targets for each of the regions, including increasing the number of entrepreneurs\/start-ups in each region by minimum 25%, improving the survival rate and scaling performance of companies; increasing FDI investment into each region by 30% to 40%; and increasing the flow of critical skills to the Region&rsquo;s enterprises.<\/p>  <p>  Achieving these ambitious targets at regional level requires a renewed focus on building on regional strengths and areas of competitive advantage to develop the environment for business to start, grow and succeed and to attract inward investment.<\/p>  <p>  All 8 Plans have been published and implementation is underway.  Each Plan is overseen by a Regional Implementation Committee, with members drawn from the private and public sector.

These competitive calls are being targeted at innovative and collaborative approaches to support jobs creation across the regions. In June this year, I announced an initial allocation of &euro;5million in competitive funding for 48 local and regional initiatives under two competitive regional funding calls administered by Enterprise Ireland; the LEO Competitive Fund and the Community Enterprise Initiative.

The improved competitiveness of Ireland&rsquo;s exporting sector has been one of Ireland&rsquo;s greatest strengths in recent years and has been key to economic growth and job creation.  Improved cost competitiveness has made Irish firms more competitive internationally and made Ireland a more attractive location in which firms can locate and expand their operations.<\/p>  <p>  As a result of our concerted efforts to improve national competitiveness, Ireland&rsquo;s relative international competitiveness as measured by a range of international indices has improved since 2012.  Ireland moved from 16th to 7th in the IMD&rsquo;s World Competitiveness Yearbook, from 29th to 24th in the WEF Global Competitiveness Report and 17th out of 189 countries, up two places on last year as assessed by the World Bank.  The Bank&rsquo;s latest report shows Ireland is now ranked 4th in the euro area in terms of ease of doing business.<\/p>  <p>  Cost competitiveness is an important aspect of Ireland's overall competitiveness and we continue to monitor Ireland's cost competitiveness on a regular basis.  The National Competitiveness Council&rsquo;s Costs of Doing Business in Ireland report published in April 2016 benchmarks key business costs and focuses on areas where Irish enterprise costs are out of line with key competitors, and on costs that are largely domestically determined.<\/p>  <p>  The report points out that recent external factors have been in our favour in terms of cost competitiveness such as a weak euro, historically low interest rates low oil prices and positive global growth.  However, as we know these are factors which are beyond our control and can change quickly and the recent UK Referendum result on leaving the UK increases the uncertainty in the external environment.  The report concludes that Ireland&rsquo;s industrial cost base remains competitive but pressure points are emerging in labour, property and business service costs. We must therefore focus intensely on reducing costs that are out of line with those in competitor countries.  There is a role for both the public and private sectors alike to proactively manage their cost base and drive efficiency, thus creating a virtuous circle between the costs of living, wage expectations and cost competitiveness.  Measures that ensure open and competitive markets are essential. Improving productivity performance is also key. <\/p>  <p>  I share the Council&rsquo;s view that high costs have the potential to undermine recent economic progress and it remains our goal to continue to develop a competitive and productive economy. The immediate challenge is to sustain the strong recovery underway by remaining competitive.  Therefore a general policy of vigilance and a willingness to take action on costs is essential.  To protect the gains achieved to date, to further embed and sustain employment growth, and to ultimately spread the benefits of economic growth to all, we must continue to enhance all aspects of our competitiveness, including costs.<\/p>  <p>  Addressing Ireland&rsquo;s international cost competitiveness remains a key economic priority for Government.  While growth prospects for the Irish economy are strong, we must continue to deliver aggressively the structural reforms required to support cost competitiveness, productivity and growth.  We will continue to progress actions that improve Ireland&rsquo;s cost competitiveness position, by implementing Action Plan for Jobs 2016 and in the development of the Action Plan for Jobs 2017.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016072000094#WRBB03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1247"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Regional Development Initiatives","counter":1192,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016072000094#WRBB04000"},{"type":"question","counter":1193,"qnumday":450,"qnumall":"[23279\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016072000094#WRBB04100","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the extent to which consideration remains to be given to supporting regional developments in a way likely to spread economic growth throughout the regions thereby preventing imbalances; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1247"},{"type":"speech","counter":1194,"content":"<p>The Government Plan is to create 200,000 jobs by 2020, including 135,000 jobs outside Dublin - my focus is to ensure that every region in the country is supported in achieving its economic potential and maximising opportunities for job creation.<\/p>  <p>  The Regional Action Plans for Jobs are playing a significant role in the delivery of regional enterprise and employment growth, by driving collaboration between key stakeholders and working in partnership with the enterprise sector to build on local strengths and deliver new ideas.

This translates into a net increase of 10,169 jobs (taking account of job losses) in EI supported businesses and brings total employment in these companies to 192,223 for 2015, a record high for the agency.  Almost two-thirds of the new jobs created were outside Dublin and all of the regions recorded increases in full-time employment over the period.  Enterprise Ireland attributes this strong mainly export-led job creation by Irish businesses to an improving entrepreneurial climate for start-ups, dynamic Irish companies innovating and scaling up in key sectors such as food, fintech, business process outsourcing and improving international economic conditions. <\/p><p>2015 saw the highest level of employment in IDA client companies in the organisation&rsquo;s 67 year history reaching 187,056.  A total of 18,983 new jobs were created by their clients during 2015; when job losses are taken into account, there was net job creation of 11,833. Overall, 53% of all jobs created by IDA clients in 2015 were based outside of Dublin, which is an improvement over the 49% share in 2014.  Please note that IDA employment figures for 2016 will be included in the Annual Employment Survey when it is completed in early 2017. <\/p><p>The methodology used to compile statistical data for the County Enterprise Boards (CEBs)\/Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) changed in 2010 and therefore comparable data is not available for the years 2008 and 2009.

It should be noted that following dissolution of the CEBs in 2014 and the subsequent establishment of the LEOs, an extensive cleansing of the former CEB client portfolio was undertaken by Enterprise Ireland.  This means that comparison between the period prior to 2014 with 2014 onwards can only be indicative.  The data in the following table refers to full-time plus other\/part-time jobs. Figures for 2016 will only be available in early 2017. <\/p><p>I am pleased to say that employment in Agency clients has been growing over recent years and I expect, with the continuous focus by EI, IDA and the LEOs, together with implementation of the Mid-East Regional Action Plan for Jobs, we will continue to see job creation in the years ahead.<\/p><p>Figures for the three Agencies for County Kildare are set out in the following tables:<\/p><p><b>IDA Ireland<\/b><table><tr><th>County<\/th><th>Category<\/th><th>2008<\/th><th>2009<\/th><th>2010<\/th><th>2011<\/th><th>2012<\/th><th>2013<\/th><th>2014<\/th><th>2015<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Kildare<\/td><td>Gross Gains<\/td><td>161<\/td><td>32<\/td><td>1,451<\/td><td>355<\/td><td>546<\/td><td>339<\/td><td>463<\/td><td>679<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kildare<\/td><td>Gross Losses<\/td><td>-742<\/td><td>-1,638<\/td><td>-352<\/td><td>-628<\/td><td>-575<\/td><td>-480<\/td><td>-516<\/td><td>-588<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kildare<\/td><td>Total Jobs<\/td><td>11,225<\/td><td>9,619<\/td><td>10,718<\/td><td>10,445<\/td><td>10,416<\/td><td>10,275<\/td><td>10,222<\/td><td>10,313<\/td><\/tr><\/table>Jobs are full-time and other\/part-time.
