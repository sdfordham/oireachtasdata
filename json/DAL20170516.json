The sharpest illustration of this in the past week or so has been the announcement by Bord na M&oacute;na to close the Littleton peat briquette factory.  Politicians often wonder why people become disillusioned with the State and the political system.  The manner in which this closure is being brought about would give those politicians some answers.  I refer to the shabby manner in which the workers have been treated, the lack of dignity shown to them, the false promises and the fact there was no plan, agreement or deep consultation.<\/p>  <p>  Bord na M&oacute;na was primarily founded to give employment to people in the midlands, to this part of Tipperary and to other counties, and to create economic development.

At an Oireachtas joint committee meeting of May 2015, the chief executive officer spoke of an investment of approximately &euro;10 million to convert both plants - those in Tipperary and Offaly - to 50% peat and 50% biomass, and that this would be a long-term project.

We are talking about third and fourth generation families now involved with these plants.<\/p>  <p>  Deputies met the Minister, Deputy Naughten, recently and the workers want the closure date extended to a minimum of 2020.  The redundancy package is unacceptable as this is compulsory redundancy rather than voluntary redundancy.  The longer one worked in the plant, the more one is punished by the redundancy package.  There should be significant retraining opportunities provided to the workers.

In fact, he denied that the Government was looking for locations for such checks even though that was patently untrue and was verified by the Minister for Finance who confirmed that Revenue was looking for such locations.  The position of the Taoiseach was also contradicted by Michel Barnier in his address to the Oireachtas last week, when he said, \"Customs controls are part of the EU border management.  They protect the Single Market.  They protect our food safety and our standards\".<\/p> <p> The economic implications of customs checks for the two economies on this island, especially Border communities, are enormous.  Currently, island-wide trade generates over &euro;3 billion annually.  Around 60% of exports in the North are to the Irish State.  Over 30,000 people travel across the Border every day for work, study and recreation.  Everybody knows that if Brexit leads to tariffs and customs checks the effect will be devastating, in particular beyond the Pale in rural Ireland.  Jim Woulf, chief executive of Dairygold, said, \"You'll have decimation in rural Ireland with the beef, and the dairy and the mushrooms, you have the drink industry\". <\/p> <p> The Taoiseach is bound to know this.  Why continue with the fiction that there will be no customs checks?  As far as I can establish, this is based on the wholly meaningless statement from the British Primer Minister that there will be no return to the borders of the past.  As I said, Mr. Barnier said customs controls are part of EU border management, which the Taoiseach now knows.<\/p> <p> Clearly, negotiations are going on as we speak before their adoption at the General Affairs Council on 22 May.

Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland want access to the Single Market, and the Republic of Ireland is in the Single Market and will remain so.<\/p>  <p>  As we are speaking today, we do not what know the outcome of the trading negotiations that will apply will be.  If, for instance, there are no tariffs between Ireland and Britain, Northern Ireland and the Republic or the UK and the European Union, there are still two different jurisdictions and some arrangement to deal with that will have to be made.  The point of agreement by the British Government is that there will not be a return to customs posts as we all knew them many years ago along the Border.  The agreement politically is that whatever the outcome on the trading relationship, a different way of dealing with this would have to be found.<\/p>  <p>  It is not impossible to have a situation like that to which Deputy Adams referred.

I am telling the Deputy that even if there were no tariffs, we would still have two jurisdictions, namely, the European Union and the United Kingdom.  There might be customs checks at Pembroke or Holyhead.  If one looks at eastern European countries where border checks applied in the recent past, there were eight and ten hour delays.

More than 800 families are still in this situation with six weeks to go.  Maybe when the Minister made this commitment he was hoping that by 1 July he would have moved on to better things and some other Minister would have to take the flak.  This target will not be reached despite the Minister's most recent assurances.  Even with the development of so-called hubs, and I believe there is a plan to establish up to ten of these in Dublin, they will certainly not be ready for use by July.  These hubs are in themselves a form of temporary emergency accommodation.  Admittedly they are better than hotels or bed and breakfasts, but moving families from one form of emergency accommodation to another, often miles away from the schools their children attend, is not a solution and Niamh Randall from Simon Communities stressed this point this morning on \"Morning Ireland\".<\/p>  <p>  The other key question about the hubs is how long will families be there before they are properly housed.  We now know the rapid build modular houses, proposed originally as temporary homes, are to become permanent homes.  Will the hubs become a permanent feature of this Government's dysfunctional housing policy?  Given the absence of public housing these families will only get housing in the private rental sector, but this morning the Simon Communities announced on the basis of a survey it did that nine out of ten rental properties are beyond the reach of those availing of housing assistance payment, HAP, and other rent supports.

I would describe it as the sell-out of the century, on a par with the rip-off of our oil and gas resources, the bank bailout and the bonanza for vulture funds represented by NAMA.

What is real is population growth of 3.8% which is greater than the growth in housing stock, which is 0.4%.  The average household size has increased for the first time since 1966.  Overall housing stock increased by a net 9,000 units.  Respondents reported 33,436 units built, admittedly since 2011.  I understand 23,000 families and individuals are on HAP schemes.  That is a real figure but they are also real people, families and individuals assisted through HAP and living in their homes.

These are only a fraction of the scandals that have enveloped the force under the current Government, Commissioner and Minister.  The scale of the maladministration, incompetence and potential corruption that have come to light is staggering.  It is obvious why public confidence in the force is in tatters but it is shocking that those in authority seem completely oblivious to this.  Instead, the Taoiseach and his Government colleagues attack anyone who attempts to bring these failures to light.<\/p>  <p>  Regardless of whether the Commissioner was informed of the issues in Templemore in a two-hour briefing or a quick chat over tea, her responsibility under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act is abundantly clear.  It beggars belief to claim that informing the Minister of these issues was a matter of judgment.  The Commissioner's failure to notify the Minister for 15 months was a complete dereliction of statutory responsibility to keep the Minister fully informed of any significant developments that might reasonably be expected to adversely affect public confidence in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as stated in the Act.  The fact that the T&aacute;naiste appears to believe this is a political attack on her and that raising these issues is to increase the pressure on her as Minister, as she said, is the height of arrogance.  It speaks to a Minister well aware that the removal of the previous Garda Commissioner set in motion the chain of events that led to the end of her predecessor's time in ministerial office.  It is looking very much as if history is going to repeat itself.<\/p>  <p>  This, however, is not about one justice Minister or one Commissioner; it is about systemic dysfunctionality deeply rooted in one of the most vital organs of the State.

It needs to happen now, however, and not after a commission of inquiry or another review.<\/p>  <p>  There was a time, at the time of the setting up of the Charleton inquiry, when it would have been sufficient for the Commissioner to step aside without prejudice.  That time is gone, however.  What is desperately needed now is a change in culture that can come about only if the Commissioner and the senior management team are changed.  That is what is required.

I examined the files and records furnished and spoke to the officials responsible for the operation of the Acts and liaison with other authorities in respect of same.  All documents requested by me were furnished and all questions posed by me in relation to the files and records produced were answered to my satisfaction.<br \/><br \/>3. On 27th October, 2016 I attended at the headquarters of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na ... I met with officers and personnel responsible for the operation of the above Acts.

All questions posed by me in relation to the operation of the Acts and the documents and records produced were answered to my satisfaction.<\/blockquote><p>He concludes: &quot;I am satisfied having examined the records and documents produced to me and from the information conveyed to me at these meetings that the relevant State authorities are in compliance with the provisions of the above Acts as of the date of this report&quot;.<br\/><br\/>What the Deputy referred to in respect of allegations of bugging goes back quite a number of years.  I do not have the date, but obviously there was a situation where there were different Ministers for Justice for quite a long time.  In respect of bugging, this is a very serious matter and the Minister for Justice and Equality of the day is not in a position to order that an individual be eavesdropped upon using telecommunications without having an official of the Department verify in the first instance that it would comply with the Act and that it would be overseen by the High Court judge with responsibility for this matter.  There is a lot of stuff in the ether about which I would like to know the facts.  As I understand it, the case the Deputy mentioned went before the courts not for bugging or eavesdropping but for personal injuries.  It was a different matter and this was an element of the case.  Be that as it may, it is a very serious allegation.  I am giving the Deputy the result of the judge's most recent report on compliance with the Act in so far as the Department of Justice and Equality and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are concerned.  All of the evidence, files and computers were made available and all of the questions were answered to the satisfaction of the judge.<br\/><br\/>The Commissioner of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is the Accounting Officer for the Garda Vote.

I simply do not agree with that.  The Internet is a public space and, like any other public space, should be free and safe.  People, particularly young and vulnerable persons, are entitled to the protection of the State when in it.  Free speech should remain just that, but harassment, stalking and aggravated bullying online are not expressions of freedom but rather attacks on it.<\/p><p>There is a history to the Bill.  In 2013 former Deputy Pat Rabbitte, as Minister with responsibility for communications, set out an independent expert Internet content governance advisory council which reported on a range of issues related to online content following growth in public concern about cyberbullying and related matters.  The report made a series of structural, legislative and administrative recommendations.  For example, it suggested the existing offence of sending messages that were grossly offensive, indecent, obscene or menacing should be updated to include new forms of electronic communications.  As the law stands, amazingly, the offence covers only phone and text messages.  That the law in this area has not changed since the invention of the text message is surely enough reason for the House to re-engage with this important area.<\/p><p>Last year the Law Reform Commission published its report on harmful communications and a digital strategy.  It confirmed that the criminal law applied to some harmful communications but that there were gaps, particularly relating to newer forms of communication.  It proposed that the existing law, together with new measures to tackle new forms of harmful communications, should be consolidated in a new single piece of legislation.  That is the core purpose of the Bill being presented today in my name and that of the other Labour Party Deputies.  It is about consolidating and reforming the criminal law on harmful communications.  This involves replacing certain provisions of the Post Office (Amendment) Act 1951 relating to electronic communications and the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997 relating to harassment.<\/p><p>We produced a draft of the Bill some months ago and it was circulated to key stakeholders.  I am grateful to the numerous non-governmental organisations and experts who provided comments and suggestions for us to perfect the draft of the Bill.  The Bill sets out an updated offence of harassment, allowing for stalking to count as an aggravating factor in sentencing.  It makes special provision in cases where the defendant and the victim were in an intimate relationship and the defendant has made use of personal information on or electronic surveillance or recording devices to monitor the victim.  The Bill also creates a new offence of distributing an intimate image without consent, what is now commonly referred to as &quot;revenge porn&quot;.  It deals with threatening, false, indecent or obscene messages.  The Bill makes it clear that it is not to be interpreted as altering the law so as to prohibit or unduly restrict the exercise of the rights of peaceable assembly or picketing or any constitutional right.<\/p><p>The Law Reform Commission had two parts in its report, the second of which proposed a system of oversight and regulation under one new regulator, to be called the digital safety commissioner.  However, creating a new statutory agency, as the Ceann Comhairle knows, is outside the remit of a Private Members' Bill.  The Bill implements the thrust of the commission's proposals for criminal law.  Last weekend we heard that the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality also proposd to act, which I, of course, support, but it concerns me that the account given in <i>The Irish Time<\/i>s of what she proposes in her Bill is confined entirely to the Law Reform Commission's criminal law reform agenda and discounts the second part of the commission's report dealing with civil online regulation.  It may be that the newspaper reports had an abridged version of the proposals and I certainly hope that is the case.  I also hope the T&aacute;naiste will act on the totality of the report, including the establishment of a digital safety commissioner, but I will await her full proposals.  In the meantime it is urgent that we advance the proposals before the D&aacute;il.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051600018#Q00300","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1494947400,"counter":209,"content":"<p>There was an interesting article in the <i>Sunday Independent<\/i>about this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051600018#Q00400","speaker":"1234"},{"type":"speech","time":1494947400,"counter":210,"content":"<p>That goes to my point.

Our discussions were largely focused on Brexit, but we also touched briefly on EU-US relations.  The meeting took place in the context of the Government's ongoing programme of strategic engagement on Brexit and was the latest in a series of meetings with my EU counterparts.  I also met recently my counterparts in Germany, Belgium, Poland and Spain and the Presidents of the EU institutions and the head of the Brexit task force who was in Dublin last week.  I have written to congratulate Mr. Emmanuel Macron on his election as President of the Republic of France.<\/p>  <p>  The meeting in The Hague provided an opportunity to share our views on the issues arising from Brexit ahead of the adoption of the European Union's negotiating guidelines by the European Council on 9 April.  Ireland has much in common with the Netherlands and Denmark, not just in terms of geographic proximity and strong trade and export relations with the United Kingdom but also in terms of shared perspectives on the importance of a liberal EU trade policy.  Although Ireland, the Netherlands and Denmark are more likely than other partners to be negatively affected by the United Kingdom's decision to leave the European Union, we agreed on the importance of maintaining the EU27 unity that has marked our approach until now.  I also took the opportunity at the meeting, as I do in all my bilateral engagements, to explain in some detail our unique concerns arising from Brexit, including protecting the peace process, avoiding a hard border and maintaining the common travel area with the United Kingdom.  I outlined the particular implications for Ireland, North and South, and also described recent political developments in Northern Ireland.  I am pleased that Ireland's unique concerns have been fully reflected in the guidelines that outline the European Union's approach to the withdrawal negotiations.<\/p><p>In this context, I am very grateful for the understanding and support of my Dutch and Danish counterparts, and all of my EU counterparts, as we progress work on these important and sensitive issues.  It will be important to continue working with like-minded partners such as The Netherlands and Denmark and in the future to proactively defend our shared perspectives in the face of new voting majorities in the European Union.  In the months and years ahead we are determined to protect and advance our interests, both within and through the European Union on the wider global stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051600018#Q02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1245","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1494948000,"counter":234,"content":"<p>We touched on this issue during statements on Brexit last week and the week before.

The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade with responsibility for European Affairs, Deputy Dara Murphy, has on several occasions been to all member states, particularly the small member states because of the implications of Brexit.  As Deputy Brendan Howlin is aware, most of the economic reports indicate that the countries most adversely affected would be Ireland, The Netherlands and Denmark.  I have already had a meeting with Prime Minister Michel of Belgium and we want to keep these contacts alive.  I wrote to President Macron following his election and said we would be most affected by a hard Brexit and that we would appreciate and count on France's continued support in addressing the unique challenges we faced.  I made the point that Ireland and France had always had a very warm relationship.  France is a big buyer of food, services and so on from Ireland and we want to maintain that position.  I do not favour having a federal Europe.  Given how near the European Union has been to collapse in the recent period, the electorates in The Netherlands and France and in Austria with the election of its President appear to be refocusing on Europe.  I see the same happening in the latest results in Germany which is moving towards a pro-European party.  The Germans will make their choice in federal elections in September and I expect the Chancellor, Dr. Merkel, to be returned again.  Given that there will more than likely be a very strong alliance between Germany and France and, as Deputy Brendan Howlin is aware, that the real reason for setting up the European Economic Community was to prevent the historic difficulties between France and Germany, it is important from the European Union point of view that there be strong countries which work with small countries for everybody's benefit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051600019#R00300","speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1494948000,"counter":236,"content":"<p>What is the Taoiseach's view of the Macron doctrine?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051600019#R00400","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1494948000,"counter":237,"content":"<p>He made his comments in Germany.

The D&aacute;il supports special status for the North within the European Union, but that is not within the negotiating guidelines.  A majority of Members of the Legislative Assembly, MLAs, in the North support that position, but that is not within the guidelines.  The people of the North voted to remain within the European Union, but that is not within the guidelines.  I believe - the Taoiseach may agree - that one of the big concerns for us all is the likely impact of Brexit on the Good Friday Agreement.  The British Government continues to make it clear that it will cut all ties with the European Court and the European Convention on Human Rights which are essential to the Good Friday Agreement.  Last Friday the former British Prime Minister, Mr. Tony Blair, warned of the dire consequences of Brexit and acknowledged that the best way to deal with the North was to treat it as a special case.  He also said, however, or is reported to have said that he thought the Good Friday Agreement would have to be amended.  I suspect he may have misspoken.  I certainly hope he did.

As the two Governments are co-guarantors of the Agreement, we want it to be implemented in full.  Protecting the gains of the peace process in Northern Ireland is one of the Government's front-line priorities in dealing with the impact of Brexit.  That hard won peace which was founded on the Good Friday Agreement cannot be compromised.  The Government will continue to ensure the EU-UK negotiations will take full account of the all-island issues and Northern Ireland, including ensuring the Good Friday Agreement is fully respected and upheld and that an open border is maintained.  That is our position.  I agree that the Good Friday Agreement is an internationally binding agreement which was brought together after many years of troubles.  Those who put it together were visionary in the way they set it out.  It was not written to be influenced by Brexit and the Brexit referendum result does not impact on it.

They also expect, of course, that we would understand their particular concerns.  It was a very worthwhile engagement by the Taoiseach with the Prime Ministers of both countries.<\/p> <p> I do not know whether the Taoiseach is aware of today's ruling from the European Court of Justice in regard to the free trade deal with Singapore.  It is quite interesting because it essentially means that any proper trade deal with the United Kingdom will have to be ratified by the parliaments of every member state, and maybe the regional parliaments as well, because the free trade agreement with Singapore cannot be agreed by the EU as an entity in itself.  Rather, it must go back to the parliaments in member states.  That relates to the jurisdiction of the investor class or the resolution of disputes, as well as non-directive foreign investment.  It means we will have to get to specifics sooner rather than later and move away from the generalities on which we have been focused thus far.<\/p> <p> I do not know whether the Taoiseach read Sunday's interview with Secretary David Davis.  He raised a lot of red flags.  First, he said the status of an EU citizen in the UK should be left until later in the process.  He raised the possibility that such citizens would not have their current rights protected, which almost guarantees a veto at Council level.  Second, he said that discussions on the Irish Border would have to wait until the new trade agreement is defined.  This poses an enormous problem for us and dramatically increases the uncertainty.<\/p> <p> Given all of this, can the Taoiseach outline very specifically the timetable and the process by which Ireland will table its proposals for how cross-Border relations will be handled?

The same applies to the CETA agreement with Canada, which is a mixed agreement and will require national ratification in due course.  In that case, we favour provisional ratification in order to ensure the deal works which is the best way of demonstrating the practical benefits for consumers and SMEs.<\/p><p>Deputy Martin is correct when he said we have to have the details sooner.  It means that all parliaments will have to have international trade committees so that they are not left without adequate information as negotiations on trade deals proceed.  This matter has been raised in the House.  Deputies have said they do not know what is in an agreement, despite the fact that the information might be on a website or have been published in book form.  Such agreements can be very complicated, as the Deputy knows.  If there has to be ratification by all of the parliaments, that will probably delay the process but may have a benefit in that parliaments would be informed on a rolling basis of what is being discussed so that their international free trade committees or whatever else would be very well-informed about the process.<\/p><p>We have dealt in considerable detail with our counterparts in London and Belfast in respect of the Border issues.  Deputy Martin is aware that the three issues are the Border, modalities and liabilities about whatever contractual obligations the United Kingdom has from joining the European Union and rights and reciprocal rights for people who live in European countries.  Since 1922, we have dealt on a bilateral basis with Britain via the common travel area, which does not involve just travel but also residency, the right to work and social protection and benefits.  The British Government has agreed with what we have said, namely that there is no return to the Border of the past.<\/p><p>We still do not know what the future structure of trade will be or what is being proposed by the United Kingdom with the European Union.  That is where the complexities will lie.  We will not get to that issue until there is substantial progress on the first three priorities I outlined.

How can we do that when we still do not know whether there will be tariffs or a collapse at the end of 2019, which I hope there will not be, when the first phase of the withdrawal has finished?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051600020#S00200","speaker":"1245"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Taoiseach's Meetings and Engagements","time":1494948600,"counter":243,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051600020#S00250"},{"type":"question","time":1494948600,"counter":244,"qnumday":5,"qnumall":"[21952\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051600020#S00300","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on his conversation with the British Prime Minister, Ms Theresa May, on 18 April 2017 following her announcement of a general election.","asker":"1330","askee":"1245"},{"type":"question","time":1494948600,"counter":245,"qnumday":6,"qnumall":"[22091\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051600020#S00400","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on his recent engagements with the leaders of political parties in Northern Ireland on the formation of a new power sharing Executive.

I hope in the two or three days after the British election that Deputy Adams will instruct his leader in the North, Ms O'Neill, and the DUP to get together, as these two parties are in a position to form an Executive in the interests of the peoples of Northern Ireland.<\/p> <p> The answer to Deputy Burton's question is \"Yes\".  We must have opportunities for engagement, as Deputy Martin pointed out, at official level but also at bilateral level.  There will be issues that will have to be teased out, as the Deputy well knows from long experience.  Ireland will be with the EU 26 in the formal negotiations being conducted by Michelle Barnier.  In the course of the discussions there will, of course, be issues that arise that are best understood by the British and Irish because we have been dealing with them for very many years, and we will have to have the opportunity to engage bilaterally.  Mr. Barnier will understand this as a complement or as a supplement to the formal negotiations he will lead on behalf of the European Union.  The Deputy is right when she says there will be issues that will arise that may be specific and complicated and that will need to be teased out to arrive at a compromise between the Irish and English, so the answer to the question is \"Yes\".<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051600021#T00700","speaker":"1245","continuing":true},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Meetings","time":1494949800,"counter":259,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051600022#U00150"},{"type":"question","time":1494949800,"counter":260,"qnumday":9,"qnumall":"[21844\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051600022#U00200","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he has made particular suggestions to the EU Council on the way the Government views the manner in which the EU should reform in the short, medium and long term.","asker":"1224","askee":"1245"},{"type":"question","time":1494949800,"counter":261,"qnumday":10,"qnumall":"[21871\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051600022#U00300","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on the EU 27 Council meeting on 29 April 2017.","asker":"1353","askee":"1245"},{"type":"question","time":1494949800,"counter":262,"qnumday":11,"qnumall":"[21877\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051600022#U00400","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on the meeting of European Union Heads of State and Government held on 29 April 2017.","asker":"1330","askee":"1245"},{"type":"question","time":1494949800,"counter":263,"qnumday":12,"qnumall":"[23278\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051600022#U00500","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"when the next EU Council meeting will take place.","asker":"1360","askee":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1494949800,"counter":264,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 to 12, inclusive, together.<\/p>  <p>  As I outlined last week in my statement to the House, I attended the meeting of the European Council on 29 April.  This was the first meeting since Prime Minister May formally notified the European Union of the UK's intention to leave, thereby triggering Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union, and it was, therefore, a meeting of the 27 remaining member states.<\/p>  <p>  We adopted the EU negotiating guidelines, and had a broad-ranging discussion about the process ahead.  Presidents Tusk and Juncker also outlined the process and timelines around the relocation of the two EU agencies currently located in the UK.<\/p>  <p>  I was pleased with the outcome of the meeting, including the overall EU approach to the withdrawal negotiations, and the acknowledgement of the need to address Ireland's unique concerns, as set out in the guidelines.  I was also very pleased with the declaration which was agreed by the European Council, which provides reassurance that no provision of the Good Friday Agreement, including the provision relating to unity, will be undermined by the UK departure from the EU.<\/p>  <p>  It was by no means a given that Ireland&rsquo;s position would be seen as a priority for the negotiations but, thanks to our strategic, persistent and patient work, and the understanding and support of our European partners, Ireland's specific concerns were fully acknowledged in the guidelines.  Supporting and protecting the achievements, benefits and commitments of the peace process; avoiding a hard border; and protecting the common travel area will now be addressed as priorities in the exit negotiations.<\/p>  <p>  There was no discussion about the future of the EU at this April meeting of the European Council, but it has been considered and discussed at a number of meetings, including informal meetings of the European Council in Bratislava, in Brussels, in Malta and in Rome.  In my discussions at these meetings, in my bilateral engagements with EU counterparts, and here in the House, I have consistently emphasised the need for the EU to focus on delivering for its citizens in areas where it can add real value.  I have cautioned against pursuing deeper integration at this time and have instead recommended that we focus on where the EU is most effective, for example, in relation to the Single Market, the digital single market, jobs, growth and investment.<\/p>  <p>  I did not have any bilateral meetings at the European Council on 29 April, although I did of course engage with my counterparts at the meeting and informally on the margins.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051600022#U00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1494949800,"counter":265,"content":"<p>We have only seven minutes left.

This is part of the problem today I have noticed.<\/p>  <p>  What the Taoiseach has said essentially is he does not have any proposal for reform of the European Union.  He has not tabled any and he does not believe essentially there is any need for reform, other than to make the existing treaties work.  The substantial majority of the Irish people would have welcomed the election of President Macron.  One part of this is that he defeated the anti-European Union and nationalist agendas of the extreme left and the extreme right.  He was unapologetically pro-European Union, which is a lesson to be learned, and it worked.  His election is an opportunity for moving ahead with some reforms of the European Union, and Deputy Howlin mentioned some of this earlier.  It may have to be done in parallel with the Brexit negotiations.  Essentially Europe has to be made more relevant to the citizen, but that will require some reforms.<\/p>  <p>  President Macron and Chancellor Merkel yesterday seemed to indicate the possibility of future treaty changes in the years ahead.  This is very important for Ireland because, in our view, there is no realistic way to achieve special status for Northern Ireland and the Border region without some form of treaty change.  In the Government document on Brexit, the point about our national interest in a strong European Union is repeated, but it is accompanied by no new ideas for strengthening the European Union, and that is required because the lesson from Brexit and other elections is a significant proportion of people are becoming disconnected from the European Union.  Has the Taoiseach made any proposals, and I take it from his reply that he has not, concerning treaty changes?  Has he conducted any analysis of what the current treaties allow and what they exclude in terms of a final Brexit deal?  I have been pursuing this for some time.  Will the Taoiseach explain why so far, nothing has been published on the constraints which may be imposed by limiting a deal to the current EU legal order and legislation?  The deal has to be limited to the current EU legal order and legislation.

It is clear the new French President has gone to Germany to reform a Franco-German axis to bring about fundamental change in the structure of the European Union but most especially in the eurozone.  I am concerned, because the Franco-German axis has always been the driver for real change, that there would be an agenda now for a two-tier Europe and that there would be new eurozone parliament, finance minister and bespoke budget, and other, non-eurozone, member states would be in a secondary position.  We need to have detailed proposals and plans on all this because one of the things in the past that has concerned Irish citizens is that matters have been foisted upon them at the end and they have said \"No\" to that sort of suggestion.  My judgment is what it is needed now is a refocusing on a social Europe, which identifies the needs of citizens, and on European solidarity, rather than any fundamental political restructuring of the Union.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051600022#U00900","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1494949800,"counter":268,"content":"<p>I am sure the Taoiseach has been briefed on the remarks at the weekend by David Davis, MP, the British Minister with responsibility for negotiating Brexit.

He described the sequencing for the negotiations as \"wholly illogical and wrong\", and he predicted the row of the summer if the EU persisted with addressing the Border and the divorce Bill first.  He was especially disparaging towards any suggestion that a deal on the Border could be agreed before the issue of the Single Market, the customs union and a future free trade deal between the EU and Britain.

He is a voice for tolerance in these difficult times.  President Macron met with the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, yesterday.  The Franco-German relationship is very much back on track and at the centre of Europe in the context of the discussion we are having now about the future of Europe.  As Deputy Howlin said, there is talk by President Macron of reform of the eurozone.  Following that summit yesterday I heard words such as \"further integration\", \"federalism\" and so on.  That would be of concern to Irish citizens in particular who see the European Union as a partnership of member states.  There is a possibility again of a multi-speed, in or out or first or second class citizens Europe.  I asked the Taoiseach about that previously and he said that we have a multi-speed Europe currently, with some countries opting in and others opting out on various provisions, the eurozone and so forth but we need to be very cautious about this development.  There is a new dynamic at the centre of the European Union now and Ireland needs to know where it stands in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  There is also a discussion on treaty change.  Any treaty change needs to be clearly thought out and debated with the Irish people because it will involve a referendum.

The European agenda should not stop with Brexit.  It has to go beyond that and the completion of the digital Single Market, capital markets and the EMU, is the agenda for the creation of millions of jobs both in Europe and beyond.  That agenda is in place and has been followed, although not to completion because it contains a number of challenges that need to be dealt with.  We participate very strongly on that and as the Deputy knows, the last Eurobarometer poll showed that 88% of Irish people supported the concept of European membership and Ireland continuing to be a member of the European Union.  That is where we stay.<\/p><p>I was glad to see the election of a French President who is clearly very much in favour of the continuation of the European Union because if that election had gone wrong and Marine Le Pen had been elected as President, withdrawing from the euro and from the European Union and dealing with the closing of borders would have created a fundamental collapse of the European Union itself.<\/p><p>There is a retrenchment here in terms of what the European Union actually means now and I have to say that for the first time since I began to attend European Council meetings, and the first meeting was in Malta, people began to realise just what was at stake.  Do they want to hold on to a European Union and a Single Market or do they not?  The point made by Mr. Barnier last week was that it comes to a point where people begin to say, &quot;You have got 400 million or 500 million in a Single Market, freedom of movement of people, capital, services and all of that and do you want to throw it away for the sake of hundreds of thousands of jobs in small businesses?&quot; Obviously, that is not the case.<\/p><p>We are very strongly in favour of the European Union and no other country, with respect to them, has the same solidarity as we have here because as the Leas Cheann-Comhairle will recall, in the middle of the recession we had to have a referendum on the fiscal stability treaty, which Deputy Howlin raised last week in terms of the fiscal rules.  The people here could have given the Government a real kicking at the time but they decided that their place was with the euro, the eurozone and the European Union and they voted 60-40 in favour of that.  Nobody here is in favour of treaties but sometimes if sovereignty is transferred in part to the European Union the Attorney General of the day makes a recommendation on whether a referendum is required.<\/p><p>Mr. Barnier pointed out last week that if we have a situation where Britain withdraws from the Union and there is a &euro;12 billion hole in the budget every year, the countries that are paying do not want to pay any more while the countries that are receiving do not want to receive any less, so what do we do?  Do we force countries to pay more or do we force countries to cut programmes?  We can imagine what could happen in a country like Ireland with the CAP and all the different schemes available for farmers, from the uplands down to the lowlands and the tillage schemes.<\/p><p>I agree with Deputy Howlin because I believe there will be more emphasis on social Europe in the time ahead but we cannot have these ghettos or <i>banlieues<\/i>in Paris and other places where people are left for 20 years without engagement from Government or Government listening to them.  We cannot expect model citizens to come out of these areas at all times.  That is where the difference of opinion, be it religious, political or whatever, arises.  It is where people get driven right and left because of fear, frustration and vexation.  I believe Governments will start to listen now to all the voices, discordant and otherwise, and deal with these issues.<\/p><p>Deputy Haughey raised the Franco-German relationship.  I believe that will be very strong.  Clearly, two big countries with big economies will get their way in the vast majority of cases and therefore relationships between small countries and the likes of France and Germany will be of particular importance.  It was always my view that the European Union thrived when big countries worked with small countries in the interests of everybody.  If we are all equal as citizens in the European Union and if everybody is to have the same opportunity, small countries need that opportunity.  Deputy Haughey is right that there will be a cementing of that relationship and in that sense we will have to face change, but we should face it with courage.  It does not always mean that there will be treaties but we should never be afraid to talk about the issues on the table because we might find we have many allies in small countries who would say this would not be in anybody's interest.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051600023#V00400","speaker":"1245"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Topical Issue Matters","time":1494950400,"counter":273,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051600023#V00500"},{"type":"speech","time":1494950400,"counter":274,"content":"<p>Before we move on to Priority Questions, I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 29A and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputies Michael Moynihan, Niall Collins and Kevin O'Keeffe - construction of the M20 motorway from Cork to Limerick;

That is important for any employee taking on a job.  It strengthens the existing minimum compensation provisions for low-paid workers who are called to work and are not provided with the work itself.  The six-month reference period in the Sinn F&eacute;in Bill is far too short to take into account the normal peaks of businesses, including seasonal businesses as well.  The six-month period would certainly produce a skewed result.  The Bill requires that every employer in the country displays notices in their workplaces indicating the number of hours being allocated to workers.  The Bill, in our view, does not deal with the range of issues that we have encompassed in our Bill.  We are also prohibiting zero-hour contracts in most circumstances, which is not included in the Sinn F&eacute;in Bill.  We are ensuring that workers on low-hour contracts who consistently work more hours each week than are provided for in their contracts are designated those hours.  We have seen many examples in the past where workers are on 15-hour contracts but are working 40 hours or so per week.  This will strengthen the employees.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051600027#Z01400","speaker":"1272"},{"type":"speech","time":1494952800,"counter":327,"content":"<p>Thank you.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051600027#Z01500","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1494952800,"counter":328,"content":"<p>I ask Deputy Gino Kenny to study our Bill when it is put together-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051600027#Z01600","speaker":"1272"},{"type":"speech","time":1494952800,"counter":329,"content":"<p>The Minister of State has exceeded his time by one minute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051600027#Z01700","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1494952800,"counter":330,"content":"<p>I think he will be satisfied enough that we are going to ensure that workers are protected.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051600027#Z01800","speaker":"1272"},{"type":"speech","time":1494952800,"counter":331,"content":"<p>I will study the Bill when it comes out.

I am involved in the jobs committee.  We have been scrutinising Deputy Cullinane's Bill.  We had a lot of representation from business organisations.  The one thing that united them all is that they came in with no solution as to the problem we have.  Deputy Kenny said it there as well.  There are a lot of people in this country affected by this.  It is not just the zero-hour contract but also the banded hours contract.  I think the Minister of State misunderstood what banded hours means.  The Bill is not asking for extra hours, it is asking for people to get the hours they actually work and for the hours to be defined.  That would allow people to go to their local credit union and get a loan or probably even a mortgage because they would know exactly what hours they were working.  I am very disappointed that the Government is not supporting that amendment.<\/p>  <p>  Workers need to be protected.  We have a huge problem in this country with people on low pay and precarious hours.  People do not know what days they are working from one week to the next and cannot organise child care or get loans when they need them.  The Bill has been scrutinised very strongly.  We have been doing that for a number of months.  We have had a balanced view in the last couple of weeks with the trade unions and USI having come before the committee.

There were 48 submissions after the UL study.  This is good legislation and the response we have received from all sides has been very positive.  We have heard very few concerns from employers about the banded hours we are proposing because the banded hours Bill will reflect the amount of time an employee has worked over an 18-month rather than a six-month period.  It is more real and in the interests of the employee.  We want to protect low-paid workers.  That is the idea behind the legislation.

On 15 February 2017 the European Parliament voted in support of the provisional application of the CETA.  As I have said many times before in the House, the provisions relating to investment protection, investment dispute settlement and the investment court system are excluded from the provisional application.  The main provisions offering new opportunities for Irish industry and business will come into force once Canada has completed its own procedures.<\/p><p>The process of ratification can now commence in the member states according to their constitutional requirements.  In Ireland&rsquo;s case, the D&aacute;il will be part of the final decision to ratify the agreement.  Canada is finalising its internal implementation procedures to allow for its ratification of the agreement.  It is expected that the CETA will provisionally apply from summer 2017.  The Council's decision on provisional application of the CETA is available on the public register of documents on the Council's website.  The document reference number is 10974\/16.<b><\/b>The decision provides that the majority of the provisions of the agreement will be provisionally applied.<\/p><p>Deputy Maureen O&rsquo;Sullivan has asked which chapters will be provisionally applied and which will not.  The position is that only Articles 8.1 to 8.8, inclusive, Article 8.13, Article 8.15, with the exception of paragraph 3, and Article 8.16 will be provisionally applied in chapter 8 and only in so far as foreign direct investment is concerned.  Paragraphs 3 and 4 of Article 13.2, Article 13.3 and Article 13.4, Article 13.9 and Article 13.21 of chapter 13 shall not be provisionally applied in so far as they concern portfolio investment, protection of investment or the resolution of investment disputes between investors and states.  Article 20.12, Article 27.3 and Article 27.4 and paragraph 7 of Article 28.7 shall not be provisionally applied.  The provisional application of chapters 22 to 24, inclusive, of the agreement shall respect the allocation of competences between the European Union and the member states.<\/p><p>On Deputy Mick Wallace's question, the CETA will establish a regulatory co-operation forum to discuss regulatory issues of mutual interest and develop bilateral co-operation activities.  The forum is expected to enhance information sharing between Canadian and EU regulators, facilitate the development of more compatible regulatory measures, resulting in fewer barriers to trade and making it easier for the European Union to do business in Canada.  The forum will be co-chaired by a senior representative of the Government of Canada and a senior representative of the European Commission and relevant officials from the European Union and Canada.  The forum cannot change existing legislation or develop new legislation on its own and will not have any decision-making powers.  It can only make recommendations to regulators and legislators.  Any initiative entailing a change in EU regulations can only be introduced and pursued outside the CETA framework in compliance with the ordinary legislative procedure of the European Union.<\/p><p>I fully support provisional application of the agreement.  I am of the view that there should be no impediment to Irish companies immediately taking advantage of the provisions of the CETA, including eliminating tariffs on almost all key exports, access to the Canadian procurement market, easing regulatory barriers and ensuring more transparent rules for market access such as a single website for public procurement.<\/p><p>To answer Deputy Maurice Quinlivan's question, it is important to wait to see the benefits of the CETA come into being before the CETA is put before the D&aacute;il for ratification.

I was privileged to be able to rear my children in County Meath.  I sent them to school in Skryne and reared them in the Seneschalstown-Hayestown area.  We used to use the Johnstown road regularly.<\/p>  <p>  My priority as Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation is to drive creation of high-quality and sustainable employment across Ireland, including in County Meath.  We are making significant progress towards achieving our regional development targets, which include an increase of between 30% and 40% in foreign direct investment in the mid-east region, which incorporates counties Meath, Kildare and Wicklow.  There are 56 multinational companies based in this region, 17 of which are located in Meath and employ 1,496 staff.  IDA Ireland is committed to increasing investment in County Meath by ensuring there is an adequate supply of modern property solutions and supporting the development of the county&rsquo;s foreign direct investment base.  The agency is encouraging its client base in the county to undertake further investment projects.  IDA Ireland will continue to work\u00a0with local authorities and other relevant agencies to support the development of further quality infrastructure in County Meath.  The Deputy will appreciate that my focus and that of the IDA must remain on how best to attract investment and jobs to the county.  The IDA Ireland property in Navan is potentially attractive to investors.  The agency continues to promote the site to its clients.  Nevertheless, I have brought the Deputy's request to the attention of the agency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051600030#CC00600","speaker":"1247"},{"type":"speech","time":1494954600,"counter":365,"content":"<p>The area in question has grown exponentially since the era when the Minister lived nearby.  Approximately 10,000 people are now living in 3,000 homes in this pocket of Navan.  As a growing town, Navan needs substantial attention when it comes to jobs, especially considering that one of the main employers in the area, Tara Mines, is in a precarious position because it is involved in the extraction of zinc, which is a finite resource.  There were no IDA Ireland site visits to County Meath in the first quarter of this year.  There were just eight such visits in all of last year.  This pales into insignificance by comparison with our neighbours in County Westmeath, where there were 36 such visits, and in County Louth, where there were 24 such visits.  The Minister spoke about investment in County Meath.  The strategy in the county must stretch beyond securing back-office facilities for Facebook in Clonee.  We need to see investment in the heart of our county.  We need to ensure there are quality jobs in the areas where people are being housed under the national planning framework strategy.<\/p>  <p>  One of these questions relates to social facilities.  I have asked the Minister to ensure her Department liaises with Meath County Council in this regard.  I do not want to confuse the two issues.  Two questions I tabled separately have been grouped.  There is scope within the IDA Ireland business park in Johnstown for the release of some of the land that adjoins a residential area in which there are 3,000 homes.  This would facilitate the development of football fields and social amenities.  My colleague on Meath County Council, Councillor Tommy Reilly, has raised this issue and has been working diligently with the council's enterprise section and with IDA Ireland.  I ask the Minister to work with her Department and IDA Ireland to help Johnstown Football Club, which was founded in 2004, to extend its facilities.  The only open lands that are available in this part of Navan are the excess lands in the IDA Ireland park.  I ask the Minister to help those involved with the football club to realise their dream of providing additional facilities for young people in the locality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051600030#CC00700","speaker":"1218"},{"type":"speech","time":1494954600,"counter":366,"content":"<p>I am aware that there are 3,000 homes in this part of Navan.

The successes at the IDA Ireland park in the town include Generali PanEurope, Timoney Technology, Welch Allyn and Lir Chocolates.  Last Christmas, the Meath County Council's director of economic services, Kevin Stewart, submitted a planning application on behalf of Meath Enterprise Board, on which I formerly sat.  This application would allow for the construction of an advanced technology building of 2,500 sq. m on the land in question.  It has been specifically pitched to provide for the development of a purpose-built facility for new startups and companies that are looking at the potential of Navan.  I would like to discuss the Navan economic plan with the Minister so that we can consider where Navan is going.  I ask her to place a renewed focus on the proactive measures that are being proposed by the council's economics section, particularly the lodging of a planning application for a building of 2,500 sq. m to supplement what is already happening in companies like Generali PanEurope and Welch Allyn.  I am also calling on her not to rule out what I have suggested on the social amenity side.  There are 3,000 people living in this part of Navan.

The draft legislation was referred to the Office of the Attorney General on 4 May for priority drafting of a Bill.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding zero-hour contracts, the intention of the proposals is to avoid the contagion of an increase in these practices in this jurisdiction.  The proposals provide that an employer will no longer be able to engage an employee on a contract within the meaning of section 18 (1)(a) or 18(1)(c) of the Organisation of Working Time Act where the stated contracted hours are zero unless it is genuinely casual, emergency cover or short-term relief work.<\/p>  <p>  Other employees, including those with uncertain hours and those on if-and-when contracts, will benefit from the following proposals: ensuring that employees are better informed about their employment arrangements and especially their core terms shortly after commencing work; strengthening the provisions around minimum payments to low-paid workers who may be called into work for a period but not provided with that work; providing that workers on low-hour contracts, who consistently work more hours each week than provided for in their contracts of employment, are entitled to be placed in a band of hours that reflects the reality of the hours they have worked over a reference period; and reinforcing the anti-victimisation provisions for employees who try to invoke a right under these proposals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051600031#DD00100","speaker":"1272"},{"type":"speech","time":1494955200,"counter":377,"content":"<p>The formulation of the Government's approach to the ending of zero-hour contracts will be very important.  Clearly, across a wide range of sectors of our economy, especially in the retail, hospitality and caring sectors, we have seen what the Mandate trade union has called the gross exploitation of workers.  In the next period in which the legislation is being drafted, it is critical the Minister of State is prepared to stand up to organisations such as IBEC which have spoken out against the imposing of what they call onerous restrictions.  We would be counting on Ministers, including the Ministers of State, Deputies Halligan and Deputy Finian McGrath, to stiffen their resolve in that regard.  The Citizens Information Board reported that 7% of its 1 million queries annually relate to employment and specifically to zero-hour and if-and-when contracts, which are contracts without any contractual obligations to give hours.

The four areas that will be covered in the legislation are the four the Deputy outlined.

There are 15 items listed but the employer does not have to provide those details until two months after the employment has commenced.  It will not be onerous on an employer to provide information on the main areas that will be covered.  An employee is entitled to know that information.

While the data for the first four months of 2017 indicates a decline of over 9% compared with the same period last year, registrations remain above the levels in 2015 and immediately preceding years.<\/p><p>Data from the Central Statistics Office, CSO, also indicates an increase in imported vehicles being registered, in part reflecting the weakening of sterling and consumers seeking value for money.<\/p> <p> The outlook for consumer spend remains positive.  According to data provided by the Department of Finance, personal consumption expenditure is growing and consumer sentiment in March was higher than it was in February.  Headline retail sales are up and the total number of private cars has increased over the year.  Overall, consumer spending, employment trends and taxation receipts confirm that Ireland's economic fundamentals remain solid.  This positive outlook should continue to benefit the motor sector in its recovery to a sustainable level.  Additionally, my Department is undertaking extensive preparatory work and consultation to anticipate the impact of Brexit on key sectors, including the retail sector.  As chair of the committee for responding to Brexit in my Department, I will continue to ensure we address the challenges and, of course, the opportunities arising from Brexit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051600031#DD00900","speaker":"1247","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1494955800,"counter":386,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for her response but there are growing concerns.

The annual budget for 2017 amounts to &euro;162.5 million.  Science Foundation Ireland's legal remit was extended in 2013 to allow it to fund applied research in line with the Government&rsquo;s policy of research prioritisation, which was adopted in 2012.  This broad remit enables Science Foundation Ireland to support an important range of work from early stage investigations, novel discoveries through to pre-commercial activities.  The adoption of research priority areas has not affected\u00a0the level of funding by Science Foundation Ireland as over 80% of funding is currently committed to oriented basic research projects.<\/p>  <p>  My Department and its agencies are important funders of research, with spending on research and development\u00a0of &euro;394 million in 2016.  I am conscious of the time allowed to answer the question and I will speak later about the three specific areas, which are oriented, applied and frontier research.  Frontier research is beyond the frontiers of what is called \"current understanding\".  The criteria for funding frontier research is typically excellence alone, with no requirement for alignment with particular themes or priorities.  The Irish Research Council, IRC, makes competitive awards on the basis of excellence only.  Its budget for 2017 is &euro;34.15 million, including &euro;2.5 million for new frontier research laureate awards.<\/p>  <p>  The original remit of Science Foundation Ireland in 2003 was to promote, develop and assist oriented and basic research.

I know the academic community at the time were also concerned about the shift in emphasis.  There was also the issue that for the first time, research priorities were being directed by the Ministers, as opposed to allowing academics to decide.  Undoubtedly, commercial activity is needed along with frontier research but the view in the academic community and those involved with high-end research, certainly at an academic level, would be that the shift was a bridge too far.  It is the equivalent of Isaac Newton in the orchard, when he watched the apple fall, being told to go back to study cider fermentation instead of discovering gravity.

I am very grateful to the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this issue.<\/p>  <p>  It is an issue that affects families in County Meath to an extraordinary degree.  I have been contacted by parents who cannot get occupational therapy for their children because there is only one occupational therapist, OT, covering County Meath and the town of Kingscourt in County Cavan for children aged between 0 and 18.  That person works 17.5 hours per week.  As of last week there are 350 children waiting to be seen in County Meath and that one part-time OT has to deal with all of them.  A child in County Meath has to wait four and a half years for an assessment.  That is what the staff tell us.  That is coming straight from the horse's mouth.  There are other OTs who work in Enable Ireland and the child and adolescent mental health service, CAMHS, to address the needs of children with diagnosed disabilities, including physical disabilities and autism but primary care is the first point of contact for children so most people coming to the primary care OT have no diagnosis and wait four and a half years for that.<\/p>  <p>  Some OTs left the service in County Meath this year and there has been no word of their replacement.  There was a long period when there was no manager to advocate for the service within the Health Service Executive.  The OT in County Meath organised meetings of parents because she was so concerned at the situation she and the parents were facing and asked the parents to contact their local politicians such was the gravity of the situation.  I have never before seen a public servant gather people together and ask them to advocate for a service.  That is the job of the Minister of State and of HSE management, not that of the OT on the ground.  It is shameful that children must wait four and a half years for an assessment.  It is extremely worrying for parents because they know and hear from others who have gone through the worry and trauma of requiring these services that the early years are when children are diagnosed and their needs are assessed.  This needs to be addressed urgently.  There are parts of Dublin where there is no problem whatsoever but children in my county have to wait almost five years to be assessed for occupational therapy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051600033#FF00300","speaker":"1225"},{"type":"speech","time":1494956400,"counter":399,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Byrne for raising this very important issue about Meath.  The HSE has advised that the Meath occupational therapy service is delivered across three divisions: primary care consisting of adult services, including palliative care and children services; social care consisting of the adult disability team, a six to 18 school aged team and older persons and acute care services delivered at Our Lady's Hospital in Navan.<\/p>  <p>  The paediatric service provides an assessment of and services to children up to age 18 years, for whom typical presenting needs relate to, amongst other things, developmental coordination disorder, also known as dyspraxia, sensory processing difficulties, chronic pain and orthopaedic conditions.  There is an open referral system in that referrals are accepted from general practitioners, parents, schools and other multidisciplinary team colleagues.  I am advised that there are two priority levels in children primary care services and the longest waiting time under priority one is three months and 61 weeks under priority two.  The HSE has informed me that there are staffing related matters affecting the delivery of occupational therapy services in County Meath.  The complement for Meath occupational therapy services, which include adult and paediatric services, is 8.1 whole-time equivalents.  However, the complement delivering services is 6.1 whole-time equivalents; this is due to a number of factors including maternity leave, sick leave and recent resignations.  I understand from the HSE that one of the current vacancies has been approved for backfill and the position is going through the recruitment process.<\/p>  <p>  A business case for the backfill of the other vacancy as well as four new additional positions for paediatric services awaits approval.  Notwithstanding the change in the staffing complement in County Meath, the HSE assures that the services continue to be prioritised based on clinical need.  I am aware that assessment and treatment waiting times in all community healthcare organisation, CHO, areas are dependent on identified need and the capacity and demands on the occupational therapy service in the particular area.  In many areas, treatment intervention is completed on assessment and therefore there is no time delay once a client is assessed.  Following the screening of referrals, a client's needs are prioritised by a standard prioritisation system.  I do appreciate the Deputy's concerns that accessing services can be very difficult for the families and children affected and the need for additional therapy posts is highlighted in A Programme for a Partnership Government.  The HSE has established a national therapy service review group to address therapy waiting times, including those for access to occupational therapies.  This joint primary care and social care project will include a detailed analysis of waiting times and resource deployment across the country.  I will seek to make the services more responsive to people's needs and also seek to put in place a standardised approach to the delivery of occupational therapy services across the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051600033#FF00400","speaker":"1359"},{"type":"speech","time":1494956400,"counter":400,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response but it is not sufficient.  His waiting list figures are wrong.  The person who spoke to me pointed out that a part-time OT has a responsibility to see eight new cases per month.  There are 350 children waiting to be seen.  Simple mathematics shows that it takes four and a half years for a child on that list to be seen.  The Minister of State says there is a recruitment process to fill one vacancy, which is welcome but I plead with him to speed it up.  I find it deeply offensive that a business case must be made to fill another vacancy.  These are not extra posts.  It is not the case that there is an increase in population requiring extra posts.  These are existing jobs that people have left recently.  Someone must make a business case so that our children receive the therapies they need.  It is scandalous if the HSE thinks a business case has to be made to replace OTs.  If the Minister of State is standing over that I suggest he goes back to the HSE and tells it to fill that vacancy as soon as possible.  There is a business case because the position was there until early this year.  The idea that when someone leaves a job the case to keep that position has to be made while children have to wait four and a half years for occupational therapy services is scandalous, outrageous and unacceptable.

I know that he wants to run away from discussing the Garda Commissioner, but his remarks were childish.  He was aided by his deputy leader, my colleague, Deputy Jackie Cahill.  If he wants to take the stabilisers off the Deputy and let him come out and play, he should do so because it was one of the most childish things I had seen in my time in politics.<\/p>  <p>  We met the workers in Littleton.  Until today, the five Deputies involved were playing a very good game and trying to ensure we achieved the best outcome for the workers.  We had worked together and met the Minister.  I have spoken to the CEO of Bord na M&oacute;na.  We have tried to work out the best way forward for the workers who have seen significant restructuring in the past few years which has affected 122 people, between full-time and part-time workers. <\/p>  <p>  When we met the Minister last Friday week, it was quite an emotional meeting because some of the workers' grandparents had worked in the factory which goes back generations and it is not just about the work.  It is also about minding the bog and ensuring production levels are maintained.  It is a way of life.  The decision of Bord na M&oacute;na, with which we disagree, has been made and e have been told it will not be changed under any circumstances.  However, we need to fight to try to get the best deal for the workers. <\/p>  <p>  There are four issues, the first of which is the peat which remains, how it can be used and whether there is capacity for it to be used for export purposes, in particular, in order to maintain and, it is to be hoped, generate some employment into the future.  It is a distinct possibility with markets looking for peat. <\/p>  <p>  Second and most important, we need to secure an extension of the closure date.  April 2018 is far too soon.  We need at least two more seasons in order to ensure the peat can be used and the workers will have a fair length of time to plan their exit and futures.  We also believe there is a demand for their produce.  There is a dividend payment of &euro;10 million a year from Bord na M&oacute;na.  Surely it could be used to facilitate the extension of time required for the workers.<\/p>  <p>  Third, we need to renegotiate the redundancy package because the one in place is awful.  To be frank, if somebody has worked at the plant for 30 or 35 years, he or she is being penalised.  The longer someone has worked there, the worse off he or she will be by comparison.  Therefore, we need to get a better deal for the workers.<\/p>  <p>  Fourth, we need to have hope for the infrastructure and plant in place.  The connection to the grid is nearby and facilities are in place.  What incubation or other services could we plan for if we were to secure an extension of the closure date to ensure there will be some employment on the site?  I am not referring solely to harvesting and exporting the peat but to other renewable energy sources that could be developed in the area, given the infrastructure in place and scale of the facility.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051600034#GG00400","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speech","time":1494957000,"counter":407,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this very important issue and supporting the rights of the workers in the Littleton Bord na M&oacute;na plant.  I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Denis Naughten, who apologises that he cannot be present to take it.<\/p>  <p>  Bord na M&oacute;na is a commercial State company operating in accordance with the Turf Development Acts 1946 to 1998.  While operational matters such as this are the responsibility of the board and management team and not matters in which the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment has any direct role or function, the Government is nonetheless conscious of the impact the recent decision has had on the employees of Bord na M&oacute;na.  It is facing significant business challenges in the context of the deregulation of the electricity market and an increasingly competitive and challenging environment across all of its business areas, not least its fuels business.  Its fuels business in general, including the briquette business, has been operating in recent years at a level significantly below existing capacity.  The fall in sales is driven by a range of factors, including increased competition, consumer trends, carbon tax, mild weather and low oil prices.<\/p>  <p>  Arising from the reduced demand and in line with the normal process of the ongoing review of each sector at Bord na M&oacute;na, the fuels business undertook a comprehensive review of current briquetting operations, with the intention of identifying a solution to sustain the business and jobs in the long term.  The review concluded that in order to sustain the business into the future, the Derrinlough factory, employing 61 people, would be the optimum location for future investment to secure the future of the fuels business.  The report also concluded that the company's facility at Littleton should continue production for the coming season and should permanently cease production in April 2018.  There are 69 permanent employees at this facility.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that, having received the review conclusions, the company has begun a process of engagement with the group of unions and employees.  It has confirmed that no redundancies in this area are being contemplated in the current year.  While the Minister has no direct role in the matter, he has held a series of meetings with affected stakeholders.  He has called for engagement and imagination from all sides - I accept many of the points raised by Deputy Alan Kelly - in order to come up with a range of solutions for the employees.  He has urged Bord na M&oacute;na to consider all opportunities for redeployment, a phased reduction in employment numbers and any other renewable technology opportunities which may arise in respect of its investments.<\/p>  <p>  As part of Bord na M&oacute;na's general strategy to move towards sustainable businesses based on renewable energy sources, pilot trials for the production of a biomass briquette have been conducted.  The development of the biomass briquette represents a significant investment by the company which has confirmed its intention to begin large-scale production of the product.  This will be a critical step in future-proofing the fuels business as it offers the potential of sustainable and quality regional employment.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Minister will bring a memo to the Government to establish a new entity, BioEnergy Ireland, focusing on the development of the biomass sector in Ireland.  It will assist farmers in establishing a new source of income and secure existing regional employment levels by transitioning staff away from milling peat to harvesting biomass in a fair way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051600034#GG00500","speaker":"1359"},{"type":"speech","time":1494957600,"counter":408,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his efforts in reading that out.

It is unacceptable that a senior representative of the company at board or management level was not there on the day of the closure of an industry which has been in place for multiple generations.

We need an extension of time.  This has been a bolt from the blue for the workers and an extension will give them time to format their lives and plan.  We need a plan for the resource and plant that is left in place.  The peat that is left there needs to be exported which would save some jobs and create others.  As somebody who supports workers, I note finally that the redundancy package is unfair.  I do not know how it was negotiated in the first place.  The workers with the longest time served will, on average, do worse, which is incredible.  I know the Minister will have to talk to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform about that and I ask the Minister of State to ask him to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051600035#HH00100","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speech","time":1494957600,"counter":409,"content":"<p>I would not like to get into a scrap between Deputies Alan Kelly and Miche&aacute;l Martin, so I will stay out of that aspect of the debate.

We have had this discussion several times already.  On 1 March, the Minister advised me that one of the primary schools in Swords was undersubscribed, if not to the extent that it would be able to absorb the excess capacity, although he failed to mention that it was a boys-only school and, therefore, not in a position to deal with the full waiting list.  The Minister said he would monitor the situation as the schools completed their enrolment process in the coming weeks.  That was ten weeks ago.  While I hate to say it given the fact that the children have not even had their summer holidays, we are quickly approaching September.  Some two or three weeks ago, I spoke with a number of parents with children in the Holy Family national school at the moment whose siblings are waiting to attend.  They have been in touch with me since to say they still have no clarity.  It appears that the Minister is waiting for this situation to somehow magically resolve itself, but it is not going to.  There is a need for action on the part of the Minister and the Department to deal with this on a proactive basis.  It is not a case that will sort itself out once the waiting lists are cleared because there are children who are going to be left without places.  The last time we discussed this, I asked the Minister if he would consider emergency or temporary measures.  I also asked him to consider doing everything possible.  I want to hear from him this evening what will be done because these people will be back onto my office as well as to those of the other Members representing the area.<\/p>  <p>  This is a very serious issue in particular for those people whose children are already in the school with siblings waiting to attend.  It is also very serious for those children born in November and December.  They are not eligible for an additional year of the ECCE scheme and, as such, cannot go back to cr&egrave;che.  Their parents face having to return them to and pay for cr&egrave;che facilities.  At least one mother maintains it will probably not be worth her while to work given that she will have to pay over so much money.  It is unfair to leave families waiting in limbo.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister will not dispute that we have a growing population as evidenced by the census.  While it is clear we need something done in the short term, there is a real need in Swords to increase school capacity in the long term.  This is not a case of parents saying they only want their children to go to the local school.  If the Minister has ever been in Swords in the morning, he will know that it is not possible for these parents to drop one sibling to the Holy Family and to then make it in any reasonable time to another part of Swords to drop another child off at a different school.  It is also not reasonable to expect siblings to go to separate schools.  All these parents want is to be able to educate sibling children in the school that is closest to their homes and rooted in the community where their children play sports and are growing up among their friends.  While it is a long time since I had to think about these issues, that is all I wanted as a parent myself.  It is what most parents want.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051600035#HH00400","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speech","time":1494957600,"counter":412,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Louise O'Reilly for raising this issue again and I understand the concern.  There are 11 schools in the Swords area which enrol junior infants and they run across the spectrum from Catholic schools, one Gaelscoil, Educate Together and a Church of Ireland school.  The basic problem here is that the Holy Family junior national school is maxed out and cannot take in additional junior infants at this point.  It is already full and its senior school, which would also have to take any increased enrolment, is on a very constrained site.  As such, expanding capacity at the Holy Family junior national school is not an option.<\/p>  <p>  There are 760 children who are due to be taken into junior infants across the 11 schools in Swords.  I am told that two schools currently have junior infant places available.  St. Cronin's, which has the largest number of available places, is a mixed school, not an all-boys school.  The schools have also expressed a willingness to offer further junior infant places for September 2017 if necessary.  As such, there is capacity available to meet the need.  The Department is very much aware of the position in the Holy Family school, which has 26 mainstream teachers and an enrolment of 680 pupils.  We have been liaising across the various schools to check their waiting lists.  As the Deputy knows, there is multiple enrolment on waiting lists, which makes it difficult to identify exactly what is the need.<\/p><p>The underlying difficulty outlined by Deputy O'Reilly is that parents want their children to go to the nearest school and I can understand entirely why this is the case, but the Department has to operate on the basis not just of the local school but groups of schools.  We have to plan across planning areas and in this case we are doing so.<\/p> <p> The Department remains of the belief there is sufficient capacity there, but has recognised schools that could expand to meet that need in September should that be necessary.  That is the current position.  I fully recognise this is a very rapidly growing area and there is no doubt that based on demographics we will be looking at the need for additional schools in Swords and in fairly short order.  I am sure that is the case.  For this coming September, the Department remains of the view that between the existing schools, which either have existing capacity to provide or can do so without constraining a site, which is the difficulty in Holy Family junior national school, they can take on extra junior infant children on a sustainable basis and are able to see them right through the school.  There are schools available to do that.  I can understand the difficulty when a parent wants a child to go to a particular school, or a child has a sibling in a particular school.  That is the position as of now and the Department is very closely monitoring the situation.  Expanding the capacity in Holy Family junior national school is just not an option available of to us, as I am informed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051600035#HH00500","speaker":"1293","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1494958200,"counter":414,"content":"<p>I do not think the Minister has looked at the capacity in Holy Family junior national school in any meaningful way.  I ask that he speak to his officials and advise them to liaise directly with the board of management of the school and engage with the parents.  I would not ask the Minister to take my word for it.  There are 27 children on the waiting list out of 107 who have siblings in the school already.  It is not possible for these children to be dropped in the morning and for their parents then to head out into the traffic in Swords, which is really problematic first thing in the morning.  It is not possible for these parents to get to the other school on time without leaving the sibling in Holy Family junior national school too early.  This is further complicated for parents who are trying to get to work, again trying to make their way through the traffic.  There is a problem.  The Minister has told me he will monitor it, but I have not heard anything from him with regard to the solution.  I ask that the Minister and his officials meet the board of management to discuss with it every and any option that might be available, and meet directly with the parents so they can explain their concerns.  I have met these people.  They are very ordinary people.  They are not people who would seek something outrageous from the Department of Education and Skills.  They are telling me, and I am telling the Minister, it is not possible for them to be able to drop their children in the morning and then make it to another school.  If a child has a sibling in a school already it creates its own problems.  They do not want anything other than the capacity to be able to have their children educated in their community, where they play sports and live, where their friends are and where their siblings go to school.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051600036#JJ00200","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speech","time":1494958200,"counter":415,"content":"<p>I asked directly this question of my officials, in other words whether Holy Family junior national school can be expanded, and they answered directly it is maxed out in terms of the existing accommodation, permanent and temporary, and the current devolved grant development is to replace existing prefab accommodation.  That will leave the site constricted.  Also, any development of the junior national school has implications for the senior national school.  All pupils from the junior national school progress to the senior national school.  The site of the senior national school has no capacity for further development, hence the need to control the junior infant intake.  In other words, it is not sustainable, as the Deputy is suggesting, to expand the school.  That is not a sustainable solution.  This is the advice of the Department.  I understand the patron has advised the junior national school can accommodate the pupils on the waiting list in September 2018.  As I said, other schools in the catchment have the capacity to meet the demand and can expand this capacity if necessary.  This is the position.  Obviously when a site such as this is maxed out and there is a growing need we need to look at the need for an additional school.  I have no doubt that will be on the agenda very shortly in the Swords area.  The advice to me is very clear that the capacity is not there to expand the school the Deputy wants to have expanded.  We have to have other offerings made to accommodate those families.  That is what the Department is doing.  If I had a solution to this I would offer it.  We are not trying to be obtuse.  I will certainly convey the concerns, which I know other Deputies have raised in the House.  I know it is a genuine concern the Deputy is raising.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051600036#JJ00300","speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Passport Applications","time":1494958200,"counter":416,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051600036#JJ00350"},{"type":"speech","time":1494958200,"counter":417,"content":"<p>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this Topical Issue.  I also thank the Minister and I am pleased to see him in attendance.  I compliment his Department and officials in terms of my dealings with them on many matters.<\/p>  <p>  We may have express buses and express trains but we certainly do not have an express passport application process in the Department.  It is a huge concern not only to my constituents but to all throughout the country who are represented in the House, so much so that since the Topical Issue was tabled today four Deputies have asked me to raise specific issues, which I will do later.<\/p>  <p>  The current delay is unacceptable in the turnaround times for the issuing of passports applied for through the passport express system operated by An Post.  Until last month, people were still being told by their local post offices that the turnaround time was ten working days.  I have seen cases where the turnaround time extended to up to four weeks, double what people were told.  I will give the example of a mother of a child with special needs, who spent more than &euro;1,500 on a holiday for herself and the child.  Her passport was out of date so she applied on 11 April through passport express.  She thought she was doing the right thing because she read the small print, which stated the renewal of the passport would be expedited within ten working days.  Instead, she received her passport on 9 May and missed her holiday, which was due to commence on 7 May.  The travel agency would not even cover the loss because of the passport not issuing.  This week, I heard of another case of a four week wait for a passport express application.<\/p>  <p>  I also want to bring to the attention of the Minister a big problem with passport express applications, whereby people who experience delays and have imminent travel arrangements cannot get any joy when they apply for an urgent appointment as they are told that because they applied through passport express the application cannot be retrieved and, therefore, expedited in any way.  This is something that needs to be looked at and changed.  Today the Department's website states the turnaround time for a passport express application is 16 working days.  For the new online application system the turnaround time is ten working days.  This is another issue with which I have problem.  There should not be any priority given to online applications over passport express.  Most of my constituents, particularly those in rural areas, do not have adequate broadband to access the online system, but this is a Topical Issue for another day.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware the Passport Office has hired more staff to deal with the influx of applications due to Brexit.  Anyone who has a parent or grandparent born in Ireland is entitled to a passport.  Surely people applying for an Irish passport for citizenship reasons should be on a different track, especially where there is no urgent need.  Latest figures from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade show applications from the UK increased by 74% in January compared with the same time last year, and that in January this year more than 7,000 people from Northern Ireland applied for an Irish passport, which is an increase of 3,973 from the number in the same month last year.  With these types of figures and the inordinate delays being experienced, the Minister has obviously not hired enough staff and he needs to look at this.<\/p>  <p>  I have also brought to the attention of the Minister the need for a satellite passport office in Dundalk or another Border town to deal with the increase in applications from Northern Ireland and the UK.  Exactly one year ago this week, I raised this issue with the Minister in a Topical Issue debate in the context of the European football finals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051600036#JJ00400","speaker":"1332"}]
