The Office for Internet Safety (OIS) was established in my Department in 2008. As a small unit, it aims to build linkages and cohesion between relevant Departments and agencies to promote internet safety, particularly in relation to combating child pornography.  A dedicated website provides information primarily aimed at parents as well as links to a variety of other resources on internet safety.  In addition, the unit provides a series of information booklets on internet safety which are made available on the website and also in hard copy. <\/p><p>An Internet Safety Advisory Committee (ISAC) advises the OIS and includes representatives from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, academia, relevant non-government organisations, the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner as well as industry etc.  At a European level, the website www.betterinternetforkids.eu gathers and makes available best practice examples, including some from Ireland, on safer internet for children and makes them available in a variety of languages. <\/p><p>The EU Safer Internet Programme for Ireland operates through my Department, channelling EU funding to four partner bodies: <\/p><p>- Webwise in Professional Development Service for Teachers Technology in Education (a part of the Department of Education and Skills) - this programme raises awareness of online safety issues and promotes good practice among students, their parents and teachers. <\/p><p>- Childline  - a helpline and other services for children and operated by the ISPCC.  <\/p><p>- the National Parents Council (Primary) which operates a helpline and provides training for parents and <\/p><p>- Hotline.ie which deals with reports of illegal content on the internet in Ireland.<\/p><p>My Department also keeps the criminal law up to date in this area as required. For example, the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017, has addressed criminal law aspects of the Law Reform Commission&rsquo;s Report on Harmful Communications and Digital Safety, including a number of measures to significantly strengthen existing criminal law in combating child exploitation - in particular to address the use of modern communication technologies as a tool which may lead to child sexual exploitation.<\/p><p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has an arrangement in place with a large internet service provider to block access to child sexual abuse content in accordance with a list they provide. Among the aims of this initiative is to reduce inadvertent viewing by members of the public, including children, of this illegal and\/or harmful material.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also has a Schools Programme where personal safety issues, including online safety, are highlighted and discussed with children and young people in schools.<\/p><p>Finally, my Department works with other relevant Government Departments in this area.

Any such proposal could give rise to very large, unpredictable and potentially very costly impacts across the full range of public and social services, particularly as  there may well be significant implications for the operation of the Common Travel Area, in the context of Britain withdrawing from the European Union.  Any proposal in this regard would have to be very carefully considered.<\/p><p>In addition, at the European level, Ireland together with the other Member States of the European Union has committed under the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum agreed at the European Council in October 2008 &quot;to use only case-by-case regularisation, rather than generalised regularisation, under national law, for humanitarian or economic reasons&quot;.  While the Pact is not legally binding, the political commitment among Member States, then and now, is clearly against any form of process that would in any way legitimise the status of those unlawfully present without first examining the merits of their individual cases.<\/p><p>Ireland operates a very open immigration policy with many legal pathways open to non-EEA nationals to legally enter and reside in the State.

It is important to stress that the study examined the situation of both those who had no immigration permission to be in the State and those who were working in breach of an immigration permission which might exclude or limit their access to the labour market.  The ESRI concluded that there was no reliable data on the numbers of persons undocumented or illegally employed in Ireland.  They did, however, identify certain characteristics of this group and concluded that the areas at high risk of illegal employment and being undocumented, include; the catering sector (such as takeaway, fast food and ethnic restaurants) and those  working in the private home involved in child and elder care.  The report also points to the enforcement work of the Workplace Relations Commission and the Garda National Immigration Bureau with particular focus on employers who engage in employing and potentially exploiting illegal workers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200079#WRA03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Commercial Rates","counter":47,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200079#WRA03050"},{"type":"question","counter":48,"qnumday":43,"qnumall":"[33016\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200079#WRA03100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"his plans to introduce new legislation regarding commercial rates valuations; and when this bill will be enacted.","asker":"1250","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":49,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, there is a distinct separation of function between the valuation of rateable property, which is the responsibility of the Commissioner of Valuation, and the setting and collection of commercial rates, which is a product of the valuation set by the Commissioner, multiplied by the Annual Rate on Valuation (ARV) decided annually by the elected members of each local authority. The Commissioner of Valuation is currently under the aegis of my Department but operates independently in carrying out his statutory functions under the Valuation Acts 2001 to 2015 and my Department has no role in this regard. <\/p>  <p>  It is worth noting that the annual setting of the ARV is a reserved function of the elected members of each Local Authority and neither the Commissioner of Valuation nor central Government have any function in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  In so far as legislation relating to the valuation of properties for rating purposes is concerned, there is a modern, up to date code of legislation in place. The entire body of Valuation Acts dating from the 19th  Century was repealed, modernised and consolidated when the Valuation Act 2001 came into force on 2 May 2002. A number of improvements to the 2001 Act mainly in relation to accelerating the National Revaluation Programme were introduced by the Valuation (Amendment) Act 2015 which was commenced on 8 June 2015.

I understand, however, that the legislative basis for the levying of rates is spread over a number of enactments, some dating back to the 19th  Century. Many of the provisions are outdated and not suited to current business practise.  I am advised that the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government has developed legislative proposals to modernise and consolidate the legislation governing commercial rates and the Government recently approved the drafting of a Rates Bill in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200079#WRA03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Data","counter":50,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200079#WRA03250"},{"type":"question","counter":51,"qnumday":44,"qnumall":"[32854\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200079#WRA03300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of garda&iacute; in each Garda station in County Kerry as of 30 June 2017; and the number of new recruits assigned to the division since recruitment resumed in 2014.","asker":"1321","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":52,"content":"<p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.

Those resolutions require the Tribunal to report to the Clerk of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann with its findings and recommendations.  Therefore, I do not propose to say or do anything which could be interpreted as impinging on its independence.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, I would also remind the House that the sole member, Mr Justice Peter Charleton, has indicated that the Tribunal has issued orders for the discovery of documents and other records.  In those circumstances, it is incumbent on anyone who is a party before the Tribunal to cooperate fully with it.<\/p>  <p>  The Garda Commissioner has statutory responsibility to carry on and manage and control generally the administration and business of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Accordingly, the putting in place of internal structures to service the Tribunal is a matter for the Commissioner and I, as Minister, have no direct role in the matter. Similarly, the selection of personnel to support those structures is a matter for the Commissioner. I do not believe that it would be proper for me as Minister to prescribe the approach which is taken by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na towards the Tribunal.  I would be open to criticism if I were to seek to influence how An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na fulfil their duties to the Tribunal.  On this point, I would say that matters relating to representation before the Tribunal will ultimately be decided by the Tribunal itself. In light of these factors it would not be appropriate to comment on the arrangements which have been made by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or, indeed, any other parties in relation to their engagement with the Tribunal.<\/p>  <p>  On a general note I would like to reiterate that the Government has, rightly, been anxious to ensure that the Disclosures Tribunal receives the greatest degree of assistance possible from all parties, not least An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It has been supportive of the Commissioner in ensuring that she has the resources at her disposal to service the Tribunal in a timely and effective manner, so that it in turn may proceed with and complete its work without delay.  I am advised that the services of two former members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (a former Chief Superintendent and a former Assistant Commissioner) have been engaged for a period of six months to 31 August 2017.  My Department was not consulted nor should it have been in relation to the selection of the particular individuals concerned. <\/p>  <p>  The work of the two retired members supports the Disclosure Tribunal Co-Ordination Office based in Garda Headquarters which is staffed by one full-time member, seconded temporarily from the Office of Corporate Communications.  A number of additional personnel are facilitating the work of this office on an ad hoc basis as requirements dictate.  I am further informed that liaison persons have been nominated from relevant sections\/Regions to deal with specific requests from the Tribunal.<\/p>  <p>  It should be understood that the provision of these additional resources is to ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as an organisation is able to cooperate with the Tribunal to the fullest extent, without unduly affecting the ability of the organisation to continue to carry out its normal vital work.  That said, there is nothing in the arrangements put in place by the Commissioner to prevent, nor could they, the right of any individual member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to make any representations they see fit, relevant to its terms of reference, to the Tribunal.  <\/p>  <p>  Finally, as the Deputy will be aware, the Tribunal has commenced public hearings and I repeat that it is important that everyone should allow the Tribunal to get on, unimpeded, with the very important work with which it has been tasked.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200079#WRA03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Funding","counter":56,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200079#WRA03650"},{"type":"question","counter":57,"qnumday":46,"qnumall":"[32975\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200079#WRA03700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"his views on the funding of a second sexual abuse and violence in Ireland report.","asker":"1434","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":58,"content":"<p>A second Sexual Assault and Violence in Ireland study (SAVI 2) would show the prevalence of and attitudes to sexual violence and elucidate how the experience has changed since SAVI 1. The overall cost of a report is likely to be in the order of &euro;1 million over three years. A formal proposal submitted by the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre recognised that, given the significant budget, funding would be divided between four Departments - the Departments of Justice and Equality, Children and Youth Affairs, Education and Skills, and Health. My predecessor wrote to the relevant Ministers on this matter and expressed her support for the project. The responses received make the viability of funding the project, as proposed, unlikely.<\/p>  <p>  However, my Department continues to investigate the financial feasibility, resource implications and approaches to identifying a ring-fenced funding stream for undertaking a SAVI 2 study and to explore obligations with regard to requisite public procurement arrangements. While I strongly recognise the value of further research in this area, I am sure the Deputy will accept that the right balance must be struck between the funding of front-line services and funding research.  I will, however, continue to pursue this matter. <\/p>  <p>  In the meantime, there are other sources of statistics that can be accessed. The European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) 2014 pan-European survey report on violence against women provides details of the prevalence of sexual violence by a partner or non-partner experienced by those women surveyed who are resident in Ireland. This data source has the advantage of providing the possibility of data comparisons with each of the other 27 member states of the EU. Discussions have begun at a Eurostat level to explore the possibility of some form of replication of the FRA survey. There is also the June 2016 pan-European Eurobarometer survey on perceptions, attitudes and awareness of gender-based violence. Figures on sexual violence in Ireland are also available from the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre, the Rape Crisis Network Ireland, the Central Statistics Office \/ An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Courts Service and Sexual Assault Treatment Units.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Central Statistics Office are to explore the feasibility of including a module on sexual violence in its next roll-out of its crime and victimisation survey.

Persons seeking the assistance of the Inspector in their area may contact their Inspector to arrange to meet with them either formally or informally.It is also possible for a person to ask a local family support worker or drugs worker to contact the Garda Inspector for their area or ask the National Family Support Network to contact the relevant Inspector. If anyone experiences difficulty contacting the relevant Garda Inspector they can contact the Project Office at the Garda National Drugs Unit. The contact details for the nominated Garda Inspectors are available on the Garda website.<\/p><p>In dealing with any complaint of drug related intimidation or advice sought in relation to this issue the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na do so with the utmost safety and effective means in order to afford the person or family subject to the threat of the best level of security, advice and support which can be offered.  Most importantly the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will deal with this issue in the utmost confidential and secure fashion. <\/p><p>At the heart of the concerns expressed by the Deputy, is the relationship between communities and their local Garda&iacute;. It is worth recalling that the Programme for a Partnership Government underlines the importance of community policing in responding to the concerns and expectation of both urban and rural communities. I would like to re-affirm that the Government remains committed to supporting the Garda&iacute; to make communities safer.  The Government has devoted very significant resources for policing in recent years, and this will continue, in particular through the accelerated programme of Garda recruitment. This undoubtedly will enhance policing services for all communities across the country.<\/p><p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is involved in a variety of activities, including local and Regional drug and alcohol Task Forces, Garda youth diversionary projects, the juvenile diversion programme, the Garda schools programme and the conducting of proactive operations designed to address drug supply in communities.<\/p><p>However, I would also like to emphasise that, in particular where communities experience intimidation, Joint Policing Committees have a very important role in facilitating consultation, cooperation and synergy on policing and crime issues between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Local Authorities and elected local representatives and active and constructive engagement by elected members is very important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200079#WRA04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Policing Authority","counter":74,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200079#WRA04850"},{"type":"question","counter":75,"qnumday":52,"qnumall":"[32754\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200079#WRA04900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"his plans to strengthen the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Policing Authority and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2015 in order to increase the powers of the Policing Authority with regard to monitoring transparency, providing oversight and ensuring accountability, particularly in view of the ongoing crises within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1355","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":76,"content":"<p>The Deputy will be aware that the Policing Authority is an independent statutory body established on 1 January 2016 to oversee the performance of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to policing services, to promote public awareness of policing matters and to promote and support the continuous improvements in policing in Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  The statutory basis for the Authority is the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Policing Authority and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2015, which amended the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005. The establishment of the Policing Authority represents one of the most significant developments in policing since the founding of the State. <\/p>  <p>  The Authority is tasked with overseeing the performance of the Garda Commissioner in respect of the very wide remit of all policing services, while developing a key role in the future appointment of senior Garda management and civilian staff and driving reform of the policing system and practices. Since its establishment on 1 January 2016, I believe that the Policing Authority has proven to be very effective in the performance of its functions in this regard. For example in its first year of existence, the Authority has met with the Commissioner and her senior team on 13 occasions. It has approved a three-year Strategy for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. It has also determined the policing priorities for 2017 which informed the content of the 2017 Policing Plan which it also approved. In addition, it has reviewed and issued recommendations on the Garda Protected Disclosure policy and has also published a Code of Ethics that includes standards of conduct and practice for Garda members. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that the Report of the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality on Garda Oversight and Accountability, published in December 2016, includes a number of recommendations in relation to the statutory remit of the Authority. I want to make it clear that the Government is fully supportive of the Authority having appropriate powers so that it can carry out its oversight functions in an efficient and effective manner. However, I would draw the attention of the Deputy to the provisions of section 62O of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, which requires the Authority to prepare a report on the effectiveness of the Authority and the adequacy of the functions assigned to it by the legislation. The report can contain recommendations for improving the effectiveness of the Authority and is required to be submitted to me, as Minister, within 2 years of the establishment of the Authority. There is also a requirement for the report to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.<\/p>  <p>  Thus, the legislation envisages that it would be prudent for the Authority to examine, after a reasonable period of time, whether it is adequately empowered to carry out its oversight functions. In this manner, an informed decision can be taken in due course, having due regard to the views of the Authority and, of course, the Report of the Committee, as to whether additional powers would be needed by the Authority and the nature of any such powers. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200079#WRA05000","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Traffic Legislation","counter":77,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200079#WRA05050"},{"type":"question","counter":78,"qnumday":53,"qnumall":"[32887\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200079#WRA05100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"his plans to review with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport all relevant legislation regarding the ownership and use of scramblers and quads with a view to introducing appropriate legislation to deal with the issue of youths continuing to use these scramblers and quads in parks, streets and neighbourhoods without insurance and the difficulty being experienced by Garda&iacute; in stopping these youths and seizing and retaining these quads and scramblers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1298","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":79,"content":"<p>Further to the Deputy's parliamentary Question No. 55 of 23 May 2017 in relation to this matter, I share the concerns of my predecessor, the T&aacute;naiste, in relation to the public safety and anti-social issues associated with the misuse of such vehicles.  It is a very serious issue. The Deputy will be aware that the use of mechanically propelled vehicles, including quad bikes and scramblers, in a public place is subject to the relevant requirements of road traffic legislation. I am advised by the Garda authorities that these vehicles, when used in a public place, must comply with the Road Traffic Acts, including in relation to motor tax, insurance and possession of a valid driver licence or learner permit. Under the Road Traffic Acts, any member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is allowed to stop a mechanically propelled vehicle in a public place and demand production of a driver licence or learner permit. In addition, Garda&iacute; may inspect the vehicle for compliance with vehicle standards legislation, which makes it an offence to drive without reasonable consideration, drive carelessly, or drive dangerously. The Garda authorities also have powers of seizure, detention, storage and disposal of vehicles under road traffic legislation. <\/p><p>I am further informed that the use of quad bikes and scramblers in public parks and open spaces is strictly prohibited by the local authorities under the Parks and Open Spaces Bye-Laws 2011. <\/p><p>Despite the road traffic and other relevant legislation available in this area, the Garda authorities have indicated that the use of quad bikes and scramblers by minors and youths in public parks has proven difficult to deal with from an enforcement perspective. Garda members are instructed not to pursue youths on quad bikes, scramblers, etc. owing to the inherent safety risk in pursuing these vehicles. If such pursuits were to take place, there would be a high risk of these ending in collisions at speed resulting in serious injury or death, so the opportunity to actually bring these vehicles to a stop is rare. <\/p><p>The Garda authorities have advised that the issue is one which is best addressed through a multi-agency approach. In this regard, Garda&iacute; are working with local authorities, including park authorities, to examine other solutions, such as engineering solutions.  Enhanced fencing and bike gates are examples of engineering measures taken to restrict access to parks.<b><font color=\"#000080\">  <\/font><\/b><\/p><p>To better facilitate this multi-agency approach, I have written to the relevant parties, including the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, as well as the Garda Commissioner and the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, in order to ascertain whether there are additional legislative or other solutions which can assist us in dealing with this issue more comprehensively.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200079#WRA05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Civilian Staff","counter":80,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200079#WRA05250"},{"type":"question","counter":81,"qnumday":54,"qnumall":"[32890\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200079#WRA05300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the status of civilianisation within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1296","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":82,"content":"<p>The most recent available figure for the number of civilians working in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is for 31 May 2017, at which point there were 2,110 civilian staff members working throughout the organisation carrying out senior management, administrative and technical roles.<b><\/b><\/p><p>As part of its Five Year Reform and High-level Workforce Plan for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Government has agreed an overall vision for a Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 to include 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Garda Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. This very substantial investment in personnel is driven by our commitment to ensure all citizens have the reassurance of a visible, responsive and effective policing service. The projected number of 4,000 civilians will effectively double the current figure and represents a medium-term target of a Garda organisation 20% comprised of civilians. That will bring An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, currently 14% comprised of civilians, more in line with international norms and ensure that trained Garda&iacute; are not engaging in administrative and technical duties which could be done by suitably qualified civilian staff.<\/p><p>The 20% target will be achieved through a twin-track approach of, firstly, a &ldquo;civilian by default&rdquo; policy to be adopted in relation to the filling of all new posts other than operational policing posts and for non-operational policing posts that become vacant and, secondly, the redeployment of Garda&iacute; and backfilling by suitably qualified civilians where necessary. In its 'Changing Policing in Ireland' report, the Garda Inspectorate has estimated that there may be up to 1,250 Garda&iacute; currently in such posts and the Government&rsquo;s plan aims to return as many of these Garda&iacute; as possible to front-line duties over the next five years. With this in mind, the Garda Commissioner, in conjunction with the Policing Authority, has been requested to identify posts suitable for redeployment and to prepare a 5 year plan for reaching the 20% medium term target.<\/p><p>Funding for the recruitment of up to 500 civilians has been provided in Budget 2017 to facilitate the Commissioner in addressing capacity and critical skills gaps across the organisation including in corporate supports, change management, human resources and financial management at the national, regional and Divisional level.

The Government has also agreed in principle to the positions of a Chief Information Officer. The majority of the positions sanctioned are in the areas of ICT, Human Resources, Governance and Strategy, Legal and Compliance, and Finance. 43 of the initial 137 sanctioned posts will go towards back filling vacancies created by the redeployment of Garda members to policing duties. Garda management has indicated that some 163 of the total 500 civilians to be recruited this year will lead to redeployment opportunities.<\/p><p>This level of commitment in the first year is very welcome and it is expected that the quantum of redeployments will increase in 2018 and beyond.<\/p><p>The Garda Commissioner has statutory responsibility for recruitment and is working with the Public Appointments Service to fill these sanctioned posts. In addition there is ongoing engagement between Garda management, the Policing Authority, my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in relation to sanctioning further posts to meet identified business needs across the organisation and draw down the funding that is available for up to 500 additional civilians this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200079#WRA05400","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Data","counter":83,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200079#WRA05450"},{"type":"question","counter":84,"qnumday":55,"qnumall":"[32863\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200079#WRA05500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of garda&iacute; in each Garda station in counties Sligo and Leitrim as of 30 June 2017; and the number of new recruits assigned to the division since recruitment resumed in 2014.","asker":"1346","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":85,"content":"<p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.

The importance attached to human rights compliance in policing in Ireland is highlighted by section 7 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.

The programme is the outcome of a comprehensive review of foundation training for entrants to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and exemplifies best practice.  The  programme <font color=\"#29303A\"> embeds human rights and ethical policing as a core programme outcome. It ensures that ethics, human rights, values and community are considered in the management of all policing situations, and it seeks to provide a continuity of learning around these issues from problem-based learning in the Garda College to work-based learning in the Garda divisions.<\/font>New members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na now make a declaration of the need to have regard for human rights in carrying out policing duties.  <\/p><p>Human rights training also forms part of the training provided by the &lsquo;Continuous Professional Development&rsquo; staff allocated to each of the Garda Divisions for serving members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p><p>A very significant recent development in this regard is the Code of Ethics for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na published by the Policing Authority last January. It defines in clear terms the principles to guide the decisions that those in policing make in everything they do.  The Code has a statutory basis under the 2005 Act and was developed by the Authority and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in conjunction with stakeholders. The emphasis of the Code is on what good policing looks like and how police officers and staff should behave.The Code sets out nine standards of conduct and practice for everyone in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. These standards must be carried out in a manner that is independent and impartial, that respects human rights, and that supports the proper and effective administration of justice. <\/p><p>Of particular relevance is the standard in relation to police powers which commits all members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to respecting the human rights of all people, including the right to freedom of expression; to freedom of assembly and association; and to be free from arbitrary arrest or detention.<\/p><p>The Policing Plan 2017 contains a commitment by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to embed this Code into the day to day thinking and actions of the organisation, through the development of a communications plan to inform and educate all Garda personnel including reserves and civilians in relation to ethical matters and to embed the Code into all training programmes.  Work in this regard is currently progressing with options for the delivery of the communications plan and training programme being examined.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200080#WRB04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Meetings","counter":149,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200080#WRB04350"},{"type":"question","counter":150,"qnumday":77,"qnumall":"[32972\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200080#WRB04400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if he will meet the family of a person (details supplied) regarding an inquiry into their death and the subsequent events around the Garda investigation and court proceedings; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1299","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":151,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware this tragic case was considered under the Independent Review Mechanism (IRM) and the recommendation was that no further action should be taken.

As the Deputy will also be aware the Committee is expected to issue their report in the near future.  The Garda Commissioner has been Accounting Officer for the Garda Vote since July 2006.  Very particular responsibilities lie with Accounting Officers under the law and you will appreciate that I must be careful not to interfere either with the independent exercise of her functions as Accounting Officer by the Commissioner or the work of the Public Accounts Committee. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the living allowance, it is voted money and comes from the pay subhead in the Garda Vote.  Its origins date back to the 1985 Walsh Report on Garda Recruitment and Training on foot of which the Government of the day  introduced a new programme for trainee Garda&iacute;. Under the new structure, trainee Garda&iacute; no longer attested as members on the first day and therefore no longer received Garda salary; rather they received a  personal allowance to cover their day to day expenses and a living allowance which was paid directly to the Garda College to cover their meals and accommodation while attending the College.   <\/p>  <p>  This payment system continues to apply to trainee Garda&iacute; today who during Phase 1 of their training programme, which lasts 32 weeks and is based in the College, are paid a personal allowance of  &euro;184  per week with the living allowance of &euro;77.92  per week paid directly to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to cover the cost of providing meals and accommodation. <\/p>  <p>  My officials in their evidence to the Committee have acknowledged that the Interim Internal Audit Report takes the view that the living allowance is public money. However, having considered the evidence given before the Committee in relation to the origins of the funding model used to finance certain activities in the Garda College, and also records identified in my Department in relation to the approval of the living allowance, legal advice has been sought from the Office of the Attorney General on the nature of the allowance: whether it was public or private funding when it was paid directly to the College.  Given that the allowance is at the core of many of the issues before the Committee, clarity on this point may be of assistance in relation to the background to the development of the College funding model.  My Department has suggested to the Committee that it may wish to consider the nature of the living allowance and has undertaken, if it can assist the Committee on foot of the legal advice that it has sought, that it will do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200080#WRB04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Policing Authority","counter":158,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200080#WRB04950"},{"type":"question","counter":159,"qnumday":80,"qnumall":"[32753\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200080#WRB05000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"his plans to amend the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 in order to make the Garda Commissioner accountable to the Policing Authority and to empower the authority to remove a garda commissioner from office; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1355","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":160,"content":"<p>The Deputy will be aware that the Policing Authority is an independent statutory body established on 1 January 2016 to oversee the performance of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to policing services, to promote public awareness of policing matters and to promote and support the continuous improvements in policing in Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  The statutory basis for the Authority is the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Policing Authority and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2015, which amended the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005. The establishment of the Policing Authority represents one of the most significant developments in policing since the founding of the State. <\/p>  <p>  The Authority is tasked with overseeing the performance of the Garda Commissioner in respect of the very wide remit of all policing services, while developing a key role in the future appointment of senior Garda management and civilian staff and driving reform of the policing system and practices. Since its establishment on 1 January 2016, I believe that the Policing Authority has proven to be very effective in the performance of its functions in this regard. For example in its first year of existence, the Authority has met with the Commissioner and her senior team on 13 occasions. It has approved a three-year Strategy for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. It has also determined the policing priorities for 2017 which informed the content of the 2017 Policing Plan which it also approved. In addition, it has reviewed and issued recommendations on the Garda Protected Disclosure policy and has also published a Code of Ethics that includes standards of conduct and practice for Garda members. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that the Report of the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality on Garda Oversight and Accountability, published in December 2016, includes a number of recommendations in relation to the statutory remit of the Authority. I want to make it clear that the Government is fully supportive of the Authority having appropriate powers so that it can carry out its oversight functions in an efficient and effective manner. However, I would draw the attention of the Deputy to the provisions of section 62O of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, which requires the Authority to prepare a report on the effectiveness of the Authority and the adequacy of the functions assigned to it by the legislation. The report can contain recommendations for improving the effectiveness of the Authority and is required to be submitted to me, as Minister, within 2 years of the establishment of the Authority. There is also a requirement for the report to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.<\/p>  <p>  Thus, the legislation envisages that it would be prudent for the Authority to examine, after a reasonable period of time, whether it is adequately empowered to carry out its oversight functions. In this manner, an informed decision can be taken in due course, having due regard to the views of the Authority and, of course, the Report of the Committee, as to whether additional powers would be needed by the Authority and the nature of any such powers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200080#WRB05100","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Data","counter":161,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200080#WRB05150"},{"type":"question","counter":162,"qnumday":81,"qnumall":"[33004\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200080#WRB05200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of garda&iacute; assigned to Newbridge garda station; the number that are actually working on local as distinct from national issues; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1257","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":163,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will appreciate, it is the Garda Commissioner who is responsible for the distribution of resources, including personnel, among the various Garda Divisions and I, as Minister, have no direct role in the matter.

I am informed by the Commissioner that in regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Garda Division. It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his\/her Division.<\/p><p>The area referred to by the Deputy forms part of the Kildare  Division.

In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves.<\/p><p>This plan is progressing apace. I am informed by the Commissioner, since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, that almost 1,200 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, 60 of whom were assigned to the Kildare Division. I am also informed that a further four hundred Garda recruits are scheduled to attest later this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - an increase of 500 since the end of 2016. <\/p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical.

The Court itself recognises the complexities around this issue in that it acknowledges the Executive function in not only controlling who should enter the State but also to regulate the activities of non-citizens while in the State and has had to consider the distinctions of rights between citizens and non-citizens in the context of Article 40.1 of the Constitution. It has concluded that in an international protection system with no temporal limit on the decision making process, an absolute prohibition on the right to work is contrary to the right to seek employment under the Constitution. The Court recognises that this is a matter for the Executive and Legislature to consider and accordingly has adjourned consideration of the Order the Court should make for a period of six months. The State will make submissions to the Court in relation to the format of the order the Court is to make at the appropriate time. In the interim, the legal status as regards access to the labour market for international protection applicants remains unchanged, as set out in Section 16(3)(b) of the International Protection Act 2015. <\/p>  <p>  One of the principal aims of the International Protection Act 2015, which was commenced at the end of last year, is to process cases as quickly as possible so that in due course as cases on hand are cleared, persons in need of international protection are granted status quickly, thereby giving them an automatic right to work. In many EU Member States, the right to work is not an unfettered right, often arising after a particular period of time - usually 9 months to a year - and in many instances may be limited to particular job categories the withdrawal of other financial supports, etc. All of these matters require careful consideration as to their impact and to reflect the existing requirements placed on those who come to Ireland as lawful economic migrants.<\/p>  <p>  The judgment has significant legal, economic, policy and operational considerations, many of which impact across a range of Government Departments and services. For this reason, a whole of Government approach has been adopted to examine the implications of the judgment and to propose appropriate solutions as quickly as possible. Following the approval of Government, I am establishing an inter-Departmental Taskforce with immediate effect to undertake this important work. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200081#WRC01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Investigations","counter":180,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200081#WRC01150"},{"type":"question","counter":181,"qnumday":87,"qnumall":"[32971\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200081#WRC01200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if he will meet with the representatives of a family (details supplied) regarding a request by them for an inquiry into the death of a person; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1367","askee":"1233"},{"type":"question","counter":182,"qnumday":101,"qnumall":"[32967\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200081#WRC01300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"his plans to commission an inquiry into the murder of a person (details supplied) in 1970 to deal with unanswered questions with regard both the death of the person and the subsequent investigation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1367","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":183,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 87 and 101 together.<\/p>  <p>  I sympathise with the family of the victim in the case to which the Deputy refers.

For this reason, the number of Garda available in any one Garda Station on a particular day is subject to the operational requirements of the overall Division. <\/p>  <p>  Edgeworthstown Garda Station and Ballymahon Garda Station both form part of the Roscommon\/Longford Division.

I am also informed that a further four hundred are scheduled to attest later this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - an increase of 500 since the end of 2016. <\/p>  <p>  This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources she needs to allow her to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division, including the Meath Division in the coming years. <\/p>  <p>  This investment in personnel is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.  In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan. This investment will facilitate the provision of more effective policing services and I have no doubt that these new resources now coming on stream will see an increase in Garda visibility in our communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200081#WRC02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Assisted Decision Making","counter":196,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200081#WRC02250"},{"type":"question","counter":197,"qnumday":92,"qnumall":"[32683\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200081#WRC02300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"when the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 will come into force; the reason for the delay; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1280","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":198,"content":"<p>The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 provides a modern statutory framework to support decision-making by adults with capacity difficulties.

I am advised that this postponement arose because the ongoing Garda review in relation to the classification of homicide incidents is not yet complete. Therefore, it was not possible for the CSO to conduct its normal data verification process in advance of the publication of new crime statistics. <\/p>  <p>  At the public meeting held with the Policing Authority on 29 June 2017 the Garda authorities indicated that there are two main aspects to the ongoing review of homicide data. The first issue under review is a consideration of how certain homicides which may have resulted from assault incidents were classified  on the PULSE system. The other issue under examination relates to apparent data entry errors connected with homicides arising from offences classified as dangerous driving causing death. I am advised that, following queries raised by the CSO, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have reviewed the classification of in the region of 1,400 incidents, covering the period from 2003 to 2017. I understand that the Garda authorities has now provided a revised data set to the CSO in relation to the classification of these incidents. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that a decision on the resumption of the publication of crime statistics is a matter for the CSO, which is the independent national statistics authority. I am advised that the Garda authorities are in continuing contact with the CSO in relation to these matters, and I expect to receive further updates on this work as it progresses.<\/p>  <p>  We must bear in mind that issues with the consistent recording of crime data are not unique to this jurisdiction. The CSO has already carried out two detailed reviews of crime data quality, in 2015 and 2016, and I understand that further general reviews of crime data quality are planned. The CSO&rsquo;s work provides an important measure of re-assurance to support ongoing work to enhance the quality of the official crime statistics.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the valuable work of the CSO, these matters are being kept under close scrutiny by the Policing Authority.

The Deputy will be aware that the Government approved a five-year Reform and High-Level Workforce Plan for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in July 2016.  The Plan is aimed at implementing the agreed recommendations in 'Changing Policing in Ireland' including the recommendation in relation to the merging of the functions of FSI and the Technical Bureau, and at increasing the number of Garda&iacute; and Reserves to 15,000 and 4,000 respectively, as well as doubling the number of civilians to 4,000 by 2021.  <\/p>  <p>  In that context, I am pleased to inform the Deputy that a Working Group has been established with senior members of staff in both FSI and the Technical Bureau, and chaired by my Department, to prepare a plan to merge the functions of both organisations and oversee its implementation.

Before the State can ratify the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, enactment of new legislation and amendment of existing legislation is required to ensure obligations will be met upon entry into force for Ireland.  Ratification of a Convention before we have amended domestic legislation that contradicts it makes no sense and does nothing to ensure compliance or to protect the people for whose benefit the Convention exists.  The previous Government published a Roadmap in October 2015, which sets out the legislative measures needed to meet those requirements, along with declarations and reservations to be entered by Ireland on ratification.<\/p><p>Considerable progress has already been made to overcome the remaining legislative barriers to Ireland's ratification of the Convention. The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 was signed into law on 30 December 2015 and is a comprehensive reform of the law on decision-making capacity. The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 has reformed Section 5 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 to facilitate the full participation in family life of persons with intellectual disabilities and the full expression of their human rights. <\/p><p>The Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016 was published immediately prior to Christmas and completed Second Stage in February 2017.  The primary purpose of the Bill is to address the remaining legislative barriers to Ireland&rsquo;s ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD).Work is ongoing on all the other issues set out in the previous Government&rsquo;s Roadmap for Ratification published in October 2015 and these will be progressed as Committee Stage amendments.  The Bill will be progressed to enactment at the earliest possible date by the end of this year to facilitate ratification of the UN Convention immediately thereafter. <\/p><p>The precise timing of ratification now depends on how long it will take for this Bill to progress through the enactment process and on issues in relation to commencement both of deprivation of liberty provisions, which will be included in the Bill at Committee Stage, and of the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act 2015.<b><\/b><b><\/b><\/p><p>The major issue at this stage is in relation to deprivation of liberty &ndash; in the case of persons in nursing homes for example, whose capacity to consent may be in doubt.  This is a sensitive and important issue and we must get it right. Unfortunately, it is taking longer than expected to develop a proposal that is constitutionally sound and operationally effective and reasonable.  The Department of Justice and Equality continues to engage with the Department of Health to assist with that work, but there is still some work to be done.<\/p><p>While Ireland&rsquo;s not having ratified the CRPD is a recurring point of criticism by the UN as well as by domestic civil society and NGOs, it should be noted that in terms of quality of service and the actual position of people with disabilities in society, Ireland is in many respects in advance of other EU states.  This is not to be complacent and we are continuing to take practical measures to improve the lives of people with disabilities.  The Report of the Make Work Pay Group was published in recent weeks and already action, as announced by Minister Harris has been taken on its recommendations.  We have a Comprehensive Employment Strategy in place and 2017 will see positive action measures being taken to support public sector recruitment of people with disabilities.  And very shortly, Government will consider the draft of the new Disability Inclusion Strategy, which I expect to see published in the coming weeks.  It will contain a wide range of practical commitments to improve the position of people with disabilities.<\/p><p>I would like to take this opportunity to assure the Deputy that ratification of the UNCRPD remains a very high priority for me as Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200081#WRC03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1359"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Data","counter":208,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200081#WRC03050"},{"type":"question","counter":209,"qnumday":96,"qnumall":"[32679\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200081#WRC03100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of personnel working within a unit (details supplied); the towns they are based in; the operations that are active; the number of successes they have had to date in 2017; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":210,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Commissioner that Garda Drug Unit personnel are assigned on a Divisional basis and that the Garda Districts referred to by the Deputy is part of the Cavan\/Monaghan Garda Division.

primarily responsible for the effective and efficient use of the resources available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and I, as Minister, have no role in the matter.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Programme for a Partnership Government, the Government is committed to launching a pilot scheme to reopen 6 Garda stations, both urban and rural, to determine possible positive impacts that such openings will have on criminal activity, with special emphasis on burglaries, theft and public order. At its meeting on 13 June 2017, the Government noted the Garda Commissioner&rsquo;s interim Report which analysed population and crime trends and, taking account of the availability of stations for reuse, makes a number of recommendations including that Stepaside Station in Co. Dublin be reopened on a pilot basis. <\/p>  <p>  The Report also indicates that the Commissioner is likely, subject to further analysis, to recommend the reopening of Leighlinbridge, Co. Carlow and Donard, Co. Wicklow in her final report. If a second station is to be reopened in Dublin, the Commissioner has indicated that, subject to further analysis, the former station at Rush, Co. Dublin will be recommended for reopening. <\/p>  <p>  The Government has, accordingly, agreed in principle to the reopening of Stepaside Garda Station on a pilot basis as soon as any necessary preparatory works have been completed.  Following any decision to reopen the former stations, the Garda authorities will work closely with the Office of Public Works in relation to any necessary preparatory works required to progress the reopenings.<\/p>  <p>  The final report of the Commissioner in relation to Rush, Leighlinbridge and Donard stations is expected to be received in the near future and it will be brought to Government thereafter. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200081#WRC03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Equal Opportunities Employment","counter":221,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200081#WRC03850"},{"type":"question","counter":222,"qnumday":100,"qnumall":"[32965\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200081#WRC03900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if he will review applications for asylum, refugee status and long term residency status in respect of persons that have been awaiting a decision for more than four years with particular reference to the need to grant stamp 4 status to enable such persons seek employment and become self sufficient; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":223,"content":"<p>I assume the Deputy is referring to persons in the international protection process.  <\/p>  <p>  Clearly, the Supreme Court judgment in N.V.H. v. The Minister for Justice and Equality is an important judgment, and its full implications are being examined carefully. The Court itself recognises the complexities around this issue in that it acknowledges the Executive function in not only controlling who should enter the State but also to regulate the activities of non-citizens while in the State and has had to consider the distinctions of rights between citizens and non-citizens in the context of Article 40.1 of the Constitution. It has concluded that in an international protection system with no temporal limit on the decision making process, an absolute prohibition on the right to work is contrary to the right to seek employment under the Constitution. The Court recognises that this is a matter for the Executive and Legislature to consider and accordingly has adjourned consideration of the Order the Court should make for a period of six months. The State will make submissions to the Court in relation to the format of the order the Court is to make at the appropriate time. In the interim,  the legal status as regards access to the labour market for international protection applicants remains unchanged, as set out in Section 16(3)(b) of the International Protection Act 2015. <\/p>  <p>  One of the principal aims of the International Protection Act 2015, which was commenced at the end of last year, is to process cases as quickly as possible so that, in due course as cases on hand are cleared, persons in need of international protection are granted status quickly, thereby giving them an automatic right to work.

Road safety legislation currently in train in Minister Ross' Department includes the Road Traffic (Drink Driving - Fixed Penalty Notice) Bill 2017, the commencement of Parts 2 and 7 of the Road Traffic Act 2017, the National Vehicle and Driver File (Pr&uuml;m Decisions) Bill 2017 and the Road Safety Authority (Amendment) Bill 2017.  <\/p>  <p>  Road safety is a shared responsibility, one which I, Minister Ross and the Government, take very seriously.  Ireland&rsquo;s current Road Safety Strategy (2013 &ndash; 2020) aims to place Ireland consistently on the list of safest countries in the EU and beyond.  To achieve this, we are continuing to work together in partnership.  I will attend the fourth Ministerial Committee on Road Safety of 2017 with Minister Ross on 24 July, along with the Road Safety Authority, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Attorney General and other agencies.  This Committee oversees the implementation of the Road Safety Strategy and provides a forum for high-level discussion of road safety issues. <\/p>  <p>  The Committee generally meets twice a the year; however, in light of the 2016 increase in road fatalities, the Committee has already met on three occasions in 2017. The purpose of these meetings is to bring together all stakeholders to see what actions can be taken to reduce the number of road fatalities and collisions, which reached a historic low in both 2012 and 2015 but which increased again last year. In this regard, it should be pointed out that, so far this year, there has been a small reduction in the overall number of road deaths compared to the same period in 2016, although there is no room for complacency here. Any death on our roads is a death too many. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, my Department jointly chairs the multi-agency Criminal Justice (FCPS) Working Group with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  The Working Group is charged with overseeing and facilitating the recommendations of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate's report on &lsquo;The Fixed Charge Processing System &ndash; A 21st   Century Strategy&rsquo; (February 2014).  Some 22 of the 37 recommendations have been fully implemented to date, with 5 additional recommendations on track for delivery in 2017.  Work on the remaining recommendations is ongoing and the majority of these recommendations are medium-long-term in nature.  <\/p>  <p>  This multi-agency approach continues into enforcement.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s Roads Policing Operations Plan 2017 incorporates a programme of high visibility road safety and enforcement operations, carried out in partnership with other state agencies.  Garda operations specifically target road use behaviour known to contribute significantly to collisions, including driving while intoxicated, speeding and the use of mobile phones.  By working together with the Road Safety Authority and other agencies, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to confront dangerous road-user behaviour thorough public presence, legislative enforcement, education and partnership.   <\/p>  <p>  In January 2017, the Commissioner indicated that there will be an additional 10% increase in the traffic corps during the course of  2017,  and I am informed that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that a proposal in respect of the reconfiguration of the Traffic Corps is currently being developed. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will liaise with the Policing Authority in respect of the reconfiguration. It is anticipated that the reconfiguration will be completed before the end of 2017.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also indicated that it was intended to have a stronger focus on road traffic enforcement in the training provided to new recruits at Templemore.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that I have no direct role in the enforcement of road traffic legislation, which is an operational matter for the Garda Commissioner. I am informed that road traffic legislation is enforced as part of the day-to-day duties of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as well as through a programme of high visibility road safety and enforcement operations, carried out in partnership with other state agencies. Garda operations specifically target road use behaviour known to contribute significantly to collisions, including use of a mobile phone. Both strategic, targeted operations and general methods of enforcement have a valuable role to play in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's road traffic enforcement programme, which targets locations with a view to preventing the commission of offences, detecting errant motorists, changing their behaviour and ultimately reducing death and injuries on our roads.<\/p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s Modernisation and Renewal Programme (2016-2021) sets out key strategic objectives for Road Policing which will inform and guide An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Road Policing plans over the next 5 years.  Under the Programme, the Commissioner will undertake a number of road safety traffic enforcement initiatives, including expanding the use of technology and increasing checkpoints.<\/p>  <p>  The Programme is being supported by significant Government investment of some &euro;330 million, including &euro;205 million under the Capital Plan, in Garda ICT infrastructure over the period 2016 to 2021. This major investment will allow An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deploy the latest cutting edge technologies in the fight against crime. <\/p>  <p>  Underpinning all of these measures is the Government's ongoing commitment to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime. The Government plans to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. This year, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan which is in train within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Approximately 300 appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200081#WRC04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Commercial Rates","counter":228,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200081#WRC04350"},{"type":"question","counter":229,"qnumday":103,"qnumall":"[32680\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200081#WRC04400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if the issue of commercial rates being applied to private child care centres will be reviewed by his Department with a view to excluding them on the same basis as community child care centres; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1218","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":230,"content":"<p>I should point out that the Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the exercise of his duties under the Valuation Acts 2001- 2015 and the making of valuations for rating purposes is his sole responsibility. I, as Minister for Justice and Equality, have no function in decisions in this regard.<\/p><p>The Valuation Act, 2001 as amended by the Valuation (Amendment) Act 2015 provides that all buildings used or developed for any purpose, including constructions affixed thereto, are rateable unless expressly exempted under Schedule 4 of the Act. Such exempt buildings would principally include those used for public worship, education and health care provided on a not-for-profit basis, and charitable purposes. In general, the Act maintains the long-standing position that all commercial properties - including all private childcare facilities such as play schools, pre-schools, cr&egrave;ches and Montessori schools - are liable for rates.  Inconsistency in the approach to the exemption from rates for childcare and education facilities and calls to exempt all such providers were among the issues raised at a number of stages during the passage of the Valuation (Amendment) Act 2015.  As a result, the Government approved an amendment to the Bill, to insert into Schedule 4 of the Valuation Act 2001 an exemption from rates for properties occupied by parties that provide early childhood care and education on a <b><i>not-for-profit <\/i><\/b>basis. This extension of the childcare and education exemption removed an anomaly that previously existed where those that provided childcare and education on a charitable basis were exempt but those that did so on a <b><i>not-for-profit <\/i><\/b>basis were not. Since the commencement of the Valuation (Amendment) Act 2015 on 8 June 2015, the Valuation Office has been updating the valuation lists to give effect to this extension of the exemption so that it became effective for qualifying providers in 2016.<\/p><p>The decision taken by Government to extend the exemption from rates for early childcare and education was taken having considered the views of stakeholders in the sector. As outlined in Oireachtas debates during the passage of the legislation, key valuation principles have to be respected to retain the integrity and equity of a system that is a significant source of funding for Local Authorities. One of those principles is that properties of occupiers that operate with the intention of making a profit are rateable. There are a variety of other more appropriate means through which Government can and does support the provision of such services. Making exception to core, long-standing valuation principles can have a far reaching negative impact on the rates system and consequently a far reaching impact on Local Government funding.  In addition to the exemption of those that provide childcare and early education on a <b><i>not-for-profit <\/i><\/b>basis, paragraph 10 of Schedule 4 of the Valuation Acts 2001 to 2015 also exempts from rates childcare facilities that <i>only<\/i>provide the Early Childhood Care and Education Scheme.<\/p><p>The Acts are quite specific about the range of exemptions that can be allowed by the Commissioner, who has no discretionary latitude to grant exemptions not covered by Schedule 4.  As a matter of course, the Valuation Office examines all claimant cases on their individual merits by reference to the relevant statutory provisions governing the operation of the Valuation Acts as they relate to pre-school childcare facilities and all other categories of properties. <\/p><p>Currently, there are a number of avenues of redress for an occupier of rateable property who is dissatisfied with a determination of valuation made under the provisions of the Valuation Acts, 2001-2015. Firstly, before a determination is made, there is a right to make representations to the Valuation Office in relation to a proposed valuation. Later in the process, if the occupier is still dissatisfied with the determination, there is a right of appeal to the Valuation Tribunal which is an independent body set up for the purpose of hearing appeals against determinations of the Valuation Office.  Finally, there is a right of appeal to the Higher Courts on a point of law.  <\/p><p>Private childcare facilities which are operated for profit form part of the rateable valuation base on a nationwide basis. There are no plans at this time to provide for special treatment of these facilities by their exemption from rateability under the Valuation Acts as such a change would be quickly followed by demands for similar treatment from other interests involved in the provision of other services. The exemption from rateability of such facilities would reduce local authority revenues, which if it were not to entail an increase in Exchequer funding of local authorities, would have to be made good by imposing a corresponding increase on the remaining ratepayers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200081#WRC04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Policing Issues","counter":231,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200081#WRC04550"},{"type":"question","counter":232,"qnumday":104,"qnumall":"[32513\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200081#WRC04600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the steps he will take in the Border region to address the impact of a hard border and the potential increase of criminal activity; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":233,"content":"<p>It has always been the case that Ireland and the United Kingdom cooperate closely on immigration and border matters, in particular as they relate to securing the Common Travel Area (CTA) and we will continue to cooperate, and to strengthen that cooperation, in the future.

A recent European Commission proposal on measures to support Italy is being discussed at EU level this week and aims to improve the situation in the short term.  In the long term, to better manage migratory flows and the return of irregular migrants the European Union and its Member States must work closely with third countries to address the root causes of irregular migration.<\/p>  <p>  Through the EU's external migration policy, the Global Approach to Migration and Mobility, and in particular the Partnership Framework and the Malta Declaration, the EU is supporting longer-term strategies to develop economic and political stabilisation in third countries of origin and transit, and in neighbouring third countries.<\/p>  <p>  In June 2016 the EU adopted a Partnership Framework with five priority third countries (Ethiopia, Mali, Niger, Nigeria and Senegal).  The first step has been to establish and build on working relationships with these third countries with a view to establishing more concrete Migration Compacts. The European External Action Service and Commission are continuing to engage with these priority countries and firmly bed down the concept in the context of the many challenges faced by Italy, while looking to expand the partnership to other third countries.<\/p>  <p>  The Trust Fund for Africa is an important tool with which the EU can encourage third countries to work with Member States on issues such as returns and repatriation, as well as on the issuing of travel documents to nationals from these third countries awaiting return.  The Trust Fund has already seen tangible results with three programmes in Libya that support the emergency needs of protection and assistance of migrants and refugees in the country, and projects supporting enhanced security and border management in Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso.  Ireland has, to-date, contributed &euro;3 million to the Trust Fund.<\/p>  <p>  A small proportion of the migrants arriving in Italy are eligible for relocation to other EU Member States as asylum-seekers.  Ireland is operating the Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP), which includes the relocation to Ireland of asylum-seekers from Greece and Italy.  Under the IRPP, Ireland is on target to meet in full its commitment to Greece.  However, as explained in responses to previous Parliamentary Questions, Italy, unlike Greece, will not permit security assessments to be undertaken by other States on its territory.  Accordingly, Ireland has been unable to undertake security assessments of the asylum seeker cohort eligible for relocation to Ireland and no relocations from Italy have therefore taken place, despite Ireland's readiness to commence relocations as soon as this issue can be resolved.  Intensive efforts have been ongoing to resolve this, both bilaterally with Italian counterparts at official, diplomatic and Ministerial level, and at EU level, including through the European Commission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200081#WRC04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of An Taoiseach","counter":238,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200081#WRC05000"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Issues","counter":237,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200081#WRC04950"},{"type":"question","counter":238,"qnumday":106,"qnumall":"[33346\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200081#WRC05000","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"the position regarding the development of sectorial response plans to Brexit; and the publication date of these plans.","asker":"1436","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":239,"content":"<p>Following on from publication of the document setting out the Government's approach to the Brexit negotiations, work is underway across departments to prepare adaptive Sectoral Brexit Response Plans to mitigate emerging sectoral challenges.

Specifically with regard to anti-competitive behaviour, a number of allegations have been received but with insufficient evidence to merit the CCPC opening formal investigations. <\/p>  <p>  The CCPC is being asked to report on the operation of the household waste collection market in order to inform the future development of national waste management policy before the end of 2017, which will provide an evidence base to establish a regulator to prevent price gouging.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200082#WRD03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Finance","counter":278,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200082#WRD03600"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Insurance Industry","counter":277,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200082#WRD03500"},{"type":"question","counter":278,"qnumday":119,"qnumall":"[33214\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200082#WRD03600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the reason vehicles which are over ten years of age and pass the national car test can be refused insurance quotes from a large percentage of providers.","asker":"1250","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":279,"content":"<p>As Minister for Finance, I am responsible for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation.\u00a0 Neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept.\u00a0 This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.\u00a0 Consequently, I am not in a position to direct insurance companies as to the pricing level or terms or conditions that they should apply in respect of particular categories of drivers or vehicles.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Policy in relation to the NCT\u00a0lies with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.\u00a0 The NCT was introduced to comply with an EU Roadworthiness Testing Directive aimed at improving road safety and environmental protection.\u00a0While the NCT is one component of having safer vehicles on our roads, every vehicle owner has a personal and legal responsibility to ensure that their vehicles are roadworthy and well maintained.\u00a0 The NCT is an inspection or general &ldquo;health check&rdquo; of what is visible and accessible on the day of the test and includes a check of the roadworthiness of such safety features, amongst others, as lighting, brakes and tyres.<\/p>  <p>  The NCT is a minimum requirement of roadworthiness and is therefore not the only rating factor taken into account in the provision of motor insurance.\u00a0Insurers will generally require that a car has a valid NCT in order to be covered.\u00a0 However, in making their individual decisions on whether to offer cover and what terms to apply, they will also use a combination of other rating factors, including the age of the driver, the type and age of car, the claims record and driving experience of the driver, the number of drivers, how the car is used, etc.\u00a0 My understanding is that insurers do not all use the same combination of rating factors, and as a result prices and availability of cover varies across the market. In addition, insurance companies will price in accordance with their own past claims experience, meaning that in relation to the age of a car and the availability of cover, different insurance companies will use different age thresholds. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy should note that, according to the terms of the Declined Cases Agreement, the insurance market will not refuse to provide insurance to an individual seeking insurance if he\/she has approached at least three insurers and has not been able to obtain cover from them.\u00a0 Insurance Ireland can be contacted in this regard at\u00a0declined@insuranceireland.eu\u00a0or 01-6761914 or 01-6761820.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200082#WRD03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Help-To-Buy Scheme Assessment","counter":280,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200082#WRD03800"},{"type":"question","counter":281,"qnumday":120,"qnumall":"[33126\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200082#WRD03900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 67 of 5 July 2017, the amount that will be paid to a company (details supplied) to produce the economic impact assessment of the help-to-buy scheme.","asker":"1259","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":282,"qnumday":121,"qnumall":"[33138\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200082#WRD04000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on the decision to award the contract for the economic impact assessment of the help to buy scheme to a company (details supplied) in view of the fact that housing is not listed as one of that company's areas of expertise in public policy.","asker":"1259","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":283,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 120 and 121 together.<\/p>  <p>  My\u00a0Department\u00a0complies with all relevant public procurement legislation including EU regulations.

However, products manufactured before this date can continue to be sold until 30 September 2018 without complying with standardised packaging requirements.<\/p><p>The result will be increased tobacco receipts in the second half of 2017 and, as a result, total tobacco receipts for 2017 are expected to be greater than the tobacco receipts in 2016. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200082#WRD06000","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"NAMA Expenditure","counter":302,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200083#WRE00300"},{"type":"question","counter":303,"qnumday":129,"qnumall":"[33273\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200083#WRE00400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the receivers working for NAMA and the fees paid to same in each of the years 2011 to 2016 and to date in 2017, in tabular form.","asker":"1355","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":304,"content":"<p>The information sought by the Deputy is provided\u00a0by NAMA and is\u00a0set out in the table for the period from 2011 to date.<\/p><p>Note figures may not total due to rounding.<table><tr><th><\/th><th>IP Firm<\/th><th>IP Fees 2011<\/th><th>IP Fees 2012<\/th><th>IP Fees 2013<\/th><th>IP Fees 2014<\/th><th>IP Fees 2015<\/th><th>IP Fees 2016<\/th><th>IP Fees 2017<\/th><th>Total IP Fees<\/th><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td><\/td><td>&euro;<\/td><td><\/td><td>&euro;<\/td><td>&euro;<\/td><td>&euro;<\/td><td>&euro;<\/td><td>&euro;<\/td><td>&euro;<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>1<\/td><td>Alder King<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>8,502<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>8,502<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2<\/td><td>Allsop<\/td><td>450,000<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>7,130<\/td><td>543,661<\/td><td>105,750<\/td><td>95,000<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>1,201,541<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>3<\/td><td>Bannon Commercial<\/td><td>3,750<\/td><td>15,000<\/td><td>114,165<\/td><td>84,553<\/td><td>56,450<\/td><td>46,725<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>320,643<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>4<\/td><td>BDO<\/td><td>480,193<\/td><td>298,600<\/td><td>663,442<\/td><td>842,086<\/td><td>1,023,692<\/td><td>518,340<\/td><td>22,375<\/td><td>3,848,728<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>5<\/td><td>BDO UK<\/td><td>521,461<\/td><td>835,615<\/td><td>513,958<\/td><td>442,101<\/td><td>135,443<\/td><td>53,700<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>2,502,278<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>6<\/td><td>Begbies Traynor<\/td><td>209,382<\/td><td>216,765<\/td><td>194,017<\/td><td>184,932<\/td><td>77,470<\/td><td>2,250<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>884,816<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>7<\/td><td>BNP\/Allsops<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>2,360<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>2,360<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>8<\/td><td>BTW Shiells<\/td><td>60,756<\/td><td>33,197<\/td><td>2,084<\/td><td>64,487<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>160,524<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>9<\/td><td>Capita Symonds<\/td><td>45,232<\/td><td>40,906<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>86,138<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>10<\/td><td>Cavanagh Kelly<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>18,333<\/td><td>8,380<\/td><td>3,624<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>30,337<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>11<\/td><td>CBRE<\/td><td>130,188<\/td><td>117,332<\/td><td>7,500<\/td><td>7,500<\/td><td>938<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>263,458<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>12<\/td><td>CBRE UK<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>66,375<\/td><td>22,383<\/td><td>99,767<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>188,525<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>13<\/td><td>Chantrey Vellacott<\/td><td>16,667<\/td><td>36,553<\/td><td>94,297<\/td><td>218,460<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>365,977<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>14<\/td><td>Colliers<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>13,100<\/td><td>9,850<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>22,950<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>15<\/td><td>Colliers UK<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>10,030<\/td><td>3,186<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>13,216<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>16<\/td><td>Cordes &amp;amp;

Consequently, while Revenue do not prejudge the outcome of the political negotiations, for practical reasons Revenue&rsquo;s planning is based on the full range of possibilities, including the possibility that customs controls or processes will apply between Ireland and the UK.<\/p>  <p>  Revenue has advised me that its officials are engaged in researching a range of contingencies primarily related to the movement of goods. \u00a0It is clear that managing the volume of trade will be one of the biggest challenges post-Brexit. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  At present, approximately 1.4million customs declarations are processed each year, representing import and export trade with non-EU countries. \u00a0In addition, some 57,000 transit instances are processed. \u00a0After Brexit, there is likely to be an increase in processing requirements, although estimation of demand is difficult and unreliable because of the likelihood of accompanying behavioural changes, and uncertainty about the exact arrangements that will be negotiated between UK and EU. \u00a0Revenue is currently involved in procuring new computer software to implement customs systems required by the 2016 Union Customs Code which must become operational in stages between 2018 and 2022. \u00a0Our EU colleagues are also engaged in redeveloping their systems to implement the Union Customs Code and to deal with additional volume that may arise after Brexit. \u00a0The new systems will be scaled to accommodate maximum possible demand. \u00a0The time required to complete new systems, and to allow software providers to adapt their business packages, may be such that they are not fully in place if customs with the UK is required in the short term, and contingencies are being explored to deal with that eventuality.<\/p>  <p>  Revenue has a presence at the ports, airports, mail and parcel depots, and is in ongoing discussion with the relevant stakeholders, including on the implications of a much higher proportion of traffic requiring customs clearance. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The serious threat that smuggling poses to legitimate and compliant businesses, consumers and the Exchequer is recognised by Revenue. \u00a0It is inherently difficult to predict levels of illegal activity, but targeting and disrupting all shadow economy activities, including smuggling, is always a priority. In 2016 there were a total of 16,658 individual seizures and 1,682 summary convictions for offences related to shadow economy activities. Additionally Revenue works closely with other Member States in order to combat illegal activity and in 2016 received over 1,500 requests for assistance from other Member States. In the same period Revenue received assistance from other Member States in relation to almost 700 cases.<\/p>  <p>  As regards the island of Ireland, the Government&rsquo;s position in relation to the border with Northern Ireland in the context of Brexit is very clear. \u00a0Continued freedom of movement, absence of an economic\u00a0border, and protection of the Good Friday Agreement are key objectives for the Irish Government. The arrangements that will apply after Brexit will depend on the outcome of negotiations between the EU and UK. \u00a0 The Government is clear that any manifestation of an economic\u00a0border would have very negative consequences. \u00a0A key priority is to ensure the continued free flow of trade on the island and the need to avoid an economic border. Clearly in this regard the closer the trading relationship between the UK and EU is more generally the better. I would point out that the EU 27 guidelines for the Article 50 negotiation, specifically refer to the need to support and protect the achievements, benefits and commitments of the Peace Process. \u00a0In this regard the guidelines recognise the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland, outlining the need for flexible and imaginative solutions, including with the aim of avoiding a hard\u00a0border, while respecting the integrity of the Union legal order.<\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that Revenue's preparatory work in relation to Brexit is proceeding well. \u00a0A first allocation of 40 extra staff has been provided to enable scenarios to be developed and explored in conjunction with stakeholders, and as more clarity emerges in the course of EU-UK negotiation, appropriate resources will be provided to ensure a full state of readiness.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200083#WRE01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":319,"qnumday":137,"qnumall":"[33339\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200083#WRE02400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the position regarding the development of sectorial response plans to Brexit; the publication date of these plans; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1436","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":320,"content":"<p>The Department of Finance is working within the whole-of-Government framework for the preparation of\u00a0sectoral Brexit response plans.

Work was carried out in the Department to assess the potential economic and financial sector implications arising, including the study, published in November 2015 under the ESRI-Department of Finance research programme, entitled 'Scoping the Possible Economic Implications of Brexit on Ireland'. Following the referendum, Budget 2017 included a number of measures to respond to the challenges of Brexit, including measures to support SMEs, entrepreneurship, agri-food and Irish exporters. These measures were informed by the Department's sectoral exposure analysis published with Budget 2017. Additional research work on Modelling the Medium to Long Term Potential Macroeconomic Impact of Brexit on Ireland was published in November 2016 and an updated sectoral exposure analysis in March 2017. <\/p>  <p>  The Department of Finance contingency work is mainstreamed across all divisions and focusses on economic and financial sector impacts.\u00a0The Department will continue to carry out the necessary research, analysis and consultations, and to develop budgetary policy in the context of Brexit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200083#WRE02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Correspondence","counter":321,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200083#WRE02600"},{"type":"question","counter":322,"qnumday":138,"qnumall":"[33358\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200083#WRE02700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if a reply will issue to correspondence (details supplied) of 16 March 2017 in regard to exempt approval status of occupational pension schemes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1313","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":323,"content":"<p>A reply to the correspondence concerned was issued on 3rd July 2017.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200083#WRE02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Banking Sector","counter":324,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200083#WRE02900"},{"type":"question","counter":325,"qnumday":139,"qnumall":"[33364\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200083#WRE03000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will investigate a matter raised in correspondence (details supplied) in relation to the use of contactless electronic payments; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":326,"content":"<p>The question appears to concern the possible security implications of information\u00a0displayed on the merchant receipt\u00a0following a\u00a0contactless payment transaction.

Best practice is to not display the card number in full on a receipt, and card numbers are generally truncated or masked to show only the final four digits. In addition, the CVV and PIN number, which are required to execute non-contactless payments, are not included on a receipt.<\/p>  <p>  Any cardholder who has concerns on how a merchant displays his or her payment card information should raise the issue either directly with the merchant or with the bank that issued the card.

Therefore, it contains a commitment for a medium-term income tax reform plan that keeps the tax base broad, while reducing excessive tax rates for middle income earners, and limiting the benefit for high earners.

A previous Government reduced the salaries and allowances payable to all new entrants to public service recruitment grades by 10% with effect from 1 January 2011. This decision also required that such new entrants would start on the first point of the applicable salary scale, which in the case of teachers had the effect of reducing their starting pay by a further 4-5%. Later in 2011, the Government placed a cap on the overall level of qualification allowances that could be earned by teachers. <\/p>  <p>  Subsequently in 2012, following the public service-wide review of allowances, the Government withdrew qualification allowances for new teachers altogether. However, the Government partially compensated for this by deciding that new entrant teachers would henceforth commence on a new salary scale which had a starting point higher than the starting point of the old scale. <\/p>  <p>  The public service agreements have allowed a programme of pay restoration for public servants to start. I have used this to negotiate substantial improvements in pay for new teachers. \u00a0The agreements have, to date, restored an estimated 75% of the difference in pay for more recently recruited teachers and deliver full equality at later points in the scale.\u00a0 This is substantial progress and strikes an equitable balance with other claims for funding on my Department, particularly needs such as enhanced service for children with special educational needs, for disadvantaged schools, for growing schools, for Higher Education and for apprenticeships.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  As a result of these changes and taking into account the proposed pay measures under the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020, the starting salary of a new teacher from 1 October 2020 onwards will be &euro;37,692. If full equalisation was achieved the starting salary for a post-primary teacher from 1 October 2020 would be &euro;43,879 and for a primary teacher would be &euro;41,511.<\/p>  <p>  Further to the this newly recruited teachers\u00a0benefit from\u00a0the terms of the Ward circular\u00a0which reduced the\u00a0qualifying period for a CID and the removal of the career break and secondment categories of objective grounds which had previously prevented some teachers from gaining CIDs.\u00a0 In addition to earlier permanency, other\u00a0measures\u00a0of benefit to newly recruited teachers\u00a0include a revised sequence for the filling of posts to enable fixed-term and part-time teachers to gain permanent, full-time jobs more quickly and easier than before.<\/p>  <p>  It must be borne in mind that the pay reduction for post-2011 entrants to the public service applied to all public servants and not just teachers, and that any restoration of these measures in respect of teachers would be expected to be applied elsewhere across the public service. While I am not in a position to provide an estimate of the total cost of restoring all post-1 January 2011 entrants in all areas of the public service to the pre-2011 pay scale arrangements, I can say that in the case of education and training sector employees, including teachers, the estimated current full year cost would be in the order of &euro;85 million.\u00a0 Clearly, the cost across the entire public service would be substantially higher.<\/p>  <p>  However there are other types of equality that we must also bear in mind, for example equality between public servants and people who work elsewhere or don&rsquo;t work at all.\u00a0 It would also not be equal or fair for us to do unaffordable deals with particular groups of public servants that mean that we do not have the money left in the public purse to provide increases in social welfare payments for vulnerable groups, tax reductions for people at work, or investments in improvements in public services that people rely on.<\/p>  <p>  Any further negotiation on new entrant pay is a cross sectoral issue, not just an issue for the education sector. The Government also supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants.<\/p>  <p>  Accordingly, the recently concluded draft Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 includes a provision in relation to new entrants which states that an examination of the remaining salary scale issues in respect of post January 2011 recruits at entry grades covered by parties to the Agreement will be undertaken within 12 months of the commencement of the Agreement.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200085#WRG00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects Status","counter":417,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200085#WRG00800"},{"type":"question","counter":418,"qnumday":170,"qnumall":"[33493\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200085#WRG00900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the extent to which the school building programme at primary and second level in County Kildare continues to proceed as planned having particular regard to the urgent requirement for school places; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":419,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Deputy that my Department's six year Capital Programme priorities building projects to meet demographic demand and this includes schools in County Kildare.

Kildare. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The aim of this new model is to deliver better outcomes for children with special educational needs. Substantial research, analysis, consultation with service users and stakeholders, and piloting have gone in to the development of this model and all of the evidence points to the fact that this new system will deliver better outcomes for children. <\/p>  <p>  No school will lose supports as a result of the implementation of the new model.

The provision of an additional 900 teaching posts is a very significant investment in the provision of additional\u00a0teaching support for pupils with special educational needs in our schools. This is additional to an increase of 41% in the number of resource teachers allocated to schools annually by the NCSE since 2011. <\/p>  <p>  The additional funding will provide additional supports to over 1200 schools who are identified as needing additional supports as a result of the new model. Supports for children with special educational needs is a key priority for this Government.

This ensures a focus on why activity is undertaken rather than on where it took place or the nature of the activity (e.g. reception, dinner).  These new arrangements ensure a closer link between the related expenditure and the Department&rsquo;s Statement of Strategy and Mission Business Plans.

Coming shortly before the formal launch of the Article 50 negotiations between the EU and the UK on 19 June, my appointment to this role has coincided with an important period in the Brexit process. <\/p>  <p>  My immediate focus has therefore been on discharging the Department&rsquo;s lead role in ensuring a cross-Governmental approach to the Article 50 negotiations. I will be building on the excellent work carried out over recent months, which has ensured that Ireland&rsquo;s interests &ndash; as set out in the Government&rsquo;s comprehensive document of 2 May on our approach to the Brexit negotiations &ndash; have been fully reflected in the EU&rsquo;s negotiating position. Protecting the gains of the peace process is a key priority for the Government in dealing with Brexit. This includes ensuring that all provisions of the Good Friday Agreement are fully respected and upheld, avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland and maintaining the Common Travel Area.  <\/p>  <p>  In order to ensure that these specific concerns are recognised, the Government has also undertaken an intensive campaign of engagement with our EU partners and the EU Institutions.  This approach has delivered for Ireland and I look forward to continuing the efforts of my predecessor in this regard.  I have already held bilateral meetings with a number of my EU colleagues since assuming my new responsibilities, including with the EU&rsquo;s lead negotiator, Michel Barnier, as well with my French and Slovak counterparts during visits to Paris and Bratislava on 5 July and 7 July respectively while on 3 July I welcomed my Finnish counterpart to Ireland when I brought on a visit to the border. In addition, I met the UK&rsquo;s Secretary of State for Exiting the EU, David Davis, in London on 6 July and I have spoken by telephone with the UK&rsquo;s Foreign Secretary, Boris Johnson. <\/p>  <p>  I will normally represent Ireland at the General Affairs Council (Art. 50). The GAC (Art. 50) will have a key role to play in providing political oversight of the Article 50 negotiations as they proceed and in preparing the work of the European Council (Art. 50), where Ireland is represented by the Taoiseach. <\/p>  <p>  The European Union Division in my Department is headed by a Second Secretary General with a particular focus on Brexit issues, and has been strengthened by the appointment of an Assistant Secretary to work with him. He oversees a dedicated six-person unit on the EU-UK negotiations in the Division. The EU Division works closely with the Department&rsquo;s Ireland, UK and Americas Division, Legal Division and Trade Division, which also deal with aspects of Brexit. The resources for these Divisions have also been reinforced. Specific additional senior diplomatic posts have also been assigned to our Embassies in London, Berlin and Paris as well as the Permanent Representation of Ireland to the European Union in Brussels, while reporting on Brexit issues is a top priority for all our EU Missions. There is daily coordination with the Department of the Taoiseach, which serves the Taoiseach as a member of the European Council. There is also close engagement with other Government Departments and their &ldquo;Brexit&rdquo; teams.   <\/p>  <p>  The precise operational arrangements for co-operation between Departments are being reviewed in the light of my Ministerial remit.<\/p>  <p>  Brexit will also have implications for a broad range of policy areas that fall under the responsibility of my Department. We have cooperated closely with the UK within the EU on a number of these important areas, including in the areas of foreign and development policy as well as in economic and trade policy.  A key priority for my Department is therefore to build on our partnerships with the remaining EU Member States and develop new alliances within the EU and engage more proactively with the EU institutions. This work is already underway. Discussions with EU partners have revealed that they too are very mindful of the need to intensify alliances post-Brexit and are also looking at how best to do so. <\/p>  <p>  We have already seen the implications that Brexit has had for our consular and passport services. There has been a marked increase in demand for passports and citizenship via foreign birth registration from applicants in Northern Ireland and Great Britain. In this regard, the Passport Service in Dublin, Cork and London as well as Consular Division have recruited a number of additional temporary and fulltime officers to meet increased Passport and Foreign Birth Registration demands including increased demand as a result of Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  It is also the Government&rsquo;s objective to exploit fully any opportunities arising from the UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU and my Department, in collaboration with other Government Departments and State Agencies, is working to support Irish businesses to identify new opportunities for their products and services by diversifying into new markets as well as intensifying efforts in existing markets.

The European Council&rsquo;s guidelines for the EU-UK negotiations include a strong acknowledgment of the unique circumstances of the island of Ireland and explicitly recognize the importance of preserving the achievements, benefits and commitments of the Good Friday Agreement.  These guidelines are fully reflected in the negotiating directives adopted by the General Affairs Council on 22 May. <\/p>  <p>  The inclusion of the specific references to Ireland&rsquo;s key priorities in the EU negotiating guidelines highlights their acceptance by our EU partners as shared priorities for the European Union in the negotiation process with the UK.

I look forward to this work continuing in greater depth and detail once agreement is reached to form a new Northern Ireland Executive.  <\/p>  <p>  The All-Island Civic Dialogue on Brexit is a critical part of the Government&rsquo;s engagement with sectors which will be impacted by the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU.  Over 1,200 delegates have participated in two plenary sessions and numerous sectoral dialogues, facilitating a wide conversation on the implications of Brexit for the island, North and South.  Through this process the Government has heard and taken on board a broad range of concerns which have informed the Government&rsquo;s approach to the Brexit negotiations.  This has been a very valuable initiative and is continuing.<\/p>  <p>  The Government will maintain its focus on the pursuit of specific, effective and realizable measures that address each of the issues of concern under Brexit to ensure that the gains of the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement are not in any way undermined by the UK&rsquo;s exit from the EU and to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200086#WRH01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"question","counter":487,"qnumday":194,"qnumall":"[32101\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200086#WRH02100","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his views of the citizenship proposals put forward by Prime Minister May in a policy paper (details supplied).","asker":"1436","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":488,"content":"<p>Safeguarding the rights and entitlements of EU citizens resident in the UK as well as UK citizens resident in the EU has been identified as a key priority by both the European Union and the UK within the context of the Article 50 negotiations on the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the European Union.

Under the Programme, the Commissioner will undertake a number of road safety traffic enforcement initiatives, including expanding the use of technology and increasing checkpoints. <font color=\"#000080\">  <\/font>The Programme is being supported by significant Government investment of some &euro;330 million, including &euro;205 million under the Capital Plan, in Garda ICT infrastructure over the period 2016 to 2021. This major investment will allow An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deploy the latest cutting edge technologies in the fight against crime. <\/p><p>Underpinning all of these measures is the Government's ongoing commitment to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime. The Government plans to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. This year, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan which is in train within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Approximately 300 appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve.  <font color=\"#000080\"><\/font><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200086#WRH05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Deployment","counter":516,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200086#WRH05300"},{"type":"question","counter":517,"qnumday":206,"qnumall":"[32851\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200086#WRH05400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of garda&iacute; in each Garda station in north Cork as of 30 June 2017; and the number of new recruits assigned to the division since recruitment resumed in 2014.","asker":"1283","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":518,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will appreciate, it is the Garda Commissioner who is responsible for the distribution of resources, including personnel, among the various Garda Divisions and I, as Minister, have no direct role in the matter. Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. I am informed by the Commissioner that in regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Garda Division. It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his\/her Division.<\/p><p>I have been informed that the number of Garda&iacute; assigned to the Cork North Division on the 31 May 2017, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 311 with 16 Garda Reserves and 29 civilians attached to the Division. When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. <\/p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime. To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves.<\/p><p>This plan is progressing apace. I am informed by the Commissioner, since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, that almost 1,200 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, 10 of whom were assigned to the Cork North Division. I am also informed that a further four hundred Garda recruits are scheduled to attest later this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - an increase of 500 since the end of 2016. <\/p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources she needs to allow her to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division, including the Cork North  Division in the coming years. <\/p><p>This investment in personnel is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.  In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan. This investment will facilitate the provision of more effective policing services and I have no doubt that these new resources now coming on stream will see an increase in Garda visibility in our communities.<\/p><p>For the Deputy's information I have set out below,  as provided by the Commissioner, the number of Garda&iacute; assigned to the Cork North Division by station as of 31 May 2017, the latest date for which figures are readily available.<\/p><p>CORK NORTH DIVISION 31 MAY 2017<\/p><p><table><tr><th><\/th><th><\/th><th><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>DISTRICT <\/td><td>STATION<\/td><td><div>TOTAL<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>FERMOY<\/td><td>BALLYNOE<\/td><td><div>1<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>CASTLETOWNROCHE<\/td><td><div>2<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>FERMOY<\/td><td><div>57<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>KILDORRERY<\/td><td><div>1<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>KILWORTH<\/td><td><div>1<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>MITCHELSTOWN<\/td><td><div>19<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>RATHCORMAC<\/td><td><div>1<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>WATERGRASSHILL<\/td><td><div>2<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>TOTAL<\/td><td><div>84<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>MALLOW<\/td><td>BUTTEVANT<\/td><td><div>1<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>CHARLEVILLE<\/td><td><div>20<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>DONERAILE<\/td><td><div>2<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>GLANTAINE<\/td><td><div>1<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>KANTURK<\/td><td><div>22<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>LISCARROLL<\/td><td><div>1<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>MALLOW<\/td><td><div>58<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>MILFORD<\/td><td><div>2<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>NEWMARKET<\/td><td><div>2<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>TOTAL<\/td><td><div>109<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>MIDLETON<\/td><td>BALLYCOTTON<\/td><td><div>1<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>CARRIGTWOHILL<\/td><td><div>2<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>CLOYNE<\/td><td><div>1<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>COBH<\/td><td><div>37<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>KILLEAGH<\/td><td><div>1<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>MIDLETON<\/td><td><div>52<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>WHITEGATE<\/td><td><div>1<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>YOUGHAL<\/td><td><div>23<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>TOTAL<\/td><td><div>118<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>CORK NORTH TOTAL<\/td><td><\/td><td><div>311<\/div><\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200086#WRH05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Traveller Community","counter":519,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200086#WRH05600"},{"type":"question","counter":520,"qnumday":207,"qnumall":"[27358\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200086#WRH05700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the funding his Department allocated in 2015, 2016 and to date in 2017 to Traveller specific initiatives and Traveller organisations around the country and specifically in County Wexford; if he has satisfied himself with the level of support his Department currently provides to cultural and heritage projects for the Traveller community; his plans to increase it; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1355","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":521,"content":"<p>The total funding available to my Department in respect of Traveller and Roma initiatives for 2017 is &euro;3,230,000, of which &euro;1,350,000, in respect of funding for 14 Traveller community groups and national-level NGOs, transferred to my Department from the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government on 1 January 2016. This was in addition to a sum of &euro;550,000 which transferred to my Department from the Department of Social Protection (for 7 Special Initiative for Travellers projects) on 1 January 2015. My Department provided funding of &euro;864,188 in 2015 and &euro;2,103,830 in 2016 for Traveller specific initiatives.Details of the funding allocation in the years in question are set out in the Table below.

This is a  positive step forward and demonstrates both the Government&rsquo;s and my Department's commitment to supporting the Traveller community nationwide. Insofar as additional resources may be necessary for implementation of the new  Inclusion Strategy, this is a matter for the relevant Departments as part of the annual Estimates process.

To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves.<\/p><p>Last Thursday, 6 July, a class of 198 Garda trainees attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na - the largest class to attest since the Garda College reopened in September 2014. This brings the number of new recruits who have attested since the College reopened to almost 1,200, with another four hundred scheduled to attest later this year.  This will bring Garda numbers to 13,500 by year-end once projected retirements are taken into account - an increase of 500 over last year. This is real  progress on reaching our target of 15,000 members by 2021.<\/p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources she needs to allow her to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division, including the Westmeath  Division in the coming years. <\/p><p>This investment in personnel is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.  In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan. This investment will facilitate the provision of more effective policing services and I have no doubt that these new resources now coming on stream will see an increase in Garda visibility in our communities.  <b><font color=\"#000080\"><\/font><\/b><\/p><p>As the Deputy will appreciate, it is the Garda Commissioner who is responsible for the distribution of resources, including personnel, among the various Garda Divisions and I, as Minister, have no direct role in the matter.

This includes responsibility for the formulation of proposals in relation to the opening and closing of Garda Stations, taking into account crime trends and policing priorities, so as to ensure that the best possible use is made of these resources.<\/p>  <p>  Indeed, this was the basis on which the Garda District and Station Rationalisation Programme was developed and implemented, resulting in the closure of some 139 Garda stations. I am informed by the Garda authorities that the closures have allowed front line Garda to be managed and deployed with greater mobility, greater flexibility and in a more focused fashion particularly with regard to various targeted police operations.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Programme for a Partnership Government, the Government is committed to launching a pilot scheme to reopen 6 Garda stations, both urban and rural, to determine possible positive impacts that such openings will have on criminal activity, with special emphasis on burglaries, theft and public order. At its meeting on 13 June 2017, the Government noted the Garda Commissioner&rsquo;s interim Report which analysed population and crime trends and, taking account of the availability of stations for reuse, makes a number of recommendations including that Stepaside Station in Co. Dublin be reopened on a pilot basis. The Report also indicates that the Commissioner is likely, subject to further analysis, to recommend the reopening of Loughlinbridge, Co. Carlow and Donard, Co.

At an operational level, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na pro-actively target public disorder and anti-social behaviour, including knife related crime through the strategic deployment of Garda resources, and areas identified as public order hot-spots by local Garda management are the subject of additional foot and mobile patrols.

I am informed by the Commissioner that in regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Garda Division. It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his\/her Division.<\/p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that on 31 May 2017, the latest date for which figures are currently available, the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was 13,137 members.<\/p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves.<\/p>  <p>  This plan is progressing apace. I am informed by the Commissioner, since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, that almost 1,200 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide. I am also informed that a further four hundred Garda recruits are scheduled to attest later this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - an increase of 500 since the end of 2016. <\/p>  <p>  This focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan.

While these have made, and continue to make, an invaluable contribution to ensuring that we have an effective police service, they were not tasked with examining policing in a &ldquo;root and branch&rdquo; manner.  In addition institutional arrangements for governance and oversight have evolved significantly in recent years in a piecemeal fashion. <\/p><p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is approaching its 100th anniversary.

I believe the decision taken by Government to establish an independent Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland, to be chaired by Ms Kathleen O'Toole, will prove to be a very important one capable of leaving a valuable legacy. <\/p><p>An important consideration in establishing the Commission was that it would not impede the existing reform programme. The Commission is to report by September 2018 and much can be done in the meantime to modernise the administration and operation of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. I am determined that there will be no let-up in the reform drive. The work of the oversight bodies must continue and the Government's support for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by providing the necessary resources for recruitment and investment must continue. <\/p><p>Crucially, the Commission may bring forward immediate proposals and rolling recommendations for implementation, that it considers are required to be addressed in the short-term, and in advance of its final report. This will allow the reform programme to be adjusted as necessary to ensure that it will deliver a police service fit for modern times.  <b><font color=\"#000080\">  <\/font><\/b><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200088#WRK03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Criminal Assets Bureau","counter":618,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200088#WRK03800"},{"type":"question","counter":619,"qnumday":241,"qnumall":"[33488\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200088#WRK03900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the scale and value of assets seized by the Criminal Assets Bureau in the past five years; if all such properties have been disposed and the proceeds retained by the State; the status of such properties not yet disposed of in this context; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":620,"content":"<p>The Criminal Assets Bureau takes actions under the Proceeds of Crime Acts 1996 to 2016 to deprive or to deny persons of assets which derive, or are suspected to derive, directly or indirectly from criminal conduct; or the benefit of such assets. <\/p><p>Sections 2 and 3 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996 provide the mechanism under which the Bureau can apply to the High Court seeking to freeze or restrain a person \/entities dealing with a specific asset.

I am informed by the Commissioner that in regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Garda Division. It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his\/her Division.<\/p>  <p>  I am informed by the Commissioner that, as of the 31 May 2017, there were 329 Garda together with 21 Garda Reserves and 31 civilians attached to the Kildare Division.

I am also informed that a further four hundred Garda recruits are scheduled to attest later this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - an increase of 500 since the end of 2016. <\/p>  <p>  This focus on investment in personnel is critical.

To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required training and development structures and resources in place, including trained Garda tutors and access to a permanently appointed supervisory Sergeant who is thoroughly familiar with their responsibilities under the training programme. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200088#WRK04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Investigations","counter":624,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200088#WRK04400"},{"type":"question","counter":625,"qnumday":243,"qnumall":"[33490\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200088#WRK04500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the extent to which resources continue to be made available for the pursuit of cold cases including those of missing persons whose whereabouts have never been confirmed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":626,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, the provision and allocation of Garda resources is a matter for the Garda Commissioner in the light of identified operational demands.

Section 19 of that Act provides that any person who assaults a peace officer acting in the execution of his or her duty is guilty of an offence and is liable on conviction on indictment to a fine or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 7 years.

Other provisions of the Act which relate to DAHR which are related to Parts 2 and 3 will be co-ordinated with the commencement of those Parts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200089#WRL04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mental Health Services","counter":679,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200089#WRL04100"},{"type":"question","counter":680,"qnumday":263,"qnumall":"[33569\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200089#WRL04200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the extent to which children or teenagers liable to self-harm continue to have ready access to support services such as counselling and follow-up visits; the degree to which patterns over the past number of years have illustrated the adequacy of such support services; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":681,"qnumday":337,"qnumall":"[31213\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200089#WRL04300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the extent to which children or teenagers liable to self-harm continue to have ready access to support services such as counselling and follow-up visits; the degree to which patterns over the past number of years have illustrated the adequacy of such support services; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":682,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 263 and 337 together.<\/p>  <p>  In March 2016, the HSE Mental Health Division established the National Clinical Programme for the Assessment and Management of Patients Presenting to Emergency Departments following Self-Harm.  This clinical programme specifically addresses the care and treatment required by people who present to the Emergency Departments of acute hospitals following an episode of self-harm or with prominent suicidal ideation. <\/p>  <p>  The aim of this programme is to develop a standardised and effective process for the assessment and management of individuals of all age ranges, including children and adolescents, who present with self-harm to an Emergency Department.  Training offered by this programme ensures that patients and their families have access to clinicians with sufficient expertise to provide high-quality, evidence-based care and treatment.  Critical to the success of this clinical programme is the consolidation and further development of close working relationships between the Emergency Department clinical team, mental health liaison staff and Community Mental Health teams and GP services.  The objectives of this programme are to improve the assessment and management of all individuals who present to an Emergency Department with self-harm; reduce rates of repeated self-harm; improve access to appropriate interventions at times of personal crisis; ensure rapid and timely linkage to appropriate follow-up care; and optimise the experience of families and carers in trying to support those who present with self-harm.<\/p>  <p>  Following clinical assessment of a person who presents to an Emergency Department following self-harm, a decision regarding treatment of the individual is required.  This may indicate admission to a general hospital, if physical care is required.  If significant mental health considerations are clinically identified, referral to mental health services in accordance with the criteria set out in the Mental Health Acts may be appropriate.  Alternatively, the individual could be referred to appropriate primary care services and supports.  All such clinical decisions are set out in the Discharge and Management Plan &ndash; Emergency Care Plan developed with, and given to, the patient and family\/friend (with consent).  In addition, the HSE currently funds a number of agencies to provide a variety of counselling services to young people.  This includes 13 Jigsaw sites nationally.<\/p>  <p>  The points raised by the Deputy in relation to the pattern and adequacy of support services have been referred to the HSE, as this is an operational matter for direct reply. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200089#WRL04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Safety","counter":683,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200089#WRL04500"},{"type":"question","counter":684,"qnumday":264,"qnumall":"[33124\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200089#WRL04600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of cyclists who have been injured due to an adverse interaction with the Luas cross city works in each of the years since the works began and to date in 2017; the number of cyclists who attended an emergency department due to these adverse interactions each year; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":685,"content":"<p>In response to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200089#WRL04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Status","counter":686,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200089#WRL04800"},{"type":"question","counter":687,"qnumday":265,"qnumall":"[33137\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200089#WRL04900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of an appointment for a person (details supplied)","asker":"1225","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":688,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

Some of these medications are also authorised for use in children and adolescents aged 8 to 18 years for the treatment of moderate to severe major depressive episodes if the depression is unresponsive to psychological therapy.<\/p><p>  Depression may be associated with an increased risk of suicidal thoughts, self-harm and suicide.  This risk may persist, particularly in the early stages of treatment when a patient starts to take an anti-depressant until significant remission of their depression occurs. <\/p><p>  Across the EU, the product information documents (the Summary of Product Characteristics (&lsquo;SmPC&rsquo;) and the Package Leaflet (&lsquo;PL)) are the main documents for communication of information and advice regarding a medicine. The format and content of these documents is laid down in legislation and regulatory guidance documents. The SmPC and PL are reviewed and approved as an intrinsic part of the licensing of a medicine. They are continuously updated for all medicines, to reflect the current state of knowledge of the medicine and the risks associated with its use. As such, it is considered important for healthcare professionals and patients\/carers to regularly read\/review these documents to support safe and appropriate use. It is important to note too, that the information included in the US &lsquo;black box&rsquo; is entirely consistent with that provided in the approved product information (SmPC and PL) for SSRIs in the EU.  <\/p><p>The SmPC is mainly intended for use by healthcare professionals and includes detailed information on the use, dosing recommendations, precautions for use and the known side-effects of the medicine concerned. The Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) is the competent authority for the regulation of medicines in Ireland. SmPCs for products currently authorised in Ireland are accessible from the HPRA website ().  The PL reflects the more comprehensive information described in the SmPC, but is required to be presented in an abbreviated and easy-to-read format and is subject to user-testing to ensure its ease of readability.  Healthcare professionals and patients are advised of the risk of suicide associated with SSRIs through the product information for the individual SSRI medicines which specifically highlight the need for monitoring of the patient following initiation of therapy: 'as improvement may not occur during the first few weeks or more of treatment, patients should be closely monitored until such improvement occurs'. The Package Leaflet accompanying these products advises that patients and their care-givers should be alerted about the need to monitor for any clinical worsening, suicidal behaviour or thoughts, or unusual changes in behaviour and to seek medical advice immediately if these symptoms appear. <\/p><p>  With respect to SSRIs used in children and adolescents aged 8 to 18 years with depression, the product information for SSRIs describes that treatment should be initiated and monitored under specialist supervision, with dose adjustments made carefully, on an individual basis, to maintain the patient at the most effective dose.  For children who respond to treatment, the need for continued treatment after 6 months should be reviewed.  If no clinical benefit is achieved within 9 weeks, treatment should be reconsidered. <\/p><p>  The HPRA, in conjunction with European counterparts, continues to review the safety of authorised medicines and takes appropriate regulatory action when necessary, including product information updates through the applicable authorisation framework for the medicines concerned.<\/p><p>  The HPRA emphasises the fact that all medicines have some risks and a small number of people may develop side effects (also known as adverse reactions). The decision to use a particular medicinal product for an individual patient rests with the healthcare professional treating the patient.  The clinician balances the risks associated with a medicine in the context of the overall benefit of the medicine to the health of the patient and the condition being treated. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200091#WRN04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Provision","counter":800,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200091#WRN05000"},{"type":"question","counter":801,"qnumday":305,"qnumall":"[33260\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200091#WRN05100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of persons that have been assessed as requiring a place at a day care centre in County Kildare, by day care centre, and by town; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":802,"qnumday":306,"qnumall":"[33261\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200091#WRN05200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the provision that has been made for allocation of additional resources to the operation of day care centres in County Kildare; the way in which he plans to reduce the 52 plus week waiting list for a placement; the way in which he plans to improve service provision; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":803,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 305 and 306 together.<\/p><p>As these are service matters they have been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200091#WRN05300","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Data","counter":804,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200091#WRN05500"},{"type":"question","counter":805,"qnumday":307,"qnumall":"[33262\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200091#WRN05600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of assessments of need of care that have been identified that attendance at a day care centre would be beneficial to a person's wellbeing; the number of persons on waiting lists; the way in which these waiting lists are managed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":806,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200091#WRN05700","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Carers Strategy Implementation","counter":807,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200091#WRN05800"},{"type":"question","counter":808,"qnumday":308,"qnumall":"[33263\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200091#WRN05900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he has carried out research into the provision of training and social outlets for those providing 24 hour care to family members; if research has been carried out on the social and personal needs of carers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":809,"qnumday":309,"qnumall":"[33264\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200091#WRN06000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if an assessment of the holistic needs of the population of adult carers in the home has been carried out; the way in which they might be supported to best care for loved ones in the home; the social support outlets and emotional supports available to such families; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":810,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 308 and 309 together.<\/p><p>The National Carers' Strategy was published in 2012.

The Plan aims to ensure that no patient who requires spinal fusion or other scoliosis procedures will be waiting more than four months for surgery by the end of the year, where that is appropriate clinically. The HSE has advised the Department that every patient, including children under the age of 14, who needs to be treated in 2017, has been considered and is included in the overall plan for scoliosis services.<\/p>  <p>  The Plan includes both measures to increase capacity in the children's hospitals as well as proposals to outsource some spinal procedures to other hospitals nationally and internationally. The Children's Hospital Group is monitoring progress made and is reporting to the Department on a weekly basis. Recent recruitment success has resulted in several new theatre nurses now in post in Our Lady's Children's Hospital Crumlin. Additional nurses and a consultant surgeon are due to commence work shortly which will increase theatre capacity by three days a week since the beginning of the year. <\/p>  <p>  While the Plan endeavours to deliver on short to medium term reduction in the waiting lists, in tandem the HSE is working to develop a long-term sustainable solution for scoliosis and paediatric orthopaedic cases.

It is the message of intent and the potential implications of that intent in the wider 12 to 200 mile zone that causes concern for the negotiations to come.<\/p><p>Under the Convention, the Irish fishing fleet has access to parts of the UK 6-12 mile zone while the UK fleet has similar access to parts of the Irish zone.The Irish fleet is not significantly dependant on this limited access. <\/p><p>I spoke with Secretary of State Michael Gove last week and stressed to him the importance of long established fishing patterns by the Irish fishing fleet and the importance of these being acknowledged and protected in the context of Brexit.  I have previously discussed fisheries issues amongst other matters with his predecessor as Secretary of State, Andrea Leadsom, on two separate occasions. I have also discussed Fisheries, with a particular focus on the London Fishing Convention along with general access issues with Minister George Eustice during a meeting at the Luxembourg Agriculture Council on the 3<sup>rd<\/sup>of April.<\/p><p>For this Government there are two clear objectives when it comes to fisheries and Brexit &ndash; the maintenance of our existing quota shares and our existing rights of access. This has, and will continue to be, my overriding priority. <\/p><p>To achieve these objectives, we must have unity of purpose across the Member States directly concerned and across the fishing industry. Disunity will only strengthen those in the UK that seek to exclude all EU fleets.<\/p><p>  As the negotiations develop unilateral sectoral announcements, like this one, will be dealt with, as this will be, within the Brexit negotiation process and there will be no room, or indeed intent, to address issues in isolation.<\/p><p>I am working closely with our fishing industry and held a dedicated meeting on Brexit involving all the Fishing organisations representing both the catching and processing sectors just the other week in Galway.<\/p><p>I maintain close liaison with the four Producer Organisations IS&amp;amp;WFPO, KFO, IS&amp;amp;EFPO and IFPO.  My officials are planning a meeting of the Sea Fisheries Liaison Group on the 19<sup>th<\/sup>of July which will involve further discussion with the POs on Brexit.I will remain in close contact with fisheries stakeholders as the issues develop and work with them and my fellow fisheries Ministers in the EU to ensure that we are all fully prepared for what are likely to be extremely complex negotiations.<\/p><p>In terms of support to mitigate any potential impacts from Brexit for the fishing industry, my Department&rsquo;s &euro;240 million EMFF Fund Operational Programme will directly assist the seafood sector to develop Brexit mitigation measures.  The Programme provides &euro;5 million to Bord Bia to supplement its normal seafood promotion work programme and this is allowing Bord Bia to have an Irish pavilion at many additional seafood trade fairs internationally.  This can be expected to lead to new export markets for seafood enterprises, particularly in Asia, thus assisting the companies concerned in diversifying their market outlets. <\/p><p>Last October, as part of Budget 2017, I announced measures aimed at alleviating the pressures of income volatility and the potential impact of Brexit.  These measures included an additional allocation of &euro;1.6m in 2016 and &euro;2m in 2017 to Bord Bia to ensure that they are in a position to provide Brexit-related supports to affected companies.  <\/p><p>Earlier this year I awarded over &euro;1.8 million in grants to 19 seafood enterprises under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund Operational Programme for the seafood sector.  The aim of these grants is to incentivise seafood innovation and new product development as a means of meeting the Brexit challenge.<\/p><p>I am continuing my ongoing round of bilateral meetings with Fisheries Ministers of the impacted Member States and I plan to hold bilateral meetings with my French and Spanish counterparts next week.  <\/p><p>In conclusion, I would like to assure the Deputy that I will be unequivocal in opposing any dilution of our existing EU quota shares, including protecting the benefit to Ireland of the Hague Preferences, and any limitations on our existing rights of access.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200093#WRP03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":895,"content":"<p>Question No. 339 answered with Question No. 338.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Basic Payment Scheme Administration","counter":896,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200093#WRP03200"},{"type":"question","counter":897,"qnumday":340,"qnumall":"[33178\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200093#WRP03300","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will he review the EU basic payment scheme to include willow as one of the crops eligible for the scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1323","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":898,"content":"<p>Under the Terms and Conditions of the 2017 Basic Payment Scheme, willow is included as an eligible crop.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200093#WRP03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"TAMS Payments","counter":899,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200093#WRP03500"},{"type":"question","counter":900,"qnumday":341,"qnumall":"[33220\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200093#WRP03600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the status of a TAMS payment for a person (details supplied).","asker":"1250","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":901,"content":"<p>A payment claim was submitted in this case.

Neither I nor the Department have a statutory authority to direct eir in this regard. <\/p><p>Quarterly updates on progress of the eir 300k roll-out will be published on my Departments website.\u00a0 The Q1 figures have been verified by my Department and the eir roll-out\u00a0is in line with the Commitment Agreement.<\/p><p>In April I published an updated High Speed Broadband Map which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie.\u00a0\u00a0This map finalises the\u00a0State Intervention Area for the procurement process and is an important milestone in the procurement process. The Map\u00a0shows the extent of \u00a0the State Intervention area and also the areas targeted for commercial services.\u00a0 The Map, which is searchable by address or eircode, has been developed by my Department using\u00a0extensive information obtained from commercial operators and\u00a0will be updated to show quarterly progress of the eir roll-out. <\/p><p>-  The BLUE areas represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or have\u00a0indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services,<\/p><p>-  The AMBER areas on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the areas that will require\u00a0State Intervention and are the subject of the current procurement process. <\/p><p>There are 89,565 premises in County Kildare, 13,371 or 15% of which fall within an AMBER area on the map and so will be covered by the State led Intervention under the NBP.  The remaining 76,194 are BLUE area premises\u00a0with 9,131 of these included in eir's 300K rural roll-out (showing as LIGHT BLUE on the map).<\/p><p>54% of the premises in Sarsfieldstown in Julianstown County Meath fall within an AMBER area and will be part of the State led Intervention under the NBP.\u00a0 The remaining 46% will be covered by the eir 300k roll-out. <\/p><p>The breakdown in the townland of Ballymore, County Westmeath includes 98% falling within the eir 300k coverage areas\u00a0with the remaining 2% being covered by the State Intervention.<\/p><p>Information on eir's planned rural deployment is available from eir at\u00a0  .\u00a0<\/p><p>The village of Castlebaldwin, County Sligo falls entirely within a BLUE area and will be provided by commercial operators. <\/p><p>I encourage members of the general public\u00a0who are in a BLUE area but who\u00a0cannot access a high speed broadband service\u00a0to contact my Department at broadband@dccae.gov.ie, quoting their eircode and query details.<\/p><p>Information on whether specific premises are in a BLUE or AMBER area can be obtained by accessing the High Speed Broadband Map and entering the premises Eircode at www.broadband.gov.ie. <\/p><p>My Department is in a formal procurement process to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area.  The State Intervention network will be a wholesale network and retail service providers will be able to use the network to provide enhanced broadband services to their customers.\u00a0<\/p><p>The procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years.\u00a0 The three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution. A fibre-to-the-home solution means that householders and businesses may get speeds not just of 30 Megabits per second but much higher, potentially up to 1000 Megabits per second.<\/p><p>With the finalisation of the map and following extensive dialogue with bidders, the procurement is progressing to the next stage.\u00a0 On 20 June 2017\u00a0my\u00a0Department wrote to the three bidders in the NBP procurement process inviting them to submit their &ldquo;Detailed Solutions&rdquo; by 26 September 2017.\u00a0 The 'Detailed Solutions' stage is the last stage of the procurement process before Final Tenders.\u00a0<\/p><p>The timeframe for the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders, during the procurement process. The Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best roll-out strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and\/or high demand.<\/p><p>The rate of demand for data services has increased\u00a0exponentially in the last four years and this presents a continuing challenge for\u00a0telecommunication operators, regulators and policy makers both in Ireland and internationally.  Recognising this challenge, I specifically included in the Programme for Government a commitment to a Mobile Phone and Broadband Task force.  In July 2016, I established the Task Force\u00a0to identify immediate solutions to broadband and mobile phone coverage deficits and investigate how better services could be provided to consumers, prior to the full build and roll-out of the network planned under the National Broadband Plan State intervention.  The report of the Task Force was published in December and\u00a0is available on my\u00a0Department's website.<\/p><p>In producing this report, the Task Force worked with Departments, local authorities, ComReg, State agencies, the telecoms industry and other key stakeholders.  The report contains 40 actions that will alleviate\u00a0some of the telecommunications deficits across Ireland and the implementation programme on mobile phone and broadband access identifies 19 of these\u00a0actions as areas where immediate and direct action by Departments and State agencies can ensure accelerated benefits to consumers.<\/p><p>In order to maintain momentum created by the Task Force, I established an Implementation Group\u00a0to drive and monitor the implementation of the actions, bringing together all key stakeholders identified in the Task Force report with responsibility for delivery.  This group will be formally reporting every 90 days on progress made on all actions.\u00a0 I published the first such quarterly progress report on 13 June 2017, which is available on my Department's website\u00a0 at http:\/\/www.dccae.gov.ie\/documents\/Taskforce%20Q1%20Progress%20Report.pdf\u00a0and which shows that considerable progress has been made, particularly in relation to the implementation of actions identified for Q1 2017. <\/p><p>The work of the Task Force will also assist\u00a0local authorities in preparing for the roll-out of the new NBP network once contracts are in place.<\/p><p>In addition, following regulations which I signed last year, ComReg recently announced the results of its auction for the 3.6GHz radio spectrum band, which means an 86% increase in spectrum capacity to meet the growing demand for mobile and wireless broadband services across rural and urban areas.  The Regulator has awarded 15 year licences for the rights of use in this band which will provide a degree of stability and create future investment certainty. Spectrum was also awarded in\u00a0lots\u00a0covering 9 urban and rural regions across the country.<\/p><p>In my Department's Estimates for 2017, I have secured an &euro;8 million provision for RTE to allow it to free up the 700 MHz spectrum band.  ComReg in turn will make plans to allocate this spectrum to provide for significantly enhanced mobile coverage.  The 700 MHz band is particularly suited to rural environments where the signal can travel long distances.<\/p><p>These initiatives should assist in enhancing the quality of mobile phone and data services across Ireland and particularly in rural Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200094#WRQ04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Waste Management Regulations","counter":964,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200094#WRQ04600"},{"type":"question","counter":965,"qnumday":364,"qnumall":"[33196\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200094#WRQ04700","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the fact that a bin company's contracts with customers give the company permission to access customers' homes without their knowledge or approval; his views on this; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1255","askee":"1234"},{"type":"question","counter":966,"qnumday":366,"qnumall":"[33244\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200094#WRQ04800","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"his views on plans by a waste company (details supplied) to levy hefty fines on customers for contaminated waste in view of the fact that the same company's terms and conditions forbids tampering with bins, meaning locks to same cannot be affixed, and therefore persons cannot fully control the type of waste that may be placed in their bins by third parties on the street.","asker":"1259","askee":"1234"},{"type":"question","counter":967,"qnumday":377,"qnumall":"[33532\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200094#WRQ04900","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the regulation in place to allow a waste company impose a fine for waste incorrectly placed in the wrong coloured bin.","asker":"1225","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":968,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 364, 366 and 377 together.<\/p><p>The terms and conditions of consumer contracts do not fall within my remit as Minister\u00a0for Communications, Climate Action and Environment.

The numbers applying for DCA have increased significantly since 2009, when the Department took over administration of the scheme from the HSE.

This began in January 2014 with the abolition of the State pension (transition), which had been available from 65 for those who satisfied the qualifying conditions, thereby standardising State pension age for all at 66 years. This is the current State pension age. It will increase to 67 in 2021 and to 68 in 2028.<\/p>  <p>  Reversing the abolition of State pension (transition) would have a significant Exchequer cost. In 2013, the cost of the State pension (transition) was &euro;137 million. Its abolition was not expected to save that amount of expenditure in full, as some people who were affected would alternatively claim working age payments such as Jobseeker's Benefit (albeit at a lower rate than the rate of the State pension), or may claim an Increase for a Qualified Adult in respect of their spouse&rsquo;s pension. However, it is estimated that well over half of the gross cost has been saved each year as a result of this measure, and this would be expected to increase as (a) the number of 65 year olds increases, (b) the change results in a higher percentage of people working while aged 65, and (c) there have been two Budget increases in the rate of the State pension since then. It is estimated that the net saving in 2018 is likely to be in the region of &euro;84 million, and this is expected to rise to &euro;87 million by 2020.

Rent supplement&rsquo;s means test is calculated to ensure that a person, after the payment of rent, has an income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to their family circumstances less a minimum contribution which recipients are required to pay.  The standard weekly minimum contribution is &euro;30 for a single adult household and &euro;40 for coupled households. Many recipients pay more than this amount because recipients are required, subject to income disregards, to contribute a proportion of assessable means towards their accommodation costs.

Measures of unemployment from the QNHS are based on International Labour Office (ILO) definitions.  To be &lsquo;ILO unemployed&rsquo; a person must in the week before the survey be without work but available for work and have recently taken specific job-search steps.  The Live Register, which captures those registering for unemployment benefits (including those working part-time and in casual work who draw partial unemployment payments), is an administrative record.  It is not the official measure of unemployment, but can give indicative trends.  My Department uses both Live Register and QNHS data for reporting and monitoring trends and adjusting policies accordingly at national level. <\/p>  <p>  This includes providing data and trends broken down by age categories and by duration of unemployment.  The QNHS data, being prepared as part of the EU-wide Labour Force Survey, also allow Irish trends to be compared with international developments. <\/p>  <p>  The Pathways to Work strategy, the key document setting out policy to facilitate the unemployed of all ages back into work, is underpinned by analyses of the labour market situation based on the statistical sources mentioned above. <\/p>  <p>  By allocating activation resources to persons on the Live Register, the government&rsquo;s policy tends automatically to focus on those areas and age-groups in which unemployment is most concentrated.  The focus on those most in need is further reinforced by the use of profiling to identify, among the newly unemployed, those most likely to face severe difficulties in re-entering employment.  People identified as having a low PEX (probability of exit from unemployment) score are prioritised for intensive engagement and support from the Intreo employment service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200098#WRU03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Pension (Contributory) Eligibility","counter":1174,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200098#WRU03500"},{"type":"question","counter":1175,"qnumday":440,"qnumall":"[33502\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200098#WRU03600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the extent to which progress has been made in addressing the issue whereby women are deprived of contributory pensions, having retired from the workplace while raising their families or due to the marriage ban, and who have made a major contribution to society in the course of their working lives; if their cases will be re-examined with a view to crediting them with sufficient contributions to enable them to qualify for State or retirement pension; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1176,"content":"<p>The State pension is a valuable benefit and is the bedrock of the pension system. There are two State pensions. The State pension (non-contributory) is a means-tested pension funded from taxation, whereas the State pension (contributory), is not means-tested and is paid from the Social Insurance Fund. Accordingly, it is important to ensure those qualifying for the latter have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives. To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension (contributory), all contributions, paid or credited, over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement.<\/p>  <p>  The homemaker's scheme makes qualification for a higher rate of State pension contributory easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties. The scheme, which was introduced in and took effect for periods from 1994, allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age, or caring for incapacitated people over that age, to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes, subject to the standard qualifying conditions for State pension contributory also being satisfied. This has the effect of increasing the yearly average of the pensioner, which is used to set the rate of his or her pension.<\/p>  <p>  The marriage bar describes a rule that existed in most of the public service, and some private sector employments, where women were required to leave their employment upon marriage. The practice was abolished in 1973 when Ireland joined the EEC. As it was a rule rather than law, women who were required to leave their employment upon marriage were entitled to take up alternative employment in the private sector, and many did. <\/p>  <p>  It is worth remembering that public servants affected by the marriage bar had paid a reduced PRSI, with no State pension (contributory) coverage. Accordingly, their continued employment in the public service would never have created an entitlement to the State pension (contributory). Instead, by impacting upon their continuing public service employment, the marriage bar&rsquo;s pension implications, where they exist, more generally relate to their eventual entitlement to a public service pension. Any questions regarding this issue are a matter for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p>  <p>  Where someone does not qualify for a full rate contributory pension, they may qualify for an alternative payment. If their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an increase for a qualified adult, amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension. Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State pension non-contributory, which amounts up to 95% of the maximum contributory rate.<\/p>  <p>  Work is under way to replace the yearly average system with a total-contributions approach. Under this approach, the rate of pension paid will more closely reflect the total number of contributions made by people, not when they paid them.  The position of homemakers is being carefully considered in developing this new system of calculating the contributory State pension.<\/p>  <p>  It is expected that this approach to pension qualification will replace the current one from 2020. Following completion of the actuarial review of the Social Insurance Fund later this year, a refined proposal will be developed. My Department will conduct a period of consultation with relevant stakeholders, including interest groups, representative bodies and the Oireachtas. Following the consultation period, I will submit a proposal to Government seeking approval for the new approach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200098#WRU03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Functions","counter":1177,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200098#WRU03800"},{"type":"question","counter":1178,"qnumday":441,"qnumall":"[33512\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200098#WRU03900","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the functions which her Department has or will assume from the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation following the appointment of the new Government; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1179,"content":"<p> Following the announcement by An Taoiseach on 14 June of the transfer of labour affairs and labour law responsibilities from the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to the Department of Social Protection, the process of identifying the functional areas, staff and resources that will transfer to my Department has begun.

We are extremely sorry for any worry or concern this may cause to parents\/guardians of children with additional care needs.  At present it is taking 20 weeks on average to finalise an application.  Applications are processed in date of receipt order.  There are a number of factors that have contributed to the extended time required to process claims;  <\/p>  <p>  First, there is a significant increase in the volume of applications being received.  The numbers applying for DCA have increased significantly since 2009, when the Department took over administration of the scheme from the HSE.  The year on year increase in volumes over recent years has consistently been in the 15-20% range due to an increase in population and more awareness of the scheme.  Over 1,000 claims were received in May, along with a further 700 in June; whereas the average would have been 400 per month a few years ago. <\/p>  <p>  Secondly, following a High Court ruling in 2016, there is now a need for the Department&rsquo;s medical assessors to provide the deciding officer with a more detailed opinion on the child&rsquo;s eligibility for the scheme and for the deciding officer in turn to provide more detailed reasons for their decision when communicating this to the customer.  These factors have resulted in the time taken to finalise applications increasing significantly and as a result the numbers being processed have reduced and the timescale to finalise each application has increased<\/p>  <p>  Corrective actions are being taken, with additional deciding officers assigned to work on the scheme.

Up until then, Defence Forces pensions were generally increased in line with, and from the same operative date as, relevant pay increases applied to serving military personnel.  Such public service pension increases normally required the prior approval of the Minister for Finance\/Public Expenditure and Reform.  Since then, no increase in military pension rates has been authorised as there were no relevant pay increases for serving PDF personnel during that period. The same situation has applied across the public service.  Instead, the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (FEMPI) Acts 2009 &ndash; 2013 reduced public service pay and pension rates.<\/p><p>I would refer the Deputy to the reply from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to Question numbers 373 and 378 on 20 June 2017 on the question of public service pension increases.<\/p><p>In his reply, the Minister said that in the past, the occupational pensions of public service pensioners were generally adjusted in line with changes in the wages or salary of the pensioner's grade at retirement. Sometimes referred to as &quot;pay parity&quot;, this non-statutory linkage lapsed in 2010, when the values of pensions in payment were left unchanged notwithstanding salary cuts at the beginning of 2010which affected all public servants under the financial emergency legislation. <\/p><p>Due to a grace period associated with the 2010 salary cuts, public servants who retired in the 26 months following those cuts, that is, in the period up to end-February 2012, had their pensions based on the higher&lsquo; pre-cut&rsquo;salary levels.  This has led to the current situation whereby post February-2012 retirees, on a like-for-like basis, mostly receive lower pensions than their earlier-retired counterparts. <\/p><p>In addition, since the beginning of 2011 a progressively structured &quot;Public Service Pension Reduction&quot; (PSPR) has decreased the rates of public service pensions above specified thresholds.  A significant part-reversal or unwinding of PSPR is under way as set out in the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2015.<\/p><p>The Minister in his reply on 20 June 2017 went on to say that the lapsing of pay parity along with the pension differential arising between pre and post-2012 retirees, have created the conditions under which &ndash; as we move beyond &quot;FEMPI&quot; legislation and the progressive removal of the Public Service Pension Reduction (PSPR) towardsmore normal pay and pension setting conditions in the public service &ndash; theissue of how to adjust the post-award value of public service pensions, through appropriate pay or other linkages has required consideration.<\/p><p>In this context, the Minister referred to Section 6.2 of the proposed Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 &ndash; published last month &ndash; which indicates that over the duration of that agreement if ratified, policy on public service pensions in payment will be guided by the following three elements:<\/p><p>First, the need to adopt an equitable approach to the various public service pensioner cohorts differentiated by date of retirement (in particular pre and post end-February 2012) is affirmed.<\/p><p>Second, for those who retired or will retire after end-February 2012, to the extent that they retired on reduced salaries for pension award purposes, they will receive pension increases in line with pay increases received by their peers currently in employment, in accordance with the terms of the collective agreement.<\/p><p>Third, when alignment is achieved between pre and post end-February 2012 pensioners, as will happen progressively for salary ranges up to &euro;70,000 in 2020 under the proposed collectiveagreement, pay increases will continue to benefit pensions in payment for the duration of the agreement.<\/p><p>Finally, a s regards the progressive removal of the Public Service Pension Reduction (PSPR) from pensions in payment, this is happening in three stages over the period 2016 to 2018.  When complete on 1 January 2018, it will mean that most public service pensioners are not affected by PSPR.  I understand that by virtue of the 2016\/2017 changes, about 90% of military pensioners are not impacted by the PSPR at all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200101#WRX00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Personnel Data","counter":1322,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200101#WRX00900"},{"type":"question","counter":1323,"qnumday":491,"qnumall":"[33128\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200101#WRX01000","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the details of figures for the strength of the Permanent Defence Force with regard to all three services and all ranks; the gender breakdown of same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1336","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":1324,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to maintaining the stabilised strength of the Permanent Defence Force at 9,500 personnel, comprising of 7,520 Army, 886 Air Corps and 1,094 Naval Service as stated in the 2015 White Paper on Defence.

Ireland can support the development of an inclusive PESCO which delivers, through modular streams, essential capabilities for Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) operations in the area of international crisis management. An agreed governance structure, the types of collaborative projects and initiatives Member States are willing to commit to, and a clear rationale as to the requirement for these to be addressed through PESCO, needs to be firstly determined before PESCO can be formally established.  Member States, supported by the EDA and EEAS are continuing to work together in order to consider and develop a shared understanding of the common commitments, goals and criteria on the basis of the relevant provisions of the Treaty, as well as the governance model.   <\/p>  <p>  Further meetings are scheduled to take place later in July and August to develop this further and where it is hoped that the common criteria and conditions for participation can be further elaborated and defined.

That said, given the significant role the UK has played in relation to the evolution of CSDP, it is likely that Brexit will have some impact on future developments in the Defence sphere at EU level. Until however the UK has indicated what kind of relationship it will seek with the EU in the CSDP area and negotiations have been finalised, it is impossible at this juncture to predict future possible outcomes in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  At Department level, structures that have been put in place to address the potential challenges arising from Brexit include the assignment of responsibility to a senior official at Assistant Secretary General level in relation to Brexit related matters.  The senior official is leading the Department&rsquo;s input to deliberations within the framework established across Government and is supported in that role by a number of branches in the Department.  The senior official represents the Department on the Interdepartmental Group on EU-UK Affairs which is chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach and is engaged with the identification of key strategic, operational and policy issues arising from Brexit.  In addition, the Management Board is acting as a clearing house for Brexit and maintains oversight on an ongoing basis.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Government has adopted a contingency framework to deal with all issues arising in respect of the UK vote to leave the EU. Accordingly, any issues arising, including those within the Defence area, whether bilateral, or in respect of developments in CSDP, or regarding our wider international multilateral defence engagements, will be also addressed within that framework.  Following on from publication of the document setting out the Government's approach to the Brexit negotiations, work is underway across departments to prepare adaptive Sectorial Brexit Response Plans to mitigate emerging sectorial challenges. These plans will build on ongoing cross-Government research, analysis and consultations with stakeholders, and will encompass the following themes:<\/p>  <p>  - Sustainable fiscal policies to ensure capacity to absorb and respond to economic shocks, not least from Brexit;<\/p>  <p>  - Policies to make Irish enterprise more diverse and resilient, to diversify trade and investment patterns, and to strengthen competitiveness;<\/p>  <p>  - Prioritising policy measures and dedicating resources to protect jobs and businesses in the sectors and regions most affected by Brexit;<\/p>  <p>  - Realising economic opportunities arising from Brexit, and helping businesses adjust to any new logistical or trade barriers arising;<\/p>  <p>  - Making a strong case at EU level that Ireland will require support that recognises where Brexit represents a serious disturbance to the Irish economy. <\/p>  <p>  Having regard to the bi-lateral arrangements already in place, and the fact Brexit does not give rise to fundamental strategic issues for Defence Forces operations or for Ireland&rsquo;s continuing engagement in the EUs Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP), it is not considered that a specific sectorial response plan in the Defence sphere is necessary at this time.  Such a requirement will be kept under constant review and all potential consequences in the defence sphere, arising during these negotiations, will remain the subject of ongoing consideration by my Department throughout this process.  The Government is under no illusions about the complexity of these negotiations.  In that regard, I wish to reassure the Deputy that my Department is monitoring the ongoing situation to ensure that the Department and the Defence Forces are well prepared to address any potential issues arising in the defence area on foot of Brexit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071200101#WRX03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"}]
