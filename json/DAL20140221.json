There are question marks over the Department of Justice and Equality, over politicians administering justice and over the garda&iacute;.  This is the first of two Bills I intend to introduce in this House to establish the independence of the garda&iacute; and the Judiciary from the Government.  The Department of Justice and Equality is the most vulnerable to political interference and patronage.  Since the foundation of this State the appointment of judges has, unfortunately, been regarded as part of the spoils of war; judicial appointments have been dished out as rewards to those who have been loyal to political parties at times of electoral contest.  That is indisputable.<\/p><p>  The effect is twofold: not all appointments are made on merit, and some people who should be appointed are excluded because of their political colour.  I see the arguments made on both sides, and those opposing this Bill, if there are any, will agree today that we should not exclude people because of their political beliefs or colour, and they will say this Bill attempts to do that.  It is not an attempt to do that.  It is an attempt to appoint people independently, and exclusively on merit, if that is possible.  It is certainly intended to exclude the obvious political interference and preference which has gone on in all parties in the appointment of judges to all courts.  This does not apply only to judges but to garda&iacute; as well.  I asked the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na yesterday to find out how many top garda&iacute; are politically appointed and I was very surprised to find that the figure is 200.  That is one of the symptoms of the crisis we face.  Political appointments should be outlawed from the appointment of top garda&iacute;.  It is equally important, before we have accidents or something awful happens, that judges are not politically appointed.  All judges are politically appointed; all judges are appointed by the Government.  This is not true in the case of the Garda but it is true of the judges of all courts.<\/p><p>  I do not want in any way to single out any particular party or appointment.  Fianna F&aacute;il was absolutely ruthless, when it was in office for many years, in appointing its own loyal lawyers to all courts, but this Government has been playing catch-up very effectively.  It is very easy for anyone in this House to examine the judicial appointments made by this Government and to identify people of a political colour, closeness to various Ministers or other politicians who have power in this House or influence elsewhere.  That system has to end.  We are lucky that we have not as yet had a very obvious accident in which a judge has made what is quite obviously a political judgment.  That is true.  I cannot point to one.  It would be very difficult to prove that a judge had made a decision because he or she was a member of a political party and that affected the verdict.  It cannot be proved because it is in the mind.  It is obviously a possibility and a system which is vulnerable to that criticism.  It is also wrong that those who are in political parties should be rewarded with very lucrative and, in certain situations, soft jobs.<\/p><p>  The present system was established in 1995 when the Courts and Court Officers Act was introduced following a political spat between Fianna F&aacute;il and the Labour Party when they were in government together over the appointment of the President of the High Court.  Until then, appointments were blatantly political as a result of lobbying and the preferences of Ministers.  There was such a hell of a row that the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, JAAB, was set up to give the impression that judicial appointments were now being made on merit, but there was a big problem with that board.  It was a fig leaf.  All of the appointments bar two on that board were political: three were directly made by the Minister, and others were <i>ex officio<\/i>, such as the Attorney General and the Presidents of the High Court, Supreme Court, District Court and Circuit Court, all of whom are political appointees.  JAAB - it was known as &quot;JAABs for the boys&quot; in the Four Courts - operated an extraordinary system and still does.<\/p><p>When a vacancy arises, applications are made to the JAAB, as advertised.  Following that, JAAB makes a recommendation, which goes to the Minister.  JAAB does not hold any interviews.  In that period, although it has power to hold interviews, it does not hold them.  For each vacancy it recommends normally seven particular candidates, whose names then go to the Minister.  The Minister and the Government choose from that seven and send the name on to the President, who then appoints the judge.  It is not just that there are seven candidates to give the Minister a wide choice - they can always find a loyalist to put into power - the problem is worse than that.  The Minister does not have to take a blind bit of notice of JAAB if he does not want to do so.  He, as it was at the time it was set up by a Fine Gael-led Government, or she can simply appoint somebody else.  However, it is available as a type of fig leaf to give the impression that there is a weeding out and selection process.  It is a farce, and it is acknowledged that it is a farce.  <\/p><p> The current system is not even approved of by the Judiciary.  It is important to point out that judges, the members of the Judiciary, are deeply embarrassed by the fact that so many of their own number are appointed partly because of their political allegiance.  I will quote two lines from a submission made by the judges in a public consultation recently where they stated:<blockquote>As a matter of principle, political allegiance should have no bearing on appointments to judicial office.  Early acceptance of this principle is essential to a transformation of the appointments process.<\/blockquote>In other words, they are saying the appointment of their colleagues should be taken out of political patronage because it is discrediting those who are particularly adept and rightly respected for the jobs they are doing.  That is a powerful testimony to what I am stating.<\/p><p> My Bill hopes to address this in a radical but extremely effective way and, unfortunately, it is necessary to address it in a constitutional way because some of us on the Independent benches do not trust either political parties to implement a Bill which guarantees the independence of the Judiciary.  I say that as one who has watched for a very long time what are blatant abuses in some cases, particularly in terms of appointments to the District Court.  Most party politicians will tell one that they are lobbied extensively by local solicitors looking for appointments to the District Court, and quite often it is an effective form of lobbying.  It is extraordinary how sought after these jobs are, and to give the Minister of State an example, in terms of applications to the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, there are usually over 100 applications for each place in the District Court.  That must be some job.  That is the reason there is such a wide and effective lobby for these positions.  They are sought after, politically appointed and are lobbied for still, and those names go to JAAB and then to the Minister.<\/p><p> I propose in my Bill that judges should be introduced on merit and should guarantee their independence.  I will outline the two layers of selection that are suggested and constitutionally imposed in this Bill.  JAAB should be abolished and replaced by a judicial appointments council or board, whichever the Minister wants to call it, which is drawn from a broad spectrum of society.  There would be no room in that judicial appointments council for any judges because the Bar Council and the entire legal profession is a home for insiders.  There would be no room for any judges or any <i>ex officio<\/i>legal representatives from the Law Society of Ireland or the Bar Council but rather candidates would be drawn from a broad spectrum of society.  That could include legal academics who would have a knowledge of the law and of the people.  It could include ordinary citizens and community groups, but it would not allow insiders to push their nominees onto the bench.<\/p><p> The second layer would be an Oireachtas committee which would receive the names of those who had applied to be judges, debate those names and then send them to the President.  The Government would be bypassed completely.  The Oireachtas would have a role in this but the security in this particular committee is that there would be an Opposition majority on that Oireachtas committee.  There would be no way the Government could impose its way as it did in the past, and the Opposition would have a veto on that.  That is the most important part of this Bill.  The rest of the detail could be provided by law but if there was an Opposition majority, we would no longer have a system where political patronage would rule.  People would be nominated by citizens and a judicial council.  They would then go before an Oireachtas committee which would hold interviews, unlike JAAB, and would then nominate individuals and send the names to the President.  Those interviews could be held in public to allow the public scrutinise them because in regard to judges, and we have noticed it in this House in recent days, it is almost taboo-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022100003#A00300","speaker":"953","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392977400,"counter":9,"content":"<p>They are very sensitive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022100004#B00200","speaker":"1017"},{"type":"speech","time":1392977400,"counter":10,"content":"<p>-----to mention the name of a judge or to criticise the appointment of a judge or anything like that in this House.

I want Deputy Ross to give me an example of this.  He referred to the fact that an accident has never happened.  I want an example of an accident that might have happened.  I suggest that an accident has not happened because we have an independent Judiciary which has exercised its powers throughout the history of our State independently of political influence from this or any other Government.  In the remainder of my contribution I will address the substance of the Bill introduced by Deputy Ross but I still want him to provide an example that would underpin his claims.  Since 1922 we have had a robust and independent Judiciary but apparently Deputy Ross and his Independent colleagues believe they are the only people who can be trusted to appoint our judges.  Members of the Irish Judiciary point out that they are ranked among the most independent in the world.  I assume Deputy Ross is not saying otherwise in respect of our judges.<\/p><p>  Over the past three years, the Minister has been in a position to closely observe how the existing system of judicial appointments is operating and he has already formed the view that it is very much of its time.  He believes reforms and improvements can be made to render the system more transparent and accountable while also ensuring that the independence of our Judiciary is fully protected and that the Judiciary continues to be respected by the Irish people and internationally.  The Minister believes that the current system of appointing judges could benefit from a review and, as I already mentioned, he initiated a consultation process in December as a first step in such a review.  Indeed, it is important to say that this is the first such open consultation to take place on the statutory provisions applicable to judicial appointments since the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board was established, and the Minister is to be commended for that.  The Minister believes it is important that reforms applicable to this area derive from a considered consultative process, public debate and debates in this House, and are not simply magicked up like a rabbit out of a hat without any serious consideration being given to the implications of what is actually proposed.<\/p><p>  Deputies will be aware that, under the Constitution, judges are appointed by the President on the advice of the Government.  The current process for the appointment of judges in Ireland is set out in sections 12 to 17 of the Courts and Courts Officers Act 1995, which established the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, JAAB.  The system provided a structure through which applicants wishing to be considered for judicial appointment may submit written applications to the JAAB providing information on their education, professional qualifications, experience and character.  Amendments to the Act in 2002 rendered practising solicitors eligible for appointment to all of our courts.  This was a move originally advocated by the Minister some years earlier and as a consequence both solicitors and barristers in legal practice for a designated number of years are eligible for appointments to each of our courts from the District Court up to and including the Supreme Court.  The JAAB, which was established to recommend persons for judicial positions, consists of the Chief Justice, the Presidents of the High Court, Circuit Court and District Court, the Attorney General, a practising barrister nominated by the chairman of the Bar Council, a practising solicitor nominated by the president of the Law Society, and no more than three persons appointed by the Minister for Justice and Equality.  The role of the board is to identify persons, through their own application or the board's invitation, who are suitably qualified for judicial office.<\/p><p>  The current criteria for appointment as a judge are set out in sections 16 and 17 of the Courts and Courts Officers Act 1995.  The board cannot recommend the name of any person unless in the opinion of the board the person concerned has displayed in practice as a solicitor or barrister a degree of competence and a degree of probity appropriate to and consistent with the appointment concerned, is suitable on grounds of character and temperament, is otherwise suitable and complies with section 19 of the Act.  Short-listing is expressly on the basis of competence and merit, not political affiliation.  The remit of the board excludes the offices of the Chief Justice and presidents of the other courts.  Where the Government proposes to appoint a person who is already a judge, the board is not involved.  In addition, the Standards in Public Office Act 2001 requires applicants to certify that their tax affairs are in order.  While the decision as to who should be recommended to the President for appointment to judicial office rests with the Government, it has been the practice of this Government to recommend to the President for appointment only persons who have been recommended as suitable for appointment to judicial office by the board.  The only exception to this is where existing members of the Judiciary have been promoted to a higher court.<\/p><p>  The fourth progress report of the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution stated:<blockquote>This\u00a0recent\u00a0procedure\u00a0supersedes\u00a0the rather informal process pursued by successive governments who were seen to appoint, almost invariably,\u00a0their own supporters\u00a0to judicial\u00a0office.  There is\u00a0 no evidence,\u00a0it\u00a0should\u00a0be\u00a0noted,\u00a0that such\u00a0appointees\u00a0displayed\u00a0favouritism\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0party\u00a0that\u00a0appointed\u00a0them.  The new\u00a0procedures were introduced because there was pressure on governments to ensure transparency\u00a0in\u00a0appointments.<\/blockquote>It should be remembered that the board is given complete freedom to establish its own processes.  Indeed, it is given express statutory power to engage in certain functions to assist it in the performance of its critical task, including a remit to interview applicants for judicial office.  Unfortunately, this has not happened to date, but in a recent letter to the Minister, the Chief Justice said the board was now considering doing so, and the Minister welcomes this proposed initiative.  The manner in which the board fulfils its statutory functions is, of course, the responsibility of the Chief Justice.<\/p><p>  The Minister is of the view that the current legislative arrangements under which JAAB operates require change to assist it in the important work it is required to undertake and to provide to the Government more information and greater assistance in the making of judicial appointments.<\/p><p>For reasons of political accountability, the Minister is satisfied that the current constitutional arrangements, which require that ultimately it is the responsibility of Government to recommend to the President those to be appointed to the Judiciary, should remain as they are and that they have well served the test of time and are in the public interest.  This position is both informed and supported by previous work undertaken by the Constitution Review Group and by this House on judicial appointments.  I note in particular the comments of the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution in its Fourth Progress Report:<blockquote>The independence of the judiciary might suggest that the executive should have no discretion in the appointment of judges.  But, since the judiciary is an organ of state, it must ultimately be held accountable to the people. As Chief Justice Finlay put it [in 1998]:<br \/><br \/>At the end of the day somebody must be accountable for the standard and type of judiciary that is appointed.<\/blockquote>The Constitution Review Group of 1996 also considered whether the power to appoint judges should be taken out of the hands of Government and given to the President or some other body.  It considered the provisions of the Courts and Court Officers Act 1995 and concluded:<blockquote>The committee takes the view that our present system of appointing judges should be retained.  It feels that the government has sufficient non-partisan advice from the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board and that it, as the executive of the elected representatives of the people, should retain the final decision.<\/blockquote> In this Bill, Deputy Ross proposes that Members of the Oireachtas should choose our judges, but only those unconnected to political parties-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022100005#C01300","speaker":"1007","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392978600,"counter":27,"content":"<p>That is not true.

The rule of law is the bedrock of democracy of our society.  It means all citizens can rely on a set of predictable, stateable rules to govern society that are independently interpreted.  As a third branch of government, the Judiciary has a pivotal role to play in the stability and continuity of the State through the application of the rule of law.  Ensuring we have best and brightest wielding the gavel, independent of political or personal pressure, is vital to the proper administration of justice in the State.  The ongoing debate about how we appoint judges is an important discussion that directly has an impact upon the concept of democracy.  The Minister's consultation period on the future of the appointments process has prompted a lively debate on how best to structure our judicial branch.  We have seen the hard-hitting document of the judicial appointments review committee, composed of senior judges, and the comments of Chief Justice Susan Denham on the principle that political allegiance should have no bearing on appointments to judicial office.  The report stated: &ldquo;It is increasingly clear that the relative success of the administration of justice in Ireland has been achieved in spite of, rather than because of the appointment system&rdquo;.  That body represents 90% of Ireland&rsquo;s judges.  The comments must be taken in the context of an appointments system that governed the judges now making such comments.<\/p><p>  There are real concerns about how we appoint judges that need to be addressed.  With regard to judicial powers, the Judiciary is far from non-political.  Article 40.3&deg; of the Constitution allows judges to take an activist approach to interpreting the Constitution.  Their decisions have direct political consequences.  The existence of unenumerated rights in the seminal 1965 Ryan case has transformed how our Constitution has evolved.  It has meant the fundamental law of the land has been able to adapt to a rapidly changing country as judges are empowered to find rights in the Constitution that are not explicitly enshrined.  It has also means the Judiciary has wide discretion in interpreting the spirit of the Constitution, not simply what is explicitly written in the document.  This gives them real political power.  Rights such as the right to privacy in the 1974 McGee case, legalised contraception in Ireland or the controversial 1992 X case that found the right to travel have all been deeply political decisions.<\/p><p>  It is also worth noting that, this weekend, the Constitutional Convention will debate whether to endorse the enshrinement of socioeconomic rights in the Constitution.  This would expand the powers of the Judiciary to cases beyond the current civic and political rights contained in the Constitution as it stands.  This level of political influence on the type of society we have and the rules that govern it underlines the need for this debate and for transparency on who we appoint to these highly sensitive and influential positions.<\/p><p>  Deputy Ross&rsquo;s Bill takes a radical approach to the issue and involves a referendum to reform the appointment process.  Setting aside the immediate argument of whether to change the appointment process in the Constitution, the complex challenge of passing it via a referendum under Article 46&deg; presents a real practical problem.  The failure of the Seanad and Oireachtas inquiries referendums revealed the understandably sceptical approach Irish people take to constitutional amendments.  Even the children&rsquo;s referendum, seen by many as a valid issue with complete cross-party support, was opposed by 42% of voters on an abysmally low turnout of 33%.  A referendum on changing the appointments process would instantly face the headwinds of voter fatigue on constitutional change and innate scepticism in upholding the Constitution.  If a referendum was to be held before the next general election in early 2016, it would be posed alongside the promised marriage equality referendum, possibly in 2015.  If not, the issue will be part of the general election campaign and be entrusted to a new Government. <\/p><p>  Fianna F&aacute;il believes we can take a constructive approach to changing the system without the need for a referendum.  Fianna F&aacute;il has introduced legislation to tackle the longstanding problems in the judicial appointments process.  Our Bill is based on the declaration of the European Network of Councils for the Judiciary on the recruitment and appointment of members of the Judiciary.  At present, the law simply requires the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board to recommend to the Minister for Justice and Equality at least seven persons for appointment to that judicial office.  The Minister may or may not accept the recommendation.  Under our Bill, a new judicial appointments board would be established and the existing Judicial Appointments Advisory Board would be abolished.  Instead of recommending seven persons for appointment to judicial office, the judicial appointments board would recommend for appointment by the Government candidates who it would certify as the best candidates for appointment to that judicial office.  This would ensure high calibre candidates are drawn upon to fill judicial vacancies.  This process would be fully open and transparent, in contrast to the behind the door approach taken to date with the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board.<\/p><p>  The judicial branch is a vital part of our system of government.  It is the cornerstone of the rule of law.  Having a genuinely independent Judiciary, free from political pressure, is central to a functioning democracy where citizens have recourse to justice.  It is also a deeply powerful position with real political consequences.  We need to construct an appointments system that reflects this pivotal role.  Fianna F&aacute;il has put forward its proposals based on European best practice to create an open, transparent and reliable system of appointments.  Our Bill will not require constitutional change and can be legislated for by the Government immediately.<\/p><p>  The challenge is to balance the independence of the appointments process with accountability.  It is a difficult balancing act.  There is a certain inconsistency in the Bill proposed by Deputy Ross.  I listened to him and I have spoken to him and I appreciate what he is trying to achieve.  I have an issue with saying that all judges in the current complement have been politically appointed and saying that it is wrong without backing it up by pointing to any wrongdoing.  Taking the appointments process away from the present system and giving it to an Oireachtas committee is a little hypocritical.  This is saying the current political process is wrong but moving it to committee of the House is similar and a parallel political appointment process.<\/p><p>  One of the biggest sectors in Irish society is the local government sector.  The most powerful people in it are local authority managers, who are appointed by an independent commission.  They have huge reserved executive powers and the local authority members, who are directly elected by the people, cannot challenge them.  I think that is wrong.  They are appointed by a body that is answerable to no one.  We need an appointment system for the Judiciary where someone can be held politically accountable and answerable.  We will not get it if we have a system behind closed doors that locks out public representatives.  Public representatives, of the Government side or otherwise, must have a say in the appointment of judges.  There has been criticism of the current Judicial Appointments Advisory Board but, to its credit, only two judges have been removed for obvious reasons in the public domain.  These are former judges Curtin and Heather Perrin.  No screening appointments process would have screened what they were up to, which led to their removal from the bench.  That must be said in the defence of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board.  It is a welcome debate but we must have accountability of government and independence in the appointment of the Judiciary.  I do not subscribe to removing everything and giving the appointment of senior positions to people who cannot be held accountable if something goes wrong.  Accountability is what is being in government is all about.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022100007#E00100","speaker":"1057"},{"type":"speech","time":1392979800,"counter":56,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak about Deputy Shane Ross&rsquo;s judicial appointments Bill.  I commend him for his preparation of the legislation.  My party, led by our justice spokesperson, Deputy P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn, published the Reform of Judicial Appointments Procedures Bill 2013 in January last year which, in a similar vein to Deputy Shane Ross's Bill, sought to increase transparency and accountability in judicial appointments.  Confidence in the justice system is contingent on having a Judiciary free from political control or political or other bias.  It is essential that there be an independent and impartial Judiciary which is representative of the community it serves.  A &quot;truly representative Judiciary&quot; would enhance confidence in the justice system, promote the development of a non-partisan Judiciary and advocate a culture of judicial independence.  Future judicial appointees should be drawn from a wide pool of qualified candidates that fully represents the community as a key step towards the eradication of a corrosive and unaccountable system of patronage.  We must not allow a &quot;jobs for the boys&quot; attitude to permeate something so fundamentally important as the administration of justice in the State.  As well as increasing transparency and accountability in the appointment of judges, we want to see a judicial council and complaints body that would hold judges to account, with a code of ethics by which they should abide.  This Government should be the very last to make political appointments to the Judiciary<b>.<\/b><\/p><p>  When we published our Bill last year, it was part of Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s campaign to end the political cronyism embedded in Irish society.  For too long we have all been aware of stories from across the State of judges being appointed after their loyalty had been demonstrated to either Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael, the Labour Party or the so-called Progressive Democrats.  The days of the old boys' club that has dominated the legal and political spheres in Ireland must come to an end.  An investigation undertaken by the <i>Irish Independent<\/i> - if I dare quote it - in November 2011 highlighted that one third of the country&rsquo;s judges had personal or political connections to political parties before being appointed to the Bench.  Some 56 of the 168 judicial appointees made since 1995 had such connections.  They were each appointed after the introduction of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, JAAB, an agency designed to take judicial nominations out of the political arena.  In the majority of cases, the judge's links were with one or other of the parties in government at the time the appointment was made.  In other cases, the judges were relatives of leading political figures.  Sinn F&eacute;in believes judicial independence is undermined by the current appointment process.  The Judicial Appointments Advisory Board was established in the wake of the controversial appointment of Harry Whelehan as President of the High Court in 1994 and meant to have removed sole discretion for judicial appointments from the Government.  However, there is still too much political involvement in the appointment of the Judiciary, as the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board merely provides a list of seven qualified candidates for the Government which, in turn, makes the appointments of judicial officeholders.<\/p><p>  Although in agreement with the intention of the Bill, Sinn F&eacute;in does not agree with the model Deputy Shane Ross prescribes.  It believes there should be as little political involvement in the appointments process as possible and this is where we differ from Deputy Shane Ross who in his Bill wishes to see the appointment of judges by the President on the nomination of a joint committee of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  In our Bill we propose to make the following changes to the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board make-up.  It should include the chairperson of the Irish Human Rights Commission who would be the chairperson of the board; the Chief Justice; the Presidents of the High Court, Circuit Court and District Court; the Attorney General; a practising barrister who would be nominated by the chairman for the time being of the Council of the Bar of Ireland; a practising solicitor who would be nominated by the President for the time being of the Law Society of Ireland; and not more than four persons appointed by the Minister who would be persons engaged in or have knowledge or experience which the Minister considered appropriate of commerce, finance, administration or persons who would have experience as consumers of the services provided by the courts that the Minister considered appropriate.  It is notable that the number of lay representatives to the board would be increased from three to four in order to ensure there would be meaningful lay representation in keeping with Good Friday Agreement equivalence obligations.  <\/p><p>  We have also sought to define the criteria for appointments more fully, as what we currently have is somewhat ill-defined and overly subjective.  Sinn F&eacute;in believes the criteria must be transparently meritocratic.  Section 10 of Sinn F&eacute;in's Bill would also oblige the Government to make public the reasons for appointing an individual to a position within the Judiciary.  Key to all our considerations in drafting was transparency and the restoration of public confidence in the system.<\/p><p>  I will briefly reference and recognise the work of the Judicial Appointments Review Committee led by the Chief Justice, Mrs. Justice Susan Denham.  At the end of last month she spoke out on behalf of the committee in a very welcome contribution on the need for a new system of judicial appointments, calling on the Government to depoliticise Ireland&rsquo;s &quot;unsatisfactory&quot; judicial appointments process and for the introduction of new laws to ensure judges were appointed &quot;on merit&quot;.  She also called for the establishment of an independent judicial council to oversee issues such as appointments, pay talks, complaints about judges and judicial education, warning that &quot;great damage&quot; was being caused by the absence of such a body.  These comments are very important in the context of Deputy ShaneRoss's initiative and she went on to say &quot;political allegiance should have no bearing&quot; on appointments to judicial office.  Sinn F&eacute;in's Bill was prepared and presented for the achievement of that very goal.  My party and I commend Deputy Shane Ross's addressing of the need for substantive reform, but we do not believe the model he has laid down before us is the best one to deal with judicial appointments.  That said, we are happy to support the passage of the Bill to Committee Stage, on which we would have the opportunity to properly debate it, amend it appropriately and, I hope, bring it more into line with the model proposed by us early last year, which is the better approach.  I thank Deputy Shane Ross for his work and hope the Minister will take this opportunity on board and allow us to progress to a system in which we would all have confidence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022100008#F00300","speaker":"969"},{"type":"speech","time":1392979800,"counter":57,"content":"<p>Before calling Deputy Joan Collins, I ask Members to be conscious of the number of speakers.

Successive Governments have exemplified in the minds of many people a system of political patronage with the Judiciary and Garda systems.  That is the feeling in many communities across the country.

I refer to FLAC, Advic and those with considerable experience in dealing with how decisions are made in the courts and how people are treated therein.  The nature of the judicial appointments board is to be decided but the principle in the Bill represents an important, radical change that would have a considerable impact on people's view of the judicial system.<\/p><p> It is important that there is clear water between politics, the judicial system and the Garda.  If there is no clear water, it can only lead to suspicion, even if there is nothing untoward.  In many cases, there have been miscarriages of justice not necessarily because of political patronage but because of the system itself.  That judges can be politically appointed adds to the problem, however.  That they can be friends, relatives and family members of those involved in politics presents a problem.<\/p><p> The Bill is very important.  The involvement of an Oireachtas committee with a majority of non-Government members is required, and this must be made very clear.  The Bill uses the wording, &quot;the majority of whom are not affiliated to the political parties who form the Government&quot;.  It is important that the process be seen to be taken out of the control of the Government.  We all know that when Fianna F&aacute;il was in power, there were Fianna F&aacute;il-appointed judges.  Under Fine Gael and the Labour Party, there have been Fine Gael-appointed and Labour-appointed judges.  This must change, as must the sense of privilege.  This Bill goes a long way towards that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022100008#F00500","speaker":"1032","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392980400,"counter":60,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Wallace for swapping his time with me today because I have to leave soon.<\/p><p>  I compliment Deputy Ross on introducing this Bill.  It is not a knee-jerk reaction but legislation that has been drafted carefully and examined over a number of years.  The Minister of State, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, read out the script of the senior Minister, Deputy Shatter, who is on Government business.  I understand the latter is at an informal meeting, a matter of defence.  I raised before the question of whether the Minister for Justice and Equality should be in charge of two Departments, responsible for both justice and defence.  I questioned that a number of times in this House.  The Minister's business is in Ireland today.  Considering all the turmoil, I suggest respectfully that he come to the House.<\/p><p>  The Minister of State asked for examples of where circumstances were a bit scary in respect of judges.  I can put my hand up and state I have personal experience that I can share.  It is well documented in the press and Deputy Ross's book.  There was the Fr. Niall Molloy case and colleagues have mentioned many others.  Mr. Justice Cooke - who has been appointed by the Minister for Justice and Equality to review what the latter, rather than anybody else, wants to review - his history is not unblemished.  Let me quote articles in this regard.  They are in the public domain in case the Acting Chairman is worried.  One headline states, &quot;Judge Cooke lands in the soup&quot;.  The Minister is now in the soup.  It was once said Mr. John Bruton would use a fork to try to eat soup.  If the Minister were eating soup these days, he would have a spring at it; that is what I think about him.<\/p><p>  Happily for all parties in the court case with Mr. Cooke and Mr. Seamus Maye, whom I happen to know and who has been blackguarded by the justice system and by this particular judge, he had to withdraw from the case.  Luckily for the judge, he did not know he had shares because he had advisers buying them for him.  He bought more after the court case began but luckily he did not know either.  We will give him the benefit of the doubt; he is so wealthy he did not know.  Is he the person the Government is now putting in charge of the important issues concerning the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission and the Garda whistleblowers?  This lacks any shred of credibility and it is disgraceful.<\/p><p>  An article by Dearbhail McDonald revealed that some senior judges had lost &euro;250,000 in various investments.  These investments include investments in Anglo Irish Bank.  Every day of the week we hear such stories.  In the case of IBRC, people are brought before the eminent justices who are up to their necks in the banks.  How could that be justice?  How could they be so removed and above political and human consideration when they have a vested interest in the banks and when they are under pressure to make repayments themselves?  What is happening stinks to high heaven.  The Minister of State, Deputy Donohoe, must know it; if he does not, I do not know what planet he lives on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022100009#G00200","speaker":"1090"},{"type":"speech","time":1392980400,"counter":61,"content":"<p>I have a point of order.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022100009#G00300","speaker":"957"},{"type":"speech","time":1392980400,"counter":62,"content":"<p>Excuse me, I am trying to be brief.

The Government has appointed more political associates since coming into office on this occasion.  It is actually punishing the previous Government for keeping it out of power for 14 years, during which time it could not get its boys in.  Last year the Minister for Justice and Equality put a referendum question to the people without debate so as to appoint a new layer of judges.

The suggestion that the judicial appointments council be composed of members selected from a broad spectrum of society is an interesting one and it would certainly improve democratic accountability. Since the current arrangement is wholly imbalanced, with seven out of ten representatives with a legal background on the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, some input or recommendation from a proposed candidate's peers or colleagues as to his or her merit and integrity could be beneficial.  In this regard, I suggest that a representative from the Bar Council or Law Society remain on the board of ten but that this influence be balanced by the remaining ten members, representing civil society.<\/p><p>  The proposed process provides a more even distribution and balance of power between the three arms of the State &ndash; Legislature, Executive and Judiciary.  The proposed arrangement is more faithful to the separation of powers principle enshrined in the Constitution than the current one, which excludes the Legislature almost completely from the process.  Unfortunately, the nomination of judicial candidates is just one example of this imbalance of power in our political processes whereby the power of the Executive &ndash; I mean the Cabinet rather than the Government &ndash; has been increased and concentrated at the expense and to the detriment of the power of the Legislature, which includes the entire D&aacute;il, even Opposition Deputies.  The delicate system of checks and balances intrinsic to the separation of powers principle has been gradually eroded within the current political system.<\/p><p>  A final example of what can go wrong when judicial appointments are political and when judges are too close to political parties is the case of Fr. Niall Molloy's murder.  Mr. Justice Frank Roe was appointed President of the Circuit Court just before Richard Flynn was tried for the manslaughter of Fr. Niall Molloy in 1986.<\/p><p>Judge Roe was a personal friend of Richard Flynn, the defendant.  Despite this fact, he first decided to assign the case to himself, in an extreme abuse of the power that came with his role as President.  He then withdrew the case from the jury after three and a half hours, without letting it consider any of the evidence and directed it to acquit.  One eye witness reported that the then deputy leader of Fianna F&aacute;il, Brian Lenihan Snr., was in the room which was the scene of the murder.<\/p><p> Although I welcome the eventual appointment of Dominic McGinn, senior counsel, to review the Garda investigation into the Fr. Niall Molloy murder and hope the facts and background to the case, to include its strongly political background, can finally be ascertained and that the family of Fr. Niall Molloy may gain some justice and peace, it is yet again a shame that this decision to review has only come after a delay of almost 30 years.  If the Minister, Deputy Alan Shatter, would only decide matters based on his ministerial responsibilities to justice rather than on political motivations and his own political survival, we might see more decisions based on transparency and accountability and fewer underhand tactics employed such as delay and confusion, dismissal of allegations, discrediting of real victims such as whistleblowers and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, and misrepresentation of law and fact.  These tactics never work on a permanent basis, as the Minister is now discovering to his peril.  The truth generally comes out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022100009#G02100","speaker":"956","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392981000,"counter":81,"content":"<p>I refer to the Minister of State's opening remarks regarding impartiality, independence of judges and political influence.  Many people in the country would say judges have an honourable record in terms of independence from the Government.  I cannot readily cite an instance where a judge's political background influenced a decision from the Bench.  However, if there is nothing wrong with the system, why is the Judicial Appointments Review Committee calling for radical change in how it operates?  Why are judges admitting on record to using political influence to ensure their appointment?  The president of the Association of Judges of Ireland, Mr. Justice Peter Kelly, during an interview acknowledged that people who would be excellent judicial appointments were passed over in favour of people who were not so well qualified.<\/p><p>  The manner in which successive Governments have appeared to appoint their own supporters to judicial office has been widely acknowledged.  There is no transparency in a system under which Ministers are handed a list of nominations and can select whatever appointee they choose, regardless of qualifications, skills or experience.  That is simply unacceptable in 2014.  The Judicial Appointments Advisory Board which was established in 1995 fell short of changing the appointment system.  The board is little more than a filtration system for the Government.  It has no input into interviewing candidates and does not hold any sway if the post refers to the presidency of the court or if the vacancy is being filled by promotion of a judge from a lower court by the Government.<\/p><p>  Public confidence in the Garda and GSOC has already taken an irreparable hammering.  How can a Government elected on a mandate of accountability and reform expect to retain public confidence in the justice system under the current structure?  It is not viable or acceptable.<\/p><p>  We are also doing judges a great disservice under the current system, since there is a common public perception that they received their appointment as a political perk on the basis that the party they support happens to be in government.  Our judges deserve better than this.  The newspaper section I was showing the Minister of State earlier is a two-page spread from the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>.  It shows 60 judges who all have close affiliations to Fine Gael, the Labour Party, Democratic Left, the Progressive Democrats and Fianna F&aacute;il.  Many of them were members of these parties.  It is indisputable that almost all judges are appointed under political influence.  The Minister of State should read the <i>Irish Independent<\/i> and about the 60 to 70 judges mentioned who all have close associations with political parties.  Actually, many of them have been members of parties, yet the Minister of State says there is no political influence.  That is unacceptable to the people.  In bringing the Bill forward Deputy Shane Ross is presenting the Government with a clear opportunity to prove it is not a proponent of jobs for the boys.  The people clearly want change, as does the Law Society of Ireland and the Chief Justice.  The only body fighting to preserve this defective system is the Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022100010#H00200","speaker":"1094"},{"type":"speech","time":1392981000,"counter":82,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Shane Ross for bringing forward this Bill.  First, I wish to draw attention to Article 35.2 of the Constitution which states, &quot;All judges shall be independent in the exercise of their judicial functions and subject only to this Constitution and the law&quot;.  Is our method of appointing judges in keeping with this?  I believe it is not.<\/p><p>  In the debate on Second Stage of the Twenty-ninth Amendment of the Constitution (Judges' Remuneration) Bill in September 2011 the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, said: <blockquote>The Irish Judiciary holds a unique place in the structure of our democracy, required daily to adjudicate on disputes between citizens and the other branches of the Government and for that reason it is vital that its independence is protected from all potential attack.  The respect for and confidence in judicial decisions is based on the confidence that every person who enters a court is secure in the knowledge that the judge is independent of the State and not subject to interference or threat irrespective of the outcome of the litigation.  This safeguard is fundamental to our constitutional system.  <\/blockquote>That indicates a thinking that there must be independence in how judges are appointed.<\/p><p>  The Minister of State asked us to give examples.  I will not bring forward examples, but I will refer to the remarks of the Chief Justice, Mrs. Justice Susan Denham, in her very unusual and rare intervention on behalf of all judges.  She said, according to an article in <i>The Irish Times<\/i> recently, &quot;It is increasingly clear that the relative success of the administration of justice in Ireland has been achieved in spite of, rather than because of, the appointments system.&quot;  That is a serious point.  Essentially, a democracy requires checks and balances.  For the last three weeks we have been consumed by an issue that arose because of the absence of the checks and balances required.  Clearly, there is the potential for a serious problem to arise.  The article continues by stating judges are critical of the flawed and deficient consultation initiated by the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter.  The Minister of State has lauded that process, but the judges say, &quot;Most fundamentally of all, however, the process itself is being initiated by a member of the Executive, and will apparently be decided upon by the Executive without further discussion.&quot;<\/p><p>  Our problem is that we have an over-centralised system of governance, in which the Executive has an enormous amount of power.  That is not what was intended by the framers of the Constitution.  There was to be a separation of power between the Executive and the Oireachtas.  As we saw in recent days, GSOC is supposed to report to the Oireachtas, but it was the Minister who appointed the judge and it was the Minister and the Attorney General who drew up the terms of reference.  The Government is exceeding its powers all the time, to the detriment of the Oireachtas.  That is very dangerous territory.<\/p><p>There are things about the Bill I would like to change but it needs at least to get to Committee Stage to refine it.  Under the current system the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, JAAB, cannot rank applicants for positions and the Government is not required to select from the list.  What is being sought is that people should be promoted on the basis of merit.  One of the improvements sought by Mrs. Justice Susan Denham is the provision of an education process within the legal system in order to determine suitability.  Only recently we saw the need for that when a judge clearly indicated a considerable lack of understanding in a rape case and the impact it had on a victim.  There are aspects of the courts system that manifestly need to change.  One of the first things that needs to change is how we appoint judges.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022100010#H00500","speaker":"1052","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392981600,"counter":84,"content":"<p>We all accept that transparency and accountability are very fine principles but we hear the words so much - there is possibly over-use &ndash; that there is a danger of them becoming clich&eacute;s and therefore meaningless.  We cannot allow that to happen because transparency and accountability are very much part of democracy and the democratic process.  The Bill also contributes to transparency and accountability.  Ba mhaith liom aitheantas a thabhairt don obair a dhein an Teachta D&aacute;la Shane Ross i gcomhair an Bhille seo.<\/p><p>  I was also struck by one aspect of Article 35, namely, that judges shall be independent in the exercise of their judicial functions.  It makes sense that the process of appointing judges is also an independent process and that it is visibly independent.  Various comments have been made about decisions made by judges within the system.  Like any system - human nature being what it is - decisions made by judges have been criticised by civil society groups, organisations and individuals where they were most unhappy with the decisions.  Taking judicial appointments out of the political arena could only enhance democracy.<\/p><p>  Individual members of the Judiciary have expressed their concerns about the system.  For example, the European Network of Councils for the Judiciary issued the Dublin declaration on standards for recruiting and appointing judges.  Chief Justice Denham saw it as a possible new standard for appointing judges.  The Minister welcomed the declaration.  He said a better architecture could be put in place than exists at present.  The Bill could be part of that architecture.<\/p><p>  There were a number of themes in the public consultation the Minister initiated.  Again, Chief Justice Denham raised one that he had omitted, namely, the need to recruit persons of highest quality and ability to the Judiciary.  Judges themselves in each of the courts are supportive of the call for a different process of judicial appointments.  We know that we are losing so much confidence in our systems and institutions, therefore it is vital that we start the process of restoring confidence.  Taking the appointment of judges out of the hands of the governing political parties is a step in the right direction.<\/p><p>  I was struck by a quote from a judge.  The point that was made is that it is increasingly clear that the relative success of the administration of justice in Ireland has been achieved in spite of rather than because of the appointment system.  The other telling words in the quote are &ldquo;relative success&rdquo;.  Judges perceive there to be difficulties within the system.  The current system is a flawed process.  In addition, it was said that the process of judicial appointment should first and foremost enhance the principle of judicial independence upon which the rule of law in our democracy is built.  That is what Deputy Ross&rsquo;s Bill is doing.<\/p><p>  I found one part of the submission by judges disquieting and disturbing.  It is where they make the point that high quality experienced candidates will not be attracted to the Bench because of recent changes to their pensions.  Judges are very well paid and they can look after their own pensions from the remuneration they receive.<\/p><p>  I support the idea of the broad spectrum of society but I have reservations about the process involving an Oireachtas committee.  I would prefer to see the entire system taken out of the hands of those in political life.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022100011#J00200","speaker":"1005"},{"type":"speech","time":1392981600,"counter":85,"content":"<p>I commend Deputy Ross on the publication of the Bill and bringing it before the House.

It does not add anything to today&rsquo;s debate.  In his contribution the Minister referred to how in December he announced a public consultation process on the formulation of proposals for Cabinet on how to change judicial appointments.  In the very next paragraph he made the point that he has already formed the view that the system of judicial appointments that is in operation is very much of its time.  One could ask why he announced a public consultation process if he believes there is nothing wrong with the system and it works perfectly.<\/p><p>  The Minister refers at another point to Deputy Ross&rsquo;s spurious and disingenuous claims.  The Minister is the king of spuriousness and disingenuousness because the tone and tenor of the response to the Bill smacks of that.  The fact that the Minister would allow such a claim to be made in the House is disrespectful.  The very least we could expect is that he would look at the legislation and provide a critique of it rather than being so rude in response to it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022100011#J00300","speaker":"1001"},{"type":"speech","time":1392981600,"counter":86,"content":"<p>The Minister should go.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022100011#J00400","speaker":"1017"},{"type":"speech","time":1392981600,"counter":87,"content":"<p>I understand the Minister could not guarantee that the Government would provide time to debate the Bill.

A number of speakers referred to the fact that the Judicial Appointments Review Committee said the system of judicial appointments in Ireland is demonstrably deficient.  That says a lot.  They said the system must be reformed so as to secure the selection of the very best candidates and contribute to the administration of justice in a manner that will sustain and enhance public confidence.<\/p><p>  It has been outlined by judges that there is a real risk that the best candidates will not be selected because they are not affiliated politically.  That is the approach the Bill seeks to change.  The political system that Fine Gael, Labour, Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats - when the party existed &ndash; are embedded in does not want such a change because they want to maintain a system of patronage.  When one examines the appointment of judges one see former chairpersons of cumanns, former town council mayors, former Deputies, former councillors and the children of former Deputies and councillors.

However, it is a lot more subtle than that because judges know that they got to where they are due to their political affiliations and they know at a subliminal level that they should not rock the boat in order to ensure the system continues.<\/p><p>  In its submission the Law Society said the current system whereby a list of potential names is supplied to the Government and the Cabinet chooses from the list leaves the system open to accusations of political allegiance, and that has played a part in appointments.  There is no doubt about it.  The only way one gets to be appointed as a judge is by having political allegiances.<\/p><p>  The Minister makes much play of the JAAB.   He describes it as being of its time.  He said that &ldquo;Unfortunately, to date JAAB has not conducted such interviews&rdquo;.  We have a judicial appointments board that has never conducted an interview of a potential candidate for a job.  That is a most unbelievable system that could operate in a democracy.

We need to change the situation in this country where people rightfully believe we are not all treated equally.<\/p><p>Whether a judge was corrupt, that judges were chosen to make certain decisions in a certain political direction is wrong.  I apply the same to this House.  It is no slight on anyone in the Chair, but the perception that there is bias in adjudication in this House is also corrosive.  This issue was broached by the Leader of the acceptable Opposition, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, yesterday when he suggested the Ceann Comhairle was not being fair to the Opposition.  I will let him make that call; one would not want to get into that argument, but the perception that there is a problem means that it is a problem.<\/p><p> My office in Castlerea has a window which looks out onto the courthouse, in which I have been a few times - I have actually been in prison a couple of times.  There is something very noticeable, whether one is in the dock in court or looking through my office window across at the court, and it is that it is the rich guys wearing their fancy clothing who decide the future of the poor guys.  This is not perception, it is fact.  Deputy Joan Collins came at it from the point of view that certain people did not have opportunities, which is correct.  It is from this point that the bias begins and it never goes away.  In this country it does not just end at this point.  A Roscommon man of the year can be killed and one can come in here and state senior politicians were there when the death occurred and no one even gasps or says, &quot;Stop, Deputy Wallace, do not say that.&quot;  No one can say that because what he said was true.  If one believes a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was involved in a rape or covering up a rape, how can one expect a victim to trust the system when a man of the year, a really well known man, Niall Molloy, was killed in the most dodgy circumstances of all time?  How can a citizen have any confidence in the system?<\/p><p> I am an atheist, but I am starting to believe there is a God because it is brilliant timing that Deputy Shane Ross's Bill has come out in the magic lottery.  While I agree to an extent - 99% - with the statement of the whistleblower, John Wilson, that people have nowhere to go, in another way this is the time, as there is a chink of light coming through the window which has been opened a fraction.  I challenge those people who have come to me, those who have not yet managed to come to me and those who have come to Deputies Clare Daly, Mick Wallace and Joan Collins to take advantage of the fact that there is oxygen and use it to boot open the window, even if there is a smashing of the glass and a ripping of the frame from the wall, and run through the hole to find freedom at last.  They should go on their local radio stations and tell their stories.  Whether they are members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who know what is going on, members of the public who are persecuted because they are single mothers and a target or because they have a relation who was killed and have not got justice, they should go on radio.  They should get onto their local politicians and ask them what they will do about it.  They should ring my office; in a way I cannot believe I am stating this because my office is already completely snowed under, but they should get in contact with us and we will get their stories out.  It is now or never.  There is oxygen and they should make use of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022100011#J00800","speaker":"1084","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392982200,"counter":92,"content":"<p>I am glad to have this opportunity to speak in the debate.  I commend Deputy Shane Ross for taking the initiative which is timely, given the backdrop to this debate.<\/p><p>  It is essential to have public confidence in the judicial system that the Judiciary be seen to be independent of the political system.  Patently this is not the case and I am disappointed by the Minister of State's response.  There was a time, not all that long ago, when he would not have dreamed of stating some of what he had to say this morning.  For a Minister of State so recently appointed he has learned many of the old tricks very quickly.  Challenging people to mention occasions on which the Judiciary displayed its political affiliations is an old trick.  The Minister of State knows the restrictions on us in doing this.  However, some have gone ahead and named names, but the Minister of State is very well aware of the restrictions on us.  As Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan stated, many civic society organisations and others outside the House have drawn attention to the political bias shown in many judgments.  Many of us share serious concerns about the political orientation of some judgments and some of the findings of various tribunals which clearly indicated a political bias.<\/p><p>  The system we have in place is not good for confidence in the justice system or the Judiciary.  It also does a disservice to those working in the legal area who aspire to becoming judges and are forced to play the game.  Nobody on either side of the House would deny a game is played.  If one wants preferment and promotion, there is no question but that one must kick with the right foot, depending on which parties comprise the Government of the day.  We have all seen this happen.  As somebody stated, the <i>Irish Independent<\/i> has drawn attention to this being the case.  The political affiliations of various appointees are very clear and we see it happen on a regular basis.  In the past I witnessed it in the party of which I was once a member.  If it looks like a party will get into government, suddenly members of the party who are members of the legal profession become very active and they are forced to do <i>pro bono<\/i> work for the party.  They are obliged to make donations and befriend members of the parliamentary party to have some chance of being promotion when the party is in government.  The system which operates is very unhealthy.<\/p><p>  The Government promised reforms, but it has not implemented any; it has not opened up the system or made it more transparent.  Fianna F&aacute;il engaged in this practice in spades during its time in government, but rather than tackling it, cleaning it up and introducing reforms, the Government wants to put its snout in the trough, just as the others had done for so long.  There is a strong sense that now they have their hands on the levers of power and access to the goodies, they will not waste them.  That is the clear impression one gets from Fine Gael, in particular, but also from the Labour Party.<\/p><p>  The system is unhealthy and undermines public confidence in the Judiciary.  It makes for a very unhealthy justice system.  This very much plays into the other major issues in the news which are the cause of so much concern to the public.  There is a clear lack of transparency and accountability.  Rather than the Minister challenging this attitude and how the system works, he is complicit in engaging in the type of cover-up we have seen in recent months and in a failure to champion and support those who had the courage to come forward and speak as whistleblowers in a system which was obviously problematic.  He failed to make it very clear that their role was very important and that those who had the courage to come forward and blow the whistle would have the support of the State in doing so and be encouraged.  The opposite has happened.<\/p><p>Unfortunately, the Minister, Deputy Shatter, has engaged in the opposite of such championing of openness and transparency.  Not only that Minister but the Taoiseach himself, the T&aacute;naiste and other members of the Government are complicit in that.  It is really disappointing and it is not surprising that in the kind of political culture of which the present Administration is very much part, the Government is not prepared to entertain the idea of a new approach to the appointment of the Judiciary because it wishes to keep the goodies to itself.  I reiterate my support for this Bill and commend Deputy Ross on bringing it forward.  It certainly is worthy of support and were they on this side of the House in different circumstances, many Members on the Government side would be absolutely supportive of this legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022100012#K00400","speaker":"1178","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392982800,"counter":94,"content":"<p>I will be brief.  I agree with the points made that the reverence displayed towards judges is unhealthy in any society that claims to be democratic.  If one says anything about or names a judge, one almost is accused of assaulting the independence of the Judiciary.  This approach is very similar to the approach that had been prevalent in respect of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Until recently, one never ever questioned the garda&iacute;.  If one does, one is subjected to an account of how crime is falling, how garda&iacute; lay their lives on the line every day and one almost might think one would be responsible for shooting them oneself.  The reality, of course, is there are good garda&iacute; who lay their lives on the line.  However, those people, like all other citizens in society, need a mechanism of accountability and transparency.  This really is the root of this issue and many of the problems that are coming to the fore and about which the dogs in the street are talking at present come from that political connection.  I refer to the axis of power that exists at present between the Minister for Justice and Equality and the politically-appointed Garda Commissioner.  There is no doubt but that the brave and well-documented complaints of the Garda whistleblower, Sergeant Maurice McCabe, were brought to the Minister.  I know the Minister discussed that issue with the Commissioner.  He did not do nothing, but discussed it with the Commissioner.  The Commissioner told him not to mind that fellow, he is a serial complainant, he is a bit of an nut, nothing to see here, move on.  We are in the position in which we find ourselves today as a result of that close connection between those two individuals, in an appointment by the Minister of that Commissioner, which is beyond what any previous Garda Commissioner has had.<\/p><p>  Ultimately, a judge is a person and what makes him or her different are the powers he or she has on becoming a judge.  It is interesting that in a paper review of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, - not of the surveillance and who was responsible but of GSOC's handling of the recent situation - the Government has just happened to choose to appoint a judge.  It may as well have appointed me or the postman or whoever because that person is not being given any judicial powers.  There is a difference there and it is very unhelpful of the Government in that regard.  It is gas that a number of Deputies are relying on a publication owned by a billionaire supporter of the Government, who has clear political views, to support their arguments in this debate about political affiliations of judges.  Everyone is political.  I believe everyone has a right to be a member of a political party if they are mad enough to so choose but that is not really the issue.  The issue in this regard is a mechanism is needed to ensure that people are appointed on merit and not because of their political views or their membership of political parties.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022100013#L00200","speaker":"1015"},{"type":"speech","time":1392982800,"counter":95,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022100013#L00300","speaker":"1017"},{"type":"speech","time":1392982800,"counter":96,"content":"<p>Absolutely appalling decisions have been made in the courts that have really damaged people in a most severe way.  I have no examples of where this was done for reasons of political influence, except possibly in the case of Fr. Niall Molloy to which other Members have referred.  However, there must be a reason that they were done because of incompetence or for some reason.  Perhaps it was because the best people were not appointed to the jobs.  There have been horrendous cases involving violence against women in which judges have given appalling sentences to which any right-minded citizen would object but there is no right to recourse.  It is a fact that a number of judges were the beneficiaries of the termination of multiple penalty points and then sat in judgment on other drivers and served them with penalties.  In my opinion, that is unlawful and there is a problem with the system.  I am aware of a complaint currently with the President of the District Court about the criminal behaviour of a judge who tried to use his position to encourage someone not to make a complaint against a senior garda.  That case is not being treated appropriately but there is no time to deal with it.<\/p><p>  This issue pertains to no one being above the law and about everyone being accountable.  Just as it now is appropriate to talk about bad behaviour of priests or is acceptable to talk about garda&iacute; or politicians, judges must also be in that category because there is a difference between the administration of the law and the delivery of justice and people seek justice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022100013#L00400","speaker":"1015"},{"type":"speech","time":1392982800,"counter":97,"content":"<p>I thank everybody for their contributions to this debate.  I agree with the point made by Deputy Clare Daly on the need to debate all our institutions and the people within them, particularly those who are conferred by society with huge amounts of power.  The Deputy is correct in that regard.  I wish to participate in such a discussion as much as does the Deputy, albeit I accept we may reach different conclusions in such a debate.  I have listened to what everyone had to say in this debate and I wish to respond to a number of the points made.  I will respond in four different areas.  The first point to which I wish to respond was made by a number of Members regarding the dangers of the politicisation of the process.  I refer to Deputy Joan Collins's strong statement regarding the need for clear water between politicians and the legal system.  Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan stated that such decisions must be taken out of the political system.  However, that is not what this Bill proposes to do.  It proposes to allow Members of the Oireachtas who are not members of the governing parties in the Oireachtas to be involved in the decision-making process.  If one seeks to have politics taken out of the system, this Bill does not do it as it still allows a role, albeit for individuals who are not members of government but who are politicians, to be involved in this process.  If one seeks the non-politicisation of the process of appointing judges, this Bill will put in place a process that allows politicians still to play a role therein.  I ask Deputy Ross in particular to respond to this point.  In addition, I draw Deputy Ross's attention to what I actually said, which was to acknowledge that within this process, it of course is people who are not within the political parties in government who would be fulfilling the role he seeks.  However, I put that point to Members.  If their desire is for politicians not to play a role in this regard, Deputy Ross is putting forward a Bill that ensures they still do and I ask for a response to that point.<\/p><p>  Second, I will revert to a point I made previously regarding the independence of the Judiciary.  Deputy Shortall challenged me on my remarks.  I am highly aware of the responsibilities that are conferred on Members of the House but also am aware of the freedoms Members of the House enjoy by virtue of having the privilege to serve in this House as Deputies.  I repeat my simple request for an example of where the independence of the Judiciary has been undermined by the manner in which judges have been appointed.  I believe we have an independent Judiciary that has fulfilled its functions well.  In fairness to Deputy Halligan, while he made many of the points Deputy Ross will emphasise regarding his concerns on how people are being appointed, he made the point that in respect of judges' fulfilment of the role, he could not provide an example.  That is what I seek because I believe the independence of the Judiciary is a cornerstone of how the State and this society should function.  I believe it is an independence that has been recognised by this Government and its predecessors.  I also believe it is an independence the Judiciary itself has been vigilant in protecting.  If Members opposite believe this not be the case, I am entitled, despite the accusations levied at me by Deputy Shortall, to ask for an example in this regard.  I again ask Deputy Ross for such an example.<\/p><p>  Third, the Minister already has indicated he will review this process and has put in place a process by which he intends to do this.  I accept completely that Deputy Ross and others might contend that the process is not substantive or will not deliver what they seek.<\/p><p>However, the Minister has put in place a process that reflects the concerns of some to examine how the appointment process could take place.<\/p><p> My fourth point is on how such decisions would be made in the system Deputy Shane Ross proposes.  I will quote a politician in this House who has spoken about the pressures politicians are under.  He said:<blockquote>TDs would knife their grannies for a seat on the inquiry.  The prospect of months of constant media mesmerises them.  At an early stage one of their number will seize the opportunity to grandstand.  The competition for the cameras will commence.<\/blockquote>That was written by Deputy Shane Ross.  I was in the House when he made the following point in opposition to the Houses of the Oireachtas (Inquiries, Privileges and Procedures) Bill: &quot;I do not trust myself or any other politician to be independent in that situation.&quot;  If he does not believe he could support the Oireachtas undertaking the inquiries that would be undertaken under that Bill, if he opposed that Bill because he believed politicians would abuse the powers that would be conferred on them, how can he be certain this would not happen under the Bill he proposes?<\/p><p> We have an independent Judiciary protected by judges and the Government.  Deputy Shane Ross has strongly alleged that it is politically influenced, yet he has argued that we should put in place a process which would ensure its overt politicisation here, albeit by people who are not members of the Government parties.  For that reason, while I respect and understand the intent and thinking behind the Bill, as I am sure the Minister for Justice and Equality does, the Government will not accept the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022100013#L00500","speaker":"1007","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392983400,"counter":99,"content":"<p>I thank everybody who participated in the discussion on the Bill.  Some of the reservations expressed by Deputies on this side were very constructive.  Some of those who said there should be changes to the Oireachtas committee have a fair point.  It is not set in stone.  In the Bill I am trying to start a process which would take the appointment of judges away from the Government.  If we were to do it in a different way, I would be happy and I am happy to have heard the constructive criticisms, reservations and changes which have come from some of my colleagues.  That does not mean, however, that one does not accept a Bill on Second Stage.  It means that there detail which should be changed and on which we do not all agree.  I am perfectly happy with this and to change it.<\/p><p>  I will answer the Minister of State's point.  The reason the Oireachtas committee is provided for with a Government minority is specifically to stop Governments stuffing their own people in an Oireachtas committee.  It is a protection to stop this happening because of the record of Governments over time.  I do not refer particularly to the Minister of State's Government but to every Government.  I see nothing wrong with a demographic input into these appointments.  I see a demographic input stopping political patronage by Governments in using their majority, as they do all the time, to appoint their cronies.  Let us be honest about this.  The Bill is about stopping cronyism and let us not hesitate in saying this.<\/p><p>  The Minister of State's reply is absurd and ridiculous because it does not address the real issue.  It avoids the issues by being insulting, in ways that do not matter and are absolutely wrong.  I do not blame the Minister of State, although I reiterate what Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall said.  The Minister of State's performance is one which I do not think would have happened a few months ago.  The ministerial appointment seems in some way to have been corrosive to his political input in this House, which is very evident in what he said about the Bill.  It is a great disappointment to me that it is quite apparent that whoever wrote the script did not read the Bill properly and that the Minister of State proceeded to read it.  It specifically states: &quot;In this Bill, Deputy Ross proposes that Members of the Oireachtas should choose our judges but only those unconnected to political parties.&quot;  That is not what the Bill states and that was why I interrupted the Minister of State because it was a piece of misleading ignorance that he then corrected.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022100014#M00200","speaker":"953"},{"type":"speech","time":1392983400,"counter":100,"content":"<p>That is not right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022100014#M00300","speaker":"1007"},{"type":"speech","time":1392983400,"counter":101,"content":"<p>The Minister of State should not interrupt me now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022100014#M00400","speaker":"953"},{"type":"speech","time":1392983400,"counter":102,"content":"<p>That is not right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022100014#M00500","speaker":"1007"},{"type":"speech","time":1392983400,"counter":103,"content":"<p>The Minister of State did say it and then corrected it.

It is about the Minister of State's party and how it is behaving.  I will give an example, but I will not name anybody because I do not wish to do this.  I am not falling for any of the traps the Minister of State has been setting about naming a judgment which has been affected by political interference.  I cannot prove this, as I said initially and I will not be able to prove it.<\/p><p>  There was an appointment to the District Court in 2011 of a person who may be very good and I suspect he is very good.  However, he happened to be a trustee of Fine Gael, a running mate of the Taoiseach in four elections; he had been a Senator under former Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald.  He had also been on the list for jobs for many years under Fianna F&aacute;il.  That tells me one thing about the system: that Fine Gael is as bad as its predecessors.  It waited its turn and now it is rewarding the guys who have waited their turn.  To come to the House with this tissue of legal detail which does not address the problem is insulting.  I am trying to ensure two things - I am happy for this to be adapted in any way if it takes the process away from the power of people such as the Minister of State and the Cabinet: that judges will be appointed on merit and that they will be independent.  I see the Minister of State and his senior Cabinet colleagues putting up a smoke screen.  They are trying to defend the system as it has always been and I am disgusted that they are adopting such a blunt and insulting attitude.  <\/p><p>  I know what will happen.  The Government will very shortly, maybe in a year or two, introduce a Bill which will be camouflage.  It stands behind the rotten JAAB system.  It is defending the justice system and refusing to reform it.  It is doing exactly the same as what it has been doing with the Garda Commissioner and on other issues which have been raised in the House recently.  It is a source of great disappointment to me but utterly revealing that the Minister of State is refusing point blank to reform the system.  The contributions from Fianna F&aacute;il and Sinn F&eacute;in put the Minister of State to shame.  He is intent on protecting political patronage in a way which six months ago he personally would not have done and against which several years ago Fine Gael and the Labour Party were preaching.<\/p><p>The Minister of State and his colleagues should hang their heads in shame that they are not prepared to tackle this problem.

I pay tribute to the members of the committee who participated in the hearings, particularly Deputy Kelleher, who is absent today, and Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, the main Opposition spokespeople, for their cooperation and participation.<\/p><p>  Early last year many of us in the House were contacted by people about organ donation.  Those affected, either undergoing dialysis, awaiting transplant, who have received transplants or made donations left a lasting impression.  One of the meetings that stands out in my memory was the one in which I had the pleasure of meeting Shane Finnegan and Joe Brolly, and people from Cork, to hear their stories directly.  I was struck by their positive and uplifting stories.  It was clear to me and to other members of the committee that we needed to reflect upon and change our policy on, and approach to, organ donation.<\/p><p>  It is only when one sits down with people directly affected that one realises the severe impact transplants have on the lives of so many people, the waiting, the anticipation, the phone call, the ambulance, the journey to the hospital, followed by false dawns or success and new life, a second chance.  The courage and bravery of all those I met was impressive.  Their honesty in relaying their stories, in reliving what they went through, or what they were going through, was personal and touching.  It was a privilege to listen to them.  These meetings also highlighted many of the structural challenges which face organ donation in Ireland.  Thankfully, the Department of Health under the Minister, Deputy Reilly, had also commenced a process of consultation on our policy.  Everyone in this House, or in the Seanad, who meets many groups and vested interests on a range of issues knows that they all have a story.  What struck me on this issue was the near uniformity of opinion on the same problems and difficulties across the country.<\/p><p>  Our current system of organ donation is an opt-in one, which requires an explicit decision to donate to be made, either by the person prior to their death or by family members after death.  Even though we have a generous culture of organ donation in Ireland, we consistently rank low, at just 23 in European league tables, behind all other countries that have a soft opt-out system.  In June 2012, more than 1,700 Irish adults were receiving haemodialysis, yet, throughout all of 2012 just 163 renal transplants were carried out in the Republic of Ireland.  To meet the needs of those receiving haemodialysis our health system should be performing in the region of 300 kidney transplants each year.<\/p><p>  Our opt-in system, or expressed consent, is used by only a small minority of countries in the EU.  Countries that have changed to the opt-out system have seen significant increases in their rates of organ donation.  Over a three year period, after making the change to opt-out systems, Belgium saw its rate of organ donation increase by 100%, while over the same period, Singapore saw an increase of a massive 700%.  Over recent years there have been suggestions that we should change to a soft opt-out system, with a presumption of consent to donate upon death, unless specifically stated otherwise.  It is important to state that even if this change were made, we must ensure that in all instances a person's family has the final say.  This maintains the principle that donation is a gift and would help to change public attitudes so that donation becomes the norm, not the exception.<\/p><p>  This morning I heard Liam Neeson speak eloquently about his late wife's gift of organs, which has given three people a new opportunity to live a normal life.  We have a chronic shortage of deceased organs available for donation.  In 2011, when an estimated 250 to 300 kidneys were required, only 164 deceased kidney donor transplants were carried out.  This suggests that our current system is not working and that a review is required so that the many people who are in need of an organ transplant can be helped.<\/p><p>  The committee was of the view that as this issue is being, or has been, debated throughout the world, and it was about time we as a country started to consider seriously the changes we need to make so that our rate of organ donation can be increased.  Countries that have changed to opt-out systems have seen significant increases in organ donation rates.  Any similar increase here could have a very positive impact on those who require a transplant and ultimately would help save lives.<\/p><p>  Last April the joint committee held two public hearings examining organ donation in Ireland.  During those hearings we heard the views of a wide range of stakeholders, including organ donors, organ recipients, practising clinicians and surgeons, support organisations, the National Organ Procurement Service, the Irish Medicines Board and the Department of Health. <\/p><p>These hearings greatly enhanced the joint committee's understanding of the position pertaining to organ donation and reaffirmed our view that the transition to a soft opt-out system is a necessary one.<\/p><p> Over the course of our hearings, the sessions were held in a way to allow us hear from different advocates, those with direct experience, medical professionals and those involved in policy development and the various legal aspects.  I will not name all the people from whom we heard but the testimonies of the people who received and gave organs were powerful.  People such as Christine Quinn, Noreen O'Halloran, Michael Kiely, Annette Betson, Shane Finnegan and Joe Brolly, to name a few, struck a pertinent message with every member of the committee and those who were involved.  Equally, we heard from a wide range of people on the medical and legal perspective including Professor David Hickey, Professor Peter Conlan, Dr. James O'Rourke, Dr. Colman O'Loughlin, Dr. Ruair&iacute; Dwyer, Dr. Liam Plant and Dr. Brian O'Brien, all people of experience with involvement in the medical field.<\/p><p> I thank all the witnesses who attended our hearings and who made submissions.  They were informative and impressive contributions to the committee, which helped us in our work, and they gave us an insight we would never have got, and which we were required to get, to allow us prepare a report and make recommendations.<\/p><p> The Joint Committee on Health and Children warmly welcomes the Government's consultative process regarding its proposal to change the current practice of expressed consent or opt-in consent to one of opt-out consent in regard to organ donation in Ireland.  Changing to a soft opt-out system has the potential to change public attitudes toward organ donation, and more importantly, to increase vastly our rate of organ donation.  It is important that in such a new system, the family of the next of kin would always be consulted.  This will ensure that the principle that donation is a gift is maintained.<\/p><p> The joint committee is strongly of the view that any transition to a soft opt-out system must be supported by increased investment in essential infrastructure, transplant surgeons and trained support staff.  Each kidney transplant has the potential to save &euro;680,000 over a 15 year period.  A short-term investment in our organ donation infrastructure has the potential to deliver real long-term savings for our health system, not to mention the long-term benefits to the lives of organ recipients, which must be of paramount importance.<\/p><p> The joint committee welcomes the current public consultation on the proposals to change how Ireland operates its systems of organ donation.  This underpins the ethos that everyone should have the right to participate in decisions affecting their health and to have their concerns heard.  Individuals should be empowered to exercise control over their own health and to participate in the decision-making process around health law and policy.  Any transition to a new soft opt-out system should be accompanied by a significant public awareness campaign prior to such changes taking effect.<\/p><p> The joint committee recommends that any transition to a soft opt-out system will only apply to organs available for donation to other patients and not to reproductive organs or other organs and tissues for research purposes.<\/p><p> All persons over the age of 16 with legally recognised mental capacity should have the ability to dissent from their presumed consent.  For children under the age of 16 and those lacking the legal capacity to consent, the next of kin should retain full control over consent, and the opt-in requirement should remain in these cases.<\/p><p> The joint committee recommends the establishment of a national register on withholding consent to organ donation.  This should be automatically accessible to organ procurement services and managed by the health departments.<\/p><p> Since we have published our report there have been significant developments in the area of organ donation.  As part of budget 2014, the Minister prioritised the development of a robust organ donation and transplantation infrastructure.  An allocation of an extra &euro;2.92 million for organ donation and transplantation services in 2014 was made available.  This extra funding is to be used to facilitate the employment of 19 whole-time equivalent positions including consultants, network link nurses, organ procurement co-ordinators, which are vital to the system, and quality officers.  These additional resources will be a great help in increasing the levels of organ donation and transplantation and will be of benefit to patients and their families.  <\/p><p> I hope this additional funding, along with the committee's recommendations, reassures those who have been sceptical about what the committee was trying to achieve.  As a committee we recognise that changing our system of consent will only be of limited benefit without the necessary infrastructure to support the intended change.  Our recommendations have clearly set out the need for a co-ordinated procurement and transplantation service across the country.<\/p><p> The Minister's decision to allocate additional resources indicates that he, too, is aware of the need to fund additional posts so that the overall system can be changed.<\/p><p> Over the course of the year I hope that every person in the Minister's office, the Department, the Health Service Executive and Members of this House will work to raise awareness of the importance of organ donation and also to ensure that the &euro;2.9 million is used for the intended purpose.  At the end of the year, I hope the committee will revisit this issue to allow us monitor the progress in delivering an improved environment for organ donation and transplantation in Ireland.<\/p><p> I want to thank all the members of the joint committee for their contributions and co-operation on this very important body of work.  In particular, I thank Deputies &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, Kelleher and Healy, who is not present, and Senator van Turnhout on behalf of the Technical Group in the Seanad, along with the members of my party and the Labour Party, for their co-operation and diligence in this particular matter.<\/p><p> I also thank the Oireachtas Library &amp;amp; Research Service, the Clerk to the Committee and the secretariat for their assistance in the production of our report and in organising the hearings last April.  Each week their work enables the committee members to carry out our parliamentary duties and without the dedication of our committee secretariat, our work would not be possible.  Sometimes that goes unnoticed but it should be acknowledged today.<\/p><p> As a committee we all work together.  We put aside our partisan rivalry and advocate on behalf of the people.  We have political differences but for the most part we put them aside and work as a committee dealing with important and sensitive issues that transcend party politics.  All members on the committee were united in endorsing this report.  We want to work to see an all-Ireland system, North and South, in terms of an improved health system that delivers for people, in this case regarding organ donation.  I hope this report can provide a template for a way forward in the area of organ donation and transplantation.  I welcome the publishing of this report and that we are debating it in the Chamber of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022100015#N00500","speaker":"989","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392984600,"counter":112,"content":"<p>Under Standing Orders I am now obliged to call the Minister, Deputy James Reilly, to provide the Government's response to the report.

Increasing the number of organ donors and organ transplants is one of my stated priorities and the joint committee is to be congratulated on the production of this report.  The report arose from committee hearings last April, which discussed consent for organ donation and other issues pertaining to organ donation and transplantation.  I echo the Chairman's thanks to members of the Opposition, Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, Deputy Kelleher and others on the committee who were very supportive during the course of these discussions regarding this initiative.<\/p><p>  I noted with interest the contributions made by a broad range of people who were given the opportunity to address the hearings of the joint committee.  Their submissions, which are included in the report of the committee, do not just make for interesting reading but for compelling reading and are of particular benefit to my Department in the work to frame legislation for the introduction of an opt-out system of organ donation.<\/p><p>  All of us here are well aware of the enormous difference an organ transplant can make to the life of a recipient and to the lives of their families and loved ones.  Organ donation truly represents a gift of life, and I note the emphasis the committee put on ensuring that the principle that donation is a gift is retained.  I welcome that.  Also, as some of the contributors to the committee emphasised, it can bring much consolation to the families of the donors and support them in the grieving process.<\/p><p>  There is a global shortage of organs for transplantation.  This applies to kidneys in particular, with renal failure increasing significantly.  This situation is mirrored in Ireland where we do not have enough organs available to meet the increasing needs.  All of us must work together to ensure that more organs are donated.  In this context, the programme for Government commits to the introduction of an opt-out system of consent for organ donation with the aim of improving the availability of organs for patients in need.<\/p><p>The service plan for the HSE specifically allocated money to make organ transplantation more available and, in particular, to support live donors.<\/p><p> I firmly believe that the introduction of an opt-out system of consent is an integral element in changing our cultural attitude towards organ donation.  We need to make organ donation the norm in Irish society so that it is the default position when people pass away in circumstances in which donation is a possibility.  In the recent past we have proved as a nation that we can change our cultural attitudes and adapt to new ways of thinking on health issues in a short space of time.  Examples include the introduction of the smoking ban in the workplace and substantially changed attitudes towards drink driving.  I am not suggesting these achievements were easily attained, because significant change in attitude or policy is never easy to bring about.  However, the effort required was worthwhile in helping to bring about a healthier and safer society.  The introduction of opt-out consent for organ donation is another step along the road of providing the best quality health care to people in need of transplants, thereby improving the quality of their lives and the quality of life for those closest to them.  These words sometimes come out too easily, but I ask Deputies to reflect on what they mean for somebody who has to attend dialysis treatment on a daily basis.  The gift of a kidney means they can get back the freedom of living.  It is an extraordinary gift.  Heart and lung transplants are similarly life-altering events.<\/p><p> The introduction of an opt-out system of consent will mean that the consent of individuals to organ donation is deemed to have been given unless they have specifically opted out during their lifetime.  That said, however, I am aware of the importance of respecting the feelings of the families involved, and to this end I am proposing a soft opt-out system.  Such a system will allow the deceased's next-of-kin to retain an important role in the process of organ donation.  I want to ensure that the system of consent we put in place will operate effectively in hospitals throughout the country in a manner that is sensitive to families who are bereaved.  It would be a churlish system if it ignored the feelings of a family that has just lost a loved one.  That certainly is not my intention.<\/p><p> I recognise that many issues need to be addressed in introducing this new system of consent.  In light of this, my Department undertook a public consultation between July and September last year to seek the views of the public on the practical aspects of introducing an opt-out system of consent for organ donation.  A total of 57 submissions were received, including that of the Joint Committee on Health and Children.  A document summarising the views received is available on my Department's website.  Many important issues were raised in the submissions.  These issues formed the basis of a consultation event which I opened in Dublin Castle last November.  The consultation event was organised by my Department in conjunction with the HSE's national organ donation and transplantation office, and approximately 80 key stakeholders attended.  It provided an opportunity to explore more deeply the important issues that were raised in the public consultation and to consider how best to implement an opt-out system that will be most beneficial to recipients, while being mindful of the feelings of the families of donors.  The event was structured in such a way as to give every opportunity to those involved to share their views and to consider how best to implement the opt-out system of organ donation in a way that addresses any concerns raised.  The outcome of the public consultation process, bolstered by the outcome of the consultation event, is informing the work of my Department in drawing up legislative proposals to give effect to the introduction of an opt-out system of consent.<\/p><p> Changing the system of consent is only one aspect in a package of measures that are needed to increase organ donation and transplantation rates.  Experience in other countries has shown that the development of an appropriate organ donation and transplantation infrastructure is necessary to have a positive effect on organ donation and transplantation rates.  This is why, in the face of very difficult economic circumstances and despite reductions in staffing and financial resources, I arranged for the HSE to allocate an additional &euro;2.9 million to organ donation and transplantation in 2014.  This additional investment is all the more significant when one considers the continuing demographic and service pressures that the HSE faces this year.  It is a clear demonstration of my commitment to improving organ donation and transplantation rates in Ireland.  The extra investment will facilitate an increase in the levels of organ donation and transplantation, to the benefit of patients and their families.  It will allow for the appointment of 19 whole-time-equivalent staff dedicated to organ donation and transplantation, including consultants, network link nurses, organ procurement officers and quality officers.  The appointments will include six half-time consultant intensive care physicians and six network link nurses, who will comprise a key element of the organ donation effort in each of the hospital groups.  They will work to foster a strong culture of organ donation, optimise conversion rates and champion educational strategies and training programmes that promote organ donation to health care professionals across each hospital group.  These key donation personnel will have a particular focus on protecting the interests of donating families throughout the process.  I am aware that reservations have been expressed about this initiative.  It was never the case that it would be an either-or situation.  We have to do everything in our power to improve organ donation rates and to comfort, console and counsel families who find themselves in the most difficult of circumstances, having lost a loved one, while encouraging them to allow their loved one to live on through the gift of life to another person.  That is a truly consoling part of the worst life experience that most families endure.<\/p><p>The additional investment in 2014 will also facilitate the employment of five organ procurement co-ordinators.  Currently the renal transplant co-ordinators employed at Beaumont Hospital also undertake the co-ordination of organ procurement supplementary to their core work.  Apart from the fact that best practice dictates that the same people should not be involved in both donor and recipient co-ordination, this situation is not sustainable if we are to achieve the increase in donation and transplantation rates envisaged.  The additional organ procurement co-ordinators will be on call on a 24-7 basis and their responsibilities will include travelling to any hospital where a potential organ donor is identified; obtaining consent from bereaved families; obtaining comprehensive donor medical and social history; supporting the donor family throughout the donation process; organising retrieval teams; and co-ordinating theatre time for organ retrieval.  It must be a priority to ensure that every link in the chain from donation to transplantation adheres to the highest possible standards of quality, safety and compassion.  In respect of organ donation and transplantation, this involves ensuring that those who donate organs, as well as those who receive organs, can be fully confident that the system meets the highest standards of international practice.  The extra investment in 2014 will also facilitate the employment of four quality officers.  It is a legislative requirement under the European Union (Quality and Safety of Human Organs Intended for Transplantation) Regulations 2012 that an effective framework for quality and safety must be established.  This framework for quality and safety will ensure that the risks of transplantation are minimised and the benefits are maximised.  Patient safety and quality are at the core of our health reform programme and I am on record as constantly striving for better standards in this key area.  A dedicated quality manager will be appointed in each of the three transplant hospitals - the Mater, Beaumont and St Vincent's - as well as in the national organ procurement service.  The appointees will establish relevant standard operating procedures, forms and reports and co-ordinate the development of quality systems for transplant services.<\/p><p> In the context of the introduction of an opt-out system of consent for organ donation, funding has also been provided for the establishment of a secure register of persons who do not wish to become organ donors after death.  This will be provided for in the human tissue Bill, the heads of which are being drafted by my Department.  In addition to the area of organ donation and transplantation, the human tissue Bill will cover a range of other issues, most likely including post-mortems, research and anatomical examination.<\/p><p> I am currently considering the possibility of some level of reimbursement of living donor expenses.  This could have the potential to increase the number of living donors while avoiding a situation where there could be any financial incentives or benefits for potential donors.<\/p><p>I believe the strong tradition that exists in the blood transfusion service is one that we would like to emulate in organ donation, but there are real expenses for those involved, such as lost time from work, that we must make good.<\/p><p> I am committed to making every effort to increase the level of organ donation and transplantation.  In 2013 a record total of 294 organ transplantations were performed in Ireland.  This figure includes 38 transplants involving living kidney donors, itself a record number.  I am confident that the additional resources provided in 2014, along with the envisaged legislation and the additional staff that have already been assigned to the HSE's National Organ Donation and Transplantation Office, will facilitate further significant increases in Ireland's organ donation and transplantation rates over the coming years.<\/p><p> I look forward to hearing the contributions from Deputies and I envisage that these will further inform the optimum way forward as we work to enhance donation and transplantation rates to the benefit of patients and their families.<\/p><p> I will finish by thanking the Chairman of the Oireachtas committee and the committee itself for their good work on this issue, but I cannot sit down without first thanking all those families who have allowed their loved ones' organs be donated and those brave Irish people who have given a living donation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022100016#O00300","speaker":"952","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392985800,"counter":116,"content":"<p>Fianna F&aacute;il welcomes this debate and believes that we need to greatly increase the volume of organ donations in the country.  As outlined previously by Deputy Billy Kelleher in this House, we favour the soft opt-out position, which assumes that people are willing to participate in organ donation, but medical staff must seek permission from the family.  However, we believe that there should be training of medical personnel on how they approach families.<\/p><p>  The presentations made by various witnesses to the Joint Committee on Health and Children were enlightening in the sense that while there was no unanimous position on all issues, there was unanimity on the need to increase the number of people who are willing to donate organs and carry donor cards.  If all this debate achieves is to highlight awareness of the issue, then that is something to be welcomed.<\/p><p>  Interesting points were made at the committee hearings and varying views were expressed on the soft and hard opt-outs and whether it should be left to people to acquire donor cards.  I understand that one point made by all groups that presented was that the family should always be consulted and that, irrespective of whether a soft or hard opt-out approach was taken, the family should be the decision maker.  However, if an individual makes an explicit determination to donate organs then, surely, consultation should not be required and his or her last wishes should be respected.  The Irish Donor Network pointed out that in Ireland consent is never presumed, even if a donor card has been signed.  While the wishes of the family should be ascertained, surely the individual's autonomy is critical too.  It is not an issue that should be approached in adversarial manner.  If we are to raise awareness and encourage as many people as possible to donate their organs, everyone with an interest should be involved in this discussion.<\/p><p>  Taking into account Ireland's ranking in terms of organ donation, we are reasonably positioned, but we could be much better.  Notable progress has been made at St. Vincent's and Beaumont hospitals in terms of capacity to transplant.  According to Mr. Jim Egan, a consultant in respiratory medicine writing in <i>The Irish Times<\/i> last year, Ireland has historically performed proficiently in regard to organ donation and transplantation.  However, Mr. Egan went on to point out that the unmet need of patients requiring organ transplantation continues to grow, and a fall in the organ donation rate, as witnessed in 2010, would have a negative impact on the lives of many Irish families.  The committee heard evidence that in 1999 there were an average of 100 patients on the waiting list for renal transplant, and 145 transplants took place.  In 2013, there were 600 people on the waiting list and we could at best expect to achieve 180 renal transplants.<\/p><p>  The Croatian experience is worth noting.  That is a country that has positively improved its outcomes in organ donation and transplantation.  Donation rates in Croatia have risen to 30 per million of the population, compared with 18 per million in the Republic.  It seems that Croatia has a strong network of hospital physicians responsible for organ donation within intensive care units.  The legislation in Croatia was also adjusted to include an opt-out system, in keeping with those of Spain, Belgium, Austria and Portugal.<\/p><p>  Countries that have made determined efforts in organ transplantation have seen substantial medical and financial benefits.  It would not be to our advantage if, having made significant technological and medical strides in saving people's lives, we find there is an insufficient supply of organs available to meet demand.  Variations and fluctuations in the rate of organ donation rates and donor numbers in recent years are interesting.  This may stem from the small number of people involved.<\/p><p>  It is important to acknowledge the role of live donors and to recognise their significant contribution.  As Deputy Kelleher stated in a previous debate on this, it is magnificent and exhilarating that a human being is willing to donate, in life, his or her kidney to save someone else.<\/p><p>  A key point often made is that, irrespective of the recommendation that results from the consultation process, the key issue is the provision of resources.  Provision must be made to the centres for organ harvesting, and it is also necessary to work with the families.  The resources must be there to enable the provision of co-ordinators who can take a compassionate approach to the families of donors and potential donors.  Many people might simply not have been fully aware of the significance of organ donation, or many have passed on whose organs could have been used but were not used because we do not have the essential infrastructure in terms of trauma centres, cardiac units and intensive care units to approach families in a planned way to discuss the issue with them.<\/p><p>  Consultants in various hospitals do their best to save their patients and when it becomes obvious that there is no hope, they approach families to discuss the possibility of organ donation.  Consultants are exceptionally busy people who work at the coalface and are under constant pressure.  Further supports are required for medical professionals.  For example, bereavement counsellors should be available to talk to families as well as co-ordinators trained in the area.  It is too much to expect that the doctor or surgeon dealing with the patient must also deal with the family.  It is important to provide supports to facilitate organ donation and to liaise with families in a meaningful way.<\/p><p>  The Government has undertaken a consultation and, again, it appears there is significant support for the soft opt-out.  There are currently in the region of 650 patients awaiting organ transplantation in Ireland.  One donor can potentially help nine other persons.  In recent years there were on average 80 donations in Ireland a year, resulting in approximately 250 transplants.<\/p><p>  In Ireland, 2011 was a ground-breaking year for organ donation.  There were 93 deceased organ donors, which allowed 248 organ transplants to be carried out.  This surpassed the previous record of 91 deceased donors, which was set in 1998.  In comparison, there were 58 deceased donors in 2010, which saw the worst decline in organ donation in Ireland on record.  In that year, there were also 23 living kidney donors.<\/p><p>  Aside from dealing with the appropriate legislation, we should advocate strongly and give people a platform to express ways to develop organ donation.  We are talking about life and death here, but organ donation needs proper administration.  There have been advances in technology, medical technologies and immunosuppressants.  We should also examine North-South relations and the possibility of a strong island-based transplant system, just as we are doing for rare communicable diseases.  We should work closely with the United Kingdom in that context.  In the UK, there is strong co-operation between various hospitals.  We should also set up an infrastructure that will allow us to improve our ranking in the league of organ donation.  We need a strong international co-ordinating body, and the EU is working on this.<\/p><p> There are two forms of presumed consent - hard and soft.  In the case of hard presumed consent citizens must clearly express their wish not to participate in organ donation.  Where there is soft opt-out, it is assumed that citizens will participate in organ donation but medical staff must seek the consent of the family.  Northern Ireland and Wales have indicated their intention to deploy this system.  Dr. Jim Egan, consultant respiratory physician at the Mater Hospital in Dublin, states:<blockquote>The soft approach protects the autonomy and dignity of the deceased by placing the stewardship of the decision with the family.  Therefore the goal of &ldquo;soft opt out&rdquo; is to encourage organ donation to be the society norm. <\/blockquote>As Deputy Jerry Buttimer points out in his introduction to the report, the current practice of using the opt-in system, or expressed consent, is used in a small minority of countries in the European Union.  Countries that have changed to opt-out systems have seen significant increases in rates of organ donation.  It is extraordinary that, following a transition to an opt-out system, Belgium&rsquo;s rate of organ donation doubled in a three year period.  Potential savings of almost &euro;700,000 per kidney transplant over a 15 year period is a further incentive.  &quot;Win-win&quot; is an overused phrase, but any situation where we can prolong lives and make savings is one that must be welcomed and an outcome pursued.<\/p><p> During the Oireachtas committee discussion there was a warning that the service was reaching a crisis that could result in facilities such as kidney dialysis being rationed or denied to the old and infirm.  Dr. David Hickey, director of the national kidney and pancreas transplant programme, said renal failure management could potentially bankrupt health services in the western world in the next 20 years and that if the issue was not dealt with, &ldquo;we are going to be talking about rationing dialysis in the not too distant future.&rdquo;  He went on to say the best possible outcome was for more donors to become available as those who received a kidney from a living donor could expect to live twice as long as those on dialysis.<\/p><p> It is notable that the number of people donating their organs upon death in Northern Ireland has almost doubled in recent years, a point underlined by Mr. Joe Brolly at the committee.  An 82% increase in deceased organ donors in the region was announced as the NHS revealed it had achieved a target to increase the number by 50% across the United Kingdom as a whole.  In 2008 there were 22 donors in Northern Ireland, while in the year to April last there were 40.  In the same period the number of donors in the United Kingdom rose by 50% to 1,212.  The upsurge has been linked with developments in 2008 when the four UK administrations accepted recommendations made by an expert task force.<\/p><p> We have a way to travel, but the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children did a valuable job in hosting the debate last year.  I congratulate all those involved and express the hope it will serve to greatly increase the volume of organ donations.  I return to Mr. Joe Brolly&rsquo;s contribution at the committee which is worth quoting in full:<blockquote>If one thinks of it logically for a moment, the question at present is, &quot;Should I decide to become a donor?&quot;  Apathy is a big problem in that regard - we only have 27% or 28% of the people involved.  Under the new system, the question will be, &quot;Is there a reason that I should not be a donor?&quot;  That will more properly accord with the overwhelming view in society that organ donation is good.  Who does not want to save seven lives after he or she is dead?<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022100018#Q00200","speaker":"1057","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392986400,"counter":118,"content":"<p>It is undeniable that the work of Oireachtas committees in the current Oireachtas has surpassed that in all previous sessions of the D&aacute;il and the Seanad prior to 2011.  That is my clear perception and understanding.  In terms of quality and quantity, the work and product have improved, which is a tribute to the members of the committees, their respective chairpersons and secretariats, including Mr. Paul Kelly.  There is more engagement than ever with citizens and groups representing citizens across many sectors and interests on many issues.  On no committee is this more marked than the Joint Committee on Health and Children and I make no apology for saying this.  I acknowledge and commend the role of the Chairman, Deputy Jerry Buttimer, and the secretariat.<\/p><p>  Lest anyone think this is a back-slapping exercise - God forbid that I would be involved in such - the hard work of the committees is not always matched by the response from the Government to the many constructive and viable proposals that emerge from committees.  There is a temptation on the part of the Government to see committees as useful devices to produce copious reports that can easily be shelved and, worse again, to keep Opposition Members busy.  God forbid that that would be the subtext.  I trust that will not be the case with our committee's report on organ donation because, as the Chairman acknowledges in the foreword, it is part of the Government's consultative process on its proposal to change the current practice of expressed, or opt-in, consent to one of opt-out consent to organ donation.  I commend the report of the committee to the Minister and appeal to him to progress it.  We have common cause and will all benefit.<\/p><p>  Sinn F&eacute;in made a submission to the committee which I will briefly summarise.  We need to address the question of organ donation and transplants in its entirety.  There is a severe shortage of organs for transplant.  There is also a severe deficit in the infrastructure for delivering transplants in terms of personnel, physical structures and funding.  All of these shortfalls need to be addressed in a comprehensive manner.  Speaking at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children in April 2013, Dr. David Hickey, director of the national kidney and pancreas transplant programme, identified the three big gaps in the current system.  They are a lack of organ donors, poor infrastructure in which transplant patients are housed and a shortage of transplant surgeons.  He said these gaps must be filled by means of increased organ donation, investment and legislation.<\/p><p>  Current Sinn F&eacute;in policy supports the presumed consent, or opt-out, rather than opt-in, system of organ donation.  This reflects our desire to meet the need for greatly increased donations and transplants.  That desire is shared by all, whatever a person's views on the best model of consent for organ donation.  Having said that, debate on organ donation, including at the Joint Committee on Health and Children and in the D&aacute;il, has increased knowledge of the issue and there is a new general awareness of the complexity of the opt-in and opt-out scenarios.  It is far from being a black and white choice between opt-in and opt-out consent.<\/p><p>  Underlying our position are a number of key principles that we believe should underpin the delivery of health services.  We believe everyone has the right to enjoy the benefits of scientific progress and its application without discrimination.  We believe it is necessary to use regulatory policy to protect the public good, including the safeguarding of public health and safety.  Everyone has the right to participate in decisions affecting his or her health and to have his or her concerns heard.  This means that individuals must be empowered to exercise control over their own health and participate in the decision-making process around health, law and policy.  Importantly, people should not be subjected to medical or scientific intervention without their informed consent.<\/p><p>  We recall the pain inflicted and injustice done to families in cases in which the organs of children were removed without parental knowledge, much less consent.  On this basis, we believe a complete and comprehensive public consultation process should take place on the issue of organ donation.<\/p><p>We have called on the Irish Government, the British Government and the Northern Ireland Assembly to ensure that the principle of presumed consent, if adopted, would operate only with regard to organs available for donation to other patients and would not extend to reproductive organs, other tissues and organs for research.  We have also argued that presumed consent would operate based on the idea that everybody carries a donor card and all persons who have the ability under the current &quot;opt-in&quot; policy to provide consent shall have the ability to dissent from presumed consent - that is, those who are over 16 and with legally recognised mental capacity.  For children under 16 and those adults lacking legal capacity to consent, the next-of-kin should retain full control over consent, and the &quot;opt-in&quot; requirement should remain in place.<\/p><p> It should be the responsibility of the relevant health bodies to comprehensively inform the public of a presumed consent policy, if adopted, and an information booklet fully outlining the rights of potential donors and their families should be sent to every household and educational institution.  This should include the ability to consent or dissent; how to officially register for and opt out of donating; the legal position regarding children; how organ donation works; how the new process will work in practice; and safeguards that will be put in place to protect the public.  An all-lreland national register on withholding consent to organ donation should be established.  I emphasise that this should be all-Ireland, as this is a practical area for real co-operation.  This would be automatically accessible to the organ procurement services and managed by respective health departments.<\/p><p> We must address all aspects of this issue, most especially the need for greater resources to be devoted to organ transplantation by the Government.  Even in these straitened economic times, I hope that will be an integral part of what the Government will do in moving this new approach forward.  This would result in significant long-term savings for the State but, far more importantly, it would save and enhance more lives, which is the real objective we all share.<\/p><p> The position I have just outlined was reaffirmed by a resolution passed unanimously at the recent Sinn F&eacute;in Ard-Fheis in Wexford, which states:<blockquote>In light of the continuing acute need for organ transplants and the unacceptably long waiting lists, the increased debate and public knowledge on this issue in the past year, and the wider recognition that changing to a soft opt-out system in relation to organ donation in Ireland has the potential to greatly increase our rate of organ donation, this Ard-Fheis reaffirms our call on the Irish Government to:Conduct an extensive consultation with stakeholders and the general public,<br \/><br \/>Publish legislation to introduce a soft opt-out system of organ donation,<br \/><br \/>Put the necessary resources and infrastructure in place to support the new system.<\/blockquote>I have emphasised the point a couple of times already, and I strongly believe it is essential.  It was very clear to us as members of the committee when those at the coalface dealing with transplants came before us and explained the reality of what they face and what they would face if we had a greater stream of willing donors but did not have the resources to cope with the increased opportunities this would present.<\/p><p> I acknowledge also the call from Cystic Fibrosis Ireland for early progress with speedy enactment of the human tissue Bill, a national online system to facilitate the change to an opt-out system, and the filling of the long-vacant cardio-thoracic transplant post in the Mater Hospital.  I ask the Minister's colleague to note these points, as they are very significant.  The post in the Mater Hospital in particular needs to be filled with urgency.  Progress is being made and although it is not often that I have the basis to say the following sincerely, I acknowledge the Minister's proactiveness in this regard.  The committee's report points the way forward and I commend my fellow members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children.  I urge the Minister to endorse the report and move forward for the sake of the many whose lives can be saved and the many whose lives can be enhanced by organ transplantation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022100019#R00200","speaker":"969","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392987000,"counter":120,"content":"<p>This is a very comprehensive report on organ donation.  As a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children, I thank those who presented or gave written submissions on this topic.  I pay tribute to the patients who gave a real insight into the effects of debilitating illness before organ donation and their feelings of well-being after transplant operations.  Many of them described the transformation of their lives after the operation, and these were real and compelling accounts.  For some, organ donations provide a platform for a \"Yes\" or \"No\" debate based on theory, supposition and a question of morality.  What should not be forgotten is that real people are suffering, hoping and praying for the call that will offer an organ with the potential to transform their lives.  In many cases, lives are saved with this call.  We have a duty to make it easier for these people to access organs.<\/p><p>  Contributions from associations such as the Irish Kidney Association and Irish Heart and Lung Transplant Association have ensured that this report is fully representative and understanding of the position pertaining to organ donation.  I also pay tribute to the very able Deputy Buttimer, Chairman of the committee, who ensured this report was comprehensive and well-informed.  He was aided by the committee clerk, who is present today.<\/p><p>  In Ireland there are currently an average of 80 organ donations per annum, but in 2010 the number was as low as 58.  There are fewer than 3,000 people in Ireland enjoying extended life because of organ donation and there are as many as 650 people waiting for heart, liver, lung, kidney and pancreas transplants.  Are these numbers acceptable, and can we do something about that?  Spain has the highest donation rate in the world, with 35 donors per million of population.  Opt-out legislation was introduced in Spain in 1979 and permits organs to be taken for transplant with the consent of family or in the absence of any known objection by the deceased.<\/p><p>I firmly believe the report's recommendation of transitioning to a soft opt-out system will greatly improve the system of organ donation and ultimately save lives.  Study after study has concluded that countries with opt-out legislation have higher organ donation rates than most countries with opt-in legislation.  The soft opt-out approach protects the autonomy and dignity of the deceased by placing the stewardship of the decision with the family.  Therefore, the goal of soft opt-out is to encourage organ donation to be the social norm.  It does not devalue organ donation as an extraordinary gift from one family to another.<\/p><p> Since the soft oft-opt out measure is part of the Human Tissue Bill, I urge the Minister to enact it speedily.  This Bill was originally promised in 2009 and has still to be enacted.  This is a source of considerable frustration for patient groups.  I am confident the current Government, unlike the last one, will ensure the Bill&rsquo;s enactment.  Legislation in isolation does not enhance organ donation.  For a successful transition to a soft opt-out system, organ donation and transplantation infrastructure must be greatly improved and prepared.<\/p><p> I thank the Minister for allocating the &euro;2.9 million for 19 new posts in the HSE service plan for 2014 in respect of organ donation and transplantation.  However, I urge him to expedite recruitment of the relevant staff, allocated in the service plan, for the National Organ Donation and Transplantation Office.  This office will play a vital role, working with transplant centres, donating hospitals, patient groups and other agencies to ensure improved organ donation rates.  According to Professor Jim Egan, director of the office, the deployment of the office would help bring Ireland in line with international practice norms, save vast sums of money and, most important, save lives.<\/p><p> It is essential that the main transplant hospitals - Beaumont, the Mater and St. Vincent&rsquo;s - be provided with the appropriate infrastructure to cater for the expected increase in the number of organ transplantations.  I am confident the Minister will note both the committee's report and my recommendations today in taking his next steps regarding organ donation and transplantation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022100020#S00200","speaker":"1004","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392987600,"counter":122,"content":"<p>I am thankful for my having been allowed time to speak today because I am not a member of the Joint Committee on Health and Children and, therefore, was not involved directly with the discussions and debate.  However, I have been keeping an eye on the debate because it is of particular interest to me.  The Minister made a point in his contribution that it is sometimes hard to grasp the emotion of somebody who is waiting for the telephone call and for the ambulance to take him or her to hospital.  One must consider the daily lives of the patient's family and the patient's efforts to stay well, which include dietary and other measures.  At times, a patient is brought to hospital only to be sent home again.  It is deflating for the family and it can be quite an experience.  The soft opt-out arrangement will really transform the lives of those waiting for a transplant of any organ.  It will be revolutionary for patients if we put in place the necessary staff, infrastructure and supports.<\/p><p>  There is always a budgetary aspect to be considered but this is secondary to a person's long-term health.  It is an economic matter, however, because a state that must provide long-term care for the very ill ends up spending more in the longer term.  The alternative, which can be only good, is to have infrastructure in place that can transform people's lives, including their financial lives.<\/p><p>  The &euro;2.9 million is greatly welcome.  It has allowed for the appointment of staff working on organ donation and the supporting of families in honouring the decisions of their loved ones who have died.  What more does the Minister believe is needed to strengthen the infrastructure in Beaumont, the Mater and St. Vincent's hospitals?  This infrastructure is crucial if we are to sustain the soft opt-out arrangement.<\/p><p>  The most pertinent question for me concerns the timeframe for the introduction of the human tissue legislation.  It is needed and should be introduced as quickly as possible.  When does the Minister believe it will be introduced?  It will allow for the legislation on the opt-out arrangement and become part of the State's thinking on organ donation.  Not everybody is in agreement with what is proposed.  There are still people opposed to the opt-out arrangement and even the Irish Kidney Association is not convinced about it.  If more of us send out a positive message on what is a gift for life, an increasing number of people will realise the approach is correct and support it.  It is crucial that we send out the message that organ donation transforms patients' lives and those of their families, including extended families.  Everybody is involved, including friends and workmates.<\/p><p>  New transplant consultants in the Mater hospital have made a big impact on changing the attitude of staff towards transplantation.  There is now a machine with which one can wash out lungs.  This is certainly transformational for those awaiting transplants.<\/p><p>  When will the human tissue legislation be introduced?  Is there a date set?  The Minister said the Department is working on it.  What resources will be needed to cater for more organs entering the hospital system?  How does the Minister envisage the support being developed?  Hospital infrastructure will be very important.  Can the Minister put more meat on the bones in this regard so people will have a better understanding of how progress will occur in the near future?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022100021#T00200","speaker":"1032"},{"type":"speech","time":1392987600,"counter":123,"content":"<p>I am delighted to speak on the important and very detailed report on the public consultation on consent for organ donation.  I thank those involved in its production, including the Chairman of the committee, Deputy Jerry Buttimer, and the clerk.  Producing it was not easy.  One thousand and thirty-eight submissions were received from individuals.  Thirty were received from organisations, including the Alpha One Foundation, An Bord Altranais, Cystic Fibrosis Ireland, the Irish Donor Network, the Irish Hospice Foundation, the Irish Heart and Lung Transplant Association, the Irish Kidney Association, the national liver transplant unit in St. Vincent's University Hospital, and many more.  The process involved consultation at its best.<\/p><p>I am delighted there was such a wide range of consultation and that a wide range of views was included.  Some of the views varied, but this report highlights the fact that we have not been doing enough for organ transplantation over the years.  One need only look at the figures for Ireland.<\/p><p> I and many other people would love to think that in our passing from this life we could help to save another life.  I am familiar with this situation.  In 2001, my father had to go on dialysis.  He was too old at the time to seek an organ transplant, but even if he had been young enough it would have been very difficult to get one.  I recall the first time we went to Beaumont Hospital.  We were very encouraged by the resources there and by the system organised by the Irish Kidney Association, which assisted us.  It has a place in the grounds of Beaumont Hospital where my mother could stay.  The support the association gave us, not of a financial nature but in terms of information, made us feel we were not alone.  It was much appreciated.  I got involved in the Irish Kidney Association, as most people do, because of that assistance.  We did not seek it but it was given to us.<\/p><p> I have been involved over the years in national collection days, selling flowers, seeking donations and so forth.  In fact, my political career in the Oireachtas was due to the Irish Kidney Association nominating me to run for election to the Seanad for the Administrative Panel in 2002.  Thankfully, I was elected.  I owe a huge debt of gratitude to the Irish Kidney Association and, of course, to the councillors who voted for me.  I enjoyed my time in the Seanad, where I could raise issues such as this.  I was spokesperson on health.  The Seanad has been retained and sometimes it is a great forum to raise issues.  One could raise issues on the Order of Business and it was not as busy as the D&aacute;il from a legislative point of view.  I am delighted the D&aacute;il has sittings such as this.  It allows government backbenchers, of whom there are many, to put their views on the record of the D&aacute;il, as we are doing today.<\/p><p> My father was not the best patient.  He used to travel to Sligo for dialysis.  The service there was great and the nurses and doctors were excellent and very patient.  However, when he came home from the dialysis, which he received three times per week, he would go next door to have a pint of Guinness.  That did not help my mother's patience, but the health system was very good to him.  He passed away 13 years ago but I do not think he fully appreciated the issues involved in kidney donation.  Again, I am grateful for the work done for him in Beaumont Hospital and in Sligo and for the support of the Irish Kidney Association.<\/p><p> I thank the Minister for allocating the &euro;2.9 million.  We genuinely need those additional resources in 2014 and the staff additional to those the HSE already has in the national organ donation system.  We must now push for increased organ donation with this extra funding and staff.  A system whereby the consent of an individual to organ donation is deemed to be given unless the person has specifically opted out during their lifetime is very welcome.  Every year, members of the Irish Kidney Association spend their time distributing cards to pharmacists and doctors and urging people to get an organ donation card and keep it in their wallet.  However, with all the preaching I have done in the last ten years, I do not have a card in my wallet.  We all have great intentions but this is something we always put on the long finger, or we sign the card and then take it out of our wallet one day and do not put it back.  This has hampered the level of donation in this country.  As Deputy Mitchell O'Connor said, we have much to learn from other countries such as Spain.<\/p><p> This is a case of the Minister and the committee grasping this issue and saying, &quot;We are sick and tired of talking about this.  This has been talked about in good times and it should have been dealt with in those times.&quot;  The soft opt-out system provides a comfort to people who do not share my view.  The deceased's next of kin will have a very important role in the process of organ donation.  If they feel uncomfortable, they will have a view as well.  That is very welcome.<\/p><p> There was a degree of controversy about this issue.  In politics, the Opposition must oppose and hold the Government to account.  That is fine.  However, opposition for the sake of opposition is wrong, and it is certainly very difficult with regard to health issues.  People can stand up and make outlandish and outrageous accusations and allegations which are featured on every local radio station and website and even here in the D&aacute;il.  Fortunately, after a week, two weeks, a year or even 20 years they are proved wrong.  I was on the radio recently talking about a report that should have embarrassed people holding certain positions regarding health.  I must defend the report and I am held to account, which is correct.  However, what about the people who make outrageous, outlandish and untrue statements?  Perhaps it is time for the media to confront them and say, &quot;You made this statement a year or two years ago.  You said people would die and that this would close.  Are you proved wrong?&quot;.<\/p><p> The Minister and the Government will get it wrong and when that happens we will put up our hands and admit it.  But what about when we get it right?  When I was in the Opposition I held the then Minister, former Deputy Michael Finneran, to account when he was wrong but when he was right I acknowledged that the Government had made the right decision and welcomed it.  That is what it is about.  Let us not oppose for the sake of opposing.  Most Deputies in this House are united on this matter and I thank Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in and all the other Deputies for their submissions.  However, there is a race to the bottom.  In the case of opposition for the sake of opposition and deriding what is happening in the health area, there must be a little generosity.  Sometimes one must say, &quot;Yes; maybe we got it wrong,&quot; but nobody seems to do that anymore.<\/p><p> I thank the Minister.  The most important matter today is, I hope, that this increases the number of organ transplants in this country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022100021#T00300","speaker":"1085","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392988200,"counter":125,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate.  This issue is all about making choices.<\/p><p>  Following consultation with the relevant stakeholders and a series of in-depth meetings last year, the health committee, of which I am a member, compiled its report on organ donation and recommended changing the current opt-in organ donor system to an opt-out<b><\/b>system.  The committee members believe that changing to an opt-out system could significantly increase the rate of organ donation in this country.  However, it is important to note that the family or the next of kin will still have the opportunity to say &quot;No&quot; if they desire when their loved one is in this difficult position. <\/p><p>  Most countries in the EU have already changed to an opt-out system, where patients must express their wish not to donate.<\/p><p>Otherwise, medical staff will presume that they are donors.  However, in this country we use an opt-in system, which means that people have to give consent before their organs can be donated.  The proposal for an opt-out system has the potential to deliver real long-term savings for the health service, not to mention the long-term benefits for the lives of those who have organ transplants.<\/p><p> To introduce this new opt-out option, we must also plan ahead and ensure the health service is equipped to deal with increased organ donations.  For example, we would need more transplant surgeons and trained support staff.  I, therefore, welcome the decision by the Minister for Health to include in the HSE service plan for 2014 an additional &euro;2.9 million for organ donation and transplantation, which will go towards the provision of 19 new posts in this field.  I also welcome the Minister's announcement last year of approval for 30 posts at various levels for the expansion of kidney transplantation services at Beaumont Hospital and the development of urology services at Connolly Hospital, Blanchardstown.  The Minister also approved &euro;5 million for phase 1 of the kidney transplant expansion programme in Beaumont Hospital.<\/p><p> It will also be important to introduce a dedicated public awareness campaign once the system is implemented in order that people will know their options.  If they want to opt-out, the system must be straightforward.  An online opt-out system has been suggested and this suggestion should be carefully considered.  We need to make it as simple as possible for those who need to make such choices.  Awareness of this issue is very important and the annual organ donor awareness week is central to improving it.  It is also important for each of us to talk to our families and loved ones about how we feel about organ donation.  It is not an easy conversation but an important one.<\/p><p> Let us remember that at the heart of this issue is the generosity of grief stricken families who make the agonising decision to allow the organs of a loved one to be donated.  They give many people who are seriously ill a second chance, a lifeline.  Many recipients can continue to live a normal life and see their children reared.  People can see fathers, mothers and loved ones continue to have some semblance of life.  On Tuesday, 24 February 20 years ago my brother-in-law, Mario Byrne, was taken from this earth.  He had been involved in a hit and run incident.  We got a call that evening at about 10 p.m. to go to St. James's Hospital where he was in a serious condition.  I did not go, but my husband did with his mother and father.  Mario was transferred to Beaumont Hospital.  I received a call in the early hours of the morning from my husband to say the doctor had told him, his mother and father that Mario was on a life support machine and that the chances of him surviving were very slim.  We took the opportunity in the following couple of days, while waiting for loved ones to come from America and other parts of the world to see Mario before he departed this world.  I remember being in the waiting room where all of us had gathered when the consultant came in.  He said Mario had a donor&rsquo;s card which he had signed a long time ago.  We were all so proud to think a young man of 20 had made a decision unknown to us all.  When the doctor turned to my mother-in-law and father-in-law, he said they could make the decision also, if they did not feel they could go through with it.  Mario&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s words were that if Mario&rsquo;s organs would give life to somebody else, then the doctor should take what he wanted.  To this day I am reminded of the words, &ldquo;Take what you want,&rdquo; because we live in a world where people do take what they want and sometimes do not appreciate what they have.  As I am a religious person, I do believe blessed is the man who gives up his own life to save others.  I will continue to believe this because there are so many people who are willing to take up a donor&rsquo;s card and the new system will help this to an even greater extent.  Each year I attend the Irish Kidney Association&rsquo;s special donor mass.  It brings comfort to those who have lost loved ones and gives an opportunity to recipients to say, &quot;Thanks,&quot; even though we will never know who the seven people were whose lives were changes forever by the donation of Mario&rsquo;s organs.<\/p><p> I agree with Deputies Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, Mary Mitchell O'Connor, Frank Feighan and others who spoke previously about the health committee.  Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in said it more eloquently than I could ever say it.  It is a committee of which I have been a member since I was elected to the House and it works well.  It holds no political stance and is admirably chaired by Deputy Jerry Buttimer who, when it is in a difficult situation or holding difficult hearings, keeps calm and shows sensitivity to speakers and witnesses alike.  It was a very sensitive time for many of us when we debated the issue of organ donation.  I found it stressful at times to listen to some of the contributors.  As others have done, I thank the staff because without committee staff, we would not be able to function or to do so as well as we do.  I pay tribute to those delegates who attended &ndash; the experts, non-experts, those who had lost loved ones and especially those who had gained their life back because that is what this debate and report is all about.  I commend the report to the Minister and urge him to put his ducks in a row as speedily as possible to bring forward all of the recommendations made in the report.  Many families are waiting at home for a call to say their loved one has been chosen for an organ, which is a lifeline.<\/p><p> I thank the Minister for his presence.  I also thank Deputy Jerry Buttimer for his wonderful commitment and all of the members of the health committee who do an extraordinary job.  I am privileged to be part of the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022100022#U00200","speaker":"1029","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392988800,"counter":127,"content":"<p>Following Deputy Catherine Byrne&rsquo;s contribution, in some ways it would be best if it were left at that because I cannot think of a more eloquent way to end the debate.  I thank her for her contribution.<\/p><p>  I thank all Deputies for their contributions because the issue is a very important one that goes to the core of the values of society.  It is fair to say all sides of the House are in agreement on the aim of increasing Ireland&rsquo;s organ donation and transplantation rates and that any difference in approach is about how best to achieve this aim.  The enormously positive impact an organ transplant can have on the life of a recipient and the lives of those around him or her cannot be overstated.  Deputy Catherine Byrne has made this very clear.  We all have a duty and responsibility to do everything we can to ensure as many people as possible benefit from the gift of life that is organ donation.  I am aware that there are differences of opinion on the introduction of an opt-out system of organ donation.  I respect these opinions and assure the House that the various viewpoints will be fully considered as my Department progresses the legislative proposals to give effect to the opt-out system of consent for organ donation.  Many people have asked me to expedite the process.  We hope to have the draft heads of the Bill later this year, with which we will go back to the committee.<\/p><p>  I am also aware that a number of practical issues need to be addressed before the opt-out system is introduced, including the establishment and implementation of a register.  These issues will be addressed in the coming months as the legislative proposals are drawn up and an implementation plan is developed.  I wish to ensure the system of consent we put in place will be a pragmatic one that will operate effectively in hospitals throughout the country in a manner that will be sensitive to bereaved families.  I also wish to ensure the next-of-kin of the deceased will continue to have an important role in the process of organ donation.  Most people never give much thought to organ donation during their lives.<\/p><p>This is perfectly understandable, as it can be a difficult topic to consider about one's self or a loved one in normal times.  However, the benefit of considering these issues in advance and making clear one's position to one's next-of-kin are that it can ensure that one's wishes are met.  It also provides peace of mind to those left behind, who have the consolation of knowing and implementing those wishes.  It is my intention to emphasise this point in any public awareness initiatives undertaken in conjunction with the introduction of an opt-out system of organ donation.<\/p><p> I hope the introduction of an opt-out system will focus people's minds on organ donation and encourage them to consider their options.  At the end of the day I do not expect large numbers of people will choose to opt out.  Irish people are known for their altruistic and generous nature and many people know of a person who has benefited from an organ transplant or who is awaiting the opportunity to avail of one.  In most cases they will be anxious to help those in need if ever they find themselves in the unfortunate situation in which donating their organs becomes a possibility.<\/p><p> What those who are supportive of the introduction of an opt-out system and those who have reservations about its introduction have in common is that they all want to increase the number of organs that become available for transplantation and they want to ensure our organ donation and transplantation services are on a par with those of the most successful countries in the world.  Success can be measured in a number of ways - for example, based on the number of organs donated, the number of organs transplanted successfully, and the quality and safety of the organ donation and transplantation services.  Ireland has a reasonably high rate of organ donation, but we all agree that we need to improve our current figures.  Last year was a record year for organ transplants, with 294 transplants performed as a result of the generosity of 86 deceased donors and 38 living donors.  It was a particularly good year for lung transplants, with 32 such transplants being performed, which was more than twice the total for any previous year.  I would also like to pay particular tribute to the 38 living kidney donors.  Their generosity is an example to all of us.  Last year's figure of 38 was a record, and we are hopeful that we can take steps to facilitate a continuation of this trend.<\/p><p> While all those involved in making 2013 a record year are to be congratulated, we need to build on this improvement in 2014.  Last year Ireland had an organ donation rate of 18.7 per million, and I would like to see this rate rising to 22 per million in 2014.  However, we must accept that this is an inexact science and the potential for transplantation depends on suitable donors being available, as well as on the aspects we can control in terms of identifying potential donors and following through successfully.  It is important that we have robust systems in place to maximise the supply of organs, match up these organs effectively with potential recipients and carry out successful transplants.  I am confident that with the allocation of an additional &euro;2.9 million and the appointment of 19 whole-time-equivalent staff, involving consultants, network link nurses, organ procurement co-ordinators and quality officers, we can make this year's challenging target a reality.  For the first time we will have dedicated teams who are experienced in counselling and dealing with bereaved families, rather than leaving it, as has been the case in the past, to sometimes very inexperienced senior house officers to approach families.  Encouraging staff throughout the hospital network to focus more on recognising potential donors will be a major step forward.  Experience in other countries shows that having specially trained staff speak to bereaved families helps to increase the number who confirm their consent for organ donation, as I mentioned.<\/p><p> The issue of a consultant cardio-thoracic surgeon was raised by Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in.  The post has been approved.  If it was not advertised today, it will be next week.  I hope the position will be filled in the coming months.  It takes time to get people of such calibre into the system, as they have commitments elsewhere and must work out their contracts.  I pay tribute to Dr. Jim Egan, whom some call Professor Jim Egan, who has done a sterling job and is driving our transplant service in the direction it needs to go.  I am also very pleased to state that in recent weeks a new unit opened in the Mater hospital with facilities for heart and lung transplantation.<\/p><p> Increasing the number of donors is just one aspect of increasing our organ donation and transplantation rates.  A key performance indicator is the conversion rate, which refers to the number of organs successfully transplanted from each donor, in line with the wishes of the donor and his or her next of kin.  Generally, potential donors will be encouraged to donate multiple organs, although the conversion rate also depends on the nature of the organ, with kidneys having the highest conversion rate and hearts and pancreas having the lowest.  Although we have not had a huge increase in donors in the past year, our conversion rate has improved hugely, with many more successful transplants.<\/p><p> I again thank the House for the opportunity to address it today on this important issue.  I congratulate the Joint Committee on Health and Children, particularly its Chairman, Deputy Jerry Buttimer.  As Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in stated, our committees are working much more productively now than previously and they inform and have an impact on legislation.  I very much value the work they do.  There will always be political differences, different emphases and sometimes frank and downright disagreement, but in the main the work that the committee has done in this area, on the Protection of Life during Pregnancy Act and on tobacco will stand the test of time as a true testament to it, its members and its Chairman.  I will take very seriously and examine the issues raised today as I continue to develop the legislative proposals which will implement the opt-out system of consent for organ donation.<\/p><p> Transplantation is an area of health care that brings many benefits to the lives of patients and their families.  We all rightly agree that it needs to be improved and we all wish to see this happen.  I assure the House that I will continue to work to enhance donation and transplantation rates to the benefit of patients and their families.  We should all be very proud of the generosity of our people to one another.  There is no greater gift than the gift of life.  I thank everyone for their support to ensure this generosity is fully converted into a meaningful improvement in life for others.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022100023#V00200","speaker":"952","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392989400,"counter":129,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and everyone who took part in the debate.  This is an example of how Friday sittings can be of benefit.  The quality of the debate on this report, in contrast to others, was breathtaking.<\/p><p>  Donation is a gift and it offers consolation.  As the Minister stated, the generosity of the Irish people knows no bounds.  I thank all those who work in our hospitals and those who tend and care for people affected by renal failure and other issues which involve transplantation.  The movement to a soft opt-out system gives families the important option to opt out if they wish.  I welcome the Minister's commitment on the human tissue Bill and his comments on the filling of posts.<\/p><p> It is important that we thank the families.  During its hearings the committee heard from many people.  Phyllis Cunningham, the senior transplant co-ordinator of the national organ procurement service, left us with an important legacy as she read into the record a letter that I wish to share with the House.  She stated:<blockquote>I will share an example of the gratitude felt by recipients by reading an excerpt from a letter written by a 16 year old to his donor family on the anniversary of his transplant.  He said:I know this time of year is very hard for you but I hope it helps to know that I think of you every day and how grateful I am for the wonderful gift you gave me.  Everything I do, everything I achieve, I do it for you.  Most especially, I bring your loved one with me and I will try never to let you down.  Once again, thank you for changing my life, from a kidney recipient.In reply, the family wrote back, &quot;Our lives will never be the same because of the loss of our loved one but your letter is beautiful remembrance.  Take care and best wishes for the future&quot;.<\/blockquote><\/p><p> When appearing before the joint committee, Professor Jim Egan stated, \"The goal of [the] soft opt-out [system] is to allow organ donation to be the society norm\" and he is correct.  In his presentation to the joint committee Dr. Liam Plant stated, \"In the absence of a robust organisation and infrastructure to support this endeavour, any legislative framework is unlikely to achieve its maximum potential in increasing [organ] donation.\"  One cannot but be struck by the great work done by the Irish Kidney Association and its many volunteers nationwide.  I hope the position espoused by its chief executive can evolve over time and that, together with his organisation, he will come to support the movement Members are professing to support.<\/p><p> I thank the Minister for his commitment and appreciate the warm embrace by all members of the joint committee of the report and the movement in the system.  This is about people's lives and ensuring those who deserve to can get a second chance at living, as the 16 year old boy mentioned has shown today in the letter referred to.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022100024#W00200","speaker":"989","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1392990000,"counter":131,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1392990000,"counter":132,"content":"<p>The D&aacute;il adjourned at 1.40 p.m. until 2 p.m. on Tuesday, 25 February 2014.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
