I welcome the Minister and thank her for her attendance.<\/p> <p>I would like to highlight the issue of the Bose factory in Carrickmacross, which closed in May 2015 with the loss of over 150 jobs to the town of Carrickmacross.  Bose had been in Carrickmacross since 1978 and was very successful there but unfortunately it has now transferred its operations to Malaysia and Mexico.  Despite attempts by the IDA and Enterprise Ireland to find a replacement, no new investor has been found to date.  The building is now an empty shell.  It is a fine facility which extends to 8,000  sq. ft. of accommodation of both office and production facilities.  It has over 200 car parking spaces and it sits on a site area of approximately 7.2 acres.<\/p> <p>Indigenous jobs have been the backbone of County Monaghan to date.  That has been the history.  A few companies have worldwide recognition, namely, Monaghan Mushrooms, which is a leading light in the production of mushrooms, and Combilift, which is another name that is recognised worldwide.  Unfortunately, all of these companies are under severe threat at the moment as a result of Brexit and the constant and current decline in the value of sterling.  There is now extreme pressure on the local economy and local business as a result of this.  If ever there was a time in Monaghan for a need to diversify employment, it is now.  We are at a critical junction in our history.<\/p> <p>An interesting statistic is that in 2014, 85% of leaving certificate students progressed to further education.  That is very welcome.  Unfortunately, only 24% of those graduates end up getting employment in County Monaghan.  That is quite a worrying statistic.  Our young people are being educated and moving on, and are not returning back home again.  This statistic is very low by national standards.<\/p> <p>I get no pleasure in saying that the record of IDA and Enterprise Ireland in attracting business to the county in general has been very poor.  An example of this is that from 2009 to the first quarter of 2016, which is a seven-year period, only four visits have occurred.  Four visits in seven years is a sad indictment which is even more emphasised when one considers the location of Carrickmacross.  It is less than 45 minutes from Dublin Airport and there is a motorway almost the whole way to Dublin city.  It also has good transport links to Belfast.  It is a great place to live and housing is very affordable.  It has a lot going for it.<\/p> <p>I plead with the Minister to redouble her efforts to encourage IDA and Enterprise Ireland to look at Monaghan as a viable location for any industry because we are hurting at the moment.  The facility has being lying idle for over a year and a half now.  We are under increased pressure due to Brexit and the pressures of the declining value of sterling.  We are at a crossroads.  It is critical that the IDA and Enterprise Ireland refocus their efforts on trying to get replacement industry into Monaghan so we can counteract the losses we have incurred and the hurt we are currently going through.<\/p> <p>I thank the Minister again for her time and for her attention.  The members of Carrickmacross-Castleblayney municipal district would be delighted to have a meeting with the Minister at her earliest convenience to try to progress this issue.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101200002#A00600","speaker":"1396"},{"type":"speech","time":1476264600,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Gallagher for raising this Commencement matter.

IDA Ireland was a member of this group along with Monaghan County Council, the local enterprise office, the Department of Social Protection and the education and training boards of Cavan-Monaghan and Louth-Meath.  The group helped to develop a demographic and skills profile of former staff at the BOSE facility.  This was completed by IDA Ireland in partnership with BOSE human resources, HR, locally.  This profile is central to IDA Ireland's marketing of the location to clients whose requirements it may match.  Enterprise Ireland also actively markets the facility to its client base.<\/p><p>As Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, I am committed to finding a new investor for the site and to bringing new employment opportunities to Carrickmacross.  IDA Ireland obviously has an important role to play and I know the agency is committed to attracting new investment to the north-east region.  I am in regular contact with the agency and I have directed it to ensure that every effort is made to market the facility and the town to potential investors.<\/p><p>It remains the case, however, that the ultimate decision by companies as to where to locate in Ireland is always taken by their management.  I emphasise that supporting regional job creation has been a priority of mine since my first day in office.  I want to ensure that regional Ireland benefits from our hard-won economic growth and that the jobs recovery is felt in every single county.  As announced yesterday as part of the budget, my Department has secured funding for a number of measures that will improve regional competitiveness and help Border counties in particular to cope with the impact of Brexit.<\/p><p>There are other policy tools at our disposal to help regional development.  For example, the north east-north west action plan for jobs launched in November last year aims to deliver 28,000 extra jobs in the north east.  I have met this group.  All regional action plans will also be supported by investment of up to &euro;250 million over the next five years, including &euro;150 million for IDA Ireland's regional property programme.  In addition, IDA Ireland has committed to increasing investment by 30% to 40% in each region by 2019 as part of its strategy Winning: Foreign Direct Investment 2015-2019.  The north east has many strengths, including a talented work force, its existing cluster of companies in international business services and engineering and its proximity to Dublin Airport.  I am confident, therefore, that Carrickmacross, together with the wider region, will experience increased employment and investment in the time ahead.  I would be very glad to meet with the Monaghan group that Senator Gallagher would like me to meet.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101200002#A00700","speaker":"1247","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1476264600,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for her reply and for acceding to the request to meet councillors from the Carrickmacross-Castleblayney Municipal District.

I also welcome the increased health spending announced in yesterday's budget, particularly provisions for home-care services and people with disabilities.  With more money, the major challenge now is to ensure that the announcement translates into the much-needed services and supports for people who need them.  This matter relates to the 25,000 people in Ireland who are living with neurological conditions and who need rehabilitation every year, and their carers.<\/p> <p>Despite spending more money than ever before on health care, there are still dire shortages in some services.  I want to draw the Minister of State's attention to the lack of core services for people living with conditions such as stroke, acquired brain injury, multiple sclerosis and Parkinson&rsquo;s disease.  Every year, over 25,000 people need rehabilitation and most of them struggle to get the services they require.  Many need specialist services with skilled multidisciplinary teams to support them on their rehabilitation pathway.  Without access to core rehabilitation services, people are left with preventable disabilities, cannot return to work and are accommodated in nursing homes, which can often be completely unsuitable for their needs.<\/p> <p>This problem is at crisis level because services are under-developed and under-resourced.  People with neurological conditions report the following problems with neuro-rehabilitation services.  They include problems with availability and waiting lists, inequities in access, lack of clear pathways, lack of co-ordination and significant problems in navigating the system.  It is bad enough to have been diagnosed with a stroke but the person must then try to find his or her way through a system in circumstances where he or she needs help.  Other problems include lack of support and training for family members, lack of skilled neuro-rehabilitation health care professionals and failures in the Department of Health and the HSE to drive the necessary change relating to the growth and development of neuro-rehabilitation services.<\/p> <p>Recent media coverage has highlighted these issues and how people are suffering as a result.  We have heard from people waiting over two years for a place in the National Rehabilitation Hospital as well as people travelling abroad for rehabilitation and, what is worse, losing any gains when they return due to a lack of appropriate neuro-rehabilitation services in the community.  Many more never got the opportunity to get the rehabilitation they needed and lost a vital window of recovery that will impact them for the rest of their lives.<\/p> <p>The case I am about to outline is just one example.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Colette Kelleher:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2484\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2484&amp;amp;pid=ColetteKelleher&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=12\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Mr. Colm Griffin was 36 years old, healthy and fit, and a qualified engineer.  As a result of corrective surgery on an aneurysm in 2015, he had a stroke.  The left side of his body was affected and he could no longer walk, use his left arm or dress himself.  He was unable to drive or go to work.  In Cork University Hospital, he got access to physiotherapy and hydrotherapy but otherwise the facilities were very limited.  In February 2016, he got a bed in the National Rehabilitation Hospital and completed 12 weeks of therapy.  Although the individual therapists did their very best, his experience was one of deep frustration as there are huge limitations on the number of therapy hours there.  He kept a timetable from that time and recorded an average of three hours physiotherapy over five days and just one hour of hydrotherapy.  In addition, there was no access to the facilities after hours or at the weekend.  Since he returned home, friends and family had to fund-raise to pay for private physiotherapy.<\/p><p>Ireland should have 270 inpatient beds for our population but we have less than half of that and none outside Dublin.  We should have four regional inpatient specialist rehabilitation services nationwide but we have none.  There should be at a minimum nine community neuro-rehabilitation teams nationwide, one in each community health organisation as a starting point, but there are only three, and these are only partially staffed.  We have the lowest number of consultants in rehabilitation medicine anywhere in Europe.<\/p><p>The lack of specialist and community rehabilitation services is impacting significantly on other areas of the health system, as the Minister of State knows, exacerbating the problem of delayed discharges from our acute hospitals.  The national policy and strategy for the provision of neuro-rehabilitation services in Ireland was published in 2011 and it is unacceptable that there has been little progress in the development of new services since its publication.  A long overdue draft implementation framework for the strategy was finally released, five years later, in February 2016.  The Neurological Alliance of Ireland and others have serious concerns with the draft framework, which lacks dedicated funding and any timelines.  It also lacks accountability and the scope required to deliver real improvements that people need.  It is essential that a revised plan is put in place.<\/p><p>I wrote to the HSE, which has stated that it has long appreciated the need to review the issue.  That is hardly good enough after five years.  I would like specifics on what plans the Minister has in place to secure the 270 inpatient beds.  When will these beds be in place?  When will we have beds outside of Dublin in places like Cork?  What about the four regional inpatient specialist services and when will the Minister put in place fully the nine community neuro-rehabilitation teams?  We have waited a very long time and the people with the conditions are really in need and at risk.  I would like some specifics and clear timetable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101200002#B00400","speaker":"1430","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1476264600,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Kelleher for raising this very important issue.  It is my first time debating with her so I welcome her to the Seanad and congratulate her on being nominated.  We need voices like hers in the Seanad, particularly with respect to this morning's subject.  I will respond here but I will speak to her later about issues relating to her question.  I thank the Senator for raising the matter of inpatient and community neuro-rehabilitation services and improving the patient pathway from hospital to home.  I welcome the opportunity to outline the current position in this regard.<\/p> <p>The programme for partnership Government places a particular focus on a number of key programmes and strategies, including publishing a plan for advancing neuro-rehabilitation services in the community.  As part of a review of how specialist rehabilitation services are accessed and provided, the HSE and the Department of Health jointly published the National Policy and Strategy for the Provision of Neuro-Rehabilitation Services in Ireland 2011-2015.  In addition, the rehabilitation medicine programme was established within the clinical strategy and programmes directorate of the Health Service Executive.<\/p> <p>With regard to the update, a steering group, led by the HSE social care division, has circulated a draft implementation framework for the national policy and strategy for neuro-rehabilitation services for consultation to members of the steering group and stakeholder agencies.  This implementation framework will guide and oversee the reconfiguration and development of neuro-rehabilitation structures and services at national and local level.  The framework outlines key issues, themes and considerations.  It makes particular reference to the need to reconfigure and develop community services within the HSE's community health care organisations and inpatient specialist rehabilitation services.  It is planned that implementation of the neuro-rehabilitation policy and strategy will involve reconfiguration and development of resources with the community health care organisations to establish specialist neuro-rehabilitation teams within each area.  Second, it will involve reconfiguration and development of specialist inpatient rehabilitation services in line with the rehabilitation medicine programme model of care and national trauma policy and integration of all specialist rehabilitation services within what is envisaged to be managed clinical networks.  Moreover, each of the nine community health care organisations will establish local implementation teams; a neuro-rehabilitation network, based on a hub-and-spoke model, will serve population-based areas of the country; and managed networks will link closely with the National Rehabilitation Hospital, community rehabilitation teams, primary care and acute hospitals in their areas.<\/p> <p>Specialist inpatient services are concentrated at a national level in the National Rehabilitation Hospital.  The hospital provides a comprehensive range of specialist rehabilitation services to adult and paediatric patients.  These are patients who, as a result of accident or injury have acquired physical or cognitive disability and require specialist medical rehabilitation.  Effective rehabilitation draws on a broad range of disciplines to meet the particular needs of individuals.  The objective is to assist with returning to life in the community with confidence.  Approximately 1,000 people are treated on an inpatient basis at the hospital each year and approximately 5,000 people are treated on an outpatient basis.  Many patients have a lifelong association with the hospital.<\/p> <p>The Government has also announced a major capital development of the National Rehabilitation Hospital.  The project will deliver a 120 replacement bed ward block.  It will include support therapies to paediatrics and acquired brain injury patients, a hydrotherapy unit and a sports hall.  Its completion is the priority project in rehabilitation medicine.  It is envisaged that the implementation of the national policy and strategy for the provision of neuro-rehabilitation services, along with the investment in the National Rehabilitation Hospital, will greatly contribute to improved care pathways for patients from home to hospital.<\/p> <p>This is a priority service issue and I am working very closely with the Minister, Deputy Simon Harris, on it.  There has been talking about this for too long.  We want to push on the agenda.  I will respond to further questions.

The Senator is referring to an individual who is an inpatient at St. Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital.  The patient has finished his acute phase of treatment and is on the hospital&rsquo;s delayed discharge list as requiring long-term residential care.  Government policy is to support older people to remain in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.  There will, however, always be a cohort of older people who require a long-term residential care option.<\/p> <p>The nursing homes support scheme is a system of financial support for those assessed as needing long-term nursing home care.  Anyone who is assessed as needing long-term nursing home care can avail of the scheme regardless of their age.  The scheme provides financial support towards the cost of the standard components of nursing home care.  Patients contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost.  The scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.<\/p> <p>The scheme has a net budget in 2016 of &euro;940 million.  This represents an increase of &euro;43.1 million on the 2015 outturn.  It is expected that the scheme will provide financial support to 22,989 clients on average per week in 2016.  The purpose of the nursing homes support scheme is to provide a sustainable system of financial support for people in need of long-term nursing home care, which ensures such care is affordable for all who need it.  Applicants are free to choose any public, voluntary or approved private nursing home in the State.  The home must have availability and be able to cater for the applicant's particular needs.<\/p> <p>On the Senator's specific query, Bloomfield Hospital is a 114-bed mental health hospital registered as an approved centre with the Mental Health Commission.  The nursing homes support scheme, however, does not extend to either the disability or mental health sectors and it would contravene the statute underpinning the scheme to support a patient in this facility.  The HSE is endeavouring to support the discharge of patients who have been deemed medically fit for discharge and require alternative supports, be that long-term care, home care or transitional care.  The HSE has provided a list of alternative facilities that accept national nursing home scheme funding.  The man was offered a place in Rathdrum public unit but it is understood this offer was not accepted.  The HSE is working with the hospital social work team to find a suitable placement and the Clonskeagh community nursing unit is being considered as it has appropriate single-room accommodation and would be more accessible for the family.

I am returning to an issue I raised previously with the Minister's predecessor regarding the social welfare offices that were closed in rural areas and in the Connemara area in particular.  As the Minister, Deputy Leo Varadkar is aware, when Deputy Joan Burton was Minister, there was a movement of community welfare officers, CWOs, from the HSE to the Department of Social Protection in 2011 and 2012, with the Department taking over more than 900 clinics that the CWOs previously undertook.  The Minister at the time maintained that the service had been enhanced, with phone lines being preferable to clinics and CWOs visiting people's homes to meet them where needed.  It was said that the restructuring of the services was to be done in a way that would not compromise the accessibility of the CWO and the person who succeeded them, as the job specification and the name have changed.<\/p> <p>We had a particular concern in Connemara with the closure of the service in Carraroe and the services in Oughterard and Spiddal being rationalised and moved to Galway city.  The Minister at the time told us it was to provide for a streamlined and consistent service to the customer.  The language used was interesting in that it proposed a \"customer\" rather than a client, and that anybody using the services of a CWO or social welfare office is regarded as a customer as opposed to a client.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2363\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2363&amp;amp;pid=TrevorOClochartaigh&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=12\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We were informed that where community welfare services had been restructured, alternative arrangements had been put in place to ensure \"customers\" - that word again - would be provided with ongoing access to the supports provided by the service and that, in general, this would mean that the frequency of available public clinics would be increased.  At the time, I and others raised issues about this because in rural areas where a service was being removed or moved to an urban centre, transport connections such as bus services were not available.  The latter remains the case.  For example, there is no bus service to Clifden, the nearest centre for people living in Carna, County Galway.  Anyone wishing to go to the city would have to get a bus first thing in the morning, stay in the city all day and return at night.  This is still the case.  From places such as Carna, the bus service runs only a couple of days a week.<\/p><p>People have told me they have been asked to attend at the centre in Galway on several occasions for three and four days in the same week in some cases in order to finalise their claims for supports from the Department of Social Protection.  It has been said that in instances where people are not in a position to travel due to a lack of resources or transport, officials from the Department would call out to them to ensure that they were provided with a service.  Somebody at a briefing on the family resource centres in the audio-visual room of these Houses last week said this does not happen when a request is made.<\/p><p>My question relates to the closure of these offices, particularly in the context of exceptional needs payments that would have been paid over the three previous years.  How much of a saving has the regional office made in exceptional needs payments to the people of Connemara since those offices were shut down.  What is the level of overall savings made by the Department through the closure of those offices?

In line with all supplementary allowance schemes, the overall reduction in the live register and general improvement in the economy has reduced recourse to exceptional needs payments, ENPs.  In 2012, 459 ENPs totalling &euro;149,000 were paid in the three offices and 177 payments totalling &euro;73,000 were paid up to the end of September in 2013.  Corresponding details on payments since September 2013 are not available as all such payments are now included in the figures for Galway city and Clifden and are not separately identified.<\/p> <p>In 2012 a working group made up of staff from the CWS reviewed the ENP guidelines with a view to achieving standardisation and consistency in the treatment of applications across the country.  This review was used as a basis for revised guidelines that issued to staff in 2012 and 2013.  These guidelines provide maximum recommended amounts for specific items such as white goods, furniture and prams.  The Department reviewed these guidelines in 2015 and no changes were provided to the recommended amounts.  The guidelines assist Department staff administering the scheme and do not affect the discretion available to officers in issuing a payment to assist an individual or household in any particular hardship situation which may arise.  The ENP scheme is demand led and continues to provide assistance to those with exceptional needs taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case in order to ensure that the payments target those most in need of assistance.<\/p> <p>Following the transfer of the service from the Health Service Executive, HSE, to the Department in 2011, the Department has re-engineered its business model to support the provision of integrated services across all business streams involved in the delivery of localised services.  As part of this strategy, the Department is engaged in the delivery of integrated Intreo centres, which provide a full range of services, including the CWS, generally available in one location.  The change is a move away from the traditional model of one CWS officer serving an individual location and delivering the full range of services towards a sustainable team-based approach.  Where the service has been restructured, including in the Connemara area, alternative arrangements have been put in place to ensure that customers are provided with ongoing access to the supports provided by the service.<\/p> <p>In the Galway area, this means that the frequency of available public clinics has increased, an improved phone service and dedicated e-mail address are available and alternative arrangements are in place for those who cannot travel - for example, due to illness - including arranging a visit to the client&rsquo;s home as necessary.  In addition, an appointments service is now in operation which is proving very successful in terms of efficient service delivery.  The community welfare clinics in An Spid&eacute;al, An Cheathr&uacute; Rua agus Cil Chiar&aacute;in all operated from premises under the remit of the HSE.  The amount of money paid to the HSE for the use of their premises is included in the overall memorandum of understanding between the Department and the HSE which covers the whole country.  Any savings from the closure of particular clinics have not been calculated and could only be estimated on an apportionment basis.  Staff who were working in these locations at the time of their closure were transferred to Galway, two remaining in the CWS and the third transferring to employment services as a case officer in the integrated Intreo service.  As a result, there were no staff-cost savings.<\/p> <p>I am very conscious of the need to provide efficient and effective customer-facing services at a local level for all customers of the Department and would like to reassure the Senator that the changes to the services in Connemara were not undertaken as a cost-saving measure but instead were intended to enhance the integration of all of the Department&rsquo;s localised services in County Galway.  I am not entirely sure what the Senator meant by making a distinction between customers and clients but I would be interested to understand it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101200002#E00200","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1476264600,"counter":40,"content":"<p>N&iacute; d&oacute;igh liom go bhfuil t&uacute; r&oacute;-sh&aacute;sta.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101200002#E00300","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1476264600,"counter":41,"content":"<p>Nach maith &eacute; go bhfuil a fhios agat.  I suppose using the frame of a business model in respect of people engaged in employment services indicates the type of language that a client of a State agency now becomes a customer of the State agency.  My concern is the use of that type of language.  I am unhappy with the cutbacks that have happened in the ENP because even with the figures available from 2012 to 2013 it is quite clear they were cut back to a third of what they had been the previous year.  I would guess that if the figures were available, we would see an even bigger cutback.<\/p> <p>One of the issues was the closure of the offices in rural areas.  People looking for an ENP cannot afford to go to an office in the city.  These people feel compelled to travel into the city to go to the Intreo offices and in many cases feel intimidated in there.  I know the Minister is a great proponent of the Irish language but many of these feel that the service is not being made available through Irish and they have to make a special effort to ask for that.  It is very unfortunate that, according to the figures available, there has been such a huge reduction in the number of ENPs paid.  Now that we are told the economy is improving, would the Minister reconsider reopening an office in the Connemara area to make it easier for those clients to access the Department's services for ENPs and other matters?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101200002#E00400","speaker":"1377"},{"type":"speech","time":1476264600,"counter":42,"content":"<p>I take the Senator's point about customers and clients.  To me, a customer is somebody who goes into a business and probably pays money whereas this situation is the reverse.  Health care always disliked the move away from the term \"patient\" to those of \"client\" or \"customer\".  It is the term the Department uses and it is not trying to disparage those who rely on our services but to ingrain the idea of a business model in the operations of the Department.  Perhaps it is not the right language.<\/p> <p>I visited the Intreo centre in Galway city a couple of weeks ago.  It is a very impressive building and a very modern centre.  I met some of the community welfare officers, including the lady who goes out to the clinic in Kilronan on Inis M&oacute;r, in the Aran Islands, and chatted with them about this issue.  They are very much of the view that they can provide the service in Galway city over the phone or by making house calls if needs be.  For that reason, there are no proposals to open new offices anywhere in the country.<\/p> <p>The overall cost of ENPs has gone down across the country for two reasons: first, fewer people have recourse to these payments because fewer are unemployed and incomes are rising again; and, second, payments were standardised across the country.  On the latter point, in the past, because these payments came from the old health board system, people in different parts of the country were receiving different amounts in respect of the same fridges, microwaves or whatever they needed.

Unless the educational needs of people living in disadvantaged areas are addressed, we will not see any improvement in terms of giving children every opportunity.

There is not much incentive to go to the dentist for a regular check-up.

I will leave it at that.<\/p> <p>The budget failed to demonstrate a real and tangible commitment to decades of neglect in rural Ireland.  If this is the best the Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il combo has to offer on the centenary of 1916, it is surely time for an alternative.<\/p> <p>The 2017 budget patched together by Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Independents clearly demonstrates a lack of urgency in addressing the real issues facing rural families and communities.  Do they not understand that if we continue to do the same thing we have always done, we will get the same results?  I refer to high emigration, unemployment, the working poor, struggling families, issues with schools, and post office closures.  At a time when we need vision and bold ideas to rejuvenate rural Ireland and address regional imbalance, we get promises of another action plan and crumbs from the table of Government.<\/p> <p>While I welcome the fact that some of the measures proposed in the Sinn F&eacute;in alternative budget have been taken on board, such as the improvements to farm assist and the 500 additional places on the rural social scheme, the failure to address the cost of living will leave families struggling.  The famous five increases for pensioners and some social welfare recipients will not remain in their pockets for long when they pay their property tax, prescription charges, telephone and energy bills.  More than the 85,000 people over the age of 65 will continue living in deprivation under this Government.  The Government was more about the two parties keeping each other on board rather than addressing the serious problems of rural Ireland.  Young people on social welfare continue to be discriminated against.  These are the same young people who are expected to clothe, feed and house themselves while looking for work and paying extortionate car insurance, all on &euro;100 per week.  They are not magicians.<\/p> <p>Sinn F&eacute;in is the only alternative that will genuinely reduce the cost of living and invest in public services, and the only alternative that will build an all-Ireland economy while investing in long-term growth.  We can only achieve that by building a tax system that is fair and equitable.  Promises to close the door after the horse has bolted to address tax avoidance measures will ring hollow for those who have suffered most because the wealthiest in this country, and beyond, have been facilitated to make obscene profits without having to pay tax.<\/p> <p>The litmus test of this budget will be whether it provides beds for the sick and elderly lying on trolleys, whether it tackles the 530,000 people on waiting lists for appointments, whether it provides meaningful treatment and supports for children with special needs and adults with disabilities, and whether it gives a break to carers or facilitates job creation that pays a decent wage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101200002#G01500","speaker":"1378"},{"type":"speech","time":1476264600,"counter":59,"content":"<p>I suppose in the aftermath of a budget, perhaps it is easy to don the political jersey and find everything that is negative in it but I do not think that it is necessarily fair or adds anything to the political debate in this country.  There are good things in this budget and anybody with a fair mind would acknowledge that.  However, I would like the Leader to address two issues which concern children.  These are two issues in which we expected the advancements of the past number of years would have been built upon.  One is the issue of class sizes and the second is the issue of free GP care for those under 12 years.  When an improvement is made over a number of years, it is a reasonable expectation that this improvement would be continued.  <\/p> <p>Over the past number of years, class sizes in primary schools have not been made worse.  They have not been increased.  In last year's budget, the pupil-teacher ratio was decreased at primary and secondary level.  It was reduced by one point at primary level where the issue is acute.  The expectation was that over a number of years, it would gradually be brought down.  That did not happen in yesterday's budget.  I am a bit disturbed by that because surely when we now have resources to invest in areas that are clearly crying out for investment, class size is one of those issues that affects every school-going child in primary school and their parents.  Many children in large classes will do fine because they can achieve in any circumstances but children with special educational needs or behavioural difficulties are the ones who will benefit from smaller class sizes.  The vision of going from having the largest class sizes in Europe to progressively bringing down that pupil-teacher ratio is something I thought would continue from last year but it has not happened.  I think we should have a discussion on that in this Chamber.  <\/p> <p>Again, we made a huge advance on the issue of free GP care for children under the age of six.  I felt at the time it was a major advance that also would be continued.  Again, for some reason, free GP care for those under 12 has slipped below the radar.  The children of Ireland who had a reasonable expectation that their class sizes would have come down and that free GP care for those under 12 would also have been introduced will be a bit surprised.  Where is the Government's vision for those two areas?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101200002#H00100","speaker":"1410"},{"type":"speech","time":1476264600,"counter":60,"content":"<p>I wish to speak about the insurance industry.  Rises in motor insurance have been highlighted a lot over the past couple of weeks.  I would like to talk about my personal experience two years ago when a protestor jumped on my car and falsely accused me of hit-and-run and being drunk at the time.  I reported it to the insurance company I was dealing with and lost my no-claims bonus for reporting it.  When I rang other companies to get cheaper insurance, I was told that I could not go anywhere.  I had to stay with the company and pay nearly three times the amount my premium should have been.  It went on for 15 or 16 months.  When my insurance came up for renewal, I rang the insurance company and was put through to the claims department.  Thankfully, the person in question had made no claim because it was totally untrue and fabricated.  It was in all the national newspapers.  It was a terrible time for my family and me.  What I found out by default from the claims department of this insurance company was that &euro;21,000 was set aside for this lady if she did claim.  She did not claim.  This person could have claimed and I would have been told it had nothing to do with me anymore and the insurers would sort it out.  If this is happening in the insurance industry, no wonder our insurance costs have gone up by 30% or 40%.  It must be looked at and regulated.  I have heard that this is happening in several insurance companies where they put this amount away once there is a claim or a reported claim.  It is just not good enough.

It is an example of cross-Border co-operation endorsed by the entire community - Unionist and nationalist and is funded by both Governments.  It is an example of where we need to move forward.  The problem is that this region of 500,000 people has no motorway, rail or air connection to our capital city.  It is totally disconnected.  If you get out the map of Ireland out, you will see motorways and rail and air links to Belfast, and rightly so.  You will also see such links to Galway, Limerick, Cork and Waterford.  There is a complete blank spot.  Could the Leader raise this issue with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross?  When we talk about Brexit and a strategy to deal with its implications, we need a commitment from our Government on co-funding the A5 project, which will come back on track in 2017, and in respect of the City of Derry Airport.  The airport deals with 340,000 passengers every year, of whom 40% or roughly 150,000 are from Donegal, yet not one cent from our Government is going into that airport.  We need the Minister, a former Member of this House, to come to the House and listen to the views of 500,000 Irish citizens in that region who are disconnected from their capital city and from equality in terms of the access that would be expected for citizens across this island.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101200002#H00800","speaker":"1400"},{"type":"speech","time":1476264600,"counter":67,"content":"<p>I agree with Senator Mac Lochlainn about those infrastructural projects.

It is certainly one for which the bank should answer.  Despite some people thinking we do not have a role in the day-to-day management of accounts, the banks should explain and, if possible, reverse this decision.  I would also be happy for the Minister to come to the House to discuss the matter concerning insurance which the Senators also raised.<\/p> <p>Many Senators raised the matter of the budget this morning.  To be fair to Senator Catherine Ardagh, she has been consistent on the importance of the funding and staffing of the DEIS, Delivering Equality of Opportunities in Schools, programme and how it is maintained and retained in some cases.  The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, was in the Chamber last week to debate the Action Plan for Education at which time he demonstrated his vision for the Department.  Given that our economy is beginning to recover and more people are back at work, I am of the view that we need to examine how DEIS status is granted in respect of the areas in Dublin to which referred to by Senator Catherine Ardagh and a number in my city, Cork.  I would be happy to have the Minister return to the House to debate this matter.<\/p> <p>Senators Conway-Walsh and &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in referred to class sizes.  In yesterday's budget, it was announced 2,400 extra teachers will be hired, a 3.5% increase.  Up to 2,500 additional posts in schools will be provided for resource teachers, special needs assistants, as well as the return of career guidance.  Up to &euro;160 million will be committed in the whole area of higher education.  Education is the pivotal part of how we get our economy moving again.  We must invest in education.  The supports announced in the budget represent a beginning.  Linked to them is the Action Plan for Education and the new action plan for disadvantaged schools, to which Senator Catherine Ardagh referred and which the Minister will announce before the end of the year.  There is also junior cycle reform and extra career guidance posts.  We have come on a journey.  We have haemorrhaged many people from the public services.  At least now, we have turned the corner in terms of investment.<\/p> <p>The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, announced a comprehensive package for child care with an investment of up to &euro;1.3 billion.  Early years funding has been increased by 35% to &euro;466 million.  A new affordable child care scheme will be introduced, along with an increase to the Tusla budget.  There is investment in children, education and younger years programmes.  Those who question the child care budget should look at the balanced and fair statement issued by the Children's Rights Alliance in respect of it.<\/p> <p>Most people on the airwaves this morning discussing the budget spoke about the housing scheme.  Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill did not acknowledge the issue of supply.  Those of us who hold clinics and engage in canvassing meet people who have an issue with getting into the housing market or being able to obtain  local authority housing.  We need to start incentivising the market in order to allow people to buy houses rather than competing against one another.  I take the Senator's point, however.  We may be able to address it with the Minister in the context of the finance Bill.  It is important that the benefit of a housing purchase scheme goes to the buyer, not to the seller.  I agree with the point about second-hand houses and the Central Bank requirement regarding deposits.  There are, however, people who cannot put the money together and we must give them an incentive.  There is a home improvement scheme still in place.  We are on a journey but it is equally important that we be fair and balanced in how we address the issue.<\/p> <p>Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in referred to free GP care for children under 12 years.  As Members know, the Government's overarching policy is to have free GP care for children under 12.  There are talks under way with GPs regarding contracts.<\/p> <p>Senator Catherine Ardagh referred to free dental cleaning and oral hygiene.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=12\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is regrettable that we have not seen any movement in regard to the matter.

I am happy to invite the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment to come here for a debate.<\/p><p>Senator Mac Lochlainn raised the issue of cross-Border health initiatives.  When I was Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children, the committee visited the North and we witnessed close co-operation.  We can see the close co-operation and link that exists between Altnagelvin Area Hospital and Letterkenny General Hospital in Donegal.  We all welcome the cross-Border health initiatives.<\/p><p>Senator Mac Lochlainn made a point about transport, infrastructural developments and projects, a matter also referred to by Senator Feighan.  Senator Mac Lochlainn also mentioned the A5 project.  I am happy to invite the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to attend here to discuss the matters.<\/p><p>Senator Feighan raised the issue of extending free travel to 18 year olds across Europe.  It is an exciting initiative that would afford students or people who have just left school an opportunity to travel and would encourage them to explore.<\/p><p>Senator Colm Burke raised the important issue of what may happen after the presidential election in the United States, particularly in terms of Israel and Palestine.  It is critical that President Obama's overseas policy is continued.  Senators have differing views on Israel and Palestine.  It is important to recognise, as Senators have said, that the Palestinian people should not be subjected to harassment and torture.  Whoever occupies the White House has a duty and obligation to the world.<\/p><p>I am unfamiliar with the case raised by Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh.

I hope that the Restaurants Association of Ireland and the Irish Hotels Federation will engage with unions.  It is a dialogue and not a monologue so both sides should interact.  The Senator is right that the hotel industry can be a transient place of employment for some people.  There have been issues, with family-run hotels in particular, but the situation has changed.

Nowhere was the way the Seanad is viewed by the public and organisations expressed better than in the past couple of weeks.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Paddy Burke:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=1866\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1866&amp;amp;pid=PaddyBurke&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=12\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Senator Mulherin will not thank me for raising one incident in particular which showed clearly how the Seanad is viewed by certain organisations.  The Senator highlighted publicly, as an instance of discrimination against Members of this House, a letter she received from the GAA indicating that Deputies would be offered tickets for sale for the All-Ireland Football Final but Senators would not.  I got the same letter and I fully subscribe to the Senator's view on the matter.  I understand any Member of this House from a participating county who sent in a letter and cheque received the same response.  The GAA proceeded to roll out its former president and current MEP for the Ireland South region, Se&aacute;n Kelly, who said the organisation had to draw a line somewhere.  It certainly drew a clear line between D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and Seanad &Eacute;ireann in this case.<\/p><p>To make matters worse, RTE's Mary Wilson, in an interview with Senator Mulherin, observed that the latter was only a Taoiseach's nominee, as if to say that Members nominated to the House in this way are different from other Members.  In my time in the Seanad we have had several Members nominated by the Taoiseach who also worked in the media, including former Senators Eoghan Harris and Maurice Hayes, the latter going on to co-author the Manning report.  None of those people was treated in any way differently by his or her colleagues.  I can say with certainty that Taoiseach's nominees are not treated differently in this House.<\/p><p>This particular incident affords us an opportunity to take stock of how we are viewed by the GAA and the media.  In advance of the biggest day in the Gaelic football calendar, the GAA drew a clear line between the D&aacute;il and the Seanad.  Moreover, the Cathaoirleach was likewise discriminated against because he is the only officeholder who is not invited to be seated in the ard chomhairle in Croke Park on all-Ireland final day, along with all the Ministers, Ministers of State, Garda and Army officials.  All the other arms of State are represented there on these occasions but not the Cathaoirleach of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  This Bill and the recommendations in the Manning report will not change any of that.  There will still be Taoiseach's nominees and this House will remain subordinate to the other House.  The actions of the GAA squarely set out how we are viewed as a House of Parliament.<\/p><p>The people who drafted the 1937 Constitution could not have envisaged what would happen in this Seanad.  They could not have foreseen a scenario in which everybody would be represented, including the diaspora.  We have lawyers, doctors, farmers, shopkeepers, business people and members of the media.  A range of political parties is represented, as well as Independents.  Moreover, no party or group has outright control in the Chamber.  The drafters of the Constitution could not have envisaged an Upper House better than we currently have.  Notwithstanding the proposals in Senator McDowell's Bill or in the Manning report, the reality is that we will not achieve a better representation than we currently have.  We will not get more organisations or parties than we have today.  This Bill will make way for hundreds more organisations to put forward nominees but it remains a fact that there can only be 60 people appointed.<\/p><p>With no party having outright control, we are in the ideal position in this Seanad to make changes to how we do business.  Instead, we seem to be putting the cart before the horse.  We could go ahead and implement every provision in Senator McDowell's Bill and every recommendation in the Manning report - many of them would not even require legislation - but there is little point in so doing if we do not have the necessary resources and funding.  For example, there are only four members of staff for Seanad &Eacute;ireann, two of them are almost always seated beside the Cathaoirleach.  People can put forward whatever proposals they like but unless there is back-up funding, we cannot do what is proposed in the Manning report or any other report or Bill.<\/p><p>The current Seanad could not be any more diverse and is not controlled by any party.  If the Government really is committed to reform, it should go about the business of giving more power to this House to scrutinise legislation and deal with the various matters as recommended in the Manning report.  The working group recommended, for instance, that the Seanad give particular attention to North-South Ministerial Council proposals and secondary EU legislation, consult with relevant bodies prior to and during Second Stage debates, investigate and report on matters of public policy interest, and consider reports from regulators and other statutory inspectors.  Senator Leyden has repeatedly called for a role for this House in the scrutinising of EU legislation, a proposal I fully support.  It cannot be done, however, because the D&aacute;il will not allow it.  Instead, the other House has decided the European committee will deal with European legislation and scrutiny, with other committees also having a role.  The view, apparently, is that we cannot having the same work being done by a committee and the Seanad, thus making the proposal a non-starter.<\/p><p>Another proposal was that we might have a role in pre-legislative scrutiny, with Ministers presenting heads of Bills to the House for discussion before a potential redrafting of the legislation prior to Second Stage.  However, as soon as it was decided to implement a pre-legislative process, that function went straight to a D&aacute;il committee.  The last Member of this House to chair a committee of both Houses was Pat Magner back in the mid-1990s.  It seems there is no person in this House good enough to be Chairperson of any of the 15 or 16 joint committees.  As I said, most of the various proposals for Seanad reform could be implemented without ever changing the legislation.  What is required, however, is a commitment by Government to provide the resources and staff necessary to do the work.<\/p><p>The Acting Chairman has indicated my time is up.  This Bill will put an enormous cost on the Exchequer - certainly &euro;30 million, which is a substantial sum, and perhaps as much as &euro;50 million.  It will see the franchise extended to nearly half the world in order to have the same groups, organisations and parties represented here.  We cannot have real change without a commitment to give more funding to enable us to do the business that is proposed to be done.  We could start doing that work in the morning if the necessary commitment was there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101200002#O00400","speaker":"1380","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1476264600,"counter":100,"content":"<p>When it comes to the issue of Seanad reform, there have been a number of reports, commissions and referenda.  Much is said about the eighth amendment to the Constitution and the damage it has done to Irish women over the years, but the seventh amendment to the Constitution is another interesting one that rarely raises any comment.  The interesting thing about the seventh amendment to the Constitution is that it was never legislated for.  It was an attempt to widen the franchise for voters in Seanad elections.  Over the almost 40 years since then there have been quite a number of commissions and reports.<\/p> <p>There was a referendum a number of years ago to abolish this Chamber, which I supported at that point.  I remember debating with Senator McDowell at that time at an event where we took opposing views on it.  Both our positions have changed over the years.  It was my interaction with this Chamber as Minister of State that changed my view on its validity and what it has to offer.<\/p> <p>There comes a stage where we have to put an end to the endless round of commissions and reports and actually do something.  The issue with this Chamber is the perceived or otherwise disconnect between it and the electorate.  This Bill tries to address that in many different ways.  There is potential in the Chamber to give a voice to people in society who do not often get a chance to have their voices heard.  Much has been said about the diaspora and Irish citizens in the North of Ireland but I am thinking also of groups such as Travellers and others who would benefit greatly from having representation in this Chamber on matters that concern them.<\/p> <p>One issue that concerns me in the Bill is the ability of an Oireachtas Member to be also a member of a local authority.  Often in this Chamber people speak about their constituency.  Technically we do not have a constituency because we come into the Chamber as national politicians.  We do not have a geographical constituency.  If we were to go back to the situation where local authority members could run for the Seanad and have a dual mandate, we would dilute the national focus of the Chamber.  Inevitably county council and city council issues would be brought to the floor of the Seanad.  That happens anyway but it would be compounded by a situation where that separation does not exist.<\/p> <p>One of the positive moves of the former Minister for the Environment and Local Government, former Deputy Noel Dempsey, was to propose the abolition of the dual mandate, which eventually became law in 2003.  It provided that one could not be a Member of the national Parliament and a local authority member.  It was very controversial at the time for people who were in that position and did not like it.  It separated various different areas of local administration and public representation.  Council work was taken up by councillors and national work and national legislation were taken on by Oireachtas Members.  I would have to be convinced that to go back to a situation where Senators could be local authority members is a positive move.<\/p> <p>In terms of what we are trying to achieve in the House, we work quite well together when we speak with one voice.  I am keenly aware that politics is under more international pressure now.  There is more pressure now on the validity of public life, the ability to make a case, and the ability to believe in something and stand for something than there has been ever before.  Looking at what is happening in the United States, the UK and throughout Europe, it appears to me that politics is in a complete mess.  The fault for that lies with politicians and the political system.  If we lose faith in the institutions of our political system, we are in a very dangerous position.  We can see what is happening in the UK, where a very nasty scenario has arisen.  I mentioned the US and Europe as well.  When we change the way we do business in the Oireachtas, we have to proceed with caution, although there has been so much caution around this Chamber that it has led to nothing happening.  I suggest that the Minister of State, the Acting Chairman and Senators take this Bill in good faith.  We can work on its various elements as we proceed.  If the Chamber is to have any validity in the future, its connectivity with the public has to be reinforced.  I question the ability of a Senator in this House to have a dual function in a local authority because if we are to be serious about national politics and talk about national issues, then having a focus on the local authority area would not be a good move.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101200002#Q00100","speaker":"1410"},{"type":"speech","time":1476264600,"counter":101,"content":"<p>A total of 35 million people in the US, 16 million in Great Britain, 4.5 million in Canada, 2 million in Australia and 500,000 in Argentina claim Irish heritage.  Ireland is much greater than the jurisdiction of this Parliament and broader than the community of this island.  Tens of millions of people around the world claim Irish heritage.  I am the first representative of those interests to have been afforded a voice in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  At a time when our neighbours across the sea are retrenching from European partnership, when the party of Abraham Lincoln in the US is calling for borders to be closed and trade links severed, now is the time for Ireland to send a message and reach out to its community across the globe.  I can think of no better way of demonstrating to the Irish diaspora that Ireland wants it to be part of our State and our community than expanding the franchise of this House and building a Seanad that can have a meaningful impact, not just on these shores but much further afield.<\/p> <p>When the Irish people voted to preserve the Seanad in 2013, they did not do so out of any true affinity to how this House operated.  The people gave the Houses of the Oireachtas the clearest mandate they have ever received to reform the Seanad.  We must look forward and this Bill is a leap in that direction.  Giving Irish citizens with current passports living abroad the chance to be eligible to register and vote on a panel of their choice for the Seanad would give a clear voice to the Irish emigrant community that I represent.  It is estimated there are 3.1 million Irish passport holders living overseas.  Affording these people a vote in our Seanad should be just the first step in redefining Ireland.  A European Union without the United Kingdom, with which we have always shared common positions on trade, investment and taxation, will be one where Ireland needs to present itself as a nation of 70 million people and not as a small country on the periphery of Europe.  The emigrant voice needs to be heard and we need to connect with that voice.<\/p> <p>Studies have shown that, over time, a 10% increase in immigration in a particular country is associated with a 1% increase of exports to that country and a 3% increase in imports from it.  Networking and strengthening connections with the diaspora has consistently been shown to increase economic activity in the home country.  Whether it is Israel becoming the world&rsquo;s second largest venture capital market or India becoming a global technology hub, it is the diaspora strategies of those states that has been at the root of their success.  We need to harness the Irish diaspora now more than ever to ensure more investment in this country, more jobs, and greater economic stability in the face of the inevitable economic winds this country will face as a result of Brexit.<\/p> <p>It is not just the economic benefits of providing the diaspora with representation in this House that should be considered but also the enormous cultural, political and social ties that have led to transformative changes in Irish society and that show why the diaspora deserve to vote for representatives of this House.  Nowhere was this more evident than the same-sex marriage referendum where more than 70,000 returning emigrants were estimated to have flown home to vote and have their say in such a significant change to this country's social identity.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Billy Lawless:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2485\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2485&amp;amp;pid=BillyLawless&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=12\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Speaking in the D&aacute;il in 1963, President John F.

People voted in the 2013 referendum to keep the Seanad, which showed a belief in the effectiveness and importance of this legislative arm.  To honour the faith of the populace, it is important to keep the integral features of the House while ensuring it operates effectively.  The Bill, however, focuses almost entirely on the electorate with little emphasis on the processes of this House.<\/p> <p>The concept behind the vocational panels underpinning the Seanad electoral system has merit in bringing forward candidates who are genuinely from a particular business, professional or union background.  I would have concerns, however, about additional eligibility requirements that the Bill imposes on nominating bodies, one of which is to have in place a set of corporate governance rules.  This needs to be examined in the light of existing governance rules for nominating bodies.  It is also fair comment to point that we are building a barrier to potential candidates by requiring seven years' experience in their chosen field, let alone adding another step to the nominating process.<\/p> <p>In terms of providing votes for Irish citizens overseas which, in theory, is laudable, I am not entirely convinced.

Should someone who has not lived in this country for perhaps 40 years have a say in the make-up of our national Parliament?  There are certainly practical issues that would arise in any significant extension of the voter franchise and these should be considered before we take any steps to allow overseas voting.<\/p> <p>When one examines who is eligible to vote under this Bill, the estimated Seanad electorate would increase to some 5.3 million people from an original 120,000.  I can be corrected if I am wrong about that.  This would naturally dilute the role that the local authority members play in deciding the membership of Seanad &Eacute;ireann - they would be reduced to 13 seats.  Presently, 43 seats in the Seanad are elected by members of local authorities throughout the country together with the incoming Deputies and outgoing Senators.  This electorate represents a direct and significant link between local communities and the Oireachtas.  This is an important connection between local democracy and the national Parliament.<\/p> <p>This proposed Seanad electoral commission will replace the existing Seanad returning office, which, as my colleague pointed out, has very few staff.  Will it be able to handle the projected 5.3 million voters?  Where are the financial estimates on the proposed Seanad electoral commission and the burden it would place on the taxpayer?<\/p> <p>As I see it, there are some other snags as well.  Candidates would have to apply for one of the five vocational panels and even at that, it could be very lob sided.  One might have a huge number on one panel and not many on another.  Obviously, it will not be evenly spread because candidates will have to apply and opt for a particular panel, and that will be as a result of regulations with the consent of the Taoiseach.  There is a pre-Seanad electoral commission and then there is the Seanad one.  The Senator can correct me if I am wrong about that also when he is winding up.  There will be a different returning officer for each vocational constituency and also one or more returning officers for the institutions of higher education.  I understand it will be one constituency as a result of the referendum that took place in 1979, a decision which no Government has put into effect.<\/p> <p>In applying for inclusion on the electoral register, under the Bill a person may express a preference for the constituency in respect of which he or she plans to cast his or her vote.  As I say, one could have many people opting for one or two panels and maybe not so many for the others.  I am not sure about the balance between them.<\/p> <p>I understand the desire to extend the franchise to Irish citizenship, and there is also the question of allowing more people to apply for a valid Irish passport - there will be some fun with this.  In any event, there will be a ballot paper in electronic form for printing and a unique identifier for each individual, and the ballot papers will have a unique QR code printed on them.  One could have fraud and all sorts involved here because it will be communicated through the post which will not be registered, although that is probably not too important.<\/p> <p>It imposes a huge responsibility on the Taoiseach of the day in deciding on this electoral commission.  There will be an interim electoral commission and then there will be another one established, presumably when it is necessary.  As Senator Paddy Burke said, there will be a significant financial imposition in that regard.  We may have to suffer that, if it is the right thing to do when the time comes, but we will have some interesting times teasing this out on Committee Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101200002#R00400","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1476264600,"counter":106,"content":"<p>I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on the Seanad Bill.  It is certainly a Bill that will encourage much debate in the House and reflection on the role of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.<\/p> <p>One aspect baffles me in that, since the recession, the only institute of democracy within the State to come under the microscope of reform has been Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  Other institutions of State, including D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, how the Executive or the Cabinet forms its powerful position and, indeed, local authorities, have not been given the same scrutiny in terms of reform, powers and democracy.  It has been the easy option to kick Seanad &Eacute;ireann and to look at reforming it.<\/p> <p>The Taoiseach opted for abolition in the famous speech that he gave at a Fine Gael dinner in 2012 and there was a referendum.  My party was the only parliamentary party that opposed the abolition of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  We strongly opposed its abolition because of the principle of democratic accountability and oversight.  Doing away with the Seanad would obviously lead to a democratic deficit, by removing the second Chamber and allowing the Executive to have more power.  In other words, it would centralise power.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2261\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2261&amp;amp;pid=BrianODomhnaill&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=12\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> Subsequently, the 2014 local government reform legislation was brought forward by the then Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Phil Hogan, the objective of which was to reform local government.  However, that objective has not been met.  A number of studies on that have been carried out.  I carried out a comprehensive analysis as part of a master's of finance degree I undertook on the 2014 local government reforms, which included research and survey analyses in respect of local authority members across the political spectrum.  It is very clear that said legislation has halted democracy.  It has centralised power in the Executive and away from councillors in the local government setting.  Local government is starved of financial resources.  The reforms were within the realm of efficiency, and we know what that means.  Efficiency without effectiveness of services means that costs are being cut.  That is what has happened.<\/p><p>In the spirit of the reforms contained in the Bill before us, we support any reformation of Seanad &Eacute;ireann that would make it more effective in its role.  However, I have concerns, some of which have been expressed, about the manner in which the reforms are being brought forward, particularly those relating to the electoral process.  I agree with Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in that the House has a major role to play at national, not local, level.  The manner in which the Seanad is structured can instil a greater level of debate on and scrutiny of legislation than perhaps the Lower House because of the local and casework demands on Deputies.<\/p><p>There is a need to examine the way we do our business.  If we are serious about reform, the first change we should examine is the manner in which we do our work on a week-to-week basis and consider some of the aspects that have been touched upon, including the scrutiny of European legislation, and sitting four days a week.  That could be a good start.  A report I read recently indicated that over 95% of the laws made in Brussels that impact on our citizens in Ireland go unchecked.  They are filtered through the parliamentary committee system but those committees - due to their workload - often do not have the time to scrutinise such legislative proposals and demands from Brussels.  We could start with that aspect.<\/p><p>There is an all-Ireland agenda which has to be developed in a better way, particularly in the aftermath of the Brexit vote in the United Kingdom.  Those are matters in respect of which we could introduce reforms.<\/p><p>The electoral reform of the Seanad is another area.  I would be slow to disenfranchise local government any further by reducing the democratic power of local authority members in electing Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute; to the House.<\/p><p>There is another difficulty - political theorists, not just in Ireland but in other jurisdictions also, have reflected on this - where the same person has two votes to elect people to either Chamber.  For example, the electorate would have a vote to elect a Member to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and the same person would have a vote to elect a different person to Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  There are issues around that.  It is a matter on which we need to reflect.<\/p><p>Regarding the Taoiseach's nominees, and I welcome Senator Lawless, who is here representing the diaspora.  The Taoiseach, and my party leader, made excellent choices this time around in selecting Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute;, particularly those from sectoral interest groups.  We can criticise that and say it is undemocratic for the Taoiseach to do so, but it was Eamon de Valera who changed the manner in which 11 Members were nominated by the Taoiseach.  I have been critical of this in the past but that is not to say that in the future party politics would be the dominant feature in terms of the way a Taoiseach would put forward his or her 11 nominees.  That process has to be changed.  If we are to elect people representing the diaspora abroad, there should be one Seanad&oacute;ir elected.  I know the structure is different in the Bill but these are issues we can tease out on Committee Stage.  We will not object to the completion of the Second Reading of the Bill today, but we reserve the right to bring forward amendments on Committee Stage.<\/p><p>I emphasise that local government in this country, which is the point of democracy closest to the citizen, is actually the weakest in Europe.  We should not be proud of that.  We will disenfranchise local government further if we remove the power of local authority members to elect 43 Senators.  We have to examine the overall picture and not just engage in a knee-jerk reaction.  I am all for political transformation and reformation, but it cannot be done on its own.  It must be done in the round.  There is a need to reform the way we do politics in this country and make decisions about spending public money, but we cannot do that in a knee-jerk fashion.<\/p><p>Yesterday's budget was an opportunity to reform more areas but it did not occur.  We had a massive opportunity to carry out major reforms in the aftermath of the financial crisis of the past five years when there was a strong Government in power.  Unfortunately, that did not happen.  Some good things were done, particularly in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, but much more needs to be done, particularly around value for money.  As politicians, we often say that we should spend more.  All political parties want more to be spent, including those that criticise the Government.  However, what is the point in spending more if we are not getting value for money for what is currently being spent?  There are issues around that.  This goes back to the power of the Executive, the debate in the D&aacute;il and the debate in the Seanad - they are all interlinked.  Local government has been reduced, with 80 town councils brought out of the equation and democracy, at the point closest to the those councils, removed.  This has resulted in a further centralisation of power.  What has happened at local government level is that the power has been centralised to the county manager and away from councillors who were democratically elected.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101200002#R00500","speaker":"1382","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1476264600,"counter":108,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101200002#S00200","speaker":"1427"},{"type":"speech","time":1476264600,"counter":109,"content":"<p>We should not rush to reform Seanad &Eacute;ireann because it is popular to do so.

We campaigned in the referendum in 2013 for it to be abolished, but the people made their decision and we respect that.

We are all honoured and privileged to find a job that matches our passion and to perform it in our daily lives.  However, there are still many flaws in the operation and formation of the Seanad.  That is why I welcome this Bill as it has many elements which have the capacity to make reforming changes which were demanded by the electorate following the referendum on its abolition.<\/p> <p>This Seanad is probably the most diverse in history in terms of the various opinions of Members.

This is good for our country and our democracy.  More can be done to make the Seanad an even truer reflection of society and the Bill will allow for it.  Allowing 30 of the 60 Members to be elected by popular vote is a move that we welcome.  The electorate proved it is interested in the Seanad and recognises its worth to our democratic system.  Therefore, it is most welcome, as part of the Bill, that the public should be given a direct say in who is elected to it, a choice to elect who they want to represent them.<\/p><p>Embracing our fellow citizens and holders of Irish passports from the North is also very welcome.  We have campaigned for a long time for voting rights for our fellow citizens in all elections that take place in the Republic.  We believe it is only a matter of time before it happens and we look forward to a time when we will have representatives from the Six Counties in a Thirty-two County D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  Brexit is a great opportunity to do it.  On that note, I would like to congratulate my colleague, Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile, who became the first Sinn F&eacute;in Senator to join us from the Six Counties, despite not even being able to vote in the election.  We are very proud of him.  Allowing the members of the diaspora to vote is also a very important step in keeping a link with our citizens who are forced to or otherwise leave our country and seek new opportunities elsewhere.  We should never forget them and their links to our country.  This proposed step would include them in our democratic process.<\/p><p>Allowing more of our graduates to have a say through the university panel would also be a progressive step.  Exclusivity was part and parcel of the Seanad for far too long.  The public rightly had a negative view of the House and its operation as a closed shop inhabited by fuddy-duddies.  The position in this regard has changed dramatically in recent years, which has been positive for our democracy.  Our House - the people's House - has a positive role to play into the future.  Many good people and positive contributors have come through the Seanad and many more will come through in the future.  The Seanad could take on many extra responsibilities that would make a positive contribution to Irish society.  I liken the House to a family in which the maturing children are demanding from their parents more responsibility and the opportunity to move on, embrace ideas and have their say.  I support the Bill, but reiterate that three years is a long time to wait for reform.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101200002#S00600","speaker":"1388","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1476264600,"counter":114,"content":"<p>My first memory of the Seanad was as a child.  Long after the fanfare of general elections and posters, my best friend's house across the road would be flooded with election literature for the Seanad.  I often wondered, and asked, why it was absent from our letter-box.  Obviously, my father went to work at Guinness at the age of 15 and did not go to college.  Neither did my mother.  Young people and children listen, and I, as a Senator, remain conscious of that inequality.  This insight as a child forever informs my understanding of the House.<\/p> <p>In October 2013, the people rejected the referendum proposal to abolish the Seanad.  However, all participants and parties involved in the referendum were clear in saying the Seanad, in its current form, is elitist, undemocratic and unacceptable.  In the discourse that has developed, the result is not viewed as a vote to retain the Seanad in its current form.  The House must become fully inclusive, representative, relevant and accountable.  After the referendum, the Taoiseach and the Government committed to reform the political system and to ensure the Seanad was a modern and effective second Chamber.  Yet, as we have heard from across the House, progress and change have yet to be achieved.<\/p> <p>The Seanad was created under the 1937 Constitution and, in the decades since, with few honourable exceptions, it has become synonymous with cronyism and corruption, particularly on the part of the Fianna F&aacute;il party.  The latter used the system of political nominees to reward close political allies.  The Seanad is also used as a safety net for those who fail to get elected to the D&aacute;il.  At no point has the Seanad provided a genuine check on the actions of the Government.  Surely we can facilitate the direct election by way of universal franchise of all citizens on the same day as a D&aacute;il vote.  Surely, Northern Ireland and diaspora representation could be the norm.  Surely, 50% of the representation in the House could be women.  Surely groups in Irish society that are traditionally marginalised would be guaranteed representation.

I have listened, here and via the monitor in my office, to what many of the speakers have said.  There is a real appetite for reform and an acknowledgement that there are deficiencies in the Seanad as it stands, particularly in terms of what the report describes as elitist and one which disenfranchises so many of our citizens.  This must be addressed.  The previous speaker highlighted his experience of it.  The fact that so many third-level institutions are excluded from the university panel electorate is not healthy.  The absence of clear and defining guidelines or public understanding of the Seanad's distinctive role must be addressed.  While I agree with a large number of the good points in the report, many need to be further explored and examined.<\/p> <p>I believe in the comment that a reformed Seanad must be seen by Irish citizens as having a legitimate voice and a role in the political process and that it should have adequate powers and functions.  However, I will return to it regarding what it might mean depending on the level of access a diaspora would and should have.  I agree with the concept.  The Seanad is enriched by the presence of Senator Lawless and our Sinn F&eacute;in representative from Northern Ireland.  However, there is a major issue to be explored.  Other speakers have discussed the logistics of achieving it.  I refer, for example, to how all Irish passport holders in Northern Ireland and elsewhere around the world would be informed and how arrangements would be made to enable them to vote.  Our diaspora is not very different - in terms of being information technology, IT, savvy - than many of our own people.  Many of them are older individuals who may not be IT savvy.  The report alludes to county libraries making IT available.  How would this be done with people abroad?  I particularly think of many of our countrymen and countrywomen residing in the UK who went abroad and sent money home but find themselves in situations of hardship that make it difficult for them to access such facilities or have a full understanding of them.<\/p> <p>As other speakers said, there is so much more the Seanad could do.  Scrutinising EU legislation is one example.  The report alludes to committee work and bringing people before the Seanad.  How would it impact on our existing committees?  As somebody who was involved in the successful pre-legislative scrutiny of the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act, which was held here in this Chamber, I wonder how we would manage the process without duplication and conflict with the committee system, which has worked well.  Pre-legislative scrutiny is a very important process around our legislation and I am very pleased it has become standard.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator James Reilly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2180\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2180&amp;amp;pid=DrJamesReilly&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=12\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> I think the principle of one person, one vote is certainly something to which most of us subscribe.

That certainly is something that requires examination and needs to be addressed.  This is not a criticism of the management, which I believe does great work on our behalf.  <\/p><p>I do not want to spend too long going through the report.  It says Seanad &Eacute;ireann lacks a distinctive identity, too closely reflects that of D&aacute;il Eireann and fails to realise the constitutional ambition to create a largely vocational Chamber.  It speaks about achieving more balance of vocational representation and educating people.  A bit that really disturbs me says that the level of knowledge and practical experience required of candidates in the Constitution should be defined in legislation.  I would be very worried about that.

All I have to do is keep encouraging him and he will keep doing it.<\/p> <p>The ninth recommendation of the working group talks about giving consideration to North-South Ministerial Council proposals; giving consideration to secondary legislation of the EU, which has been touched upon; consulting with relevant bodies prior to and during Second Stage debate, which I believe will cause problems; and investigating and reporting on matters of public policy interest, which I believe we already do.  Much of the stuff that has been mentioned here can be done without necessarily passing a Bill, as Senator Paddy Burke has already noted.  <\/p> <p>I believe we are going to have a serious issue around how we can have representation without residency or taxation.  A total of 5.5 million people who do not reside in or pay taxes here could influence policy that would impact on the day-to-day lives of the citizens who live here without any consequences for them.  That is not in any way to demean the value of our diaspora, which is very important to us not just from the point of view of creating more jobs and more industry but from a cultural point of view and all it has done for us.  It is more a case of how we get that balance right between those we want to involve and the powers of this Seanad in respect of how it impacts on national policy.  I believe there needs to be input but we have an awful lot of work to do to investigate how to get that balance right so that the citizens of this country who live and pay their taxes here and suffer the consequences of policy here do not feel disenfranchised by a larger number of our diaspora which would have an input into that.  This is something that requires far more examination.  <\/p> <p>When I was a Minister, one feature of this House I found hugely useful and helpful related to commencing legislation.  Many of the things Senator Paddy Burke referred to and the issue of starting more Bills in this House can be done without necessarily waiting for this Bill to complete its passage and for the reform of the Seanad to take place.  Many of the things we could do that would improve the working of the House and create far more relevance for our people can be done without necessarily waiting for this.  I welcome the Bill in terms of the debate it has generated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101200002#U00700","speaker":"1421"},{"type":"speech","time":1476264600,"counter":124,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State.  I compliment Senator McDowell on pushing this Bill forward.  When I became a Senator, he was one of the first people I spoke to about the Bill and he was very insistent about getting support for it.  I also second the points made by Senator Lawless regarding the Irish diaspora, of which I was a member for 20 years.  I think I was more Irish abroad than I am in my own country.  I support most of what the Senator said.  Ireland is almost unique in not allowing even a bare level of voting access for the recently emigrated and it is my hope that this Bill will go some way towards remedying that problem.<\/p> <p>My approach to this Bill is one of frustration that the reform of this archaic Chamber has taken so long and that this issue has not advanced more since we introduced it in July.  I respect the points made by Senator Reilly but, nevertheless, in my opinion, diversity is strength and movement.  We need to move on with things.  We cannot just think and debate forever.  We need to put things into effect.  The Manning report was the 12th such review of the powers and make-up of the Seanad.  We have been debating its powers and electoral process for most of the history of the Republic.  We passed a referendum to expand its democratic mandate through the enlargement of the university panel franchise by an overwhelming 92% as far back as 1979.  This still has not been acted on.  Having been a student of Waterford Institute of Technology, I have no vote in the process.  Previous processes have been far too slow and even less effective.  Reforming the Seanad was voted one of the most pressing concerns by the Constitutional Convention, second only to greater environmental protection.  The Irish people voted to keep and reform the Seanad three years ago this month and we have still to make that a reality.<\/p> <p>This Bill is not perfect.  The Green Party position would be to more radically change the nature of the Seanad to make it the primary body that scrutinises EU legislation with even greater freedom from Government dominance than that provided for in this Bill.  We would like to see the Seanad have more power than it currently has to imbue it with greater importance not just by changing the way it is elected but by increasing public focus on its work by making it more crucial to the legislative process.  We want to change the way business is handled and to expand its functions to include the development and facilitation of participative democratic functions.  Some of this would necessitate a change to the constitutional nature of the Seanad but much can be achieved once the newly restructured Seanad outlined in this Bill is made a reality. <\/p> <p>It is my belief that the Seanad can be a greater Chamber.  There are plenty of examples of senates around the world that play a crucial role in their democracies.  The Australian Senate has long provided a crucial control in respect of the see-saw politics of the two-party system of the lower chamber there, while also allowing for the representation of alternative views.  In much of Europe and elsewhere, upper houses have facilitated federalism and positive decentralisation.  Although the US Senate has been undergoing some tough reputational times, it has often lived up to its reputation as the \"greatest deliberative body in the world\".  Well-structured upper chambers can play a key role in modern democracies holding governments and lower chambers to account and introducing new thought and new ways of doing business into the legislative process.   <\/p> <p>In order to do this, some key characteristics are essential.  They should be elected or composed in a different fashion to that of their respective lower chambers.  They should make some effort to temper the partisan divisions that can dominate lower houses.  They should be largely or completely popularly elected.  They can also offer dedicated representation to groups in society that are otherwise under-represented.  This Bill in particular does much on that front.<\/p> <p>The Seanad reform Bill that I have sponsored, along with all my colleagues in the Civil Engagement group, addresses many of these key concerns and lays out a vision of a more democratic and legitimate Seanad in line with its original intentions when it was conceived in the 1937 Constitution.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Grace O'Sullivan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2467\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2467&amp;amp;pid=GraceOSullivan&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=12\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The Bill will finally make a reality of the 1979 referendum result and democratise the university panels by merging them and admitting all Irish graduates into the franchise.  The university panels have provided us with some of our more impressive political figures over the years, including Mary Robinson and Senators Norris, Higgins and Ruane.  The University of Dublin panel in particular played a role in providing representation to minority communities during the early Republic.  A reformed Seanad can play a similar role in finally granting those Irish forced to move abroad by the economic collapse some form of representation in their native political system through their inclusion in the Seanad voting panels, and with provision at long last of some form of national postal voting.  That will bring us one step closer to ensuring we cherish all the children of the Republic equally.  The Bill also finally restores the vocationality of the panels by requiring that candidates actually have some knowledge and experience of the topics they are elected to represent.  It restores the balance towards the nominating bodies and away from the political parties in the D&aacute;il.  This Bill will create a renewed, more democratic and more informed Upper House and I urge all Senators and Deputies to give it their full support, as I intend to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101200002#U00800","speaker":"1385","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1476264600,"counter":126,"content":"<p>I thank Senator McDowell for bringing this Bill before us and I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy English, my neighbour from the poorer side of Meath.

As a former councillor, I know the Seanad performs a great role and I would hate the vocational panels and input of councillors to be totally diminished to 13 seats.  As a councillor, my greatest link with national politics and policy was through my interaction with Senators.  Now, as a Senator, I see that role in reverse.  The councillors of Ireland are at the coalface and they deal with the public.  There is a very close relationship between the councillor and the Senator, more than with the Deputy, which in essence forms a link between these Houses and the people on the street and changing that would be detrimental.<\/p> <p>I must comment on my colleagues to my right.  Once again, even in a debate of this nature, as a Fianna F&aacute;il Member I had to take a snipe.  I will not lower myself to snipe back and in fact I will give a compliment.  As Senator Devine reminded us, Sinn F&eacute;in canvassed for the abolition of the Seanad and I thank them for that.  If that party had canvassed for its retention, none of us would be here today.  We owe the party a debt of gratitude.<\/p> <p>I really appreciate the contribution from Senator Lawless and I am delighted he is here.  Nevertheless, I have a major issue with the Bill and the proposed inclusion of the overall diaspora and Irish passport holders.  We have all shouted for boys in green in the Lansdowne Road stadium or what is now the Aviva who, when they arrived in Dublin Airport, may have had to get directions to the stadium.  They had an Irish passport but how Irish were they?  There is a diaspora that is interconnected and not long gone, as well as some we would like to bring home.  Giving them a vote for its own sake will not bring them home or give them any more of a connection with Ireland and how Irish governance is carried out.  Today, we are discussing the giving of a vote in a Seanad election to up to 5 million people.  We still will have vocational panels, where people will have a choice as to which panel they will work from.  The logistics will not be possible.  We could have a dry run for a presidential election, if possible, that would involve one ballot paper, and we could see how that works.  I see the merits in the philosophy of including an entire diaspora, and I agree with it to an extent, but the logistics in this scenario will not be possible.  The way the proposal has been designed with the vocational panels, whereby people decide on which panel they wish to vote, is not possible.  We could have a dry run with a presidential election involving one ballot paper to see how it goes.<\/p> <p>As I stated at the outset, I am only learning how this House works and I should declare, so far so good.  I have been able to raise issues that I was not able to raise in the council chamber.  I am thankful that in some, although not all, cases I have obtained positive outcomes.  We have a major role to play in the analysis and scrutiny of European and national law, as has been mentioned.  Where does that go?  Perhaps our day could be more condensed and we could be more fruitful in what we do.  The scheduling should be examined as much as how and why we got in here.  A Senator mentioned a knee-jerk reaction to reform in a contribution but this is definitely the slowest knee-jerk reaction that could possibly happen.  There is a need for reform and it is not a knee-jerk reaction.<\/p> <p>The Bill is to be welcomed and although I will support it, I will keep my options open on Committee Stage, as my colleague noted.  There will be a need for much scrutiny in much of the make-up of the Bill and there must be some amendments.  In theory the Bill must be welcomed as there is a need for reform, although that should not just be for its own sake.  It does not need to be the dramatic type of reform that seems to be the populist opinion.  As was highlighted in the referendum about this Chamber, the populist opinion might not be the right one.  In 2013, when politicians were to be kicked around the streets, who would have predicted the people of Ireland would vote to keep the Seanad?  Nobody in their right mind could even imagine how anybody would vote for politicians at that time.<\/p> <p>The people have spoken and they want a Seanad.  It is up to us, na Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute;, to figure out how we do our business.  I do not want to get carried away in how we decide to elect Senators and complicate matters.  The last count I attended was so complicated, it was unreal.  It is so complicated I did not even know I had been elected when it happened.  From what I hear today, we are going to make this even more complicated.  Perhaps I am reacting in a knee-jerk fashion, as I am still recovering from a campaign that hit the four corners of the country.  I have a vision in my mind, with what is being spoken about here, of having to do a global campaign.<\/p> <p>We must think very strongly about how to include the diaspora.  I have no problem with the idea in theory as it is a great idea.  As some Senators have mentioned, I lived outside the country for some time.  I was more Irish then and travelled for two or three hours in taxis to see Irish bands playing.  If I had been at home and they were on the radio, I would have turned it off.  The Irish diaspora can be more Irish than we are but we should not include them for the sake of it and complicate the process.  One would not know what kind of Seanad we would end up with if 5 million people were voting.  Some would wear green jerseys like the Irish soccer team players who did not know how to get to Lansdowne Road when they arrived in Dublin.  What kind of Seanad would they elect?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101200002#V00900","speaker":"1383"},{"type":"speech","time":1476264600,"counter":133,"content":"<p>I thank the Seanad Independent group for using their Private Members' time for this crucial Bill.

I am sure we will all agree that a significant number of people feel they are not well represented in Irish politics.  People see the infighting that has resulted from partisan and Government-versus-Opposition politics.  They believe that the issues they care about and that affect them are lost in the fray and are the collateral damage of electoral competition.  This is why ensuring the creation of a reformed and independently-minded Seanad is so important.  The Seanad could be a forum for consensus, for cross-party policy-making and for the type of politics that focuses on Irish citizens, not political point-scoring.<\/p><p>Since the adoption of the Constitution in 1937, the Irish people have been locked out of the Upper House of their Parliament.  They have been kept at a distance, unable to participate and only able to observe.  This Bill will open up the Seanad to the Irish people and provide another check and balance in respect of policy-making and governance in this country.<\/p><p>I am a strong believer in the idea of a fully participatory democracy.  I believe in a democracy where every level of government constantly and consistently seeks new mandates from its citizens in the form of elections.  That is why I have co-sponsored a Bill on the Order Paper to lower the voting age to 16 in order to include young people in political decision-making.  That is why, as president of Trinity's Students' Union, I led voter registration drives that signed up tens of thousands of students to vote and thus ensure the greatest level of participation by as many people as possible in Irish democracy.<\/p><p>I support the Bill because it will allow for a new forum whereby Irish citizens can directly mandate their representatives to work on their behalf and express their vision for the future of this State.  As politicians, we must support all efforts to build a stronger and more symbiotic relationship between Irish politics and Irish citizens.  That is why I call on everyone in the House to support the Bill.<\/p><p>My colleague, Senator Norris, will have an opposing view on the following matter.

I am not surprised that he champions Seanad reform.<\/p> <p>We have had other good champions in the Seanad, including Dr. Maurice Manning, who lectured me when I studied politics at UCD for three years.  UCD is where many people my age learned about politics, its intricacies and the value of the Seanad.  As a UCD student, I came here as a guest of Dr. Maurice Manning.  I sat in the Visitors Gallery and saw the workings of the Seanad at first hand.<\/p> <p>Like everyone else, I want Seanad reform but first we must check what works.  We are quick to criticise ourselves and institutions but we should consider what we have achieved in this Chamber.  Some of the most influential people in Irish society have passed through this Chamber.  To my left is Senator Norris.  We all know what he has achieved since the 1980s.  His success is in no small part due to his membership of this House.  If anybody suggested that a reformed Seanad would not have somebody like him in it, I do not believe the Irish people would want such a situation.  We must be careful about how we pitch reform and what type of reform we embrace.  The reform of local government was discussed for a long time and eventually it was reformed before the 2014 local elections.  If one asks a current councillor, particularly one in a rural area, whether reform is good, he or she will reply in the negative and state that the municipal areas are too big and that the municipal district structure is broken, even though it was never right in the first instance.  Also, the elimination of town councils came about on foot of a unilateral decision but many people would say that swathes of urban Ireland are not represented at local authority level.  I caution that we need reform but we must ensure that it is the right type of reform.<\/p> <p>I have only direct experience of Seanad &Eacute;ireann since 2011.

Its establishment was an initiative mooted by the previous Leader, Maurice Cummins.  It was set up to examine and report on issues that affect Irish society and that are deeply held within the mindset of Irish people.  One example is the groundbreaking farm safety report.  It received national and international coverage in terms of pulling all the relevant stakeholders together.  We advertised for submissions and received many.  We opened the Seanad Chamber to between ten and 12 groups and they gave oral submissions.  We based a report on all of the submissions and made significant recommendations.  As one person involved in farm safety said, every time a line is written in the media about farm safety awareness is raised and, potentially, lives are saved.

We have to respect that it is a different animal from the D&aacute;il with a different but nonetheless important function.  There are two aspects, first, electoral reform and how we elect Senators; and, second, how it operates and functions.  We need to address both to achieve reform.<\/p> <p>The view of the public is that it does not get to vote on the Seanad and it wonders what the Seanad does, although when we had a referendum people wanted to keep it.  There is a good case to extend the franchise on the basis that we need to have as much participation from people as possible.  The proposal here is to extend the franchise to people with Irish passports, people in Northern Ireland and others living outside the State.  The nation extends beyond the country&rsquo;s boundaries; there are many who feel an intangible link that makes them feel Irish, no more so than when they are abroad and their identity is more challenged by contrast with other cultures.  We stand very proudly over our culture.  As a democracy, we should draw circles of inclusiveness.  It is a healthy development in recent years that there has been more reaching out to our diaspora, and not just for economic reasons.  Those people have the same genetic history as us in general, although I know there are new Irish now.  We can learn from the people of the diaspora and they from us.  We celebrate when they succeed, in politics and business, as, for example, the Kennedys did, and we like to claim Barack Obama, rightly so.  We are very proud. <\/p> <p>I do not agree, however, with extending the franchise to people other than Irish citizens resident in the State.  It would be important to have the diaspora represented here but that could be achieved by Taoiseach&rsquo;s nominees.  There is a simple mechanism already.  I am delighted that Senator Lawless is here and that he contributes.  He can give us the emigrant&rsquo;s perspective.  I know he actively helps the young diaspora.  An exception could be made for people who left in the past five or ten years.  I agree with much of what Senator Paul Daly said.  There is a real connection.  For the most part I subscribe to the view that unless one is paying taxes in this country, one should not have the franchise for national or local elections.  <\/p> <p>I am concerned about the detail of how this would operate.  The Leas-Chathaoirleach mentioned that over 5 million people who have Irish passports could have the franchise.  The proposal for conducting elections through an e-mail to be printed, completed and sent back seems very casual compared with our approach to national elections and with the Seanad election as it operates now, local elections and referenda.  There would be a lot of scope for personation.  It is a fair and proper concern in the conduct of elections, to know that the outcome is a legitimate representation of the votes of people who were entitled to vote.  This proposal cannot be stood over.  What is the rationale for moving people from panel to another when one is oversubscribed?  A person may not have an interest in another panel or may not want to register.  I could run on the education panel but if I cannot get onto it, I would have to get onto another.  There could be an imbalance.  The system is good at the moment.  When I was a councillor, I got five papers and voted for all the panels.  That is the best way to go.  Does voting for the Seanad need to be scrutinised less than for other elections?  The answer has to be \"No\". <\/p> <p>The people spoke when they were asked if they wanted the Seanad to continue.  I was not in favour of abolishing the Seanad.  The people wanted a watchdog, and that was the gist of their message.  It does not need any great legislation or debate in here.  Senator Reilly, the former Minister for Health and for Children and Youth Affairs, spoke on this Bill.  He was one of the few Ministers who allowed legislation commence in the Seanad.  Why is that not happening?  The Government has only five hours in the D&aacute;il to put through legislation.  That begs the question as to why more legislation is not commenced in the Seanad.  Can somebody answer that question?  This is not rocket science.  Why does the Seanad not scrutinise EU legislation?<\/p> <p>This Bill is not reform.  It is reform for more of the same.  It will be unwieldy and the process will be confusing for those who wish to participate.  Dividing the country into regions with one candidate from each will not be very balanced.  All candidates may be from Dublin.  I understand the tenor and intent behind this, but I can see trouble coming down the line.  I see other problems in the legislation that I do not have time to deal with here.  I will do so on the next Stage.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Michelle Mulherin:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2309\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2309&amp;amp;pid=MichelleMulherin&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=12\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->There is a lot of hoo-ha being made about reform.

I compliment Senator McDowell on putting the Bill before us and thank the former Senators, Mr. Manning and Mr. O'Toole, for their immense work in preparing the report of the working group on Seanad reform.<\/p><p>While it is important to recognise that there was a referendum and that the people voted 52% to 48% to retain the Seanad, the fundamental question we should ask is a little like the one a person would hear when watching &quot;Grand Designs&quot; or Mr. Dermot Bannon on &quot;Room to Improve&quot;.  Would we start from here?  The fundamental question I would pose, while not opposing reform, which is needed, is why we are starting with this Bill at this stage when the Taoiseach, after his visit to this House in September, has asked for an implementation group to be put together and on which he has written to the party leaders.  I am not sure whether the Taoiseach has written to Senator McDowell.  At one level, we are ahead of ourselves.<\/p><p>The reason we need reform has been well articulated previously and in the debate today.  It also emanates from the fact that many believe the Seanad is not representative of them because of its elitist electorate, which is a fair observation to make for those in the communities we all live in and who recognise that.  At the same time, however, they fail to make a distinction between our role as Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute; and that of Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;la.  Therein lies part of our difficulty in how we see ourselves and how we are defined under the Constitution.<\/p><p>At the risk of causing a note of discord, perhaps the framers of the Constitution did not necessarily get the role of the Seanad correct at its inception and in how we see ourselves now and how we operate today.  Undoubtedly, the powers and functions of Members of this House can and should be reformed, and they have been in some way over the years, but the fundamental difficulty for many Members in the House rests in the franchise, in terms of the changing of the franchise, who can vote and how they vote.  That will pose a difficulty.  As Senator Conway said, that will pose a challenge on Committee Stage.  To be fair to Senator Lawless, who represents the diaspora as well as being here himself as an authentic, able parliamentarian in his own right, how does one extend that franchise and who does one allow to vote?  As Senator Paddy Burke asked, how does one put that structure in place?<\/p><p>What is important is that we will not be opposing Second Stage, and we all want reform, or at least I want reform.  I will be honest about that.  The Taoiseach, in this House and since the referendum, has been clear on his support for and belief in reform.  He has endorsed the Manning report and its implementation.  That is Government policy and it is in the programme for Government.<\/p><p>It would be remiss of us all, either as part of the implementation group, whoever its members may be, or as Members of this House, not to recognise that there are grave concerns about the Bill before us.  Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill, in his contribution, posed a good question.  When we talk about the political system, we have not seen significant reform of the D&aacute;il.  As a Member of the previous D&aacute;il, I was privileged to be Chair of a committee which parsed, investigated and analysed much legislation, conducted pre-legislative scrutiny and held committee hearings on the protection of life during pregnancy legislation.  We have seen copious volumes of reports on reform of local government, some of which have worked, but what we have seen in local government has been an erosion of the powers given to local authority members, which is not good.  Like Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill, I share the view that local government is the closest form of government to the people, and we need to give more powers back to councillors.<\/p><p>What will reform of this House look like in its final state?  That question is why I would like to move to Committee Stage where we can have a constructive debate on the parts of this Bill, which is fundamentally a good idea but is perhaps flawed at one level, and I do not mean to be critical when I say that.  To be fair to Senator McDowell, we needed someone to take the ball and run with it.  If we had not had that, we would be back to talking about implementation, going back to the 12 other reports on Seanad reform, and we would certainly not have the roadmap from the Manning report and this Bill today.  Mr. John Downing, in a fine piece in the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>, wrote correctly that the shelves are groaning with voluminous reports.  That is why it is important the Bill goes forward to Committee Stage and that we have the implementation group put together by the Taoiseach.  If we are to discuss widening the franchise, what will that mean in real terms?  Who will be here and how will people vote to get representation in the Upper House?<\/p><p>The one part we have not focused on and which I look forward to discussing on Committee Stage or in whatever guise we come back to this issue is the logistics of what reform means in terms of costs, staffing and how we can beef up the House.  Fundamentally, we all demand that we scrutinise legislation and that, as I stated when the Taoiseach was here, we bring this House beyond the gates of this complex to the people.  That means we should be open to doing different things.  I note we have a Seanad consultative committee, chaired by the Leas-Chathaoirleach, which I hope will take up different projects or different aspects of civic life and make positive contributions to them.  Senator James Reilly stated his belief that we will have a serious issue around how we can have representation without residency or taxation, something referred to as well by the Leas-Chathaoirleach.<\/p><p>We are in favour of reform.  Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill spoke about sitting for four days.  I wish him luck with that because I do not think he will get Members to come in for four days when they are already involved in constituency work and are doing other work around legislation.  Senator Humphreys's point about climate change is one we should pursue.<\/p><p>The value of our local authority members is one we should continue to cherish.  They have been treated badly, and I do not say this as a representative of councillors.  We have seen electoral areas increased, their pay reduced and their workload increased.  The abolition of the dual mandate has not done what it was meant to do.  It has not worked for the betterment of people.<\/p><p>This Bill is one we should support moving to the next Stage.  It is important from there on that we put together that roadmap and go back to the plan, the grand design, and see how we can build up the House.  I thank Senator McDowell for his work and commitment.  Only for him, we would not be having this debate today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101200002#Y00200","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1476264600,"counter":157,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.

That is ridiculous in the Houses of the Oireachtas as all Members are equal.  One House is as important as the other.  The budget is for everyone, not just for Deputies.

This should be dealt with on a broader term.  I do not agree with taking the vote away from councillors, as has been suggested.  While there is talk about Seanad and local authority reform, there is never any talk about D&aacute;il reform.  Local authority reform reduced the number of councillors and abolished town councils.  Deputies made that decision and councillors had no say in the matter.  That is not right as councillors work on the ground and deal with constituents every day.  Without them, we would not function as a State.  One cannot just reform the local authorities and the Seanad without doing anything about the D&aacute;il.<\/p> <p>I believe in extending the Seanad franchise to the diaspora and giving it a say.  When I was an emigrant in London for four years in the late 1980s and early 1990s, I always came home to vote.  Apart from the fact my father would have killed me if I did not, I felt passionately about politics back then in my late teens and early 20s.  As every emigrant cannot do that, there must be a way of extending the vote to the diaspora.  It has to be carefully examined, however.  If one looks at the electoral register, it is not perfect by any stretch of the imagination.  If we cannot get the register right for general or local elections, how can we get it right if we extend the vote to the diaspora across the world?  I also do not agree with online voting as this would open the doors to allow people to fiddle with the register.  It was argued that only people who pay tax should get the vote.  That is not necessarily right either but that would be important for the committee to examine.<\/p> <p>For the purposes of Seanad elections, the country should be divided into regions.  I enjoyed and had a great time on the recent Seanad campaign, which one is not supposed to admit.  I saw places I had never seen before from the Inishowen Peninsula all the way down to Cork.  However, as a politician, I might not necessarily be relevant to someone on the Inishowen Peninsula.  The Seanad electoral base should be divided into regions to allow Senators to represent one region, canvass it and get to know its issues.  I agree with most of what Senators Daly and Mulherin said.  I support the Bill's sentiment and acknowledge the work Senator McDowell has put into it.

The Manning committee commissioned a former parliamentary draftsman, Dr. Brian Hunt, to do that.  That is the Bill I am presenting.  While it is nice to hear Members compliment me for all the hard work I put into it, and although I did assist the Manning committee on the broader issues, I cannot claim credit for the actual drafting of the Bill itself.  I pay tribute to those who were part of that process and who put much work into it.<\/p> <p>I am a bit perplexed by the Leader's approach to this and the suggestion made earlier this afternoon that we are putting the cart before the horse.  I do not see that at all.  There are many procedures in this House which can be changed.  This House is the total master of its own procedures.  It is not the total master of the resources necessary to give effect to the changes we make, however.  Under the Constitution, each House of the Oireachtas is totally free to decide and change its own procedures.  There is no significant constraint on us, apart from the question of resources to implement whatever we actually do.<\/p> <p>It must be remembered that there are inside and outside electoral panels for the Seanad.  The Oireachtas Members panel, the inside one, has a designated guaranteed minimum under the present system.  This Bill aims to get rid of that.  Deputies and Senators would not have, and need not have, a guaranteed input into who gets into the Seanad.  Accordingly, if we do change it to bring in a popular franchise of, say, 30 versus 13 in respect of the 43 panels, as suggested by the Manning committee, we can strengthen the rights of councillors by eliminating the right of the D&aacute;il and the Seanad to grab a specified portion of the seats on each panel for themselves.  This would decomplicate the local authority-Oireachtas Members elections in that way.<\/p> <p>Article 9.3 of the Constitution, an often forgotten article, states, \"Fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State are fundamental political duties of all citizens.\"  If one holds an Irish passport, it is an indication of citizenship and one owes a duty of loyalty to the State.  The fact one might belong to a greater diaspora in the numbers mentioned by Senator Lawless and be one of 40 million people does not mean one is a citizen or owes the State a duty of loyalty.  If one does owe the State a duty of loyalty, the very least the State can do is recognise and reciprocate that duty.  Accordingly, wherever one is in the world, if one owes that duty of loyalty to the Irish State, there is no reason the State should not care about what one thinks when we compose our Legislature.<\/p> <p>The issue of taxation and representation is very well made as an argument.

This is not a black and white or binary matter whereby everyone is in one constituency and no existing elements of the third level sector can be somehow protected.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101200002#AA00300","speaker":"1403"},{"type":"speech","time":1476264600,"counter":169,"content":"<p>Senator, I do not know why, but you were only allocated five minutes according to the Order.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101200002#AA00400","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1476264600,"counter":170,"content":"<p>It is a little strange.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101200002#AA00500","speaker":"1403"},{"type":"speech","time":1476264600,"counter":171,"content":"<p>Can we change it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101200002#AA00600","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"speech","time":1476264600,"counter":172,"content":"<p>It is in Standing Orders.

The point is that it is entirely possible to afford people a postal vote and to have a postal system without extensive electoral fraud.

The PRTB, Private Residential Tenancies Board, now has a total of 323,271 tenancies registered, representing 172,121 landlords and 704,332 occupants.  We are introducing this Bill to help Fianna F&aacute;il fulfil a promise made in its manifesto to introduce rent controls.  Under the heading, strengthening tenant rights and implementing rent certainty measures, its An Ireland for All manifesto stated:<\/p><blockquote>Spiralling rent prices are driving families out of their homes, pricing young workers out of cities and alienating potential future investment in the city.  We need to introduce measures to cool down the market and curb excessive rent rises.  Tenants need enhanced security to ensure stability in their home.  We will implement current rent certainty measures.<\/blockquote> <p>As Fianna F&aacute;il included that in its policy which it brought to the people, hopefully, it will support this Bill today.<\/p><p>If it does not support the Bill, then the public is entitled to ask when it will be in a position to support it.  Mar sin, iarraim ar Sheanad&oacute;ir&iacute; Fhianna F&aacute;il a bheith linn inniu agus tac&uacute; a thabhairt don mBille.  Rent certainty should have been in yesterday&rsquo;s Budget Statement.  Every week this Bill is held up, it costs families &euro;1,000 extra a year.  Any support of the amendment, which is a kick-to-touch device, will end up costing families substantially.  Those Members who vote against the Bill will have to explain their actions - more precisely their lack of actions - to the people.<\/p><p>This Bill seeks to link rent increases to the consumer price index.  In simple terms, this means rents should not increase more than the cost of living rises.  There is criticism from some quarters that the consumer price index is not the best indicator with which to measure rent increases.  They quote from the Central Statistics Office that it is not a suitable measure of the rise in the cost of living.  If any Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute; hold this view, I ask them to support the substantive aim of the Bill, allow it to pass to Committee Stage and then propose any amendments and suggest other more suitable indices.<\/p><p>This is not a panacea for the overall housing problem.  Our private rental sector is deeply flawed and will require much legislation to fix, as well as action by all stakeholders to reform it into a sustainable model.  Supply will remain a constant problem as there is a lack of units being built, a large number of tenants in private rental accommodation who should be elsewhere, and a significant number of vacant units.  For example, in Dublin there are over 40,000 vacant units.  These are not social housing units but private properties which have fallen into disrepair with the owner unable to carry out work on the property or sitting tight, refusing to do anything with it.  This situation is not ideal but in a housing crisis, it is lunacy to allow this to continue.<\/p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in welcomes the initial steps announced yesterday to begin a scheme to provide rent payments upfront to renovate these vacant properties for rental.  Rent certainty provides certainty for landlord and tenant alike.  We are now experiencing a continued rise in rents across the State.  Rents were up 3.9% in the last quarter, the largest three-month rise since 2007.  In 2007, there was a massive decline in rents which would also be avoided with the passage of this legislation.  Many of the arguments against rent certainty claim the crisis has not reached such a level that legislation is required.  The question is, when will it be a crisis for Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael?<\/p><p>A recent report by the Simon Community called for exactly what is contained in this Bill to be implemented.  It highlighted how inadequate housing assistance payment, HAP, and rent supplement are when there is a lack of available houses to rent under these schemes.  When available properties were surveyed in Galway city by this report, there was an average of 12 available, a decrease of 21 properties, since the last survey was carried out in May 2016.  Out of these 12 properties, none was within the HAP-rent supplement limits for a single person or a couple.  There was one such property available in May.<\/p><p>In the time since this Bill was voted down in the D&aacute;il, the situation has become worse.  It is not a problem which will be solved with the passage of time.  Accordingly, I do not want to hear any excuses from Fianna F&aacute;il claiming it is too early for such legislation or we should wait for endless reports, consultations and studies before moving on the issue.  Back in February 2016, the Fianna F&aacute;il Seanad leader, Senator Catherine Ardagh, then a councillor, raised this specific issue when she pointed out the then Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, took 10,000 homes out of the private housing market in 2015 alone.  Her statement continued:<\/p><blockquote>To put this into perspective, there were fewer than 10,000 new homes constructed ... The only new homes made available to the market under the Minister&rsquo;s strategy are the paltry 28 new social houses.<\/blockquote> <p>She then decried the issues in the private rental market, saying something needed to be done.<\/p><p>The Government with its Fianna F&aacute;il partners are the experts at kicking to touch.  Water charges were kicked to touch with bin charges suspended for a period.  Legislation for banded hours contracts can be supported in nine months&rsquo; time.  All of this has nothing to do with waiting for the optimal time for these to have effect.  The average rent for a one-bedroom property was 42% more than the rental accommodation scheme-HAP limits for a single person.  Sometimes these figures can hide the reality, which is that a single person would need almost one and half times the payments available to him or her to pay rent for one month.  This is a stark sign that the current system is not sustainable.<\/p><p>One factor which exacerbates this problem is that many of the private rental properties in Galway and other areas with third level institutions are being rented to students.  This is due to the lack of adequate student accommodation.  In many cases the private rental sector is completely unsuitable for students and places pressure on parents.  Many parents have had to take out loans or even use credit cards to provide third level accommodation for their children.  The building of social housing is necessary, not only in terms of investment in our future, but in playing a direct role in easing the crisis in the private rental sector.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2363\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2363&amp;amp;pid=TrevorOClochartaigh&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=12\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Social housing tenants are in private rental properties and this is one of the causes of the market being flooded.  If there was adequate social housing, just as if there was adequate student housing, it would free up thousands of private rental properties.<\/p><p>Yesterday's budgetary housing measures were nothing more than a sop to the construction industry.  Since the first-time buyer scheme was mooted several months ago, house prices across the State have risen by 2.9%.  It is not difficult to discern a pattern whereby developers simply factor in the cost of any scheme into the overall cost.<\/p><p>Our Bill is common sense.  It is common sense to provide certainty to all parties in the market.  Where the Government failed to use the budget to positively impact the thousands of households who rent from month to month, uncertain of their future, Sinn F&eacute;in has put forward a positive proposal.  I am constantly hearing the question from our opposition and from colleagues in Fianna F&aacute;il about where our positive proposals are.  Here is a positive proposal that we are asking the House to support.<\/p><p>The Committee on Housing and Homelessness as well as many other charities and NGOs have called for precisely this measure on many occasions.  Accepting this Bill would let them know that they are finally being listened to.

Organisations throughout the country are doing great work to support people who are in difficult situations of homelessness.  Many of them cite issues in the private rental sector as having an impact on other issues.  It is stark to read the annual report of COPE Galway, an organisation that does fantastic work to help people.  The annual report from 2015 states that the organisation worked with 659 households, and that 369 children were affected by homelessness in Galway.  The figures include 166 families, 493 single people and seven couples.  Those involved tell us the most significant issue is a lack of housing.  The impacts of this on the COPE Galway domestic violence services are severe.  In 2015 the organisation worked with 380 women and their 180 children who were experiencing domestic violence.  COPE Galway provided 780 outreach appointments, 205 court accompaniments and answered 1,100 crisis calls.  However, the organisation was unable to accommodate 288 women and 405 children who requested refuge due to a lack of space.  This I believe this part of the knock-on effect of the issues in the private rental sector.  COPE Galway also does wonderful work with older people and provides older people's services.<\/p><p>There is a section in the COPE Galway annual report relating to the increasing incidence of family homelessness.  There may have been a belief up to some years ago that homelessness only affected people who were down and out.  COPE Galway tells us that a total of 56 families, comprising 36 lone-parent families as well as 20 non-lone-parent families, including 133 children, were provided with emergency accommodation in 2015.  This represented a 107% increase on the previous year, when 27 families, all lone-parent families, including 55 children, were provided with emergency accommodation.  COPE Galway has said that the loss of private rented housing was the reason these families became homeless, with most experiencing homelessness for the first time.  Many first came into contact with COPE Galway homeless services at the point they had been issued with a notice to quit by their landlord.  The planned sale of the property was most often the stated reason.  Anecdotally, we know that the notice-to-quit methodology being used by many landlords is actually simply a mechanism to increase rents.  That is another reason I am putting forward the case that we need to introduce rent certainty.<\/p><p>I am disappointed that the Government has put forward an amendment.  I call on the Government Members to retract the amendment at this stage.  I appeal to colleagues across the House to do the right thing on rent certainty.  It is actually the right thing for the landlords and tenants.  It gives far more certainty.  It is a simple act.  I hope Members will support the Sinn F&eacute;in Bill.  T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go dtac&oacute;idh Fianna F&aacute;il ach go h&aacute;irithe linn mar t&aacute; polasa&iacute; Fhianna F&aacute;il chomh maith leis an polasa&iacute; seo againne.

I am keen to discuss it in terms of the context of the politics we have.  I was struck by a phrase in the D&aacute;il yesterday echoed by both Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael Deputies.  The phrase was that the centre must hold.  This has been the subject of considerable comment through the course of the past 24 hours.  It got me thinking.  What do we mean when we talk about the centre?  What do we mean by the centre of politics?  I take it to mean reasonable moderate inclusive politics.  It strikes me that there was little of any of that in yesterday's budget.  The budget has been described by Peter McVerry as a landlord's charter.  I imagine everyone in the Chamber would respect the views of a man such as Fr. Peter McVerry.  When it comes to housing and homelessness he is recognised as an expert.<\/p><p>There is something rather strange about this State.  Let us consider how rents and housing are organised throughout most of mainstream western Europe.  We find that having rules for rents is the norm, as is having rules around rent certainty.  Having rental properties that are not subject to the extremes of boom and bust is the norm.  The reason for this is because it is a regulated sector in these countries.  The political consensus in the centre has it that this is something we do to protect people.  It is strange that this consensus of the centre has never existed in this State.  It is strange that parties which claim to be of the centre have always, regrettably, taken the side of the landlords in this State.  It is a poor reflection on parties that claim to be of the centre.  Whenever anything is challenged in terms of the status of landowners, they always fall by the wayside and allow the <i>status quo<\/i>to continue.  Why should we not have rent certainty?  Why are the people of this country not entitled to rent certainty?  Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael claim to be parties of the centre, but when it comes to crunch issues like challenging the <i>status quo<\/i>in respect of property, they constantly disappear or sneak away.  Why is that?<\/p><p>Having read the Government amendment to today's Bill, there are no surprises for me.  Basically, those on the Government side are suggesting that we kick the can down the road and not deal with this today, but that we might look at it again in a few months' time.  That seems to be the over-riding mantra of this Government in respect of any issue of substance.  The view is that we should not deal with it today or take a decision that would be in the interests of all the people, because that might hurt some of the people they like to protect.  It is no coincidence that the people who produced the budget yesterday with absolutely no measures to redistribute wealth from those who have it to those who have not are the same people who are going to sit in the Chamber today and essentially make the case that it is a nice idea and they like it - in fact, in the case of Fianna F&aacute;il it is in the party manifesto - but they have no wish to deal with it now.  I appeal in particular to our colleagues in Fianna F&aacute;il.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Paul Gavan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2469\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2469&amp;amp;pid=PaulGavan&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=12\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I recognise that some good points have been made in relation to housing, particularly by Senator Murnane O'Connor in recent months.  I appeal to Fianna F&aacute;il to take a second look at this Bill and think of the people in their own areas, those who have had rent hikes of &euro;300 and &euro;400 a time, those who are crying out for some kind of decent regulation and find that Government after Government has turned a blind eye to it.  I ask them to think about it.  To be clear, if they do not support this moderate reasonable Bill today, the message will go out that Fianna F&aacute;il has once again rejected rent certainty and I would have to believe that at least some Members on the Fianna F&aacute;il side cannot be comfortable with that notion.  We had a wonderful moment last week in the D&aacute;il where we got behind a Bill that had all the right sentiments regarding the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA.  In fairness, we saw the Fianna F&aacute;il Party listen on that occasion, it abstained and we managed to send a strong message in relation to CETA.  I am asking our colleagues in Fianna F&aacute;il to look again today in relation to rent certainty.  It is an issue that affects hundreds of thousands of people in our State.  We know, because the facts are out there, that rent hikes have been absolutely outrageous.<\/p><p>It is not only a Dublin issue.  We know that rents in Dublin are astronomical, but where I live, in Limerick, colleagues of mine are facing rent hikes of &euro;300 and &euro;400 when their review comes up.  The bottom line is this.  We can either do something about it - this is what this Bill is designed to do - or we can blow hot air and say, \"If only\", or \"We agree with you but\", and effectively do nothing.  I would ask a simple question.  Is that the best that our people deserve?  Is that the best that this Chamber can do?  Last week we showed that we can do better than that.  This week, I believe, with genuine goodwill on all sides, we should be able to do better than that.  If they cannot do better than that, then the message will go out loud and clear that Fianna F&aacute;il has backed the Government in refusing rent certainty.  On the back of a day yesterday when, unfortunately, Fianna F&aacute;il was at one with Fine Gael, it will do Fianna F&aacute;il no good to find itself in the same corner again.<\/p><p>As I say, I am aware there are genuine concerns on the Fianna F&aacute;il benches in relation to this issue.  They should have the courage to stand up and do what is right, not for us - I would not expect that - but for those in rented accommodation.  We can talk about it, we can ramble on about it or we can take this opportunity here in this Chamber to do something.  We can make the Seanad relevant again, as it was last week.  We have choices, let us make the right decisions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101200002#KK00200","speaker":"1389","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1476264600,"counter":202,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Gavan.

I recognise it is an effort to improve the circumstances around the entire rental sector in this country in terms of sustaining tenancies.  However, if we analyse it and break it down in terms of what it would mean if it was implemented in the morning, we must look at the possible consequences of enacting such legislation.<\/p><p>We all are agreed there is no silver bullet to resolve what is a housing crisis in this country at present.  It is a crisis for many reasons but, essentially, it is about the lack of supply.  The fundamental underlying reason is we do not have enough houses to meet the current demand.  That is as a result of a legacy of, as some Senators have said, a boom-bust cycle but it also means that we currently have a dysfunctional property and construction sector and we have a dysfunctional rental sector.  Until we address those underlying issues of supply, unfortunately, we will not see the full resolution that we all aspire to.<\/p><p>The Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government<b><\/b>has already displayed that this is the highest priority for Government in terms of providing adequate housing to meet our citizens' needs.  That is displayed, not only in words but in terms of funding, in terms of policy interventions, in terms of legislation and many more interventions the Minister will outline later.  It all goes back to supply, and that has to be addressed if the challenges of this country are to be met in regards to increasing supply for private purchases, increasing supply for local authorities, and, indeed, the approved housing bodies in the voluntary sector, and increasing supply for the rental sector.  The recent Government action plan for housing and homelessness is a proactive tangible response to meet all of those needs that are outlined under five pillars - addressing homelessness, accelerating social housing, building more homes, improving the rental sector and utilising existing housing stock.  I believe if behoves all of us because it has become such a crisis of proportion that it is beyond politics in my eyes.  I believe the Minister and the Government should be supported in trying to implement this Rebuilding Ireland plan.<\/p><p>We will need not only the policy makers to support the plan.  We are depending also on the local authorities, including members and officials.  We are depending on the voluntary sector and the approved housing bodies to help us achieve the challenging objectives and targets that have been set.  We are also depending on the construction sector that, I suppose, has been the sector hit most in the economic recession over the past number of years.  Everybody can see the legacy that happened in the construction sector.<\/p><p>By extension, the rental sector is also affected because the supply numbers are simply not there for a normal functioning rental market.  That is why Government has proposed an amendment to the Sinn F&eacute;in Second Stage motion on the Rent Certainty (No. 2) Bill 2016.  We believe the Bill is premature for the reasons outlined but we also firmly believe that we need to be careful with regard to policy interventions that could provide disincentives to landlords or drive more of them out of the market at this critical time.<\/p><p>The proposal is to link the rent to the consumer price index, CPI.  There is a significant risk - that has been stood up by independent reports - that CPI-linked rents would, in fact, discourage new investors from entering the market and that is something we simply cannot afford at present.  Recent statistics show that new registrations of tenancies in 2013 stood at 114,000 and in 2015 there has been a dip to 105,000 registrations.  That clearly shows that there is a supply challenge in the entire rental sector and to make policy interventions such as proposed without thinking through their consequences could have a severe impact.  The proposal might be well meaning but it could, in fact, have a negative impact in terms of the availability of properties for rent if it is not sustainable.  I do not hold a candle to landlords and if one looks at the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2015, one will see a number of interventions were made that the landlord sector opposed and were not happy with.  Those were positive interventions to try to sustain tenancies in this critical period until we get the construction sector back to a functioning normal mode and until we increase the supply of housing.<\/p><p>While it is well meaning, we need to be careful and cautious as regards this Bill.  If the Bill had even some type of sunset clause over a period of two or three years, it might have allayed some fears, but the figures show that landlords, many of whom are accidental landlords, are getting out of the market and properties are being sold, which means they are not available for rental any longer.  That is a problem that we need to be acutely aware of in any interventions we make.<\/p><p>Going back to the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2015, it is fair to say that Government made interventions at that time that were to try to sustain tenancies in rental accommodation, such as to increase the minimum period between rent reviews from 12 months to 24 months.  That is to operate for a period of four years - this critical period until we get the construction sector repaired and the supply side up.  Another measure was the minimum period of notice for a new rent increased from 28 days to 90 days, and that was to help in terms of sustainability.  Landlords, as the House will be aware, are precluded from increasing rent above the market rate.  If there is evidence where landlords are increasing above and beyond that, then tenants have recourse to appeal to the Private Residential Tenancies Board, PRTB, which will adjudicate on such matters and rents will remain at the current level until that adjudication happens.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Paudie Coffey:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2237\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2237&amp;amp;pid=PaudieCoffey&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=12\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is important to note that there are many supports available.  It is recognised that there are still challenges but this is why, across parties, we need to support the Minister and the Government in terms of driving delivery of housing units across all sectors.  The Government is committing over &euro;5.3 billion to deliver over 47,000 units by 2021.  This is ambitious and challenging but it is not something we cannot achieve if we align all of our forces at local, regional and national level in terms of policy-makers and the construction and rental sectors.  As stated earlier, we have a lot of accidental landlords who, due to legacies of times past, are under huge debt pressures and must sustain their properties and recoup a sustainable income in terms of rent.  If we are going to limit that, we could drive them out of the sector.<\/p><p>I know the Government and the Minister want to see more long-term lettings and more long-term sustainability with regard to rents.  The budget measures will certainly help.  I know sometimes they do not go as far as many would like but the help-to-buy scheme for first-time buyers will assist in increasing levels of supply because it is an incentive for such buyers to purchase new units rather than existing ones.  There is also tax relief for landlords to try to keep them in the market so that they will not exit in circumstances where there are fewer properties available to rent.  The increase in the rent-a-room income ceiling to &euro;14,000 is another measure that can certainly help alleviate some of the pressures.  In many of the pressure areas in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and other places, people have spare capacity in their houses and this might incentivise them to let surplus rooms to people in need or students who require accommodation.  The HAP scheme, in respect of which &euro;105 million is being allocated, has proven successful in areas where it is up and running.  I know there were issues around ceilings and the scheme not being available in all local authority areas but much progress has been made with it.  I can say without contradiction that we would be in a far worse situation in terms of the housing crisis were it not for the HAP scheme, which has met the needs of many thousands of people throughout the country.<\/p><p>I wish the Minister well with the Rebuilding Ireland programme.  I fully support it and believe it is a tangible strategy that sets out a vision with funding behind it.  If we can get behind the programme and address the issues on the supply side, we will, in turn, resolve many of difficulties relating to the rental sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101200002#LL00300","speaker":"1422","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1476264600,"counter":205,"content":"<p>Fianna F&aacute;il will not be supporting the Bill.  The introduction of this highly-flawed legislation undermines attempts to provide real solutions to the housing crisis.  As a party, we are on record in calling for stronger rent certainty measures and did so long before Sinn F&eacute;in.  However, our measures were well thought out.  Fianna F&aacute;il published a policy document, Generation Rent - A new deal for Renters and Landlords, which aimed to stabilise rents immediately by restricting rents to an area-based rental index both within and between tenancies.  This is similar to the model in operation in many\u00a0German cities.  This proposal would be for a maximum of three years pending annual reviews of the effects of the regulation of market supply.<\/p> <p>By contrast, Sinn F&eacute;in's introduction of this half-page Bill, which attempts to make highly-flawed changes to a hugely complex area, represents political posturing of the most careless and irresponsible kind.  The Bill is extremely defective.  First, if passed, there is a strong likelihood that it would lead to short-term spikes in rents as well as an increase in tenancy turnover.  This is what happened for two months prior to the introduction of the former Minister's rent regulations in January 2016.  Second, while watered down, the recently introduced rent certainty measures have only just taken effect and it would be highly irresponsible to introduce new regulations, which would lead to more disruption and upheaval in the market, prior to reviewing the effects of the current rent certainty measures.  Third, the Sinn F&eacute;in proposal to link rent increases and decreases to a measure of inflation through the consumer price index, CPI, is flawed.  A\u00a0report in 2014 commissioned by the PRTB found that had market rents been linked to the CPI during the period from 2000 to 2014, rents would be far higher than they are at present.<\/p> <p>I look forward to the publication of the report on rent certainty and affordability, which is being prepared by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and which is due before Christmas, because I think it will play a crucial role with regard to rents.  The measures in the Bill before the House, the main provision of which aims to link rent increases or decreases to the CPI's inflation index, are highly defective.  The new rent certainty measures only commenced in January 2016.  At the very least, they should be given some time to bed down.  Their effect on rent levels, units and supply will be reviewed prior to the introduction of the new regulations.<\/p> <p>While it is currently illegal for landlords to end tenants' leases mid-contract, they can end existing tenancies if they want to sell their properties or if they want family members to use them.  This is a problem because a landlord can end a tenancy any time he or she wants.  This issue needs to be examined.<\/p> <p>The continued shortfall in supply and increasing demand has put significant upward pressure on rents.  Rental market increases are, in the main, a result of the legacy of under-supply in recent years.  It is estimated that just 9,000 housing units were completed in 2014 compared with an estimated requirement of 25,000.  The number of units completed in 2011 and 2013 was even fewer.  The false notion that vacant homes and ghost estates somewhere in the midlands are a substitute for vacant homes where they are actually needed still lingers.  We are still not building houses - even in the midlands.  All this needs to be addressed.  Far from keeping rents down, freezing rents in the manner proposed could encourage landlords to raise rents up sharply at the beginning and the end of tenancies, which would create a problem.  Restricting prices to below market levels will only make supply even scarcer.<\/p> <p>Fianna F&aacute;il's proposal will encourage long-term leasing to give tenants greater security in their occupancies and allow families to consider renting as a long-term option.  These changes will also alter the balance of power in favour of tenants, who would still be able to terminate their contracts after their probationary period with one month's notice.  It is crucial that this is addressed.  This proposal would be far more effective in stabilising rents than the measure proposed by Sinn F&eacute;in and would inflict less damage on the rental market.<\/p> <p>The private rental sector faces a crisis in terms of supply and security.  This has driven up costs and undermined the sector.  Action is urgently required.  Combining it with boosting supply is key.  We will introduce a series of measures to provide security for renters.  We also propose to introduce a family tenant lease to facilitate long-term renting above the current four-year cycle, to improve the quality of accommodation by means of a new certification scheme - to be operated by local authorities and approved by the PRTB - in order to improve tenants' rights and to review the current rent certainty scheme in the coming years<\/p> <p>I will not support the Bill before the House.  As the Minister is aware, I am a member of the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government.  I know he has a plan to build 47,000 houses.  It is crucial that this plan be implemented as soon as possible so that those on local authority housing lists can be housed and others can qualify for inclusion on the housing list.  The cap is a massive issue for me.  In my local authority area, the cap is &euro;27,500.  My biggest problem is that most people do not qualify for the local authority housing list, which is causing another form of homelessness.  Renting is crucial.  The HAP scheme needs to be addressed.  We must also ensure that rents units in the midlands or elsewhere assist people who do not qualify for the local authority housing list because, as the Minister is aware, the new HAP scheme only applies to people on the housing list.  There are other people who fall through the cracks because they do not qualify for inclusion on the housing list but they need rent allowance.  I ask the Minister to ensure this is also kept in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101200002#MM00200","speaker":"1395"},{"type":"speech","time":1476264600,"counter":206,"content":"<p>I want to say a few things about the principle behind this Bill.

Would the introduction of this Bill bring us to a stage where more money was available to create a viable thriving and competitive rental sector or would this Bill drive away investment in rented accommodation?  The answer is fairly obvious.  The long-term effect, even the medium-term and, for reasons that have been mentioned in speeches just now, the short-term effects would be counterproductive.  This Bill would not achieve what Sinn F&eacute;in hopes for in proposing it.  It would in fact drive money out of the provision of rental accommodation, make people unwilling to enter into that market and tend to drive rents up if people had an opportunity to increase them.  This would be because they would know that if this was the law for the long term, they would have to provide for future changes in housing market prices to cushion themselves against being landlords of properties which were let at an amount far below the market rate for rents in the area.  This is a misguided Bill.<\/p><p>We forget that whenever one comes into a malfunctioning market such as exists now and which is exploiting tenants and one decides to operate with a legislative scalpel on that market, a few hard questions have to be asked.  Two or three years ago a friend was thinking of buying property in Dublin and thought I was a good person to look at houses with him from an architectural point of view and to judge their soundness as someone who was interested in it.  I went to quite a few properties in relatively well-to-do parts of Rathmines, Ranelagh and all those kind of places, which seemed at that stage to be going for attractive prices.  As I walked around, I realised going from one room to another these were bedsits which had been cleared out.  I could see the traces of the cookers and whatever else, and the fairly downmarket adaptations of these rooms for bedsit letting.  I became more and more depressed at the thought that somebody in Dublin City Council, I think, had decided that bedsit accommodation was to be outlawed and made it unlawful to continue to rent out accommodation in which kitchen or bathroom accommodation was shared or where the apartment was not fully self-contained.  I do not know how many separate dwellings were ruled to be illegal in this city but I think it was of the order of 10,000.  These were, generally speaking, for people who were not well to do, often single, many of them elderly and this was the best they could afford.<\/p><p>Did whoever it was on the quays who decided at the stroke of a pen to improve housing standards in the city of Dublin think for one minute about the social and market consequences of scrapping that accommodation without working out whether there was a functioning rental market to which the people who were going to be evicted could have resort?  It struck me that they did not, although it was well intentioned.  Everybody would like to have a top quality rented sector available, but this person did not ask what would happen to the woman or man in her or his 50s who had been in this place for 15, 20 or 30 years when the new law came into effect.  Does Sinn F&eacute;in really believe this will increase the provision of decent rental accommodation or drive people out of that market?  I believe this Bill would have that effect.<\/p><p>One of the consequences of the decision on bedsits is that people now share houses, including the bathroom.  They do not have a separate letting of each room, except by internal arrangements among themselves.  They may not even have fully functional Yale locks on their doors, but their position is similar in many respects to the bedsit arrangement that was declared unlawful.  It is the same thing by another name.  The consequence was that between 8,000 and 12,000 people were put out of their homes because somebody thought to improve the quality of rental accommodation in Dublin at the stroke of a bureaucratic pen.  I should declare an interest here because I have let a property in the past.<\/p><p>This Bill is well intentioned.  It is designed to stop people being ripped off in a rising market where there is low supply, but it will not in the long term increase the supply.  It is contradictory to its aim to bring fairness to people who are vulnerable and need to be protected.<\/p><p>We need to accelerate the investment in providing rental accommodation and to take steps which even the Minister&rsquo;s strategy may not have thought of.  I think sometimes that Dublin City Council should operate on a \"use it or lose it\" basis in respect of land in the city which has a high value but is being left derelict for this or that reason and do what the Wide Streets Commissioners did 200 years ago, which is to acquire it and give it to somebody on a building lease and say rental accommodation should be built now.  We need dynamism in the provision of rental accommodation.  Every day coming in here I pass Charlemont Street, where Dublin City Council is rebuilding the Tom Kelly flats complex.  It was sad to see that a large portion of the site was lying empty for approximately two years while Dublin City Council, which owned the property, got its act together.  Local authorities are not the most dynamic.  They are slow at turning projects around.  There should be methods to encourage other people into developing available space.  There is nothing unconstitutional about having a use it or lose it provision for unused property which has the potential for residential use and give people whatever value the site has.  It should be handed over to somebody who will provide rental accommodation.  I hope the Sinn F&eacute;in Members do not think I am being unduly negative but I believe this is a recipe for worsening the situation rather than improving it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101200002#MM00300","speaker":"1403","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1476264600,"counter":208,"content":"<p>I am delighted to support this Bill.

The Simon Communities' report \"Locked Out Of The Market V: The Gap between Rent Supplement\/HAP Limits and Market Rents\", published last week, showed that in the year to the second quarter of 2016, rents increased by 18.2% in Cork city; 10% in Dublin city centre; 14.6% in Louth; 13.9% in Galway city; 12.5% in County Kildare; 7.5% in County Leitrim; 15.5% in Limerick city; 12% in Laois; and 3.8% in Sligo.  From this, we can conclude that rising rents are a problem for people nationwide, and it needs the national response which the Bill encompasses.  The housing rental market needs new rules.

The Labour Party will support the Bill, although it is very limited in its scope.  We recently published our own Bill, the Social and Affordable Housing Bill 2016, which goes far beyond what is in the Bill we are discussing.  However, the provisions of the Bill are encompassed in our Bill, and we will support it.<\/p> <p>Our Bill, published by Deputy Willie Penrose, seeks to amend the Residential Tenancies Act 2004.  It provides a proper definition of \"landlord\" and prohibits landlords from refusing to allow tenants to stay beyond the sale period of a house.  It also provides that the Private Residential Tenancies Board, PRTB, would be the agency that provides rental guidelines based on the consumer price index, CPI, and geographical guidelines across the country.  It also provides that rents would be reviewed on a 12-monthly basis and that rent issues would be dealt with by the PRTB.  It would prevent vacant tenancy as a result of the sale of a house which, as mentioned by Senator Kelleher, is commonplace across Europe.  We are one of the few European countries in which the mention of a sale by a landlord can result in a vacant tenancy.<\/p> <p>Our Bill also seeks to change the role and scope of NAMA and change its name, on a transition day, to the national housing development and finance agency.  NAMA, which has done a very good job, except on one or two matters, would have a new focus.  The focus in our Bill for NAMA would be to address the shortage in supply of houses for sale and for rent and to ensure a stable and functioning accommodation market.  Our Bill also proposes to change tax laws to assist landlords who cannot write off interest on money borrowed for the development and upgrade of housing against their profits.  They should be allowed to do it.  As previous speakers said, unless we have people prepared to invest in the market, we do not have a market and we have a narrowing of the base of houses.<\/p> <p>Our Bill also seeks to reduce the VAT rate applied to materials from 13.5% to 9% to allow for materials for the provision, construction, renovation and alteration of houses to be assessed and charged at 9%.  We also want to bring forward a vacant site levy to amend the Urban Regeneration and Housing Act 2015 to bring forward the levy to 2017.  This would further encourage the use of vacant land which, as has been said, is lying idle while thousands of people wait on housing lists.<\/p> <p>The Kenny report of 1973, which has lain on the shelves since then, is adopted in our Bill, with one or two modifications.  The issue is constantly being debated as being unconstitutional.  In 2004, an all-party Oireachtas committee examined the Kenny report and deemed it constitutionally sound.  The vacant land across the country would be compulsorily purchased at 125% of its market value.  Vendors would receive 25% on top of the market value.  This would free much of the land and would put a fire under those who are sitting on land across the country to sell it.  While the Bill may have difficulties, they are not insurmountable.  It needs the will of all parties in the House to support it and start the process of linking rents to the CPI.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101200002#OO00800","speaker":"1387"},{"type":"speech","time":1476264600,"counter":217,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101200002#OO00900","speaker":"1389"},{"type":"speech","time":1476264600,"counter":218,"content":"<p>I would like the Minister to address the regulation of Airbnb.

The Senator can have it.  I might go off-script at times; I have a reputation for doing that.<\/p><p>As I said, there are acute pressures in the rental market and I outlined some of those.  Those stresses are borne out by the latest data from the Private Residential Tenancies Board, PRTB.  The PRTB index for the second quarter of this year shows that private rents rose by almost 10% across the country compared with the same period last year.  In Dublin, rents are now 3.9% higher than their previous peak in 2007.  Rents are also increasing outside Dublin, although they remain at about 11.2% off their peak levels.  Those numbers are broadly in line with the trends reported in the recent <i>daft.ie<\/i>report for the same period.  There is no question that the increases are placing huge pressures on tenants, particularly those who are seeking to access new accommodation and, in particular, on many people who are simply being priced out of the market, as has been pointed out, or put at serious risk of homelessness.<\/p><p>The core issue behind almost all of the pressures throughout the housing market is lack of supply.  For the rental sector, the best way to reduce and stabilise rents in the long term, and benefit the entire sector, is to increase supply and accelerate delivery of housing for the private and social rented sectors.<\/p><p>Rebuilding Ireland - an Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness aims to increase and accelerate housing delivery across all tenures to help individuals and families meet their housing needs.  It sets out over 80 actions the Government is taking through new policy, new legislation and innovative measures in the budget to achieve that aim.<\/p><p>A strong and viable private rental sector can play an important role in the housing market and our wider economy.  It can provide a housing option to those who either cannot or choose not to enter the owner-occupied market but still have sufficient means to meet their own accommodation needs.  It can provide a housing option to meet rising demand and promote flexibility and better alignment to a more mobile labour market, making it easier for individuals and families to pursue job opportunities or adapt their accommodation to changing family circumstances.<\/p><p>It can also reduce the macroeconomic risk of an over reliance on home ownership.  We have seen examples over the past decade where states with relatively large private rented sectors, such as Germany and Switzerland, have been better insulated against housing booms than states with small rental sectors like Ireland and Spain.  The rental sector in Ireland has traditionally been regarded as a residual sector in which households who would prefer either to own their own home privately or access permanent social housing must serve time in on their way to their true tenure of choice.<\/p><p>The rental sector in Ireland has doubled in size over the past two decades.  Almost one fifth of the population now live in the rental sector.  Growth in the sector has been driven by a range of factors including a reducing reliance on home ownership as a tenure of choice, as well as demographic factors including inward migration from the European Union, decreasing household size, and increasing rates of new household formation.  Notwithstanding that, the rental sector here needs to develop and mature in order to provide a viable, sustainable and attractive alternative to home ownership rather than serving as a temporary refuge or a staging post on the route to home ownership.<\/p><p>Severe supply pressures, rising rents, security of tenure issues, limited, but nonetheless unacceptable, examples of poor accommodation standards, and a shortage of professional institutional landlords are impediments to delivering on a strong, stable and modern rental sector that offers real choice for individuals and households while contributing to economic development.<\/p><p>With regard to rent levels, important amendments to the Residential Tenancies Act introduced last year mean that the minimum period between rent reviews for tenancies has increased from 12 to 24 months.  This will apply for a four year period until 2019.  In addition, the minimum period of notice of new rent is increased from 28 days to 90 days, and longer notice periods for the termination of long-term tenancies have been introduced also.  These changes are important, but clearly there is need to do more.<\/p><p>While I appreciate the motivation behind the Sinn F&eacute;in Bill, I strongly believe that the proposal to tie rents strictly to the consumer price index may well exacerbate the problem we are currently facing.  It may force some existing supply to exit the market and discourage future supply for the sector.  The experience in jurisdictions where strict and blunt controls such as that proposed have been introduced is generally not a happy one.  Rent control has been shown to negatively impact on supply, make tenants even more vulnerable, and create strong black market distortions and inefficiencies that can emerge from time to time.<\/p><p>I see rent predictability, as part of a stable rental sector underpinned by a sustainable investment environment, being of benefit to both tenants and landlords.  That is why the Rebuilding Ireland document commits to developing a real and meaningful strategy for the rental sector, with a major focus on supply but also including new mechanisms for both setting and reviewing rents.  We plan to have that done by the end of the year.  We will start our consultation towards the end of next week and would be interested in anything people have to say in a constructive manner.<\/p><p>In advance of the publication of the strategy before the bend of this year, I am advancing other legislative changes.  In case people think we are not acting in this area, we are by taking some early actions to which we are already committed.  They are in the Rebuilding Ireland document, and they have already gone before Cabinet in terms of legislative approval.  We are advancing their early introduction in the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016, which I will shortly introduce to this House.  This Bill will introduce new measures to ensure tenants remain <i>in situ<\/i>where a landlord proposes to sell more than 20 units in a single development.  It is being referred to as the Tyrrelstown amendment, and it will provide for enhanced enforcement and dispute resolution powers also for the RTB.  We are saying that when one institutional investor sells a development to another, the tenancies in that development will not be affected through that sale.  We need much more consideration on whether we will do something similar for much smaller developments or individual houses or apartments that may be owned by landlords that only have one or two properties.  We will consider that and examine it in detail.<\/p><p>In terms of increasing supply, the Bill will introduce temporary fast-track planning arrangements for large-scale housing developments and streamline the existing process for local authority developments and developments by approved housing bodies, and support a very significant increase in the supply of dedicated on-campus student accommodation, free\u00ecng up thousands of units in the wider rented sector currently occupied by students.  There are approximately 25,000 students in the private rental sector, and many of them have four or five students per house.  We are not saying that will free up 25,000 houses, but it will certainly free up about one third of that number.  There are approximately 10,000 new student accommodation units in the pipeline, either in preparation for planning, in planning or with planning and about to start construction.<\/p><p>Yesterday&rsquo;s budget contained more measures designed to encourage a strong supply response in the rental sector.  For example, the Government has announced the restoration of 100% interest relief for residential landlords on a phased basis, 5% at a time, moving from 75% to 80% next year and continuing on to 100% over the next five years.  We are also extending the Living City initiative to include rental accommodation, and we are removing the existing square footage cap.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Simon Coveney:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=250\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=250&amp;amp;pid=SimonCoveney&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=12\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->In other words, we are trying to encourage investment in derelict property, primarily in city and town centres, so people can invest in it and make it ready to be rented.  That makes much sense.  We are increasing the ceiling of the rent-a-room scheme from &euro;12,000 to &euro;14,000.  In other words, we want to attract people financially to rent a room in their homes to students if it suits them to do that.  By moving the level from &euro;12,000 to &euro;14,000 of tax-free income, there is a really strong sweetener in doing that.  It will also have an impact on supply.<\/p><p>I am determined that the strategy will provide a vision of the role that the rental sector will play in the short, medium and long term in the context of the Government's objectives for a housing sector overall as set out in Rebuilding Ireland.  It will contain a range of actions focused on the four key areas of security, supply, standards and services.  In terms of security, we will look at bringing greater tenure and rent certainty to landlords and tenants, and in terms of supply we will examine how to maintain existing levels of stock while encouraging investment in additional supply, including through affordable rental.  We will launch the detail of that scheme in the coming weeks.  In addition, measures on standards will continue to improve the quality and management of rental accommodation, while actions on services will broaden and strengthen the role and powers of the Residential Tenancies Board to more effectively provide services and empower tenants and landlords.  In other words, if there are disputes between tenants and landlords, we need earlier outcomes to solve them.<\/p><p>We have more to do to allow this area to evolve into a mature, stable sector in which there is a true balance between the rights and responsibilities of landlords and tenants.  Supply of new rental accommodation at affordable levels is key to this balance.  The strategy for the rented sector, which will be in place by the end of the year, will lay out measures to address immediate issues affecting the supply, cost and accessibility of rental accommodation.<\/p><p>I agree with the speakers who have said they will oppose this motion.  It is well intentioned, and I do not mean that in any kind of patronising way.  There is a problem for many people because of the pressures they are under arising from rent inflation.  An effort to solve that using the blunt tool of simply putting in rent caps without anything else would have a very significant and potentially very negative impact on supply in the medium term.  Ultimately, we need to see dramatic investment in that area.  I look forward to working with everybody in this House in the context of the housing legislation we will introduce in the next few weeks, I hope, and Members will be able to see some of the measures we are introducing right now.  I hope to get engagement in the broader consultation that we will facilitate in the next few weeks in the context of trying to put a balanced rental strategy in place that can deal with a multitude of different pressures, ensure that supply continues and that predictability around the management of rents also improves from a tenant and landlord perspective.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101200002#PP00600","speaker":"1286","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1476264600,"counter":227,"content":"<p>There are people all over the city and in other parts of the State this evening getting ready to join queues outside properties in an attempt to try to put a roof over their heads.

The rental market in Dublin and other cities in Ireland is in absolute chaos.  The chronic shortage of rental properties is unsustainable and something must give.  The shortage is getting worse by the month.  As of August this year, just over 3,500 properties were available for rent across the State, which is 1,000 fewer than in August last year.

Rent certainty is not rent control.  Rent certainty provides protection for both tenants and landlords.  The only way to deal with rapidly rising rents is through legislative change.  If we attempt an economic solution to an economic problem, there will be only one outcome.  That is the outcome we have witnessed in the past few years because we have refused to act.  The market will only fix itself one way in times of lack of supply.<\/p> <p>This Government had a big opportunity yesterday to try to fix this problem but Ireland's 720,000 renters were forgotten about.  The first-time buyers grant, it is widely acknowledged, will purely increase prices for new builds, and it is a slap in the face for these renters, who will never be able to consider buying with the current rental levels.  The Fine Gael amendment is further proof that this Government is just kicking its heels on rent certainty, as it is with so many other aspects of housing policy.  It speaks about recognising pressures, a comprehensive response, etc., and although the terms used in the amendment sound good, they will not make a blind bit of difference to the people I spoke about already who will be out queuing this evening, seeking a roof over their heads.  The longer measures like rent certainty are put off, the higher rents will rise and the more people will become homeless.  This is direct consequence of inaction.<\/p> <p>Rent certainty is needed.  Those who say they support rent certainty should support the Bill tonight and the parties arguing that they support rent certainty should back it tonight.  I appeal to Members to do the right thing.

Rent certainty will make a positive change so let us be positive and do it.<\/p> <p>It was interesting to watch yesterday's responses to the budget.  We all agree the Peter McVerry Trust is at the coal face of this matter, and it saw the budget measures as a series of incentives for developers and landlords.  It did not see any real leadership vision or resources presented to deal with the matter.  The Minister, who has just left, and the Minister of State face big challenges in our society of housing and rent increases, which are crippling people across the State.  The Government is overly reliant on the private sector to address the housing crisis and provide what should be public housing across this State.  I have no doubt this is about ideology, specifically a right-wing ideology that believes it is better for the market and privatisation to address social challenges.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101200002#QQ00400","speaker":"1400"},{"type":"speech","time":1476264600,"counter":230,"content":"<p>That is not correct.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101200002#QQ00500","speaker":"1264"},{"type":"speech","time":1476264600,"counter":231,"content":"<p>The speech of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, mentioned that the centre must hold.

I recognise that there is a comprehensive social housing programme and I firmly believe that this is the proper mechanism by means of which to deal with this issue and tackle rising rents.<\/p> <p>Since the 2015 legislation was enacted, a market cap has been in place and it will remain so four years.  Senator Coffey was part of the Government that introduced that legislation, which has been quite helpful to tenants.  The Sinn F&eacute;in housing policy aims to facilitate the building of 100,000 houses in 14 years.  Sinn F&eacute;in wants builders to provide 20% social and affordable housing, a measure introduced by Fianna F&aacute;il.  Sinn F&eacute;in wants to set interest rates.  It talks about lowering them and it wants to manipulate the interest rate market and tell banks what they can and cannot charge.  It wants to abolish the local property tax, introduce rent regulation and cap rents.  It also wants to heavily increase taxes on companies - something we have heard on several occasions - and increase taxes on builders.  All these measures are not incentives to build more houses.  We must be practical.  These measures will not help us build more houses.  This is \"la-la\" economics and would leave us with a massive housing crisis akin to the one that Sinn F&eacute;in, as the largest party in Dublin, has overseen.  Its hand is on the wheel here in Dublin.  We have talked about it.  Senator McDowell talked about landbanks in the city centre that could be used to build houses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101200002#RR00400","speaker":"1411"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1476264600,"counter":238,"content":"<p>(Interruptions).<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1476264600,"counter":239,"content":"<p>Senator Davitt, without interruption.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101200002#RR00600","speaker":"1418"},{"type":"speech","time":1476264600,"counter":240,"content":"<p>Sinn F&eacute;in is preoccupied with Fianna F&aacute;il.

We can all come in here and provide heart-wrenching human stories involving people in our communities about which we hear every day.  They are not statistics on a quarterly report - they are real people.  If Members have not already done so, I ask them to read the action plan on housing and homelessness.  It did not happen overnight and it did not happen because people were not concerned.  It happened because we are in the midst of the worst housing crisis ever.  We can all apportion blame but the people about whom Senator Mac Lochlainn spoke who will queue to view properties tonight or the people in Cork who will go into homeless shelters, search for emergency accommodation or sleep in hotel rooms need and want us to deliver for them.  That is what this Government is about.<\/p> <p>Sinn F&eacute;in Members might want listen to the contributions of the Minister, Senators Coffey and McDowell and others.  There are consequences involved.  I speak not as a multiple home or property owner.  I own my own house so I am not flying the flag for anybody other than those who require housing.  We cannot deal with issues in isolation.  We must parse the various issues.  Regardless of whether we like it, one of the fundamental problems in this housing crisis is the lack of supply.  If one talks to auctioneers, landlords, tenants or people who want to buy, one will see it comes down to supply.  We do not have enough houses and that is the consequence of bad decisions made over a long period.  I will cite two examples.  We have seen the growth of Cork Institute of Technology and University College Cork, both tremendous higher-education institutions.  The growth of Cork University Hospital is linked to that.  What did we do in terms of providing accommodation for students?  We did nothing.  As a consequence, vast swathes of areas are taken up in private rentals for students when they could be used to cater for people who want to buy or rent or the city council could take over some of the properties.  As Senator Landy said, people are now using Airbnb.  <\/p> <p>Senator Coffey talked about the legacy of the boom-and-bust cycle.  We must ensure, as we have done in the budget, that we can get first-time buyers to purchase and have a private rental sector that actually works to suit tenants.  Regardless of whether Sinn F&eacute;in Members like it, we need landlords.  In many cases, landlords are not pariahs.  I have appeared before the PRTB with residents against landlords and I do not fly the flag for them.  However, we need landlords who are responsible and who have houses to let as their main source of income so that people can live in them.  If we do not have that, we will get nowhere.  <\/p> <p>The fundamental difficulty is in the context of the rental sector.  I come in here and listen to people giving out about what the Government are not doing.  I will provide a couple of facts so that we can debunk this myth in the context of Government.  There was an action plan for housing within 100 days of Government.  I accept the all-party committee was set up under the chairmanship of Deputy John Curran but the Minister, the Minister of State and the Department have been driving this, as has the Government.  The one thing I have learned in opposition and in government is that it is very easy to come in every day and criticise.  They should go and talk to their colleagues in Northern Ireland and ask them what is like to be in government.  They will provide the answer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101200002#RR02200","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1476264600,"counter":256,"content":"<p>We do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101200002#RR02300","speaker":"1377"},{"type":"speech","time":1476264600,"counter":257,"content":"<p>It is called having to make decisions and having to be responsible.

Up to &euro;200 million has been allocated to the local infrastructure housing activation fund to remove infrastructure blockages to larger housing developments and, in turn, to deliver more supply.  A help-to-buy scheme has been announced for first-time buyers with a tax refund of up to 5% of the value of the house with a &euro;20,000 cap.  I know the academics have had a field day before and since the Budget Statement.  However, I have had telephone calls today from people who want to buy a house in Cork city but tell me they cannot find one.<\/p><p>We have given a 5% increase in tax relief for landlords in 2017 to encourage investment.  One problem we have is people with distressed mortgages in buy-to-let schemes and it is in rag order.  Some of the conditions of rental properties are sinful and immoral.  I have a fundamental difficulty in how the Private Residential Tenancies Board, PRTB, does it business.  We need to be more proactive in going after those landlords who do not treat tenants with respect.  The increased threshold for the rent a room scheme to &euro;14,000 will ease pressures on rents.  An increase of &euro;105 million for the housing assistance payment scheme will benefit 15,000 families.<\/p><p>The four keys areas in tenancies are security, supply, standards and services.  Rather than divide the House, will Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh park the Bill?  Like the housing committee in the D&aacute;il, we should come together in a national movement to ensure supply is increased and we do not have the awful human tragedies of people living on the streets of our cities, not able to rent or buy a house.  These are the very people we meet every day.  There is nothing more distressing or upsetting than to be confronted with the possibility of losing a tenancy or being homeless.  Political point scoring does not work.  The Government is committed to dealing with this.  Members opposite should join us in ending this scourge.  Together we can go back to the people who have elected us to the Houses of the Oireachtas to improve their lives, which is a fundamental part of this budget.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101200002#RR02600","speaker":"1391","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1476264600,"counter":261,"content":"<p>Senator Jerry Buttimer spoke about how we in the Chamber can all share stories about the housing crisis.  I certainly would not make apologies - I would not expect him to either - for expressing the needs and concerns of those most marginalised.<\/p> <p>Sinn F&eacute;in is in government in the North and works at local government level too.  One of the first events at which I met Senator Paudie Coffey was when he was Minister of State.  It was at the launch of the Valhalla sheltered housing development in the heart of Clondalkin two years ago.  Since that time, however, those on the South Dublin County Council housing list continue a nine-year wait for social housing.  We made decisions in South Dublin County Council which had 300 houses ready to go.  Despite our local authorities doing their utmost, they cannot do it alone.<\/p> <p>Queues of residents, homeless people, students and young people hoping to find a room are commonplace in Dublin city.  Every week night, the effect of years of policy inaction, which started well in advance of the Government's term, is visible as crowds gather to rent a property or room, some with deposits in hand, in the hope of their names and references being accepted by landlords.  Now online property and rental sites feature rooms with multiple bunks.  Staggering homeless figures are evidence of the horrific effect of our lack of affordable rental options.<\/p> <p>The Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, referred to the scenario facing students who need housing every September.  He said it affects 25,000 young people, but I have heard the figure is more likely to be 50,000.  Market stability should be the long-term goal with meaningful rental options on offer.  Rent certainty gives students, young people and homeless people security and a stake in a rental market that has all but left them behind.  I encourage Senators from all parties to take significant and meaningful action tonight by voting for this Bill which supports affordability and tenancy rights, as well as what the organisations on the ground are telling us, namely, that certainty can be the start of a significant process in solving this crisis.<\/p> <p>Yesterday afternoon, the tax and spend measures announced in the budget showed Fine Gael continuing the same failed housing policies which have dominated public policy for decades.  The Minister for Finance's first-time buyer's scheme is available on homes up to the value of &euro;600,000, a measure which will only drive prices higher.  It is quite telling the Government thinks struggling first-time buyers will consider a house purchase of between &euro;400,000 to &euro;600,000.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform's increase in capital investment in social housing of &euro;105 million will deliver only 900 new houses.  That is not combined with the extra &euro;17 million to be given to the housing associations which will deliver only 100 extra social houses.

There is a fundamental flaw in some of the arguments put forward by both Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il.  They argue the reason rents are increasing is because of lack of supply.  That is only an element of what is going on.  When I was learning fundamental economics, we were told another issue in the lack of supply would be vultures coming into a market who would be willing to pay more because there would be less of the commodity available.  That is what is happening in many cases in our housing market.<\/p><p>Recently, a director of services in a local authority told me they try to buy houses which come onto the market with the moneys available to them.  However, increasingly, they are seeing fellows in sharp suits, as he said, coming to sales representing the vulture funds.  They will pay over the odds for any houses coming onto the market.  It is a bit like the spike in oil prices and what is happening with sterling.  Rents are increasing as a result of the increased yields these vulture funds are looking for on their investments.  There is talk about accidental landlords.  These vulture funds are forcing those landlords out of the market and putting rents way up.  Essentially what one has is extortion supported by Government policy.  These vulture funds are taking the large sums of money, referred to in the article from the <i>Galway Advertiser<\/i>, from the pockets of people trying to make ends meet.<\/p><p>There has been much talk about what is a normal functioning market.  There are functioning markets in Germany, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark and Sweden.  A part of their markets is having rent certainty.  Mention was made of people getting out of the market.  I would like to see the vulture funds get out of the market and not get as much money.  I would like to see rents at a less volatile level.  Rent certainty would deliver that.  As for accidental landlords getting out of the market, there were some people who got involved in the property market at the height of the boom when prices were very high, as the auctioneers to my left would know, paying way over the odds for housing stock<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101200002#SS00500","speaker":"1377"},{"type":"speech","time":1476264600,"counter":263,"content":"<p>It is good to employ a few people too.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101200002#SS00600","speaker":"1411"},{"type":"speech","time":1476264600,"counter":264,"content":"<p>If they want to get out of the market, why not let the local authorities buy them out and put that housing stock back into their hands?<\/p> <p>It has been thrown at us by Fianna F&aacute;il that this legislation is highly flawed and it has a great policy for this area.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2363\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2363&amp;amp;pid=TrevorOClochartaigh&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=12\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Where is its legislation?

The judicial appointments Bill involves complex legal and constitutional questions which will require careful consideration, further consultation and teasing out into the most appropriate measures.  I intend then to proceed to finalise a general scheme of the Bill and to bring it before the Government for approval.<\/p> <p>Senators will be aware that, under the Constitution, judges are appointed by the President on the advice of the Government.  It is an act of the Executive under the Constitution to advise the President on the persons to be appointed to judicial office.  The current process for the appointment of judges in Ireland is set out in the Courts and Court Officers Act 1995, as amended, which established the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board as a recommending body.  The role of the board is to identify persons through their own application or the board's invitation who are suitably qualified for judicial office.<\/p> <p>A process involving a wide-ranging review of all aspects of the law on the system concerning judicial appointments was commenced under the previous Government and has been referred to by me in previous contributions in this House and in the D&aacute;il.  A consultation process on the system of judicial appointments was conducted by my Department in 2014 and it was acknowledged then that the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board process was a model of best practice in its day but that it was time, after almost 20 years, to review the operation of the judicial appointments system to ensure it reflects current best practice having regard to international standards, that it is open, transparent, accountable and that it promotes diversity.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Frances Fitzgerald:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=401\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=401&amp;amp;pid=FrancesFitzgerald&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=12\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->There was an encouraging response to the call for submissions.  A total of 27 submissions were received from a range of interested persons and bodies, including the Judicial Appointments Review Committee, which is a committee of the Judiciary, the Bar Council, the Law Society of Ireland, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties and other civil society groupings, former judges, public representatives, university-based lawyers and private individuals.  These submissions remain available to us and are of direct relevance in terms of moving to the delivery of new legislation in this area.<\/p><p>A number of reform themes emerged from the consultation process and, along with the programme for Government commitment, they are informing the preparation of the new legislation.  Among the strongest ideas to emerge is the idea of the importance of ensuring that the Judiciary retains the independence essential for discharging its constitutional function.  I believe Ireland has a proud record in this regard.  Another important idea is that the Judiciary should reflect, as far as possible, the diverse nature of society, from which it is drawn, as is the idea that judges should be appointed on merit.<\/p><p>I imagine the House will agree that our reforms must have regard to these important principles.  Significant further work and critical consultation will be necessary in finalising the scheme for a new judicial appointments commission Bill.  This is a priority for the Government and I look forward to bringing this legislative reform to the House at the earliest opportunity.<\/p><p>A number of vacancies exist in the courts.  Currently, there is one vacancy in the Supreme Court, two vacancies in the Circuit Court and one vacancy in the District Court.  There are also two pending vacancies, one in each of the Circuit Court and the District Court.  Undoubtedly, there will be more over the coming period.  The requirements of the administration of justice will be the over-riding priority for the Government over the period ahead as the necessary reforms are brought forward as expeditiously as practicable.<\/p><p>It is intended to publish the judicial council Bill in this session.  Considerable work has been done on it.  The Bill will provide for the establishment of a judicial council to promote excellence and high standards of conduct by judges as well as to facilitate the investigation of allegations of judicial misconduct.  That legislation and the judicial appointments commission Bill will together provide for a fundamental and far-reaching reform of the judicial system.<\/p><p>Senators have called on me to address the issue of Garda pay.  I am disappointed that the Garda Representative Association rejected the agreement reached with my Department in recent weeks and has announced an intention to take industrial action.<\/p><p>It is disappointing that the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors is contemplating action, particularly in view of the positive outcome of the recent association ballot on the Lansdowne Road agreement.  Members of the association accepted the proposal by a ratio of 70:30 some weeks ago.  In the event that it proceeds, such action would be unprecedented and would be detrimental for society, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Garda morale and public confidence.  I am committed to doing everything possible to find a resolution within the very real constraints that exist in terms of public sector pay.  Everything that can be done will be done.  My focus and that of the Government is on negotiation and we are looking for a pathway to move forward.  I have said consistently that all sides must continue to explore ways forward through further engagement.  I met with the GRA and the AGSI last week to hear first-hand their outstanding concerns.  Those meetings were constructive and I will continue to facilitate further engagement.  The GRA will meet this week and I hope my officials and the GRA will be in a position to meet us before the end of the week, if not, then early next week.<\/p><p>As Senators will be aware, the agreement reached between my Department and the GRA addressed in a positive way the issues raised by the GRA in the course of negotiations, which took place over a number of months.  In particular, the agreement sought to address the concerns articulated in respect of the pay of new recruits, the additional hours that garda&iacute; are required to work, access to pay determination and dispute resolution bodies and the completion of the review of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The agreement we had reached included significant benefits, including the restoration of the rent allowance, worth over &euro;4,000 annually, to new recruits as well as lifting the increment freeze that has been in place since 1 July.<\/p><p>It would be most unfortunate if, rather than engaging further, action was to be contemplated that would not be in the best interests of our communities or An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I have mentioned this on a number of occasions and I imagine Senators will agree with me.  Members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, like all public servants, played a significant part in stabilising the public finances and bringing about the economic recovery.  They were subject to the same pay reductions as all other public servants over the course of the financial crisis years and similarly have benefitted from the partial restoration of pay commenced on foot of the Lansdowne Road agreement.  Like all public servants, members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na played a significant role in stabilising the public finances.  In working with them I am keen to find a way forward towards pay restoration that can be managed within the parameters laid down.<\/p><p>The Government is conscious that the associations, as is the case with many public sector representative bodies, are frustrated at the pace of pay restoration.  However, I imagine many Senators would agree that the Government must take a sustainable and prudent approach to public sector pay.  We are committed to the Lansdowne Road agreement as the framework for industrial relations and pay determination within the public service.  Within this framework, the programme commits to the establishment of a commission for public sector pay to examine pay levels across the public sector, including entry levels of pay, and to the gradual negotiated repeal of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts.<\/p><p>As the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, said in his budget speech yesterday, the public service pay commission will report to him by the middle of next year and provide inputs on how the unwinding of the financial emergency measures in the public interest legislation should proceed.  We will ensure all those represented there do so on an equal footing.  The resolution of any outstanding issues of concern to the GRA or the AGSI can only be addressed through engagement between the parties, and I urge them to engage in discussions before contemplating any action that, as I have said on numerous occasions, would not be in the best interests of our communities or An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101200002#VV00300","speaker":"1214","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1476264600,"counter":283,"content":"<p>Senator Clifford-Lee is next.

However, it shows that there is rampant demoralisation and anger within the force.

As we know, unlike other workers, garda&iacute; do not have the right to strike.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has always served the State with great pride and its members take an oath to defend the public and the State.  However, the decision to strike, which Fianna F&aacute;il does not support or agree with, nonetheless shows a rampant demoralisation, as I have already said.<\/p> <p>The Government has been aware that industrial relations issues have been brewing in the Garda for some time.

It is to be regretted that the Government has stumbled and stalled in dealing with the challenges facing An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Government must recognise that reports by GSOC, the Policing Authority or the Garda Inspectorate will be meaningless unless the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has good morale within its force and feels its members are being respected and valued by the State and the Government.  Morale is low because of the terms and conditions.  It is clear the grievances of garda&iacute; are not being treated seriously by the Government.  <\/p><p>In the confidence and supply agreement with Fianna F&aacute;il, the Government agreed to establish a commission on public service pay.  The Minister said the commission will report in the middle of next year but did not specify when it will be established.  Will she address that?  I am calling on the Minister to give a commitment that the Government will engage with the GRA to defuse the situation immediately.  <\/p><p>I will touch on the issue of judicial appointments.  Fianna F&aacute;il recently published a Bill to provide for the establishment of an independent judicial appointments commission that would recommend persons for appointment to judicial office based solely on merit.  The timescale and delay by the Government in dealing with the issue has prompted Fianna F&aacute;il to put forward its own Bill.  We are fortunate in Ireland to have a staunchly independent Judiciary.  This is in spite of, rather than because of, our system of appointing judges.  Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s legislation provides for an independent commission that can recommend and rank, based solely on merit, a small group of substantially qualified persons to be nominated.  A merit-based system of appointment will enhance the principle of judicial independence.  Publishing the Bill would remove the possibility of Government foot dragging for any longer on establishing a judicial appointments commission, which would be required to make recommendations to the Minister for Justice and Equality based on merit.  <\/p><p>The Minister touched on the vacancies in the Judiciary and we call on her to fill them as a matter of urgency.

I thank her for coming in response to a suggestion I made that this debate should happen and I thank the Leader of the House for arranging for it.<\/p> <p>The particular issue I was concerned about was the question of judicial appointments in view of media reports that a moratorium on the appointment of judges had been put in place at Cabinet level pending the passage of the legislation outlined in the programme for Government.  I note what has been said here about the Fianna F&aacute;il Bill.  I have had an opportunity to look at Deputy Jim O'Callaghan's Bill and it seems to me that the principle of the Bill is preferable to that adumbrated in the programme for Government.  I am deeply concerned that the model proposed in the programme for Government for an inexpert majority on the appointments commission will lead to poor rather than good results.<\/p> <p>The principle in Deputy O'Callaghan's Bill is a better principle, which provides that the advice of people who know what they are talking about is made more focused and is available to the Executive.  It strikes me that Senator Boyhan has been advancing the proposal to have the judicial council legislation brought forward and considered at an early date.  The Minister will know it is a longstanding chestnut in her Department.  I was recently interested to see judicial impatience at the progress.  There was a time when the impatience was all in St. Stephen's Green and it was the Judiciary who were on the receiving end of correspondence from impatient Ministers.<\/p> <p>It is important that our Judiciary has the relevant institutions to enable it to function to the best possible standard in the eyes of the public.  There is no opposition to the idea of a judicial council any more, although there was at one point, so now is the time to get on with it.  If Deputy O'Callaghan's Bill receives the favour of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, where I presume it will be introduced, the Government should adopt it and get on with it rather than going through the process of developing its own model.  Deputy O'Callaghan's Bill can be amended if it is the will of that House and this one, but it would be pointless to have two alternative views competing in the form of two separate Bills and to delay any action until the Government prepares its own Bill in this respect.<\/p> <p>Reference has been made to the Garda pay issue.  I do not want to put any further political pressure of any kind on the Minister.  I understand completely the circumstances in which the T&aacute;naiste finds herself.  Everybody, including the T&aacute;naiste, will agree with me that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na needs to be treated as a special case because its members carry out special functions and are deprived of certain rights which other people in the community enjoy in respect of negotiating their own wages and conditions.  The idea of a two-tier wage structure within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is unacceptable.<\/p> <p>Right across Ireland, there are people who believe they are being policed by garda&iacute; who live 50 or 60 miles away and who are driving to work and going home to wherever they leave.  Will the Minister confirm whether or not the Garda Reserve, which could serve to establish local roots for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in every community, will be expanded and its numbers increased?  It is no threat to Garda status or pay but it would be a huge bonus for linking An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to the communities in a way they were in the past when it was common for the local sergeant to live above the station.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101200002#XX00700","speaker":"1403"},{"type":"speech","time":1476264600,"counter":292,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister for Justice and Equality to the House.

There is no mention of the judicial council in the programme for Government, only three paragraphs about judicial appointments.<br\/><br\/>Articles 34 and 37 of the 1937 Constitution of Ireland regulate the courts and outline generally how judges are to be appointed.  The President of Ireland appoints judges on the advice of the Government.  In practice, the decision to appoint a person to the Judiciary is made by the Minister for Justice and Equality.  He or she is under no legal obligation to accept a person recommended by the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, JAAB.  These are facts.  The JAAB is a statutory body.  It has no role in appointing a person who is already a judge to a judicial appointment, such as a higher court than the one in which he or she sits.  This critical point is somewhat lost.  The JAAB creates a list of at least seven people whom it recommends for appointment.  The Government is under no obligation to accept any of these recommendations.  In practice, there is no review of a decision regarding the appointment of a judge.<br\/><br\/>The JAAB does not have the power to rank the names on the list in order of preference or merit.  Neither is the Government obliged to select any one of these recommended by the JAAB.  The JAAB has no role in the appointment to a judicial office of a person who is already a judge.  If a judge of the Circuit Court is to be appointed to the bench of the High Court, no provisions of section 16 of the 1995 Act apply.<br\/><br\/>The programme for Government sets out three simple paragraphs regarding political judicial appointments.  How can we progress the matter?  There is no doubt that reform is needed in this area.  It is important to set out the facts of where we are.

We are discussing very important aspects.  For too long, the system of judicial appointments has not been dealt with.  I share Senator McDowell's concern about a moratorium.  The legislation the T&aacute;naiste proposes is a very important incremental step forward in tidying up the process.  We have been very lucky to have an effectively unblemished record of judicial decency and honour.  We have great judges, many of whom are coming out of retirement to do the State further service.  It shows the calibre of the people who served on the benches of the country over the years.<\/p> <p>On the difficulties faced regarding the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, I call on all parties to continue engagement.  The rank and file members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na do not want to go on strike.  They do not want any disciplinary issues or for the public to feel afraid that there may be an increase in crime on the allocated days.  The responsibility is on the Garda representatives and the Government to engage and continue to engage.  I have no doubt the issues will be ironed out.  I agree there is a special case for the Garda and maybe we should debate it.  They are one of the few groups of public servants who put themselves in the line of danger, and some have lost their lives.  Garda Tony Golden's anniversary mass was yesterday.<\/p> <p>The Garda Commissioner, N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan, appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality this morning and gave a phenomenal performance, although it was all about one issue.  Enormous transformation is taking place across the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Templemore has reopened and new recruits are coming in.  The Government has committed to an additional 800 garda&iacute; per year over the coming years.  There is a programme for change to modernise the structures of the force in terms of ICT.  Millions of euro have been invested in Garda vehicles.  The provision whereby civilians can do certain behind the desk tasks is happening.  There will be recruitment of senior management to ensure the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the necessary skills base to do its work.  It is a very exciting time for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p> <p>Let us not forget the quarterly behaviour and attitudes survey shows that the public has more than 85% confidence in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which is a world record compared with other police forces.  Three or four years ago, public confidence stood at 67%, which was still much higher than other countries.  Less than 15% of the population do not have confidence in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Given the programme of transformation, steered by a phenomenal Garda Commissioner with a phenomenal work ethic and supported by the T&aacute;naiste and Government, the next few years will be a very exciting time for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I sincerely hope the little difficulties in terms of pay will be resolved, bearing in mind that the whole country has suffered pay cuts over recent years.  Maybe we can consider creating a special case for the men and women of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101200002#YY00200","speaker":"1416"},{"type":"speech","time":1476264600,"counter":295,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith ag an T&aacute;naiste as an chur i l&aacute;thair at&aacute; d&eacute;anta aici.  There is a degree of unity in the Chamber this evening around the T&aacute;naiste's proposal regarding judicial reviews.  We all acknowledge, as the T&aacute;naiste did in her contribution, that the previous process is outdated and no longer fit for purpose.  Going back many years, it has been Sinn F&eacute;in's position that the issue of judicial appointments needed to be reviewed and changed to become compliant with a more independent ethos.  It is the right thing for the Judiciary and for those who find themselves engaging with it.  Given that it has been our position, I remind the House of the Reform of Judicial Appointments Procedures Bill 2013, which my colleague, Senator P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn brought before the previous D&aacute;il.  Unfortunately, the Government opposed it.  However, it is not the time to look back.<\/p> <p>There is a degree of heart to be taken from the T&aacute;naiste's acknowledgement in her contribution that she would like to see the independent oversight and the shade of independence in judicial reviews become institutionalised.  Is there a timeframe?  While we can all get into the nuance of it when it come before us, and no doubt Members will do so, for all the reasons previous speakers outlined, we need to know when it will happen and we need it to be expedited, not in a haphazard way but in a way that brings it to the fore sooner rather than later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101200002#YY00300","speaker":"1413"},{"type":"speech","time":1476264600,"counter":296,"content":"<p>The T&aacute;naiste is very welcome.  I will deal with the impending Garda strike.  Week after week, public sector workers are making the difficult and, in certain instances, unprecedented decision to take industrial action.

These workers have endured austerity budget after austerity budget in which this State took rights from them year on year and now they are telling the State: \"Pay us what we are worth, or else we'll down tools and leave you to it&rdquo;.  It has got so bad that today we are debating the unprecedented move by garda&iacute; to vote to take industrial action.  We need to recognise this anger and frustration over public sector pay will not go away any time soon but is gathering momentum.  The T&aacute;naiste needs to get to grips with this soon because this vote by garda&iacute; for industrial action is serious.  It is a reality check for those among her civil servants or her ministerial colleagues who seem to be playing hard ball on these issues.  <\/p><p>We are currently seeing recently recruited members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on starting salaries of &euro;23,500.  To put that in context, that is about one third of what we earn before we get our expenses and they have a much tougher job than we have.  They sleep in cars because they are unable to afford spiralling rent costs.  They drive all the way from places like Tipperary to Dublin every day, from their parents' homes, just to turn up for work because they cannot afford to live in Dublin.  On the broader morale front, given the continuous issues regarding whistleblowers, garda&iacute; do not feel safe to make protected disclosures.  When new garda&iacute; starting on a salary of &euro;23,500 read the Comptroller and Auditor's General's report about a &euro;150,000 slush fund to buy presents for senior garda&iacute; in Templemore, how does the T&aacute;naiste think that will affect the morale in the workforce?  Yesterday the Government gave Deputies a very generous &euro;5,000 annual pay increase but still has not restored the rent allowance for garda&iacute;.  We begin to get a clearer picture of the choices we make and the choices the T&aacute;naiste's Government has decided to make.  <\/p><p>To be clear,  Sinn F&eacute;in supports the right of any worker to engage in industrial action for better terms and conditions and we support the right of garda&iacute; to do so.  We believe the Garda Commissioner, N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan, and her senior team must now put in place a contingency plan for policing on those dates.  If the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors, AGSI, join the action of the Garda Representative Association, GRA, it will leave 160 superintendents, 42 chief superintendents and eight commissioners, including the chief, N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan, manning the force, according to the Garda figures we have.  The Garda Reserve, a force of 1,100 unpaid civilian volunteers, would most likely need to be deployed as well. <\/p><p>There is a scandal of low pay and poor working conditions in our public sector and this domino effect we are seeing is no surprise.  The only surprise is it has not happened sooner.  The Government needs to act with urgency and enter further negotiations with the GRA.  Yesterday, we heard about the political centre.  The problem, as I alluded to in another debate today, is that the Government does not occupy the political centre.  Unfortunately, it occupies quite a position on the hard right and that is why so many public sector workers are voting with their feet.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101200002#YY00400","speaker":"1389","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1476264600,"counter":298,"content":"<p>I welcome the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality to the House.  I also welcome the opportunity to have this debate.  A consensus has been breaking out across the House on the need for reform of judicial appointments, as other colleagues have said.  As the Minister said, this is very much an ongoing issue about which there has been extensive consultation.  At the justice committee last year, at my instigation we conducted a hearing on the subject of judicial appointments.  I hope we forwarded the transcript of that hearing to the T&aacute;naiste and her Department to inform the consultation process and the discussion around reform.<\/p> <p>I believe we all agree with the T&aacute;naiste's comment that any system of judicial appointment must be open, transparent and accountable and must promote diversity.  In the debate around the nature of the reform, I would make three points about how reform should be carried out.  The first point is to emphasise the critical issue that reform should not be long delayed, or at least that the process should not delay the much-needed appointments of judges.  The T&aacute;naiste referred to the vacancies that currently exist in the courts, one vacancy in the Supreme Court, two in the Circuit Court and one in the District Court.  One of the complaints most frequently made to me by stakeholders or clients, people who come into contact with the legal system, is the delay in judgments.  I know of some appalling delays in the handing down of judgments; there are currently outstanding judgements in particular cases.  It is a matter of real concern that we do not see a delay in the appointment of judges leading to delays in the judicial process for individual litigants and for people appearing before the courts.  That is one concern.<\/p> <p>A second issue regarding reform is to acknowledge the current model, as pointed out by Dr. Jennifer Carroll MacNeill in her extensive research on judicial selection procedures.  She pointed out that the current model, the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, JAAB, is not using the powers available to it to the extent that was originally anticipated when it was established in 1995.  It has taken a very narrow view of its own powers, particularly since the early 2000s.  Dr. Carroll MacNeill has clearly documented this and this is well known in the public domain as Dr. Elaine Byrne and others have written about this.  The JAAB could, for example, put forward for nomination to the Minister only seven names under the legislation.  Senator Boyhan pointed out that it does not have power to rank, but to put forward only seven names would itself send forward a message to any Minister.  Instead we are seeing, routinely, well over that number being put forward to Ministers and that is documented in that book.  The power of interviewing or of putting forward candidates is not used and has never been used by the board.  Therefore, there are some issues that need to be examined.  If legislation seeks to reform, the legislation must be implemented and any new body or a reformed JAAB must be properly resourced in order to be able to implement powers such as the power to interview.  Certainly those powers would circumscribe the process of appointments more.  Another point that was made is the need to extend the power to promotion of judges, where existing judges seek promotion and that power clearly currently is not there.  There are some issues with reforms but the failure to implement or use powers already existing in legislation must also be noted.<\/p> <p>We need to guard against any sort of affinity bias.  I know the judges' submission to the Minister called for more of a role for the Judiciary.  There is an issue where members of the Judiciary are self-appointing but that becomes hugely problematic.  I believe all Members would agree that in any reformed judicial appointments body, there should be less, and not more, of a role for serving judges.  This affinity bias, where people tend to promote or appoint people who are like them, tends to stifle diversity in appointments.<\/p> <p>We should be critical of problems and flaws within the system but we should also note that there are some ways in which our judicial appointments process has been very effective, for example, in having an increased gender diversity in the Judiciary.  In 2003 we published a study on gender discrimination in the legal professions in Ireland.  At that point there were low numbers of women in the Judiciary at all levels.  That position has significantly improved since 2003 and that is to be welcomed.  We are seeing a more representative Judiciary, at least in terms of gender, and that is to be welcomed.  Some elements are working well in the appointment process and that also should not be overlooked in any debate on reform.  Ruadh&aacute;n Mac Cormaic's recent book on the Supreme Court makes that point, namely, that judicial independence has been well established in this State and that whatever the flaws in the procedure, we have been well served generally by our Judiciary.  I am aware we will have a debate on judicial independence in the House next week, at the behest of Senators Boyhan and McDowell, and we will be able to say more about that.<\/p> <p>Turning to the issue of the proposed strike by garda&iacute;, this is the second cause of crisis in policing at present.  We read in recent weeks the revelations about the treatment of whistleblowers in the force and we await the report from the retired High Court Judge, Mr. Justice Iarfhlaith O'Neill, on that issue.  Clearly, the proposed strike is very much a second cause of crisis in which rank-and-file garda&iacute; are planning to take industrial action in November.  Other colleagues have talked extensively about the issue of Garda pay, which is one of the issues that has prompted this 95% vote in favour of industrial action.  I want to focus on another issue, that of access to State negotiations, in particular to national negotiations such as those on the Haddington Road and Croke Park agreements.  The issue of garda&iacute; and the right to negotiate is not new.  While section 18 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 prohibits members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na from joining trade unions, they can join associations but their representative associations are not privy to the national negotiations on pay and conditions.  We know that in 2013 the European Committee of Social Rights issued a decision that Ireland was in breach of its international obligations under the European Social Charter, among other things, because of the prohibition on the representative associations from joining national employee organisations such as Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU.  I draw attention to the Industrial Relations (Members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces) Bill 2015, introduced in the D&aacute;il in 2015 by my then Labour Party colleague, Michael McNamara, which, among other things, would have provided for the right of Garda representative bodies to join umbrella groups like ICTU.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Ivana Bacik:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2248\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=12\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Mr. McNamara pointed out that provisions like ours that were in place in France had resulted in judgments against the French Government by the European Court of Human Rights.  He also pointed out the need for us to comply with the European Social Charter.  This year, the T&aacute;naiste indicated she would seek a solution to the issues concerning the charter and that the findings of the European committee had been referred for consideration as part of an independent review under the Haddington Road agreement.  Has that review been concluded or will the T&aacute;naiste be in a position to accept a Bill like Mr. McNamara&rsquo;s, which was not accepted by the Government at the time, given the context of a speech in which she stated there was an ongoing review of these issues?  This is a significant bone of contention because it leads directly into issues of low pay, conditions of work, sick leave, hours of work and so on in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that have given rise to the 95% vote in favour of strike action.  I ask that we see our way to resolving this issue, being mindful of the finding against us at European level and the fact that Private Members' legislation has been introduced that proposes reasonable propositions in terms of the rights of garda&iacute;.<\/p><p>It was anomalous that, in the Haddington Road agreement negotiations, representatives of the Garda and the Defence Forces were barred from participating while representatives of prison officers and firefighters rightly participated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101200002#ZZ00200","speaker":"1402","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1476264600,"counter":300,"content":"<p>I thank Senators for their contributions to this debate.  I will address the issue of Garda pay, on which the House focused, first.  We want to negotiate and use every opportunity possible to deal with the concerns that have been raised by the GRA and AGSI.  In a ballot of AGSI members several weeks ago, the ratio was 70:30 in favour of accepting the work done by officials on the Lansdowne Road agreement.  That matter was agreed two weeks ago.  There were areas of consensus and progress was made, but when the GRA team reverted to its executive, the executive expressed a range of concerns and the association was not in a position to go further with the agreement.  I regret that.  I met the GRA recently to discuss its concerns.  It has stated it wants to continue working with us on how to chart a path forward.  This is in the context of the 285,000 public sector workers who have accepted the Lansdowne Road agreement and the 21 unions that have worked with the Government on unwinding the FEMPI legislation.  Everyone knows how important it is that we manage the economy well.  We are reaching out to address people's concerns as much as possible, but there are constraints.  It would not be realistic of me to claim otherwise.<\/p> <p>I take the point made by many Senators regarding the important role An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na plays in defending citizens against criminal elements.  Garda&iacute; are on the front line.  As Senator Conway mentioned, Tuesday was the anniversary of the death of Garda Tony Golden, who was doing his job and responding to a call.  My thoughts this week are with his family: Nicole and his very young children.  It was an appalling tragedy and act of criminality.  We must be conscious that garda&iacute; put their lives on the line.<\/p> <p>Senator Bacik asked about mechanisms.  After the European Confederation of Police, EuroCOP, found that the State was in breach of certain aspects of the charter, I referred its finding to the review that was then under way in the context of the Haddington Road agreement.  There was a change in personnel and the process under Mr. Ray McGee, who had done some of the work, did not continue, but Mr. John Horgan is now working with the Garda to finalise the review.  I expect it will be finalised by the end of December.  We are agreeable in principle to the Garda associations having like access as other public sector representative bodies to future pay determination mechanisms and statutory dispute resolutions, for example, being able to use the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court.  This will be helpful.  I take the point that being outside of the Haddington Road agreement process was not helpful.  I hope the progress we can make through the review will chart a roadmap towards having access to these mechanisms.<\/p> <p>Senator Clifford-Lee asked about the public sector pay commission.  The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, will table recommendations on the establishment of that commission in the coming weeks.  I hope it will be established early in the new year.  The timeframe for the body's first report has been brought forward to the middle of the year.  Senators referred to public sector unions and workers and I hope the commission will be a useful mechanism for examining contrasts in public sector and private sector pay and giving a voice to the various stakeholders.<\/p> <p>A number of Senators mentioned the anger within the Garda.  As I have acknowledged, garda&iacute; are like many workers, in that they have been through a difficult period.  There were high levels of overtime, but overtime was stopped, as was recruitment, and there was no investment for a period.  All of this has impacted on morale, as have the ongoing pay issues.  Thankfully, the economy can now support investment.  The previous Government restarted that investment, which I am continuing.  I hope that this will make a difference to morale.  I accept that pay issues are front and centre and we will do everything possible to address them.<\/p> <p>Various options are available as regards protected disclosures.  I have taken a decision on how the two most recent disclosures should be handled.  For the various whistleblower complaints that have crossed my desk and that of GSOC, there is also the option of a GSOC investigation.  I do not want to do anything that would interfere with GSOC's investigations and it is important that they proceed at GSOC's pace.<\/p> <p>As part of the agreement, there was a commitment to restore rent allowance to the 700 or 800 garda&iacute; affected.  I would be concerned by any irregularity in audits and accounting at Templemore.  The Garda Commissioner is Templemore's Accounting Officer.  Some of the issues are historical, but they will undoubtedly be addressed and appropriate action will be taken.  It was Templemore's own audit that found the difficulties.<\/p> <p>Turning to judicial appointments, we have received some advice and are seeking more on this matter.  Complex legal and constitutional issues are involved.  Senator McDowell has written about them and Senator Boyhan has raised a number of concerns.  The roles of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, JAAB, and the Government are distinctive.  As I have often stated, neither this Government nor its predecessor ever went outside JAAB's recommendations.  That is important.  We have an appointments process, but it is in need of change.  We will have interesting discussions on the format and type of change that is necessary, but we all agree on some of the key principles - appointments on merit and maintaining the strong constitutional issues that arise in this regard.  Senator Boyhan made suggestions concerning the scope that is available to the Government.  The advice that I have received agrees with him in this respect.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Frances Fitzgerald:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=401\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=401&amp;amp;pid=FrancesFitzgerald&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=12\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Deputy O'Callaghan does have a Bill which I will certainly examine very carefully and see what progress we can make because it is a priority for the Government, as is the judicial council Bill.<\/p><p>I again recognise what has been said about delays in the past.

Both pieces of legislation are on the A list and we are only putting on the A list those Bills that will be published.  It is not like in the past where there was a very long list of A Bills.  The last time we reached ten out of the 11 pieces of legislation on the A list.  It is the absolute intention that those Bills will be published this term and as much progress as possible made on them.<\/p><p>No doubt we will have interesting discussions as to whether there should be a lay majority or a legal majority.  There will be different points of view on that issue.  International practice at present would suggest that there ought to be some lay members.  Quite what the proportion should be will be for discussion but many jurisdictions do have lay chairs.  For example, the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority which we have just established has an independent lay person in charge.  Those are the kinds of decisions we will be teasing out and I look forward to what Members have to say about it.<\/p><p>Those are the main points raised on both areas so I will leave it at that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101200002#AAA00200","speaker":"1214","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1476264600,"counter":302,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.
