Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for having me here today, and I will do my best to help the committee in its difficult task.  You have my statement and I won't read it all out but will summarise a few important aspects of crisis management and the new legislative framework.<\/p> <p>  When I started on the banking side at the beginning of November 2008, the task at hand was the assessment of the size of the problem and the possible tools to handle it.  The liquidity aspects were well measured at that time and fairly stable.  The Irish economy had been contracting all that year and by the autumn of 2008, following the Lehman Brothers collapse, the property market had collapsed, with activity ceasing and prices falling.  The solvency of the Irish financial institutions depended on the performance of the economy overall and the value of the property assets against which the institutions had lent money.  Therefore, it was clear, as the property market continued to decline, that future losses on the property would be greater than had been previously expected and future profitability would be less than previously anticipated.  This meant that the capital position of the banks had to be addressed.  The PwC analysis showed clearly that there was a serious problem with land and development loans, both because of the total volume of such loans across the system and because of the small number of developers who had huge debts across the system.  The Department immediately began discussions with the bankers on the need to bolster their capital position.  The policy parameters within which the Department approached the recapitalisations throughout the period were as follows: banks should take action, where possible, to reduce the capital need by making changes to their balance sheets; assets should be sold; subordinated debt holders should be bailed in as far as possible; money should be raised on the markets, if available; the risk to the guarantee should always be considered; the systemic risk, that is, the risk of contagion if capital were not provided, should also be considered; State support should only be considered as a last resort.<\/p> <p>  The initial recapitalisations of Bank of Ireland and AIB consisting of &euro;3.5 billion in preference shares, was agreed and implemented between December '08 and May '09, with detailed discussions on the amount and the terms and conditions in these capital injections.  AIB also agreed at that time to sell their US and Polish subsidiaries.<\/p> <p>  The chairman and chief executive of Anglo Irish Bank left in December '08 and Donal O'Connor was appointed executive chairman on a temporary basis until a new CEO could be recruited.  In view of what we knew about it and had discovered, once the announcement of our intention to recapitalise the banks was made on 21 December '08, we prioritised legal due diligence of Anglo.  Arthur Cox carried out the due diligence and their first report was with us on 15 January '09.  The options which we had at that point were to continue with the original recapitalisation, either by preference shares or ordinary shares, to nationalise or to try and disengage.  The latter was not realistic in view of the guarantee, the expectation that European governments would stand behind their banks and the extreme likely contagion effect across the Irish system.  In the event, it was decided to nationalise and replace the board and management.<\/p> <p>  The problem of land and development loans was dealt with, following a study by Peter Bacon, by setting up NAMA.  An asset management agency was necessary because this loan book was so big and dysfunctional that it would have been very difficult for the banks to deal with these loans while continuing to provide banking services to the rest of the economy.  NAMA has proved efficient in dealing with these loans.  However, the slow, detailed method of valuing them individually and moving them over in tranches, which was developed to meet the requirements of the European competition ... European Commission, the competition directorate, increased the pressure on Irish banks and on the Irish State throughout 2010.  The effect of this should not be exaggerated.  The size of the losses was the major issue and overvaluing NAMA loans in 2010 would have resulted in losses materialising for the State later.  Nonetheless, the transfer of loans based on discounted ... a discount calculated on a broadly stratified sample of loans for each bank would have been a better methodology and would probably have left ... given us the same result.<\/p> <p>  Another major issue was the haircuts for loans was significantly higher than we had estimated.  This was mainly because of lack of equity in the developments.  In addition to this, the continued recession meant that other loans, including both mortgages and loans to SMEs, were registering an increase in arrears.  The first PCAR stress test run in March 2010 by the Financial Regulator found that the banks had very significant capital needs.  Bank of Ireland met this need through a combination of raising capital on the market and a conversion of &euro;1.7 billion of their Government preference shares.  AIB sold their overseas assets, with the balance of capital - &euro;3.7 billion - being provided by the Government.<\/p> <p>  Following our entry into the EU-IMF programme, the second PCAR stress test in March 2011 resulted in further capital demands for the banks.<\/p><p>Once again, Bank of lreland was able to raise money from the private sector, but the other banks, AlB, PTSB, EBS relied mainly on the State. <\/p><p> Given how much the State had to invest in the banking system, the policy throughout the period was to burden-share where appropriate.  All of the original shareholders in the covered institutions saw their share value diluted to nothing, or almost nothing.  At peak in 2007, the total share value of the institutions was &euro;53.7 billion.  In addition, &euro;15.5 billion capital was raised through burden-sharing with subordinated debt holders.  Much of this was done through liability management exercises where debt holders were asked to voluntarily sell their debt back to the banks at a reduced price.  We also passed legislation to allow the Minister get a special liability order, SLO, from the courts to change the terms of the bonds.  This forced the bondholders to sell into the liability management exercise, or have their bonds extended for a long period and interest suspended.  The SLO was only used in AlB, but, undoubtedly, the existence of the legislation contributed to the success in burden-sharing with the sub debt holders in the other institutions.<\/p><p> The question of extending burden sharing to senior bondholders was considered seriously twice that I remember - first, in October and November 2010 when the guarantee had lapsed and the programme of assistance was being put in place.  A number of lMF officials were strongly in favour of burning any unguaranteed and unsecured bonds in Anglo.  This was opposed by the EU and ECB officials.  In the event, the matter was considered at a more senior level in the IMF and, as a result of a US Treasury veto, the IMF also came down against any such action.  It would not have been possible for the lrish Government to act without troika consent.  The question was considered again in March 2011, but it was ruled out this time, as I understand, by the ECB.<\/p><p> The financial crisis ... to look at the regulatory supervision and government issues.  The financial crisis lead to a reassessment of the legislative framework for the financial services, both domestically and internationally.  I will give a brief summary of the changes made.  I will divide my comments into domestic and EU, though obviously the two programmes were developed in tandem and the Department worked to ensure they were consistent to the greatest extent possible. <\/p><p> On the domestic side, the first action was to amalgamate the Central Bank with the lrish Financial Services Regulatory Authority.  Separating the supervisory and financial stability functions, albeit with a requirement to cooperate, had undermined the importance of the macro prudential aspects of the role of both organisations.  The amalgamation was effected through the Central Bank Reform Act 2010.  This was followed by an extensive renewal of the supervision and enforcement powers of the Central Bank through the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013.  This latter legislation streamlined, enhanced and modernised the powers of the Central Bank.  Again, while this was a necessary and welcome improvement in the legislative framework, the Central Bank had significant powers before it was enacted and, indeed, used them extensively in the crisis management period, 2008 to 2013, prior to the new legislation.<\/p><p> The third major strand of legislation was providing for resolution powers.  This was done initially through the Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Act 2010, which gave extensive temporary resolution powers to the Minister for Finance to deal with the six covered institutions, as necessary, during the crisis.  Subsequently, the Central Bank and Credit institutions (Resolution) Act 2011 was passed.  This provides for the orderly resolution of a financial institution in financial difficulties.  The Central Bank is the resolution authority.<\/p><p> A final major piece of domestic legislation in the Credit Reporting Act 2013.  This is to enable credit institutions check what loans potential borrowers have from other institutions and organisations.  This should prevent a reoccurrence of a situation where a small number of people can have large loans from many different institutions and pose a systemic risk.  The credit register is currently being set up by the Central Bank.<\/p><p> On the EU front, the crisis lead to significant changes to the international regulatory framework also.  The 2009 de Larosi&eacute;re report recommended the establishment of a new European systemic risk board and three new supervisory authorities, the European Banking Authority, the European lnsurance and Occupational Pensions Authority, and the European Securities and Markets Authorities.  These bodies set technical standards, resolve disputes between supervisors and assist in developing consistent interpretation of European law.  Major legislative directives were also put in place for all the financial services areas, including the capital requirements directive, CRD lV dealing with bank capital, solvency ll dealing with insurance, and MIFID ll dealing with markets.  This was followed by the banking union proposal which centralised banking supervision and resolution for euro area countries, with a possible opt-in for non-euro countries.  The Single Supervisory Mechanism, SSM, was set up as a new branch of the ECB with responsibility for supervising the top 130 banks in Europe.  The bank restructuring and resolution directive, BRRD, was also agreed to provide for a single resolution mechanism to resolve financial institutions in difficulties.<\/p><p>All of these changes represent a major reconfiguration of the regulatory and supervisory framework.  Many of them have only just been implemented and some are not yet operational.  It will be some time before their effectiveness can be assessed.<\/p><p> And I'll stop at that, Chairman, and allow you ask your questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015070100002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Ann Nolan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1435705200,"counter":14,"content":"<p>Thank you very much for your opening statement, Ms Nolan, and if I can now invite Deputy Joe Higgins to commence questions this morning.

And then, on the other hand, a little bit later, \"...to continue the development of Ireland as a centre for international financial services\".  As you well know, in the 2003 Central Bank and Financial Services Authority Act, responsibility was given to the Central Bank and the regulator in the Act \"to promote the development within the State of the financial services industry\".

I don't see the two as being in contradiction.  I think if our regulatory system isn't robust, then that industry isn't secure, and the jobs in that industry is not secure.  So, although I think for the regulator to have a job of promotion is inappropriate, I don't think it's inappropriate for the Department of Finance to have that job, and I don't think it influences our regulatory decisions because I think for us, we would see as a major policy issue to have a robust regulatory system, and that that robust regulatory system is necessary to develop the international financial services industry.  I don't think they can develop against a background of light regulation in the modern world.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015070100002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Ann Nolan"},{"type":"speech","time":1435705200,"counter":17,"content":"<p>Yes.

Now, several witnesses in front of this inquiry have suggested that giving the Central Bank and the regulator at that time the mandate to regulate and control at the same time as promoting the industry gave rise to a conflict.

There is a question of what their position was at one point in time and the fact that the things deteriorated.  I mean the drop in GDP in Ireland in 2009 was phenomenal.  I don't think anyone at the end of 2008, which is the point where this is taking part, had any idea the extent to which the recession would be so deep as it was, particularly in 2009-2010.  So, therefore, I think the capital needs grew over that period and so even if they were right in 2008 as to what they needed at that point, that point was not even allowing for what was envisaged as so-called stress tests wasn't sufficient when the actual stress was so much bigger than they were testing for.  So I don't think there was a question of they told ... you know, in 2008 if somebody had walked into this committee and said, ''By the way, AIB need &euro;20 billion'', everyone would just simply have said, ''You're mad; you can't possibly think AIB needs &euro;20 billion'\", you know, because there was no ... there was no facts on which to base such an idea.  So I don't think it's a question that they lied, that they knew they needed the &euro;20 billion and lied to us.

I mean, for example, in February 2009, they produced a summary report of three previous reports that they had conducted into Anglo Irish Bank and they projected what the capital position of the bank would be on the various loss scenarios and they reached a conclusion, for example, that \"Under the PwC highest stress scenario, Anglo's core equity and tier 1 ratios are projected to exceed regulatory minima, (Tier 1 - 4%) at [end of] September 2010 after taking account of operating profits and stressed impairments.\"  Now, when it actually came to September 2010, the losses in Anglo were almost &euro;30 billion, so how can you rationalise that conclusion in early 2009 with the outcome of a loss and a bill for the taxpayer of almost &euro;30 billion in September 2010?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015070100002#N04700","speaker":"993"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1435705200,"counter":218,"content":"<p>I mean, Anglo surprised on the downside every time you looked at it for the entire period I've been dealing with it, I think I could say, and that's just looking at the losses.

The first one was the issue we've dealt with earlier, the question of whether there was any equity at all in the loans and I think, if you were to ask me, Bank of Ireland did have equity, AIB had some and Anglo, as far as I could see, just topped up all the loans to 100%, or were lending to the borrowers in a different hat ... with a different hat on, so the loans effectively had almost no equity.<\/p> <p>  The second aspect, I think, where there's the biggest difference between the original PwC work and what actually happened is the assumption that the bank had a model that would continue to generate income.

Now, if I can just scroll down this a moment, and while it's being done, maybe to a page ... it's the third page of it, it's the last footnotes of it here.  But in doing so, as I'm pulling that up, by March 2012, it was becoming clear within the Department of Finance that a longer-term restructuring solution was needed to the promissory notes which had been provided to IBRC.  The paper was produced in October 2012 for the EMC.  This proposed replacement of promissory notes with longer terms bonds over maybe a 30 to 40-year spread, however the view was that this would require liquidation of IBRC to allow this to be acceptable to the ECB.  Now, what I'm trying to do here is to get an understanding as to who was responsible for the strategic planning of the balance sheet impact of the banking crisis and also to establish with you the level of assistance and co-operation the Department of Finance received from the European Central Bank and Central Bank of Ireland during the crisis plan and implementation of putting in a solution.  So, in this regard, who originated this idea and what level of co-operation was evident from the Central Bank of Ireland and the ECB to investigate, discuss and cost alternatives and can you also describe the interaction and level of co-operation between the Central Bank of Ireland, the EMC and the European Central Bank and your Department to work through this proposal?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015070100002#P01700","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1435705200,"counter":295,"content":"<p>Okay.  This proposal ... I suppose, it goes back to what we were talking about earlier about moving all the deposits out of Anglo and INBS and then the following summer we amalgamated the two of them.  Now, we then had, effectively, a run-off vehicle with very big European funding which was rolling on a two-week basis, which was very unsatisfactory.  At the time of the guarantee ... at the time of the bailout, which would have been November 2010, there was some discussion about how the long-term funding of Anglo ... but no conclusion was reached at that time.  So we had various options after we had amalgamated the two of them in summer of 2011.  Various options were discussed, many of which didn't make very much sense but, from our own point of view, those discussions with the troika were very important because we knew we needed to get some resolution which would give long-term, not two-week funding, that we couldn't have a vehicle there ... you know, effectively for us, a priority was fixing it up or having a long-term solution before we left the programme.  While you were in the programme you had a kind of certain protection from the markets but you wouldn't have that when you left the programme so it was quite important to look at that.  So it was, I think ... I genuinely do not remember who first suggested it, but I think it was at some meetings at the very beginning of September 2011, no, 2012, when the liquidation of Anglo was first discussed and suddenly it became possible because, because it's kind of almost legal theology that the ECB had, this was a more attractive solution to them than the other solutions we'd been putting forward.  And it was ... had huge attractions to us as well, in that it would, effectively, remove Anglo or IBRC from the landscape, which was causing so much trouble for everyone.  So we entered into discussions fairly intensively starting at the very beginning of September 2012, ourselves, the Central Bank and the ECB.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015070100002#P01800","nonspeaker":"Ms Ann Nolan"},{"type":"speech","time":1435705200,"counter":296,"content":"<p>And maybe you could just paint a picture as to what the difficulties were, if I can maybe draw your attention there to the very bottom of the page, where it says:<blockquote><br \/><br \/>[The] Net book value of customer loan book per IBRC 30 June 2012 accounts [one, they had] &euro;15.6 billion.

Can I query and interrogate that somewhat with you for a minute or two?  In regard to Allied Irish Banks, the general figure that is put out there is that &euro;21 billion of State funds went in.  I would say that has to be added to by the following: NAMA witnesses said to the inquiry that the banks were overpaid for loans transferred to NAMA from them by &euro;10 billion.  That was the evidence from NAMA chief executive and chair.  If we allocate the Allied Irish Bank proportion of that, it would be &euro;2.8 billion, so I say if you add that to the &euro;21 billion, you get &euro;23.8 billion.  the merger with the EBS gives a further &euro;777 million in a, kind of, a hidden recapitalisation to AIB and then there's a further transfer, in February 2011, of &euro;1.6 billion or &euro;1.7 billion of Anglo NAMA bonds and deposits.

My opening remarks are quite brief.  First of all, I'd like to thank you and the members for the opportunity to make this brief opening statement today.  The task of inquiring into the banking crisis and the events surrounding it will, I hope, reveal lessons for the future guidance of policy makers which will help reduce the risks of a recurrence of these events to a remote one.  I don't think we could have another such unaffordable crisis.<\/p> <p>  I would like at the outset to express my regret at how matters turned out for the people of Ireland and for the period of austerity that affected so many, and for the increased burden of debt that we now carry.  As set out in my written statement, my connection in this was as a senior civil servant providing economic and fiscal policy advice to Ministers and Government, who then decided on the policy actions to pursue.  <\/p> <p>  I believe that, as confirmed by the Wright report, that the policy advice was appropriate, although not always followed.  The advice was to run a fiscal policy close to balance or a surplus, and to avoid adding unnecessarily to demand in the economy, to improve supply and to guard our competitiveness.  I did not provide advice on monetary or credit issues, that being the preserve of the Central Bank, or on credit growth, seeing that is a matter for the Central Bank to handle.  While giving advice I also took advice, notably that the likely growth scenario was one of a soft landing, i.e. that the housing market would return to more normal levels in a manageable way.  This was the view of economic advisors in the Department as well as outside, official and private sector commentators.  <\/p> <p>  I did not foresee events as they happened.  Others didn't do so either.  I was aware of only limited contrarian advice at the time.  It is difficult, as I said in my written statement, for cautionary or contrarian views to be got across when the economic news is so positive and when the country has been widely complimented on its economic performance.  <\/p> <p>  The rise in asset prices was a factor of accommodating monetary policy and fiscal policy, strong domestic demand and certain property tax incentives.  These incentives were introduced at various times since the 1980s.  The motivation for these reliefs was to develop, restore, renew certain areas, and to stimulate employment and job creation.  Some of these were more successful than others, and all were generally supported at political level.  A number of these were terminated after 1997, some limited in extent, and some new ones introduced.  The case for such reliefs was much diminished in the strong property market, but it took time to eliminate these from the tax system.  <\/p> <p>  I accept that there was a deficiency in economic advice resources, which it also took time to address effectively.  The situation was improved, but the problem is not just recruiting but retaining staff.  The current Government economic and evaluation service model seeks to address these issues in a constructive way.  Fiscal policy decisions take place in a different context to monetary policy action.  That context is a democratic one.  Government must marshal support for policy actions, and justify and defend these to parliament and the electorate.  It is not easy to garner support for restraint when resources appear plentiful.  A key challenge for the future, I believe, will be the need to communicate the wisdom of restraint to the public, even when resources allow, and the desirability of using surplus funds to reduce debt now to lessen the burden for the future.  It also seems that the EU believes that closer monitoring of member states, more constraints on our freedom of action, and firmer rules on budgetary policies will bring about greater fiscal responsibility.  Hopefully this will not be at the expense of democratic responsibility.  In short, there are important lessons to be learned and there are important issues to be reflected on in the remit of the inquiry on which I hope I can help in that regard.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015070100002#W00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Donal McNally"},{"type":"speech","time":1435705200,"counter":485,"content":"<p>Thank you very much, Mr. McNally, for your opening comments.

I don't know about the other side but the financial side, there would have been also IT skills but I do admit there was a problem in terms of resourcing on the economic side.  I found this out early on when the economic forecaster, who I think was Robert Watt, who is now the Secretary General of PER, I think he was the short-term economic forecaster.  I was seeking somebody to replace him and I had some difficulty because there was a reluctance to go on to the economic side, because people thought that their career prospects were better if they had a more broader experience and they weren't identified as being too technical or working too long in one particular area.  I said to the person that \"look you will only be there for a couple of years, you will be replaced\" as a way of trying to get him to agree.  As a result of that, I spoke to the Secretary General, John Hurley, who became Governor of the Central Bank and he arranged for the Central Bank to second an economist, John McCarthy, who has since gone on to be the chief economist.  That was sort of a stop-gap measure to an extent.<\/p> <p>  When Derek Moran, the current Secretary General came in, he conducted an analysis of the leads of the section and proposed a plan to recruit economists directly, which was done, and to bring in some other people from other parts of the Department, from the NDP - the national development plan side - who were, that was running down their engagement there.  We also took on another economist in 2006 from the Central Bank.  So something, things were done.  I don't think there was any lack of quality, it was more an issue of quantity.  The Wright report did say that the analysis presented by the economic side was as good as any else and there were no complaints that I heard from any of the international bodies they dealt with to that extent.

Okay, I'll just deal with one question myself, Mr. McNally, and then we'll move towards the wrap-up and I'll invite both Senator Barrett and Senator D'Arcy back in again.  If I could just relate to, and I think Senator MacSharry touched upon this with you just a moment ago, on 24 January 2001, the European Commission concluded that Irish fiscal policy was inconsistent with the broad European policy guidelines.  They further asked Ireland to avoid further overheating of its economy, and there's a document, I think, coming up on the screen there now, but you make reference to this, I think, actually in your own opening address today, where you mention, I think, it's on page four of your opening statement:<blockquote><br \/><br \/>The only notable exception to this is the recommendation issued to the State in 2001 by the Economic and Finance Council under Article 99(4) of the Treaty to take countervailing budgetary measures during 2001 to avoid overheating.  This recommendation was not felt warranted and was not accepted by the Irish authorities.<\/blockquote>And if I just, the document is there, if I just move one or two pages into it, it's page 13 of the document itself, on the bottom, it's ... next one ... next one again ... just page 13 of it.  And if you look at the last paragraph of it there, Mr. McNally, just come in there about three lines down, it says:<blockquote>Against this background, the Council finds that the planned contribution of fiscal policy to the macroeconomic policy mix in Ireland is inappropriate.  The Council recalls that it has repeatedly urged the Irish authorities, most recently in its 2000 broad guidelines of the economic policies, to ensure economic stability by means of fiscal policy.  The Council regrets that this advice was not reflected in the budget [of] 2001, despite developments in the course of 2000 indicating an increasing extent of overheating.  The Council considers that Irish fiscal policy [of] 2001 is not consistent with ... broad guidelines of the economic policies as regards budgetary policy.<\/blockquote>And it goes on and on.<\/p><p>Now, we've had reports from some institutions like the IMF and others that said in around 2005, 2006, they were getting things wrong.  But this one would seem to be very, very strident in its language and in its indication of action required and so forth.  So could you, as I say, I think the document is of 12 February 2001, this, so ... and the European Council recommend that countervailing measures be taken, as I just cited.  Could you tell us what action was taken by the Department of Finance on receipt of this very, very strong advice as outlined from the European Council?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015070100002#FF00900","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1435705200,"counter":840,"content":"<p>Well, the ... I would have been advised just before that meeting of the Economic and Finance Committee, that they were planning to make this recommendation and I would have reported back to the Minister, who felt that it wasn't justified, and I would have argued at the Economic and Finance Committee that the recommendation was not warranted.  I agree that they did, in the 2000 broad guidelines, say that we should stand ready to use countervailing measures.  But we had a surplus of 4.3% in 2000 and were planning another surplus of 4%, so, you know, that is taking a lot of resources out of the economy.  What they were suggesting was another 0.5%.

I was Minister for Finance from the 26 June 1997 to the 29 September 2004.  As directed by the committee, I submitted a statement on specific lines of inquiry relating to my role as Minister for Finance.  As my period as Minister for Finance ended in September 2004, some considerable time before the banking collapse, my statement deals only with those areas of interest of which I might have some direct knowledge or which would have arisen during my tenure as Minister.  This opening statement refers briefly to areas of my written statement.<\/p> <p>  The new regulatory structure was set up during my time and culminated in two separate Bills in 2002 and 2003.  In 1998 the Government agreed in principle to the setting up of a single regulatory authority for financial services.  Interestingly, the idea of an SRA was first mooted in 1989 but it was decided not to go ahead with same at that time.  We asked Michael McDowell to chair the implementation advisory group.  It consisted of nine persons and produced two reports, a majority report and the minority alternative model.  It took some time to reach political agreement as to the new structure, which eventually led to the two Bills as referred to above.  There was considerable disagreement and not just between the politicians.  If you read the commentary on stances of that time, there was not universal agreement as to how and where the new authority should be located.  I've noted with a certain degree of irony that a number of the politicians and commentators who wished to keep the Central Bank out of the key role at that time were to the forefront in advocating the return of all powers to the Central Bank post the recent financial crisis, and that has now been done.<\/p> <p>  Practically all of the debate of those years centred on the consumer protection angle, and little on prudential supervision.  I outlined in my statement the various reasons for such debate orientation.  I further outlined in my statement that the rules for the capital requirements for banks were designed internationally following the Basel committee recommendations.  There has been a recurring notion in much of the Irish media commentary of recent years that principle-based regulation, also referred to as light touch regulation, was an Irish invention.  In particular, some commentators have gone so far as to advise that light touch regulation was even a Charlie McCreevy invention.  Much as I might be flattered to think that I might own the copyright, it is not the case, and light touch, principle-based regulation was a long time in vogue internationally, and years before I arrived as Minister for Finance.  At least some of the earlier evidence to this committee has at least scotched that notion.<\/p> <p>  I have outlined in my statement as to how capital requirements for Irish banks were managed under the same formulae and policies which applied to all the other European banks.<\/p><p>As the new structures were in the embryonic stage of development before I ceased as Minister in 2004, I can only comment in a cursory way on the co-operation and integration of the new bodies.  However, during the setting up of IFSRA, I was strongly of the view that there was an excellent level of co-operation between the chair of IFSRA and the Governor of the Central Bank.  The new structure allowed the Central Bank to concentrate on the macro level and to produce financial stability reports which contain guidance for the financial regulation to follow.  IFSRA had responsibility for the individual institutions under their remit.<br\/><br\/>I now turn to direction from the committee on advice.  Strictly, the reprimand from Brussels on our 2001 budget would fall under the heading of &quot;advice&quot;.  The European Union was of the opinion that our budget and stability programme update were inconsistent with the broad economic policy guidelines and issued this reprimand early in 2001.  However, in November 2001, the Council of Ministers lifted its earlier reprimand and stated: &quot;Unexpected economic developments were such that the inconsistency underlying the recommendation has lost its force.&quot;  This says much about the whole art, if it is one, of economic forecasting.  In fact, during the course of 2001, the international economic slowdown had gathered force arising from a number of factors, and economic activity in Ireland had declined sharply.  In fact, the year on year increase in real GDP in Ireland decelerated from 13.1% to 0.1% in the last quarter, thus the 2001 Irish budget was then seen in a different light in Brussels.  I shall also mention that, in 2001, there was much criticism of the EU reprimand, and not just from the Irish Government.  Many commentators, nationally and internationally, were critical of the EU stance.  As many referred to at the time, there appeared to be one set of rules for the larger countries, and a different book for the smaller member states.<br\/><br\/>On the issue of advice given to governments from many quarters, the Department of Finance, Central Bank, ESRI, OECD, European Union, IMF, and others, the line taken by all democratic governments is that it is just what it says on the tin, advice.  Democratically elected governments must, at all times, with their freedom, do what they consider best, in the interests of their people.  Yes, this means the ignoring of some advice and the taking of others.  I note with some wry amusement that the current Government, as is their right, seems to be steadfastly ignoring advice from a plethora of sources.  The fiscal advisory council, establish in law by the present Administration, are saying that the projections for growth, consumer spending and population are too optimistic.  Also being sidelined are commentaries from the ESRI, the European Commission, and the IMF, not to mention some domestic economists and commentators.<br\/><br\/>My high regard for the Department of Finance and the staff is well known and has been documented many times previously.  However, it is not a criticism when I note the very obvious.  Very few worthwhile initiatives of different political Administrations would never have seen the light of day if advice from the Department of Finance had been followed.  One of the most groundbreaking changes in Ireland was the introduction of free secondary education in the sixties by the late Donogh O'Malley.  This was done without the approval of Finance, and those of an historical bent know that the Department was so exercised, that it got its Minister, the late Jack Lynch, to formally complain to the Taoiseach.  Finance were totally unaware of the proposal, and O'Malley was, indeed, in contravention of Cabinet rules for making such a major announcement without informing his other colleagues, and, in particular, the Minister for Finance.  Wasn't it a good job for Ireland that Se&aacute;n Lemass ignored the yanks of the Department of Finance?<br\/><br\/>I look back on the advices from a number of the already mentioned sources.  For example, in 2002 the main theme seemed to be the threat of inflation, and there was little talk of housing prices, or that general area, in any of the commentary.  In fact, a leading economist was so concerned in 2002 on the slowdown, that he suggested the diverting of funds, of the annual contribution of the pension reserve fund, and putting that money into capital projects.  Some commentary always referred to the fact that we had &euro;1.5 million people between the age of 50 and 34, and that the demand for housing would continue to be very strong.  To illustrate, again, the futility of forecasting, I would draw attention to the 2000 report from the long-term issues group of the Department of Finance.  It predicted a total population of 4.1 million in 2056.  It's about 4.6 million today.  And that the Exchequer debt would be wiped out entirely by 2012.  During my time as Minister for Finance, I was painted as a right wing ideologue, possessed of a Scrooge-like parsimony when it came to public spending.  On the other hand, post the financial crisis, I've been turned into a kind of Santa Claus and the philosophy most often attributed to me by my detractors is supposedly encapsulated in the quote, &quot;When you have it, you spend it&quot;.  It is ironic that this comment was made on the publication, in November 2001, of the following year's departmental Estimates.  The headline in the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>on the following day was entitled, &quot;McCreevy takes the axe to public spending&quot;.  The first line of that article reads, &quot;Finance Minister Charlie McCreevy last night brought to a shuddering halt the big-spending era that went with the economic boom&quot;, end of the headline.  Later on, in that article, it refers to me saying, &quot;When you have it you spend it.  The mistake is to try to spend it when you haven't got it&quot;.  Now, however, I think it can be fairly said that the above actual comments of mine, when I was answering a question as to why I was reducing public spending, have been distorted and non-contextualised to an extraordinary degree.  The comment at that time attracted little attention but seems to have got a special lease of life during the economic downturn.  The reason for such misrepresentation ... well, to quote from another scribe, &quot;It might just be an interesting example of the way popular quotes get distorted over time to better fit the public perception of the person who made them&quot;.<br\/><br\/>I vigorously disagree with the assertion that the Government, during my term as Minister for Finance, misspent the proceeds of the stellar economic growth of that period.  We did increase spending in a large number of areas to make up for lost time, and for the under-provision of services in the previous decade and a half.  As a percentage of GNP, in 1986, Government expenditures stood at 58%, and Government debt at 122%.  At the end of 2003, the respective figures would have been 38% and 35%.  In respect of spending during my time in office, I've set out, in tabular form, the percentages for total Government expenditure and gross current expenditure.  These figures are taken from the public document Budget Statistics 2014, published by the Department of Finance.  The figures I quote are in respect of GNP and, of course, the percentage figures in terms of GDP would be lower.  In terms of GNP, gross Government ... gross current expenditure ... I'll leave ... the figures for Government expenditure are in a different column; I'll just refer to the gross current expenditure figures.  As a percentage of GNP, in 1997 it was 35.2%, and that relates to a previous Government of Fine Gael and Labour.  In 1998, for me, it was 31.7%; in 1999, it was 30.4%; in 2000, it was 28.1%; in 2001, it was 29.5%; in 2002, it was 30% even; in 2003, it was 29.8%; and in 2004, it was 29.8%.  No matter how these figures are interpreted, it is quite clear that there was no splurge over the period.  This was a period of considerable economic success.  The numbers for people at work increased massively; there was practical full employment; the scourge of forced emigration ceased after 150 years; we experienced the welcome new phenomenon of migration to Ireland; the population increased dramatically; we increased spending considerably in the areas of health, education and social welfare; the pension for the aged was increased to a proper level; child benefit more than doubled; and many other improvements in public services.  And, during all of those years, we ran substantial Exchequer surpluses, except for a small minus in one year.  This was achieved after paying for a massive public capital programme, the most visible example being the now excellent road network, and yet there was still a surplus.  We also set up the National Pensions Reserve Fund, setting aside most of the proceeds from the Telecom privatisation, and setting aside 1% of GNP annually.  This fund was intended not to be touched until after 2025, and was there to provide for future pension liabilities.  Since the recent financial downturn, critics are suggesting that we should not have spent all of this money.<\/p><p>So if we had spent less, it would have meant larger budget surpluses and some have gone on to say we should have built up further rainy day funds, apart from the pension reserve.  Now, are these people for real?  In a political democracy, it is especially difficult to run any kind of a budget surplus and many were even against the idea of the pension reserve fund.  It is difficult to run a surplus in a democracy.  If there was one patient untreated by the health services, one family without a house, one special needs person without proper services, one pay demand unmet, what justification would any Government have had for increasing the reserve fund and initiating further buffers?  Not alone would it be politically unacceptable but I suggest it would be morally wrong also.  The next theme of the committee refers to the property sector and, by implication, the question of tax incentives in that area.  Activity in the construction sector has always been a key driver of economic activity.  Despite the gains made in residential construction over the years, Ireland's housing stock is still below the EU average in units per 1,000 of population.  This is particularly obvious in 2015, which results in rents climbing substantially.  Furthermore, it has always been part of the Irish social culture for persons to actually own their own home.  This led the Government to initiate various reports of the housing market, which resulted in some changes.  Tax incentives for the property investment have been a feature of the Irish tax code for over 50 years.  As far as I can research there are incentives as far back as the 1959 Finance Act.  Some have sought to give the impression that the property tax incentives only really started after the '97 Government came into office.  However, if you look at the list of incentives by non-Fianna F&aacute;il-led Governments, you will find many others, such as urban renewal, seaside resorts, designated islands and many more.<br\/><br\/>My attitude to property tax incentives is summed up in my budget speech on the 2003 budget, when I was going about ending the deadline for some of the schemes.  I proposed ending many on 31 December 2004.  As I said in that speech &quot;the existing demand for property investment and the desire to improve equity in the tax system, there is no justification for a continuation of these reliefs beyond 2004&quot;.  Regarding the philosophy of property tax incentives, I stated &quot;I am a supporter of properly-focused, clearly defined, specific reliefs which can encourage the development of goods and services, including public services, which might otherwise not be provided, or where provided, are too little or too late.&quot;  So to conclude, quite recently an Irish commentator wrote the following:<blockquote>The reality is that economics is a social and not a physical science.  Economic outcomes are generally driven and shaped by human behaviour, and unfortunately human behaviour is rarely possible to predict with any degree of certainty.<\/blockquote>During my time as a student in University College Dublin, what is now the department of economics was then known as the faculty of political economy.  The longer I was in politics, the more I understood the accuracy of that old definition in UCD.

There is no ... in the words of a former Secretary General at Finance, still alive I know, there is no such thing as a departmental view of government.  There are only Ministers' views.  I am some time intrigued in recent times to read when politicians, and we all have done this, try to get out of trouble as to why something can't be done.  They come along and say the Department of Finance won't let us.  That's only a cop out.  If you convince the Minister for Finance - that's the person to go to and he can overrule his officials if it's a good enough case.  I am sure if you go back over my 27 years in the D&aacute;il when I was a backbencher, I perhaps used that as well.

In fact, I took a little liberty of going back and looking at Central Bank kind of commendations for the last 30 years or so and you'll nearly find the same thing in every report of a central bank in Ireland and elsewhere as well.  Central bankers are by nature, and rightly so, obliged to worry about things like inflation.  They'll always advise the Government to run surpluses if they can run surpluses and even when we had large indebtedness, they were saying back years ago \"well you shouldn't give any tax concessions at all and you should more or less cut down the public services entirely.\"<\/p><p>And Governments took some of that advice on board and trained their budgets, as I did in my time, in what I considered the best possible way and the proof of the pudding has been in the eating.

If you read the commentary in the newspapers and the Dail debates, everybody was concerned that the first-time buyer was being forced out of the market, and he or she couldn't get their foot on the first rung of a ladder, so the Minister for housing requested the Bacon report.

There was an interesting, very interesting D&aacute;il debates at the time.  The two main Opposition parties opposed it.  One of the Opposition parties was considerably against the interest ... the disallowance of interest deductibility.  And I remember him saying, and you can check the D&aacute;il debates, that all this would have unintended consequences.  So that was the effect of the first Bacon report.<\/p> <p>  Then we have the second Bacon report, and when the second Bacon report came out, prices had slowed down since 1998, but rents ... prices had gone down on houses, but rents had gone up 24% in Dublin and 17% in the rest of the country.  Apartment prices had gone up 24% and there were about 42,000 units completed that year.  Now, actually that report of second Bacon 2 praised the new student accommodation tax relief that I had in budget 1999.  And it also praised the new urban tax scheme for 43 towns cities that was in that time as well.  And then we had the Bacon No. 3 report that reported in June 2000.  And that report concluded firmly that rates of increase in prices on new and existing homes in Dublin were down sharply since 1998, and that's what the report said.  It also said that immigration of 200,000 to the country was expected over the next seven years, and this led to the Finance (No. 2) Bill of 2000, and that third Bacon report and the subsequent Finance (No. 2) Bill 2000, led to the introduction of the 2% anti-speculative tax, and tax of 2% of non-principal private residences.  Now, the interest deductibility and other changes were made subsequently, as Deputy Doherty has pointed out, and the reason for so doing was that we got a fair shock as to what was happening in the economy in 2001 into 2002.  As I referred to early in my address, growth had fallen off considerably.  There ... if you read the figures from the CIF and from the housing bodies, there was considerably less economic activity in the housing sector, or in the construction sector generally, and unemployment in that area was starting to rise, and that's why we reversed our approach on deductibility and the 2% anti - speculative tax did not take place.  It was ... we made redundant as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015070100002#QQ00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Charlie McCreevy"},{"type":"speech","time":1435705200,"counter":982,"content":"<p>And why did you scrap the ... the original question, why did you change your mind on the 2%?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015070100002#QQ00500","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1435705200,"counter":983,"content":"<p>Because I just said ... because we thought ... we believed at the time and the figures had borne it out, is that the effect of what we done in Bacon No. 1, in particular, was in danger of killing off the whole construction activity in the country and-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015070100002#QQ00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Charlie McCreevy"},{"type":"speech","time":1435705200,"counter":984,"content":"<p>So, it was to boost the construction activity?

I was the finance spokesperson for Fianna F&aacute;il to look at the whole area of our possible entry into the euro.  And the late Deputy Mitchell brought all types of views before the committee; people who were very for joining it, people who were against.  So we had a very robust discussion and no-one ... we learnt a lot while it was there and it worked.  We got very little headlines but actually it was very agreeing, so therefore all of the issues were thought about then.  When I, as Deputy Murphy has alluded to, I would have had concerns about us joining the euro, as most ... as a lot of people did.  Interesting enough, to show how ridiculous the economic succession is, our biggest, one of our biggest concerns at the time was that when we join the euro and our nearest neighbour wasn't joining.  That was the big issue at the time, that we were going to join the euro and knowing that the United Kingdom wasn't going to join.  Now it shows the development of the Irish economy since we joined the EU in 1973 that we were able to take that decision and consider it, knowing that our nearest neighbour, our biggest market, were not going to join.  And one of the biggest issues that we had at the committee was the fear that we would join the euro, that the rate for the Irish ... the euro versus sterling would go totally in the wrong direction for us.  And if you read some of the expert views we got done by many eminent economists who predicted that the Irish rate might go to &euro;1.10 - &euro;1.09, &euro;1.10.  Deputy Murphy will be aware that the total opposite occurred and we went in the other direction to as low as &euro;0.66, &euro;0.67.  So it goes to show what all the experts ... but when we ... when we ... when I became Minister for Finance then in 1997, I actually was the Minister responsible then for making the formal decision and it took place ... or the euro notes and coins didn't start till '02 but we joined from 1999.  And the major decision I had to make was at what rate we were going to join <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>the Deutsche mark and if I remember correctly, Ireland, when we devalued in '92-'93, we went to a rate, off the top of my head, the Deutsche mark from DM2.67 to DM2.41.  It was then that the Irish pound kept appreciating against the Deutsche mark in '96, '97 and '98 up along, and the rate was when we were going to join and I said ... we kept our counsel very ... our cards very close to our chest and I finally made the call and we joined I think at the rate was DM2.48667.

That's named after the Secretary General of the Department of the Taoiseach, Dermot McCarthy.  Can I just go back a little bit about this?  We decided in 1998 that we should have a single regulatory authority.  We set up the McDowell report to decide how this would be implemented.  Why did we want a single regulatory authority?  Well, I think if you read the early chapters of the McDowell report, it summarises very well the reasons for having a single regulatory authority, having it all in the one place, bringing all the supervision from different quarters.  Up until that, you had the Central Bank involved, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, you had the Department of Environment ... Local Government, now the Department of the Environment, you had different regulations to do with credit unions, you had all this all over the place.  So we thought the single regulatory authority was a good idea.  Mr. McDowell was asked to chair an implementation group that had nine people on it, from the Department of Finance, the Central Bank, the Department of the Taoiseach and others as well.  They came up with two reports, or two and a half reports; the majority came up with the single regulatory authority outside as an autonomous unit, outside of the Central Bank.  The minority alternative model, supported by the Finance person - Tom Considine I think it was at the time - and the representative of the Central Bank, I think it was Mr. Barron, came up with the alternative model to keep it located within the Central Bank.  And Dermot McCarthy, then subsequently had a slightly ... a variation of all that.  There were differences of opinion as to its location, there was not a difference of opinion about having a single regulatory authority.  The differences of opinion regarded where it should be located and constituted and that's what caused all the difficulty between us all.  And the D&aacute;il debates are very, very interesting.<\/p><p>Not alone was there a difference between the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, namely, the T&aacute;naiste, Mary Harney, and myself, but there was also a difference between the political parties.  Deputy Derek McDowell, who represented the Labour Party, was for the independent model advocated by McDowell.  Michael Noonan, who was then the spokesperson for Fine Gael, was for the model that we were for in finance, keep it within the Central Bank.  In fact, if you look at one of the D&aacute;il parliamentary question debates, you see where Michael Noonan has a funny aside with Derek McDowell and he says, &quot;So, you're a PD at heart&quot;, or something like that.  You can look up the D&aacute;il debate to see that.<br\/><br\/>So therefore, it wasn't anybody was coming at this from <i>mala fides <\/i>but there was a difference of opinion and as I said in my witness statement, over Europe and further afield, there was not a universal way of doing this.  Other countries had different ways of doing this.  So finally, we came around and we came up with this compromise solution which I would term more &quot;the Dermot McCarthy kind of solution&quot; which had this overarching body, the Central Bank of Ireland self-regulatory authority and within that, we had the regulatory authority known as IFSRA, and we combined the two bodies together.<br\/><br\/>Now, subsequent to the economic collapse, as I said also in my opening statement, people have gone back to having it all within the Central Bank.  And by the way, the United Kingdom, in 1997, were also in the process of diversifying out as well and reverting and they also have gone back, more or less, to a single model as well.  So, it's not that anybody came this from <i>mala fides<\/i>including the politicians, it's just that there was an agreement on all this and how to reach it.  So, that's how we came about it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015070100002#TT02700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Charlie McCreevy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1435705200,"counter":1093,"content":"<p>Thank you for that.

You might go out and buy a refrigerator, buy a Chinese on a Saturday night, or take a holiday on it, but you don't plan your week to week current expenditure upon overtime.

Well, the only other thing that I can suggest to you is that you impose more taxation, lessen the amount you're spending on public services, withdraw thousands of people from the public service, and, like, what would that do?  And, by the way, other studies have been done which say if you were to have counter-cyclical measures that would maybe have an effect of maybe of a quarter of a percent on the harmonised inflationary index, you'd have to take about the best order of &euro;5 billion out of the economy.  That's not realistic in those years.  What we did in my last two budgets, I lessened considerably, as I gave my figures earlier, to the amount of tax change ... the tax package.

It's a desire that is very well worthwhile, that we'd have the same principles for accounting worldwide.  Americans use US GAAP,  that's general accounting accepted principles.  Irish and UK used to use Irish GAAP.  And there always has been a move since the 60s to try and have an internationally accepted standard the way we look at accounts, whether it be in Australia, America, Ireland, whatever, you'd be interpreting the same thing.  The IASB, the International Accounting Standards Board, was set up in the 60s and it's funded from a variety of independent sources. They started to produce then IAS standards over the years.  The European Commission decided in 2002 that they would endorse IFRS the new standards - International Financial Reporting Standards.  And the European Commission, even though not a member of the IASB, which is totally independent, adopted all these particular standards, and public companies had to apply these IFRS standards as and from, I think the accounts starting January 2007.<\/p><p>Those particular standards, some people ... those particular standards generally use mark-to-market.  They all said there were some difficulties over standards, IAS2 and 39.  And all these difficulties, some people would say, is that ... contributed somewhat to the financial crisis internationally but Ireland ... Ireland was ... Ireland was the one country, the same as all the other member states, bar one, who had ... who implemented exactly what the new regulation was.  So the accounting professionals have been before the ... before the committee here, but they were doing their accounts on the basis of IFRS and there are certainly some anomalies in the IFRS standards which may have contributed globally to some of the financial problems and particularly in the EU.  But that's a matter you can discuss with some accountants rather than me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015070100002#NNN01800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Charlie McCreevy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1435705200,"counter":1415,"content":"<p>On the wrap-up question then, well how did so many accountants and central bankers and, indeed, the bankers themselves, land us in so much trouble?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015070100002#OOO00200","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1435705200,"counter":1416,"content":"<p>I think, Deputy, we ...

I mentioned earlier about low interest rate policies but if I can say one thing about ... I said competition among the banks, which we all thought, in Ireland, was a very good thing.  And, as you rightly have ... over your long career as an academic have advocated competition, and competition is a good thing, but in certain areas, too much competition can be a very bad thing because you can't compete to the lower base, financial products being one of them.  Auditing on price can be a bad thing as well because you can compete all the time on price for auditing ... you may end up with a very, very low base.  So, therefore, competition has been recognised as being a very good thing and, as you well know, all of my political career I have been pro-competition, but in certain areas it can lead to these problems and, as I said earlier, the competition, not alone among Irish banks, but banks from the outside contributed to the lessening of credit standards being applied by banks.<\/p> <p>  And one final thing, may I say, if I was to ... from my experience in Brussels, and looking across what happened in the financial sector throughout Europe and throughout the world, the remuneration policies of financial institutions have led, in my view, to a lot of these difficulties.  Very ... we'll make it very simple, here is bank A over here, led by a very conservative chairman, chief executive, lending officers etc., in business for 60 years, doing a nice ... doing a nice dividend at the end of the year for their shareholders.  Along comes bank B over here, bright new sparks, new chief executive, incentivisation and bonus shares etc. etc.  Profits keep going up and up and up.  Every year at their annual meeting, old Mr. Fogey over here, \"Why aren't your profits going up and up compared to bank B over here?\"  What happens, out is turfed conservative Mr. A and his team.  In come a whole lot of new whizz kids anyway and they're going to compete for more and more business, because they are being remunerated on results.  And everybody's being remunerated on results, including the Government.  The Government is being remunerated because they're going to get increased taxation and corporate taxation plus PAYE etc. etc.  The shareholders are going to get more and more dividends.  The employees are going to get more wages and more salaries and more bonuses baked in share schemes.  And this cycle keeps going.  And if you were to look across the world, not just Ireland, you will see that is one common denominator.

By the way, I know that in some of the earlier evidence of the committee is that the Department contended after my 2003, 2004 budgets, is that the line Departments were complaining that I had left them at least &euro;2.1 billion short in the moneys that they needed to provide for existing services.  I accept that as well because I went in 2003 and 2004 in very, very heavily on Departments in order to get back to a better baseline for the future.  That's what I did.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015070100002#CCCC00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Charlie McCreevy"},{"type":"speech","time":1435705200,"counter":1667,"content":"<p>Is that why you were sent to Brussels?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015070100002#CCCC00800","speaker":"993"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1435705200,"counter":1668,"content":"<p>You're a member of my party, Deputy.
