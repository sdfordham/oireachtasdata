The Government&rsquo;s economic policy has led to economic recovery and a resumption of economic growth. This has provided the fiscal resources to provide for a sustainable and fair recovery in public service payscales.<\/p>  <p>  Defence Forces pay is increasing in accordance with public sector pay agreements.  The focus of these increases is weighted in favour of those on lower pay.  Members of the Permanent Defence Force have received the pay increases due under the Lansdowne Road Agreement.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, following negotiations with PDFORRA on behalf of their members, improved payscales for general service recruits and privates who joined the Permanent Defence Force post 1 January 2013, were backdated to 1 July 2016 and paid in August 2017.<\/p>  <p>  The Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 provides for further\u00a0increases in pay ranging from 6.2% to 7.4% over the lifetime of the Agreement with the focus of the agreement once again being on the lower paid.<\/p>  <p>  Both RACO and PDFORRA attended the negotiations which led to the Agreement, which were held under the auspices of the Workplace Relations Commission.  They were afforded equal standing to other public sector trade unions and representative associations during the negotiations.<\/p>  <p>  A 1% in annualised salaries due from 1 January 2018 was included in the weekly pay for enlisted personnel on 7 February 2018.  The increase is being applied to officers monthly salaries in the February payments.<\/p>  <p>  Following these revisions in pay, the\u00a0starting pay for\u00a0a newly qualified three star private, and their Naval Service equivalent,\u00a0(inclusive of military service allowance) is\u00a0&euro;27,257,\u00a0gross annual\u00a0earnings,\u00a0with scope for further income from duty allowances.  This is a significant increase on the &euro;21,800 per annum which was the annual amount prior to the implementation of the\u00a0increases in pay received through recent pay agreements.<\/p>  <p>  The starting pay for\u00a0a Corporal, including Military Service Allowance, is over\u00a0&euro;37,000 per annum.  The first point on the payscale for a Sergeant, including Military Service Allowance, is\u00a0&euro;40,000 per annum.<\/p>  <p>A newly qualified non-graduate entry 2nd   Lieutenant can expect a minimum of &euro;35,000 (inclusive of military service allowance) per annum after 15 months of training, while a graduate entry Lieutenant can expect a minimum of &euro;40,000 per annum (inclusive of military service allowance) after 15 months of training.<\/p>  <p>  In 2017, under my direction, the Department of Defence raised recruitment and retention issues as part of the submission to the Public Service Pay Commission. In a further acknowledgement of these issues the Government tasked the Public Service Pay\u00a0Commission with examining\u00a0these challenges in the Defence Sector in more detail.<\/p>  <p>  The Public Service Pay Commission has commenced this work and has requested detailed information from the Department of Defence.  Defence management are preparing their submission\u00a0which will be sent to the Commission in the coming weeks. \u00a0I understand that both PDFORRA and RACO have made submissions to the Commission.<\/p>  <p>  The Public Service Pay Commission is due to complete this exercise in the second half of 2018.

In that regard, among the roles assigned to the Defence Forces in the White Paper on Defence (2015) is the provision of ATCP which, in practice, means to provide assistance and support to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when requested to do so. There is on-going and close liaison between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces regarding security matters, including ATCP deployments and a wide variety of military training activities are specifically designed to counter or respond to possible security emergencies. Regular coordination and liaison meetings also take place between the Defence Forces and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to ATCP issues. The Defence Forces also participate in counter-terrorism training initiatives with international forces on an on-going basis.<\/p>  <p>  I also wish to assure you that the Defence Forces retain a wide range of specialist skills and equipment. The full spectrum of Defence Forces personnel and equipment are available for deployment in response to any emergencies that may arise. The Operations Directorate in Defence Forces Headquarters manages the necessary cross-service coordination in responding to requests for support. These arrangements have proved effective in all emergencies encountered to date.<\/p>  <p>  The acquisition of new equipment for the Defence Forces remains a clear focus for me. Future equipment priorities for the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service is considered in the context of the White Paper on Defence as part of the capability development and equipment priorities planning process and I wish to assure you that significant investment in equipment is taking place in the coming years in this context. <\/p>  <p>  With regard to training, the primary function of training and education in the Defence Forces is to develop and maintain the necessary capabilities. The Defence Forces deliver military training programmes and modules meeting national and international standards. They also engage with external educational institutions in order to facilitate organisational learning. This engagement with national and international educational institutions, military and civilian, aims to ensure that the Defence Forces retain currency with regards to best international practice and employ all relevant modern training methods.<\/p>  <p>  I am committed to ensuring that the personnel of the Defence Forces continue to be equipped and trained to best international standards and I can confirm that the Defence Forces keep their operational plans and response capabilities for dealing with a wide range of threats under constant review. I am satisfied that the Defence Forces are equipped and resourced to respond, as appropriate, to any such events were they to occur in this State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030600058#WRB02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Search and Rescue Service Provision","counter":34,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030600058#WRB03000"},{"type":"question","counter":35,"qnumday":35,"qnumall":"[10730\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030600058#WRB03100","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the extent to which the Air Corps and the Naval Service continue to co-operate in air and sea rescue missions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":36,"content":"<p>The Defence Organisation provides a broad range of services in accordance with its primary security role while it also undertakes a diverse range of non security related tasks.<\/p>  <p>  With reference to Search and Rescue, since 2004 the Irish Coast Guard has overall responsibility for the provision of Search and Rescue services within the Irish Search and Rescue region.

The barbarity of the attacks by the Syrian regime on its own people, the deliberate targeting of civilian infrastructure, including homes, hospitals and schools, and the refusal of the Assad regime to allow humanitarian aid in, or injured civilians to leave, has been shocking, even by the standards of the Syria conflict to date. I can only imagine how terrifying this is for the people there, who have no way to protect themselves or their children, and no way to leave.   On numerous occasions in this House, I have condemned the violence in Syria and I reiterate that condemnation in the strongest terms today.<\/p>  <p>  I attended a UN Security Council briefing on this issue in New York two weeks ago, where UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres appealed for an immediate suspension of violence in Eastern Ghouta to allow for the delivery of humanitarian aid, and for evacuations. Ireland strongly endorsed this call. <\/p>  <p>  I welcome the adoption of a UN Security Council resolution that called for an immediate ceasefire and unimpeded humanitarian access. However, the bombardment of Eastern Ghouta has continued in defiance of this resolution. The international community must redouble its efforts to press for a full and immediate ceasefire, and unhindered humanitarian access to besieged populations in Syria. <\/p>  <p>  EU Foreign Ministers discussed the situation in Syria at their informal meeting on 15 February and again at the Foreign Affairs Council meeting on 26 February where Ireland added its voice to calls for the immediate and full implementation of the ceasefire demanded by the UN Security Council.  <\/p>  <p>  Ireland has consistently supported EU sanctions targeting the regime and its supporters, and will continue to do so as long as the situation on the ground justifies these measures. <\/p>  <p>  Ultimately, a long term, sustainable, Syrian-owned and Syrian-led solution to this conflict is needed. Ireland fully supports the UN-led political negotiations to end the conflict based on the 2012 Geneva Communique and UN Security Council resolution 2254, which call for an end to violence; full humanitarian access, a democratic political transition and accountability and transitional justice.<\/p>  <p>  The EU provides direct assistance to the UN-brokered talks in Geneva and has launched, in coordination with the UN, an initiative to develop political dialogue with key actors from the region to identify common ground. <\/p>  <p>  The EU and its Member States have to date mobilised more than &euro;10.4 billion for humanitarian, stabilisation and resilience assistance inside Syria and in neighbouring countries, making the EU the largest single donor to the effort.

In 2018, the UN estimates that $7.9 billion is required to meet the needs of the most vulnerable within Syria and across the region &ndash; the highest appeal worldwide for a single crisis.    Ireland is committed to providing ongoing humanitarian assistance in response to the Syria crisis and has contributed over &euro;90 million to the international humanitarian response since 2012, including over &euro;25 million in 2017.

The publication last week by the European Commission of a draft Withdrawal Agreement is fully in line with this mandate.

This is a default and will only be triggered if the commitments made by the UK in phase one cannot be delivered through the wider future relationship agreement or specific solutions. <\/p><p>It is intended that the eventual Withdrawal Agreement will also include transition arrangements, the draft legal text on which is separately under negotiation between the EU and UK.  Appropriate transitional arrangements would be hugely important for Ireland in giving certainty to individuals and businesses.

The methodology adopted to assess levels of disadvantage in schools is based on centrally held data with a uniform application across the entire school system to assess levels of disadvantage in Primary and Post-Primary schools. <\/p><p>A detailed document explaining the methodology used in the Identification process is available on the Department&rsquo;s website at<\/p><p><i>www.education.ie\/en\/Schools-Colleges\/Services\/DEIS-Delivering-Equality-of-Opportunity-in-Schools-\/DEIS-Identification-Process.pdf.<\/i><\/p><p>The concentration of disadvantage varies significantly between schools. It is important to note that the Department's assessment is not based on the location of the school but on the CSO small areas statistics from which a school derives its pupil cohort. Accordingly, the demographics of neighbouring schools can differ in terms of assessed levels of need which are based on the pupil cohort within each school.<\/p><p>It should be noted that the additional funding due to the\u00a0school under DEIS is based on the identified level of disadvantage of the school.  The amount of DEIS funding due to the school has been allocated for the current school year in addition to all basic funding to which this school is entitled.<\/p><p>An update of the identification model\u00a0is currently underway.  This will take account of updated school data as provided by schools for the current school\u00a0year combined with the\u00a0Pobal HP Index of Deprivation, based on\u00a0CSO Small Area Population statistics\u00a0derived from\u00a0the 2016 National Census.

Substantial research, analysis, consultation with service users and stakeholders, and piloting have gone in to the development of this model and all of the evidence points to the fact that this new system will deliver better outcomes for children. \u00a0<\/p><p>No school, has lost supports as a result of the implementation of the new model. In addition, no school received an allocation, for the support of pupils with complex needs, less than the allocation they received to support such pupils during the 2016\/17 school year. \u00a0<\/p><p>An\u00a0additional 900 teaching posts\u00a0have been provided to support the introduction of this new allocation model.  The provision of an additional 900 teaching posts is a very significant investment in the provision of additional\u00a0teaching support for pupils with special educational needs in our schools. \u00a0<\/p><p>The additional funding provided additional supports to over 1300 schools who identified as needing additional supports as a result of the new model while ensuring that no school received a reduced allocation.<\/p><p>The new funding will ensure that all schools receive a sufficient allocation\u00a0of special education needs resources to provide additional teaching support to all pupils, including pupils who have yet to enrol in their school, who require such support.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>In relation to the school referred to by the Deputy, the profiling model had indicated a profiled special educational need for this school of 45 teaching hours.\u00a0<\/p><p>However, as no school received an allocation, on the introduction of the new model, which was less than the allocation they received in the previous school year, the school maintained an allocation of 46.03 hours and it was indicated that within this allocation there was a retained element of 1.03 hrs. \u00a0<\/p><p>The new Special Education Teaching allocation provides a single unified allocation for special educational support teaching needs to each school, based on each school&rsquo;s educational profile.<\/p><p>Under the new allocation model, schools\u00a0have been\u00a0provided with a total allocation for special education needs support based on their school profile. \u00a0<\/p><p>Included within this is an allocation for: <\/p><p>- A school educational profile component; which includes:<\/p><p>- An allocation for pupils with complex needs<\/p><p>- The learning support needs in schools as evidenced by attainment levels in standardised test results <\/p><p>-The social context of the school including disadvantage and gender\u00a0<\/p><p>- Baseline component provided to every mainstream school to support inclusion, prevention of learning difficulties and early intervention. <\/p><p>The provision of a profiled allocation is designed to give a fairer allocation for each school which recognises that all schools need an allocation for special needs support, but which provides a graduated allocation which takes into account the actual level of need in each school.<b><\/b><\/p><p>It is\u00a0acknowledged and accepted that schools will have some additional pupils with special educational needs enrolling to their school subsequent to the profiles having been developed. <\/p><p>However, for the most part these will be balanced by the fact that some students who had additional teaching needs in the previous year will have left the school.  The baseline is also designed to ensure that schools have some capacity to provide additional support to pupils. <\/p><p>Where a school profile significantly changes following the allocation process e.g. a developing school where the net enrolment numbers significantly increase year on year additional allocations may be made.\u00a0<\/p><p>The criteria for qualification for mainstream school developing school posts are set out in DES Circular 17\/2017 (Primary School Staffing Schedule) and DES 10,11,12\/2017 (Post Primary School Staffing Schedule).<\/p><p>Schools who qualified for additional mainstream developing school posts in accordance with these criteria also qualified for additional Special Education Teaching Allocations to take account of this developing status. <\/p><p>It is also acknowledged that there will be some schools where exceptional circumstances may arise.\u00a0<\/p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) will be available to support schools where schools have developed and implemented appropriate plans for the deployment of their special education needs teaching resources, but the school considers that further support may be required. This support may involve Continuing Professional Development or further training for school staff, advice in relation to the support plans that are in place, and possibly a review process once schools can clearly demonstrate that exceptional circumstances have arisen in the school.\u00a0<\/p><p>The NCSE has also\u00a0now published details of how schools can seek a review of their allocations, including the utilisation of their allocations, in circumstances where a school considers that very exceptional circumstances have arisen subsequent to the development of the profile.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>Should schools consider that they fulfil the criteria for a review on the grounds of exceptional circumstances, details of this review process are available at: <\/p><p><i>. <\/i><\/p><p>The NCSE has\u00a0advised that the school referred to by the Deputy has\u00a0made an application to the NCSE for a review on this basis.  The NCSE considered this application and has advised that following a review of the application submitted by the school, the NCSE has concluded that the school does not fulfil the criteria for review, in accordance with the qualification criteria set out for the scheme.<\/p><p>The reason advised for this is that requests for reviews based on comparisons between allocations under the new allocation model, and the previous allocation model, or consideration of the allocations that may have applied to schools had the previous allocation model stayed in place, if certain factors such as new assessments arising subsequent to the new allocations being made to schools were considered, do not qualify as a basis for review under this process.<\/p><p>A review on the grounds of exceptional circumstances arising should only be conducted where the school profile changes very significantly, beyond which the school profile is provided to cater for, or where very exceptional circumstances have arisen in a school beyond a schools capacity to provide additional teaching support once their allocations are utilised effectively.<\/p><p>The NCSE has advised, however, that they will be in a position to provide additional guidance or support for this school and to discuss any issues which the school may have in managing their available resources, and to assist the school in managing the utilisation of their allocation to support all children who need additional teaching support in the school, should the school wish to avail of such support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030600060#WRD02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects Status","counter":139,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030600060#WRD02500"},{"type":"question","counter":140,"qnumday":76,"qnumall":"[10490\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030600060#WRD02600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the status of the new secondary school for Monasterevin, County Kildare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1257","askee":"1293"},{"type":"question","counter":141,"qnumday":77,"qnumall":"[10491\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030600060#WRD02700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the reason there have been delays in securing a new second level school for Monasterevin, County Kildare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1257","askee":"1293"},{"type":"question","counter":142,"qnumday":83,"qnumall":"[10689\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018030600060#WRD02800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 206 of 20 February 2018, when the tendering process will begin; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1257","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":143,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 76, 77 and 83 together.<\/p><p>The building project for the school to which the Deputy refers is at an advanced stage of architectural planning, Stage 2b &ndash; Detailed Design, which includes the applications for Planning Permission, Fire Cert and Disability Access Cert and the preparation of tender documents.

An outcome from this meeting was the establishment of a Working Group comprising representatives from DG Competition, the Department of Business, Enterprise&amp;amp; Innovation, Enterprise Ireland and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  The objective of the Group is to scope and design schemes to support enterprises impacted by Brexit in line with State Aid rules.  The Working Group has met three times and in between these meetings, there has been engagement on specific issues in order to continue to progress matters.  Should issues arise that require an approach that does not fit within the existing State Aid rules, this will be raised as part of the Working Group discussions.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is carrying out extensive work to prepare for all Brexit eventualities. Informed by detailed research, my Department is  putting in place a package of measures that will allow us to respond to the needs of businesses including the Brexit Loan Scheme which was announced in Budget 2018 which will provide affordable working capital financing to eligible businesses that are either currently impacted by Brexit or will be in the future.<\/p>  <p>  The recent signing of the counter guarantee from the EIB group (through its InnovFin Guarantee) means that the &euro;24 million exchequer funding announced in the 2018 Budget (&euro;14 million from my Department and &euro;9 million from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine) can be leveraged to provide a fund of &euro;300 million. The Brexit Loan Scheme will be open to businesses of fewer than 500 employees which can demonstrate that they are significantly exposed to the impact (or potential impact) of Brexit.

The Court ruled that the Commission was incorrect in calculating the annual levies set for the period in question.  The Court also found that the method used by the Commission to fix the levies was incorrect because it led to an over-estimation of the costs to be covered and consequently overcharged to Greencore and the growers.  The levies for the marketing years in question, set by EU Regulation, provided for a self-financing system for the sugar sector by means of flexible production levies.  Under EU Regulations the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector was based on the operation of a quota system on the principle that producers should bear full financial responsibility for the losses incurred each marketing year due to disposing of surplus sugar over the production quota allocated. <\/p>  <p>  A new Council Regulation (EU) 2018\/264 fixing the production levies and the coefficient for calculating the additional levy in the sugar sector for the 1999\/2000 marketing year and fixing the production levies in the sugar sector for the 2000\/2001 marketing year, giving effect to the Court decision, were recently approved by the Council of Agriculture Ministers.

The Beef Data and Genetics Programme (BDGP) is the main support specifically targeted for the suckler sector, which provides Irish beef farmers with some 300 million euro in funding over the current Rural Development Programme (RDP) period. <\/p>  <p>  This scheme, which was introduced in accordance with the provisions of Article 28 EU Regulation 1305\/2013, is an agri-environmental measure to improve the environmental sustainability of the national suckler herd by increasing genetic merit within the herd. So far under this programme approximately 135 million euro has been paid out to farmers and this Government will continue to support this programme through the lifetime of the current RDP.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to existing funding, under Pillar II of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) my Department has rolled out a range of schemes as part of the 4 billion euro Rural Development Programme (RDP), 2014 - 2020. In addition to the BDGP, other supports which are available for suckler farmers under Pillar II of the CAP include GLAS, ANCs and Knowledge Transfer Groups. Suckler farmer also benefit from the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS) and Greening payments under CAP Pillar I.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to any potential funding over and above existing supports to farmers under the current CAP, I again stress:<\/p>  <p>  There are no surplus funds available within the RDP above and beyond the funding already allocated, which has been committed to existing schemes within the RDP. Therefore, any additional supports under the RDP would require cuts to other RDP schemes and \/or additional exchequer funding.\u00a0 RDP schemes, including the existing BDGP are based on costs incurred and income foregone by participants. Every scheme, or scheme adjustment, under the RDP must be justified and approved by the European Commission on the basis of additional actions and income foregone by farmers.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Any allocation of funding under Pillar I of the CAP for a coupled payment would in principle require a linear reduction to all existing farmers Basic Payment Scheme payments for redistribution. <\/p>  <p>  I am not of the view that taking already committed money from farmers under the CAP is an appropriate means by which to support suckler farmers.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to the Animal Welfare, Recording and Breeding Scheme for Suckler Herds which was operated between 2008 and 2012, its objectives were to improve breeding by recording animal events data and make better use of genetic evaluation. It also aimed to improve husbandry and weaning to reduce illness and mortality. The scheme was developed to provide training under Article 15 Provision of technical support in the Agriculture Sector of Commission Regulation 1857\/2006 for participants of the Suckler Welfare Scheme. The Scheme was successful in meeting its objectives.<\/p>  <p>  Any attempt to introduce a similar exchequer funded scheme which has the aim of improving the genetic merit and the welfare of the suckler herd would require approval by the European Commission under State Aid regulations and would need to comply with our obligations under WTO rules. The fact that a scheme, the Beef Data Genomics Programme (BDGP), with similar aims already exists would be a complicating factor in seeking State Aid approval.<\/p>  <p>  The introduction of such an additional scheme funded directly from exchequer funds, would in any event not be possible under the current budgetary resources available to my Department. I am strongly of the view that the current range of supports available to suckler farmers is the most appropriate way to support the continued development of the sector which according to the Teagasc National Farm survey for 2016 received support equivalent to approximately 500 euro per suckler cow.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  I will continue to argue for as strong a CAP budget as possible, post 2020.

These new rules were implemented from July 2017.  In general all placements will now be for one year only - if a CE participant is undertaking training to achieve a major award, their time can be extended by up to 2 year to allow them to complete the training which will enhance their overall employment prospects. This allows for 3 years continuous participation on CE.  Those over 55 years of age can also remain on CE for three years.

The purpose of this payment is to assist these households with their energy costs.  The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household.  It is not intended to meet those costs in full.  Only one allowance is paid per household.    In October 2017, I introduced the option for qualified households to receive their fuel allowance payment in two lump sums - in October and in January.  This allows people to buy fuel in bulk and potentially avail of special offers or discounts on the purchase of the particular fuel that meets their specific needs. <\/p>  <p>  In Budget 2018, I increased the duration of the fuel allowance season by one week to 27 weeks.  This is clearly longer than the winter period in Ireland, and provides assistance during what are largely colder weeks, when heating costs are expected to be at their highest.  The current fuel allowance season will, therefore run to the first week in April.<\/p>  <p>  Given the severity of the weather in recent days, last week I announced that all people in receipt of the Fuel Allowance will receive an extra payment of &euro;22.50 in respect of this week.<\/p>  <p>  This is to ensure our customers can be safe and warm at this time.  The additional payment will be paid automatically during the week commencing 12th March and will bring Fuel Allowance payment to &euro;45 that week.  The extra payment of &euro;22.50 will also be paid to those who have received the Fuel Allowance in lump sum payments.<\/p>  <p>  Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, exceptional needs payments may be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost which customers are unable to meet out of their own resources and this may include exceptional heating costs.<\/p>  <p>  The best way to tackle fuel poverty in the long term is to improve the energy efficiency of the dwelling.

It provides part-time temporary work in local communities, as a stepping-stone back to employment.  However, it is important to note that these placements are not full-time sustainable jobs and are designed to break the cycle of unemployment and maintain work readiness, thereby improving a person&rsquo;s opportunities of returning to the labour market or getting a job for the first time.  The scheme commenced operation in 2011 as a response to the high level of unemployment and the large numbers on the Live Register at that time.  There are 47 Local Development Companies (LDCs), as well as &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, involved in the delivery of the T&uacute;s programme - known as Implementing bodies (IBs).  The Deputy will appreciate that the reduction in the unemployment rate is a factor in recruitment to all programmes.  Long-term unemployment is expected to fall further this year in line with the continuing forecasted fall in overall unemployment. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that given the welcome improvements in the labour market in recent years with reducing numbers of long-term unemployed on the Live Register, which is the target cohort for T&uacute;s, it is proving difficult to fill the number of places available nationwide.  However, changes were introduced recently to the selection criteria for T&uacute;s which should broaden the availability of T&uacute;s to a greater number of people on the live register.
