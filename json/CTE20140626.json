I have been trying to get to the bottom of what safeguards are in place for taxpayers' money regarding the running of elections and serious concerns have been brought to me that not all returning officers have followed tendering guidelines and rules for obtaining equipment such as tables and chairs for polling stations and count centres, which comes to a significant amount of money.  There is also an issue with regard to how items are invoiced and what documentation is provided.  I raised a parliamentary question to the Minister of the Environment, Community and Local Government on 19 June but it was disallowed by the Ceann Comhairle, which is fine.  He stated the Minister was not accountable to the House.  The note obtained by the clerk clearly states the OPW is the responsible body with regard to the expenditure of funds.  The note is helpful but it does not answer the specific question.  We need, in tabular form, a list of the returning officers, whether they tendered for the purchase or use of equipment during the election, what were the amounts of the tender and what was the amount spent by each returning officer for the local and European elections.  This information should not be impossible to get, but trying to get to the bottom of it has become like trying to discover the third secret of Fatima.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014062600003#B00300","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"speech","time":1403773200,"counter":8,"content":"<p>The Accounting Officer for the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government is here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014062600003#B00400","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speech","time":1403773200,"counter":9,"content":"<p>It is not the responsible Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014062600003#B00500","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"speech","time":1403773200,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I understand that, but perhaps the Deputy could start by fleshing out the issue and afterwards, if it is still not to his satisfaction, we can pursue it with the appropriate Accounting Officer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014062600003#B00600","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speech","time":1403773200,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I am agreeable to that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014062600003#B00700","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"speech","time":1403773200,"counter":12,"content":"<p>The best approach is probably to start a discussion with the Secretary General.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014062600003#B00800","speaker":"1067"},{"type":"speech","time":1403773200,"counter":13,"content":"<p>If it is not complete we can follow up on it.

This was down almost 22% on the 2011 spend.  The most significant reduction year-on-year related to the contribution from the Vote to the Local Government Fund.  This fell from &euro;175 million in 2011 to nil in 2012.  Other significant expenditure reductions year-on-year included spending on the water services investment programme, which fell by &euro;82 million or 23% and spending on local authority housing, which fell by &euro;56 million or 17%.  There was a net surplus on the Vote at the end of 2012 amounting to &euro;126 million.<\/p> <p>This was all liable for surrender back to the Exchequer but capital funding of &euro;43 million not spent in 2012 was carried over to 2013 with the approval of the Minister for Finance.  Such capital funding carryovers are a regular feature of Vote 25.  The remainder of the 2012 surplus was duly surrendered.<br\/>The appropriation account records the final disposal in 2012 of electronic voting equipment and I have briefly outlined the circumstances in chapter 4.  Between 2001 and 2013, a total of almost &euro;55 million was spent on the purchase, storage and associated costs of the electronic voting equipment.  The cost of buying the equipment was borne by the Central Fund of the Exchequer, where the bulk of election expenses are charged.  However, the Central Fund does not have a balance sheet so the equipment was carried as fixed assets in the environment Vote balance sheet.  The equipment was only used on a pilot basis and a decision was taken in 2009 to dispose of it.  Following an EU-wide open tender competition, the equipment, which had a book value of &euro;24.5 million, was sold for just under &euro;70,000 in June 2012.  That sum was transferred to the Exchequer.<br\/>Chapter 10 presents an overview of the level of central Government funds provided to local authorities and the purposes for which those funds are provided.  Relevant information has to be drawn together from a number of accounts in order to get a full picture of the transfers and of trends over time.  In 2012, central Government funds provided to local authorities totalled approximately &euro;2.9 billion.  The graph on the screen indicates that the local government fund, Vote 25 for environment and Vote 31 for transport provided the bulk of the funding.  In the past, the local government fund was financed mainly by motor tax receipts and the annual Exchequer contribution.  As I have already mentioned, the Exchequer contribution was ended in 2012.  Instead, the proceeds of the household charge payable by owners of residential property resulted in nearly &euro;114 million being paid into the fund.  The household charge was replaced in turn by the local property tax.  The local government fund will be Exchequer-funded <i>pro rata<\/i>the proceeds of the tax from 2014.  There has been a substantial reduction in the level of central Government transfers to local authorities since 2008, when the transfers peaked at around &euro;5.8 billion.  A graph in the documentation shows that the contraction has affected all areas funded by central government, which tended mainly to be in support of capital spending.  The result of the reduction in central support for capital investment is particularly evident when trends in local authority spending are examined.  Across local authorities, capital spend dropped by almost two thirds between 2007 and 2011, which is the latest year available at the time I was reporting.  On the other hand, current spending has reduced moderately.<br\/>Chapter 11 presents the findings of a review of the costs of land remediation.  At the time of the report, there were 34 sites identified where it is necessary to remove waste or to nullify contaminants in the soil or ground water.  This contamination may be due to illegal dumping, inadequate management of licensed dumping facilities, pollution effects from current economic activity or residual impacts of previous economic activity.  Such events result in economic costs, which it is generally expected would be managed on a &quot;polluter pays&quot; basis but which in many cases fall to be met initially by public bodies.  There is also a risk of the State being fined by the EU Commission if such sites are not cleaned up.<br\/>Overall, remediation costs incurred by public bodies up to June 2013 were almost &euro;119 million, with further expected costs for the identified sites that may exceed &euro;66 million.  Whereas there are legal options to recover costs from polluters, this may be difficult in practice and may also be costly in itself.  The Department has indicated that there has been limited recovery of cost from those responsible for unlicensed sites but that legal proceedings are under way in a number of cases.  The remediation of land at any site is generally a long-term project, spanning several accounting periods.  Accordingly, I consider that it should be accounted for in a similar manner to the accounting for capital investment projects.  This should include the disclosure of the estimated contingent liability, the contracted commitments details of the amount spent to date and the amount spent in the current report period.  I also consider that funding from multiple State sources for the same clean-up project should be disclosed in a single primary disclosure note so that the full cost of remediation of a site can be readily identified.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014062600005#D01500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1403775000,"counter":96,"content":"<p>Deputy John McGuinness resumed the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1403775000,"counter":97,"content":"<p>Overall, remediation costs incurred by public bodies up to June 2013 were almost &euro;119 million, with further expected costs for the identified sites that may exceed &euro;66 million.

As requested, I have provided some advance briefing for the meeting and I will therefore keep my opening comments short.<br\/>The Department had significant achievements in 2012 in delivering on key policies and programmes from within available resources in order to contribute to improving the quality of life of citizens and communities; to economic and social development; and to environmental protection.  We were again assigned the second largest capital allocation of any Department in order to implement major housing, water, rural development and other programmes.  Total spending from the Vote on the various housing programmes, including the provision of social housing and improvement and regeneration measures, amounted to over &euro;670 million in 2012.<br\/>The ongoing restructuring of the social housing investment programme delivered 1,259 units through leasing, and 5,451 new rental accommodation scheme transfers took place in 2012 at an overall cost of just over &euro;146 million.  In addition, over 1,800 new and refurbished social accommodation units were delivered through local authorities and approved housing bodies, including housing for those with a specific category of housing need, and through &euro;129 million invested in the major housing regeneration programmes.  The ambitious programme of retrofitting and energy efficiency upgrading continued in 2012 with improvements to 2,115 local authority units from departmental funding of over &euro;19 million.<br\/>The national implementation framework<i><\/i>to support the housing strategy for people with a disability was published in July 2012.  During the year, over 10,000 households benefited under the housing adaptation grants scheme for older people and people with a disability, with a total cost to the Exchequer of &euro;53 million.  The total spend from the Vote in this area in 2012 ensured that the needs of over 20,000 households were met from the full range of housing measures.  Significant water services capital investment continued in 2012 with &euro;308 million spent on these services, including &euro;40 million on the rural water programme.  In all, 56 contracts or schemes were completed in 2012, with a further 55 commencing, and work continuing on a further 22 contracts.  The Department recouped in excess of &euro;39 million to local authorities on water conservation projects in 2012 and, in all, some 273 km of public water supply piping were rehabilitated.  Over the period 2000-2012, over 1.5 million population equivalent was added to the capacity of water treatment systems and in excess of 4.2 million population equivalent in waste water treatment capacity.<br\/>In parallel, intensive work continued throughout the year on the organisational, financial, economic and environmental models for Irish Water, leading to the putting in place of a detailed implementation strategy in respect of the water services reform programme.  Work progressed on the relevant legislative framework, leading the following year to enactment of two water services Acts.  The first, enacted in March 2013, provided for the establishment of Irish Water on an interim basis and the roll-out of the nationwide domestic metering programme.  In December, the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provided for the full establishment of Irish Water and the economic regulation of the new utility.<br\/>During 2012, funding of &euro;53 million was provided under axes 3 and 4 of the Leader rural development programme, RDP, resulting in 1,056 infrastructural enhancements in villages and communities across the country and support for 662 new tourism actions.  Enterprise support funding was provided to 1,347 enterprises under a number of RDP programme measures, resulting in the creation of 570 full-time jobs.  The local and community development programme provided funding of some &euro;54 million to local development bodies for the delivery of the programme in 2012.<\/p> <p>During the year, some 47,790 persons were supported in entering the labour market by the LCDP, 16,830 persons progressed into labour market training as a result of LCDP intervention, and 7,050 individuals progressed into employment or self-employment as a result of LCDP actions.<\/p><p> Chapter 4 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's annual report on Vote accounting records the key points in the history of the electronic voting project, extending 13 years back to 2001, and the actions taken by the Department in light of the Government's decision in 2009 not to proceed with the implementation of electronic voting in Ireland.  The 2012 Appropriation Account records the sale of the equipment in that year following an open tendering process and includes the necessary associated financial provision for the disposal of the equipment.  Since the finalisation of the chapter, we have made arrangements for the conclusion of the last remaining lease in respect of premises for the storage of the equipment.  <\/p><p> The chapter of the Comptroller's annual report concerning central Government funding of local authorities provides an overview of local authority expenditure and income since 2006, detailing the range of programmes for which local authorities are responsible and the range of funding sources.  In 2012, some &euro;2.9 billion was provided by central government to assist authorities in providing essential public services at local level. <\/p><p> In terms of accountability, as the committee is aware, under the existing policy and legislative framework, the Local Government Audit Service provides independent scrutiny of the financial stewardship of local authorities and other local bodies.  The audit service audits local government bodies in accordance with a statutory code of audit practice, thereby fostering the highest standards of financial management and public accountability.  Where the annual audit has been completed by the local government auditor, the local authority is required to furnish a copy of the audited financial statement, and any associated statutory audit report, to every member of the local authority for their consideration at the next practicable council meeting.<\/p><p> Section 61 of the Local Government Reform Act 2014 provides for the establishment of a new national oversight and audit commission for local government, NOAC.  It will scrutinise local government performance in fulfilling national, regional and local mandates, scrutinise value for money where State funds are channelled through local government and support the development of best practice, and enhanced efficiency, in the performance of local government functions.  The  commission, which will be statutorily independent, will comprise members with expertise in local government, finance, audit, corporate governance and customer service.<\/p><p> The final item on the agenda today is the Comptroller and Auditor General's chapter concerning the costs of land remediation.  The chapter touches on issues which are the responsibility of a number of  Departments. <\/p><p> As far as my own Department is concerned, the chapter details expenditure of almost &euro;100 million on the remediation of landfill sites.  It also notes expected future costs of &euro;10 million in relation to these sites and substantial, though not yet quantified, costs that will arise in respect of the long-term remediation of the Kerdiffstown site in County Kildare.  These figures are updated to &euro;113 million and &euro;15 million, respectively, at the end of 2013 in the briefing paper I have circulated to the committee.  It is likely that substantial costs will also be incurred at the former Greenstar landfill at Kilconnell, east Galway. <\/p><p> I might add that the paper also updates the estimated cost to the Department of the Mahon tribunal as referred to in the Appropriation Account 2012.  A revised estimate prepared by the tribunal registrar in May 2014 indicates an overall cost of &euro;159 million.  Expenditure on the tribunal from the Vote at the end of 2013 amounted to &euro;106 million, so remaining costs are now estimated at &euro;53 million.  This reduction in estimated tribunal costs, down from &euro;196 million in 2012, reflects the fact that a significant volume of cases and third-party costs have been settled since that estimate was made.  That has facilitated the preparation of a more up-to-date estimate of potential final costs. <\/p><p> To conclude, Chairman, the matters I have referred to illustrate well the range of programmes and activities for which my Department has responsibility.  I am, of course, happy to respond to questions on these and other issues that emerge in the course of the committee's work today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014062600006#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1403775600,"counter":101,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy.

I shall begin with one of the most pressing societal problems at the moment, which is housing.  We are all aware of the current crisis in housing.  Last week I visited my local authority, and I can vouch that there is a real and genuine fear among people who work at the front line in housing offices about homelessness.  Obviously we must all tackle the issue.<\/p><p>  We have seen from the statement and the accounts that there has been a significant drop in financial provision for social housing from 2007 to 2012.

The housing situation is critical.  The Department relies extensively on the housing needs assessment exercise which is run every number of years and provides us with a good and reliable snapshot in time.  The assessment was undertaken last year and gave us very clear evidence, as we had in previous assessments.<\/p><p>  The Deputy mentioned that the resource base for housing has, along with most other programmes, contracted over the past number of years.  This is something that we have worked hard to work our way through in terms of trying to ensure that we make the best possible use of the resources that are available to us in order to meet as many housing needs as we possibly can.  <\/p><p>  Without putting all our eggs in one basket, we have adopted a range of new measures to meet housing needs over the past number of years.  For example, the social housing leasing programme was introduced.  We have a programme of acquisition of units from NAMA.  There is still some element of local authority building and voluntary housing building going on.  We have a number of programmes to address voids, or empty houses, in order to bring those back into use.  The measures are all designed to ensure that we use the resources available to us in a way that meets as much housing need as possible.<\/p><p>  We were also minded, I suppose, back in 2008 and 2009 where there was a substantial surplus of property on the market, that it was important for us to tap into that in terms of speed of delivery.  I shall put this in context and give the Deputy a sense of the impact of the evolution of the programmes.  Let us take the three years from 2010 to 2012.  During that time we provided just over &euro;38 million for leasing, which allowed us to meet the housing needs of about 3,500 people.  If we had used the money that was available to us to build or buy houses during that period, we would probably have been able to deliver around 250 houses.  I am trying to get the following across.  Yes, the resource base has reduced quite considerably.  In response to the reduction in resources, but also in response to the level of need that exists, we have tried to introduce new and different ways of providing social housing so that we could meet social housing needs as far as possible from within the available resource space.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014062600007#F00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1403775600,"counter":106,"content":"<p>I will drill down through that for specifics.

In large measure, many of the cases now being dealt with have a historical dimension to them.  The legislative and structural arrangements for waste enforcement were enhanced quite significantly in the middle of the last decade, in particular with the establishment of a new office of environmental enforcement within the Environmental Protection Agency.  That has a dual role, both in regard to the enforcement activities the agency undertakes and in terms of overseeing the enforcement activities of local authorities.  The EPA monitors, and then publishes reports on, environmental enforcement generally.<\/p><p>  In a report published in the past week or ten days, it categorised the enforcement activities across the country in this area, which comes to approximately 12,000 enforcement actions.  They range all the way from the very minor up to the much more significant.  I understand from that report that between 2009 and 2012, there were approximately &euro;2.1 million in fines and costs were awarded in waste-related cases before the courts.  That reflects an increasing trend of going to the higher courts, reflecting the seriousness of the issues.<\/p><p>  In regard to some of the cases covered in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, I will be a little careful as there are some legal proceedings still going on.  In regard to the former Greenstar facility in east Galway, the EPA took a legal action against the company, the receiver and other parties.  The High Court ruled against the agency in April of this year but it is considering a Supreme Court appeal, so I will leave it at that.  In regard to Kerdiffstown, there has been a number of proceedings both of a criminal and a civil nature.  Criminal proceedings are still pending in that case.  In other proceedings, the agency has obtained orders for more than &euro;2.6 million which, in effect, now attach to the lands.  Obviously, the scope to recover that money remains to be seen but it has brought it to that point.  There are also civil proceedings going on in regard to Kerdiffstown, so I will not comment on that.  <\/p><p>  As the Deputy knows, there has been a long history with Whitestown in Wicklow, going back through many court sessions.<\/p> <p>The High Court action in that case has been adjourned until such time as the remediation is completed.  I would expect that the case will return to the courts next year.  In that case there were, of course, criminal prosecutions as well, resulting in fines of over &euro;200,000.  There are a range of both criminal and civil proceedings in train with regard to some of the larger cases.  Obviously the process of actually assembling evidence for cases which go back some period in time and trying to trace waste that was found back to the individuals responsible is a challenge.

The staffing numbers in local government have dropped by approximately 27% in the last five to six years.  Savings in procurement and other areas were also identified.  Those have been reported on and, in effect, we are seeing them being carried through in the lower expenditure figures.

I have also raised it on numerous occasions through parliamentary questions and my predecessor, the former Labour Party Deputy for Wicklow, Ms Liz McManus also raised it in the D&aacute;il as far back as February 2010.  I do not want Mr. McCarthy to get into the political decision making on this, but I wish to tease out the oversight role of the Department, as underpinned by legislation.  I understand that it is not the Department's responsibility to run local government.  However, if something goes wrong or if there is a concern about something going wrong at local government level and that concern is brought to the attention of the Department, the issue is what action the Department takes, or unfortunately, in my experience, does not take.  I am referring specifically to the issuing of a waste permit in County Wicklow.  While the specific case is an issue for Wicklow, my worry is that it could happen in any county.  A waste licence was issued in Ballybeg in County Wicklow.  We do not need to get into the complexities of the issue but the licence was sent to the EPA  and was subsequently shredded.  There was significant concern about why a licence was issued to a certain operator and then shredded.  The point of me raising this issue with Mr. McCarthy is that Wicklow County Council held a special emergency meeting on Monday 25 January 2010.  At that meeting a resolution was passed and sent to the Department.  That resolution read as follows:<blockquote><br \/>We call on the Department to appoint a public local inquiry under section 212 of the Local Government Act 2001 to inquire into, and report upon, all aspects of the performance of the functions of Wicklow County Council concerning the grant of a waste permit relating to the creation of a borrow pit on certain lands belonging to the Byrne family of Ballybeg, near Rathnew, and the subsequent treatment, by Officers of the Council, of documents, evidence and other information relevant to that grant.  We also ask that the Department's role in relation to an investigation requested by councillors and the reported loss of files by the Local Government Audit Service investigation, be investigated.  <\/blockquote>I was a councillor at that time.  An overwhelming majority of local representatives, on a cross-party basis, agreed that there was a problem and that they needed the Department to look into in on their behalf.  That resolution or motion was sent, under the Local Government Act, to the Department.  The issue actually goes back to 2002 or 2003.  The former Deputy, Liz McManus raised it in the D&aacute;il in February 2010 but basically, from what I can see, nothing happened.  The request was acknowledged by the Department and the correspondence trail went dry.  I raised it with Mr. McCarthy's predecessor here and in fairness to her, she came back and said that the Department had no further evidence of wrongdoing.  The point was that the Department was asked to set up an inquiry to look into the issue.  The local representatives were not asking if the Department had any evidence of wrongdoing.  There is provision under the Local Government Act for public inquiries.  The issue here is broader than Wicklow.  The question is,  what do local councillors have to do to get the Department to look into an issue of serious concern?  Councillors were waving red flags, asking for help having identified a problem and asking that the Department look into it but the response from the Department, in the view of many public representatives and residents in Wicklow was mute.  <br\/>I do not expect Mr. McCarthy to be familiar with all of the details of the case but I can provide him with a copy of the minutes of the aforementioned special meeting which give a very clear overview of the concerns.  I would ask that the Department would reflect on how it deals with investigations against that backdrop.  The Department has an oversight role.  There is provision for a public inquiry in the Local Government Act and I am just wondering what the criteria is for an issue to merit such an inquiry.  It is extremely disconcerting for local representatives when they express concerns but the Department does not respond, in my view, in a proactive manner.  Would Mr. McCarthy be willing to look at the correspondence again?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014062600009#H00400","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1403776800,"counter":123,"content":"<p>Certainly Deputy, I will look at the correspondence.

Some would relate to individual planning cases and the Department is specifically precluded, under law, from getting involved in such cases.  If financial issues are raised, we would explore whether they should be referred to the Local Government Audit Service, LGAS, for further investigation.  I am not sure, but I think in the case mentioned by the Deputy, there would have been an involvement by the LGAS at some point in time.  Obviously, if other issues are raised with us that carried evidence of suggested criminality, then we would take the appropriate steps in dealing with those.  Indeed, there may be other issues referred to the Department where accountability for them would rest with the local elected members themselves.  In that context, we would point out the relevant statutory provisions.  The Local Government (Reform) Act of 2014 contains a number of provisions which strengthen the oversight role of elected members at local level.

We were encouraging local authorities to try to access land almost ahead of the posse before it appreciated in value so that we were getting good value from it.

We got a longer-term perspective on the housing capital programme from the multi-annual financial programme that was put in place in 2012.  As we moved further on in time, it became clear that sufficient capital resources would not be available to enable us to continue the scheme in that format.  We decided that maturing loans would be converted to standard annuity loans, in effect, with terms of up to 25 years.  We decided we would recoup the payments on those loans.  There were 26 sites, involving approximately &euro;52 million in loans, under that second phase of the scheme.  As those loans were not repaid - they were refinanced, in effect - we have an ongoing liability of approximately &euro;2.7 million per annum in relation to them.

It is clear in that context that there is a need to look at the regulation of the sector.  Deputy Nash mentioned that there is a multiplicity of bodies of this nature.  The total number is approximately 500.  As the Secretary General has said, they vary in size from the very small and localised bodies to the handful of bodies that are essentially operating on a not-for-profit commercial footing.  The regulatory structure we are devising for them is based on the principle that one size does not fit all.  We are working on a light-touch regulatory system for housing bodies in the middle tier, some of which are essentially community groups but nonetheless receive public funding from time to time.  The housing bodies in the upper tier, which operate on a reasonably large scale, are probably those of the most interest.  The number of such bodies in Ireland is very modest by comparison to the number of equivalent bodies in other countries.  There is some potential for growth of the sector here.  The larger bodies receive significant amounts of public moneys.  We introduced a voluntary code as a precursor to putting the regulation of the sector on a statutory footing.  The interim regulatory structure is housed in the housing agency, which is independent of the Department.  Bodies are signing up to that voluntarily.

I refer to the fact that voters in Clonakilty elected their own mayor.  I do not know if Mr. McCarthy is aware of this, but it is an interesting development.  It was considered there was a dearth of representation in the aftermath of the abolition of town councils and, as a result, voters directly elected a mayor.  I am surprised Mr. McCarthy does not know this, particularly as the Local Government Reform Act does not preclude the existence of other representative structures in more localised areas.  I can understand why the people of Clonakilty did what they did.  I come from Dungarvan, the county town of Waterford which had a local authority and a town council for many decades.  However, we have moved from a situation where there were probably close to 12 councillors living within the town boundaries to a point where there is only one.  I am not going to discuss the pros and cons of abolishing the town councils, but the Act makes specific reference to the potential existence of other representative structures.  The people of Clonakilty noticed this and elected their own mayor.  They obviously believe this is an advantage and of benefit to the town.  When it comes to twinning with other locations or inviting people to visit the town for business and commercial purposes, having a mayor is a plus.  Given that the Act does not preclude the existence of different democratic structures, will the Department accept applications for funding from the relevant entities?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014062600017#Q01500","speaker":"1091"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1403781600,"counter":286,"content":"<p>I will explore the particular issue the Deputy has raised.

The programme part-finances projects; 50% is provided in grant aid to a private individual or 75% to community group.  That became a significant issue in terms of seeing the programme succeed to the end.  We made a number of changes to the programme to try to allow the situation to change.

There are two aspects to the issue.  One is why certain units are rejected and the other is, in the case of units that are not rejected, what is the issue governing the pace at which they become available.<\/p><p>  On the first point, we pursue a sustainable communities agenda and we try to avoid situations where there is a very high concentration of one tenure type.  We wish to avoid the old model of a congregation of large numbers of social housing units, possibly in areas with inadequate services for families.  There has been a process of filtration by local authorities to fit in with their own housing needs.  We are revisiting that now.  The Housing Agency, some local authorities and the Department are looking again at units that were previously rejected to see if we could find mixed tenure solutions that would allow some of them to be brought into service.<\/p><p>  The situation was extremely complex at first.  First, properties were not in the ownership of NAMA.  The loans had transferred to NAMA but not the properties, which were still in the ownership of developers or, in some cases, receivers.  As the Secretary General has said, in some cases the properties were not fully completed and issues arose in that regard.  We work closely and co-operatively with NAMA.  One of the actions it has taken to expedite the situation is to set up a special purpose vehicle within NAMA to which it can transfer properties.<\/p> <p>As they are resolving individual loans with associated properties, taking ownership of the properties and moving them into this special purpose vehicle for onward leasing to local authorities, it short-circuits what otherwise is a very complex process.  There are no developers or receivers involved and so on.  That has led to the type of acceleration we have seen more recently, and we anticipate this will continue for the rest of this year and into next year.

It is now back to approximately 6%, and the aim of the Government's construction strategy is to restore that to a more sustainable level of between 12% and 13% of GNP.  Within the construction strategy, there is a wide variety of measures, for some of which my Department is responsible.  Others, such as those pertaining to development finance, mortgage lending and so on, are the responsibility of the Department of Finance.  All the issues that are connected with this or must be dealt with to support the increase in activity in the construction sector are being dealt with in this integrated way, with the Department having a very important role in that regard.

Mr. McCarthy spoke of a strategy.  The rent supplement scheme, which comes under the Department, was designed as a short-term scheme.  In many cases, it has ended up becoming a long-term scheme.  The RAS, from my perspective, works.  It is a relatively well-administered scheme.<\/p><p>  I have major misgivings over the way the rent supplement scheme in certain cases has operated, in terms of the level of controls.  Nearly all of those on the rent supplement scheme are excellent.  There are weaknesses in the scheme.  I suppose I am asking Mr. McCarthy to bring it to me on a practical level.  How will society, in which the Department is central, deal with a local authority housing crisis in the broadest sense when the number of units being made available on an annual basis is falling far short of the requirement and young housing applicants, many of whom are lone parents, end up living in sub-standard accommodation and find in a relatively short period of time that they have got into a physical housing poverty trap, both in the financial sense and in the level of facility provided?<\/p><p>  Mr. McCarthy, dare I say it, is a new broom.  I am setting him a challenge, not criticising the old broom but acknowledging the new broom.  This is one of the most challenging areas for a public representative.  I have thought long and hard about it.  We are dealing with such persons every day of the week.  It is something in which I have a particular personal interest.  I see young people, particularly single mothers, living in dives.  I would not put anyone into them.  I feel an onus to help them.  Mr. McCarthy might tell me what he has in mind to address the challenge, involving organisations such as NAMA and the voluntary groups that do fantastic work.  How do we go about it systematically where, instead of finding mechanisms to keep people off the lists, we find mechanisms to facilitate in various different forms people to get adequate necessary housing and to not create a housing poverty trap?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014062600021#U00900","speaker":"1060"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1403784000,"counter":371,"content":"<p>Picking up on Deputy O'Donnell's comment at the end on keeping people off the list, there is a very valid point - it was in a discussion with Deputy Deasy earlier - around the connection between social housing, and what we need to deliver there, and the wider housing market because the more that we have a properly functioning housing market with supply at a level that can meet demand, the more we have price and rent issues dealt with in the market generally.  Certainly, it eases the pressure on the public housing system.<\/p><p>  In terms of providing for the future, the social housing strategy is really the vehicle which we are working through, particularly in terms of the potential funding arrangements that can be devised to support the maximum level of delivery.  I might ask Mr. Michael Layde to say a few words on that.<\/p><p>  The housing assistance payment scheme that Deputy O'Donnell has spoken about would be a very important part.  He identified some of the issues associated with rent supplement.  What the housing assistance payment does is bring the tenants in under a local authority-led regime with all of the benefits that that brings, and it also addresses issues around the rent being payable directly from the local authority to the landlord, avoiding some of the arrears-type issues which have given rise to some of the problems in terms of people finding themselves moving out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014062600021#U01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1403784000,"counter":372,"content":"<p>There is another issue with the rent supplement scheme with a tiny minority.

The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government is responsible for in the region of 10% of that funding, yet nothing has been built.  We are quickly approaching 50% of the original costs of &euro;266 million that were intended for that project, but still nothing has been built.  Those costs have now ballooned to about &euro;500 million according to the Dublin city manager in Dublin City Council.<\/p><p>  Europe has told us that one of the firms was procured illegally, so they have gone since January.  There is a serious conflict of interest case which has still to be adjudicated upon in Europe.  We have had four formal reports since 2012 each of which has focused on weak governance and poor financial management.

Apart from some initial grant assistance of about &euro;7.5 million up to 2005 at early stages in the project's conception, the Department has provided no Exchequer funding towards the project.  It is to be funded through the contractual arrangement between the local authorities and the private partner.  Accountability for the project rests at local government level and that accountability arrangement is active.<\/p><p>  As regards the local government auditor's report, the Deputy pointed to the issues the auditor raised.  Discussions have taken place by the elected members, as well as considerations by the council's audit committee.  Changes that were made in the governance arrangements were subject to more positive comment in the auditor's report for 2012.  The project has been discussed in the House by another committee on a number of occasions, most recently earlier this year.

While it is critically important that sort of expenditure, or any expenditure, is undertaken in a value for money way, from the Department's point of view the issue is the extent to which that level of expenditure would be of a compromising nature in terms of the financial stability of the four authorities.

At that meeting in January, the city manager of Dublin City Council spoke about a cost of &euro;500 million if this project was to go ahead.  That is one third of the annual budget of those four local authorities.  There is no business case for this incinerator, as was pointed out in the Capita report.

Under the procedures, the National Development Finance Agency is the body that has been assigned responsibility by the Government for assessing projects of this kind.  When he appeared before the joint committee, the city manager indicated that before any decision is made, the project will be resubmitted.

The project itself is one of the best examples of how dysfunctional the whole process is in respect of this type of project - local authorities versus central funding and so on.  I understand Mr. McCarthy's position.  He is part of it but not part of that type of position.  At the same time, while he says it is not money from central Government, it is taxpayers' money.  It is ratepayers' money.  There is no facility at council level to give this issue the type of scrutiny it deserves.  County managers generally plough on with projects like this and the elected members have very little input, as Deputy Murphy said, in terms of who will stop this project.  I agree with everything he has said.  It concerns me greatly that the type of reform that is needed to address issues such as this has not happened.<\/p><p>  When Mr. Watt from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform appeared before us, if my memory serves me correctly, he generally agreed that the local authority and its spend should come under the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General in some guise because there is no forum like this one locally where value for money audits or reports or even the audit itself are debated in public.  That is a weakness.  It is a weakness of management and controls on money and there is an issue around how that money was spent.  <\/p><p>  I would ask the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform about how this money is being spent.  Surely it must be concerned and surely it must see the need for some intervention to bring clarity to this and to possibly suggest ways of examining the spend that has already occurred and the spend that may happen.  It must see the need for the project itself to be subjected to some type of central Government and administrative oversight and scrutiny.  I would ask the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to engage with local government or these four managers who are being spoken about here to determine what exactly is happening so that someone takes responsibility for the issue itself and how it is progressing, particularly given the concerns expressed by Deputy Murphy, who has raised this issue here on numerous occasions.  I am asking the Department to give us a written note on how it sees it.  I do not expect the Department to respond today but I do expect a written report or commentary on how it sees this issue relative to public expenditure, because, taking all of the positions away, it is taxpayers' money that is central to this, and people want to know.  As I understand it, from comments made by Deputy Murphy, councillors are also concerned about it.  I ask that the Department examine the structures, who intervenes and who can intervene and give us its views on all of this in correspondence so that we can pursue the matter further.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014062600025#Y01000","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1403786400,"counter":466,"content":"<p>The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is certainly concerned with value for money issues.

I would appreciate if he would reflect on it and give us his views.<\/p><p>  I know we are late but I just want to get answers to some questions.  There is an issue relating to Carlow County Council and the Revenue Commissioners regarding who is responsible for the payment of &euro;1 million worth of VAT.  Revenue was meant to decide on this, but if it was to decide that the local authority had to pay it, that is an issue for the local authority.  It is a significant amount of money.  I am concerned about the legal costs in all of this and the delay in making such a decision around this VAT issue.  Is it possible to get a note from the county council as to the current status of this, the level of expenditure to date on legal costs and the council's intention regarding future costs in resolving this issue?  Perhaps the Department might encourage the Revenue Commissioners to resolve the matter as well, as I have done, because it is an overhanging cost.  I do not think it can be quantified for the future in terms of the legal costs, but someone should bring a bit of sense to this and resolve it.  Again, it is an interdepartmental issue, regardless, involving Revenue, local government and one local authority.  Could the Department check on it and let me know about it?<\/p><p>  Another issue relates to the Kilkenny central access scheme, which involves the construction of a bridge in Kilkenny city and investment in what is called the brewery site.

The Bill explicitly provides for a permit type in intra-company transfers.  While the intra-company transfer employment permit holder&rsquo;s employer is outside the State, that is, a foreign employer, the employment permit holder is carrying out duties for, or participating in a training programme with, the connected person, that is, the Irish entity.  It is the Minister's intention that the provisions of the Bill relating to intra-company transfer employment permits respect the employer-employee contractual relationship between the foreign employer and intra-company transfer employment permit holder.  For this reason, any reference to the connected person that could suggest it was the employer has been removed and sections have been redrafted accordingly.  Many of the Committee Stage amendments are drafted to achieve this aim.<\/p> <p>The new subsection (b) provides that a foreign national employed outside the State by a foreign employer to carry out duties for, or participate in, a training programme provided by the connected person shall not be permitted to do so except in accordance with an intra-company transfer employment permit and that to do otherwise is an offence.  The new subsection (c) applies the offence provisions where a foreign national employed outside the State by a foreign employer to carry out duties for, or participate in, a training programme provided by the connected person does not have the required intra-company transfer employment permit.<\/p><p> The new subsection (d) will provide a defence to a foreign national working without an employment permit who can prove he or she took all reasonable steps to ensure compliance with section 2.  This defence is already provided in the 2003 Act to an employer who employs someone without an employment permit.  This provision addresses an issue raised by Mr. Justice Hogan in his 2012 ruling in the Younis case, which he referred to the Oireachtas and the Minister.<\/p><p> Acceptance of amendment No. 4 will involve the deletion of section 3 of the published Bill.<\/p><p> The new subparagraph (e) in section 3 of the Bill applies the defence provisions of section 2(4) of the 2003 Act to the new subsection 2C.  Subsection 2C makes it an explicit requirement that a foreign national employed by foreign employer who undertakes duties for, or training with, a connected person in the State has a valid employment permit.  The effect of this is to provide a defence for those charged with an offence consisting of a contravention of the new subsection 2C.<\/p><p> The new subparagraph (f) in subsection 3 of the Bill is required to address the variance which exists between existing employment permits legislation and the State's obligations under international agreements concerning the employment of dependants of State employees assigned on official duty overseas, often referred to as working spouse or working dependant agreements, particularly the treaty agreement in place between Ireland and the US.  The amendment provides an exemption from the terms of the proposed Act for foreign nationals in the State under the terms of the Diplomatic Relations and Immunities Act 1967 who are assigned to a mission in a country with which the Government has entered into a working dependant agreement.  Under the terms of the working dependant agreement with the US and Canada, both of which predate the employment permits legislation, relevant dependants of officials assigned abroad are entitled to an authorisation to work in the other country.  This system has been applied in full to Irish dependants overseas, but following the introduction of the Employment Permits Acts, applications by relevant embassies based here must be accompanied by a formal job offer, in contradiction of the terms of these international agreements.  While our partners in the US and Canada implement the terms of working dependant agreements in full, our legislation as it stands means Ireland cannot fulfil its obligations to our partners.  The US has noted on several occasions that Ireland's insistence on receipt of a formal job offer before issuing the employment permit is in breach of the agreement being implemented in full by the US.  It is not expected that the amendment will lead to a substantial increase in non-nationals seeking work under the terms of working dependant agreements.  In addition, the exemption ends upon completion of the posting of the assigned person, usually a four-year duration.<\/p><p> The new subsection (g) in section 3 of the Bill assigns the definitions of new terms used in the legislation, which fall out of the treatment of the intra-company transfer situation in the Bill.  I am considering further minor amendments to section 3 of the Bill and will revert on Report Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2014062600002#A01500","speaker":"979","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1403773200,"counter":554,"content":"<p>That is the short version.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2014062600003#B00200","speaker":"1078"},{"type":"speech","time":1403773200,"counter":555,"content":"<p>Could we have that in English, please?

With regard to amendment No. 7, I have followed the Younis case closely and we all agree it was shocking.  We were shocked at the exploitation and injustice it highlighted.  The objective of the new section 2B is to further deter employers from employing foreign nationals without an employment permit by permitting the foreign national and the Minister to take civil action for compensation against the employer, notwithstanding the illegality of the contract.  This is in addition to potential criminal prosecution of the employer.<br \/>Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n's amendment deals specifically with this.  Without necessarily speaking too much on the amendment until the Deputy proposes it, it would raise the bar in terms of what a foreign national or the Minister, in deciding whether to take a case on behalf of a foreign national under the new provision, has to prove before a court to get paid compensation.

For example, although everyone else working in a restaurant might be getting paid between &euro;10 and &euro;12 per hour, one waiter might only be getting the minimum wage.

If people must go a long time without being able to feed their families, pay their rents or cover other costs before judgments are made, they will be radically disempowered from raising their concerns in the first place and we will end up with hundreds more Muhammad Younis cases.  At our meeting on Tuesday, someone from the Irish Immigrant Support Centre, Nasc, indicated that 30,000 people were in this undocumented space, although not how many were experiencing these levels of exploitation.

Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n&rsquo;s amendment would place the onus on the foreign national of proving that exploitative work practices took place.  Currently, the foreign national does not have to prove that this occurred in order to avail of the provision.  Unscrupulous employers who employ illegal non-EEA nationals continue to face the possibility of prosecution under the employment permits legislation.  If found guilty of an offence, such employers face a fine of up to &euro;250,000, imprisonment for a term of up to ten years or both.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the National Employment Rights Authority, NERA, actively pursue breaches under the legislation and welcome information concerning possible breaches.  On this basis, we will not accept amendment No. 7.<\/p><p>  Regarding amendment No. 8, the new civil proceedings provide for compensation in a situation where there is no legal contract of employment &ndash; this point is important - and the compensation provided for is the national minimum wage or other mandatory statutory rate for the job.  These are rates provided for in law and there is no ambiguity or complex standards of proof for a court in determining how much the compensation should be.  It is also how the Labour Court determined Mr. Younis's compensation.  The Deputy&rsquo;s amendment would add complexity and ambiguity to a court's determination of what the rate for a \"regularised employee engaging in the same employment\" would be and could actually result in the applicant's claim failing if such a rate could not be established to the court's satisfaction.  On the other hand, the national minimum wage is clear and unambiguous.  It would be different if the contract of employment were legal, but in such a scenario it is not.  We will not accept the amendment.<\/p><p>  Amendment No. 9 provides for retrospective effect of the provision so that a person taking proceedings pursuant to the new section 2B of the 2003 Act can claim an amount of money for work done or services rendered during a period prior to, as well as after, the commencement of the section.  The new section is providing a remedy to a defined class of persons who have not been properly recompensed for work done or services rendered by reason of the illegality of their contracts of employment.  It covers those who never had permits and those whose permits lapsed through no fault of their own.  The employer has benefitted from the work done or services rendered.  If the employee had held an employment permit, the employer would have had to pay him or her at least the national minimum wage.  As a matter of social justice, the Minister wishes to provide a remedy to the class of persons referred to in section 2B.<\/p><p>  New subsections (6) to (9), inclusive, inserted into section 2B, impose limitations on the right of action conferred by section 2B and are proposed, following consultation with the Office of the Attorney General, for the purpose of making the section more likely to withstand challenge whether on constitutional or European Convention of Human Rights grounds.  The new subsection (10) inserted into section 2B provides that, where the Minister institutes proceedings under section 2B, the court may award costs in favour of the Minister.  We are considering some further amendments to these provisions and I will revert on this matter on Report Stage.<\/p><p>  Amendments Nos. 10 to 12, inclusive, are drafting amendments falling out of amendment No. 9, which inserts new subsections (6) to (10), inclusive, into the new section 2B of the 2003 Act and relates to the bringing of an action against an employer.  Amendment No. 13 is a drafting amendment and falls out of the insertion of a new subsection (14) into new section 2B, which is addressed in amendment No. 14.  Amendment No. 14 defines terms used in section 2B.  It also provides that proceedings taken against an employer under section 2B may be brought in the District Court for claims of up to &euro;15,000 and in the Circuit Court for claims of up to &euro;75,000.<\/p><p>  We consulted the Courts Service regarding amendment No. 15.  It has indicated that, in the cases provided for by this section, the only relevant interim relief would involve applying for an order preventing the employer dissipating or reducing his or her assets that might be required to meet the claim if the plaintiff were successful.  Such relief would already be available by way of injunction in the High Court or Circuit Court.  If by this amendment the Deputy is proposing that the plaintiff could apply for an advance of money that he or she might get in a settlement or court determination, the Courts Service has indicated that it is unaware of such relief being available where there is a dispute and pointed to the danger that allowing relief as proposed would pre-empt the outcome of the proceedings where the case remained to be determined.  Therefore, on grounds that it is unnecessary or possibly ill advised, I am not accepting the proposed amendment.<\/p><p>  The shoulder note for section 4 of the Bill as published must be amended to read: \"Insertion into Act of 2003 of new sections 2B and 2C\".<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2014062600004#C00500","speaker":"979"},{"type":"speech","time":1403773800,"counter":574,"content":"<p>The Minister of State referred to the amendments as strengthening the law, particularly for the permit holder and people in exploitative relationships.

We are putting a belt and braces approach around the existing legislation such that there is a comfort for anybody who finds themselves in an exploitative situation that they can come forward and make a complaint and that there is a corpus of law that does not put a prohibitive cost on them in so doing because there is a statutory body, namely, NERA, that exists to err on their side where exploitation occurs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2014062600005#D00400","speaker":"979"},{"type":"speech","time":1403774400,"counter":579,"content":"<p>I do not accept the Minister of State's point with regard to amendment No. 8, namely, that an amount equal to that paid by regularised employees would somehow negate the court case or lead to it falling.

While the intra-company transfer employment permit holder's employer is outside the State, that is a foreign employer, the employment permit holder is carrying out duties for, or participating in a training programme with, the connected person, that is the Irish entity.   <br \/>The provisions of the Bill regarding to intra-company transfer employment permits must respect the employer-employee contractual relationship that exists between the foreign employer and intra-company transfer employment permit holder.  For this reason, any reference in the Bill to the connected person, that could suggest that it was the employer, have been removed and a number of sections redrafted accordingly.<br \/>Amendment No. 16 defines the term &quot;connected&quot;, which refers to the affiliation between a foreign and an Irish company for the purposes of granting an intra-company transfer employment permit.  The intention of the amendment is to tighten up and more clearly define the nature of the connections between the foreign employer and connected person, and consequently the definition of the terms &quot;holding company&quot; at amendment No. 21 and &quot;subsidiary&quot; at amendment No. 23 are required.<br \/>Amendment No. 16 also defines &quot;civil partnership registration&quot; in terms of the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010.  The term is used throughout the Bill in the context of the dependant, partner or spouse employment permit.  Amendment No. 21 also defines the terms &quot;health insurance&quot;, &quot;health insurer&quot; and &quot;medical treatment&quot; as these terms need to be defined in the context of the revised definition of remuneration at amendment No. 24, which I will address later.<br \/>Amendments Nos. 17 and 20 further amend the definitions of connected person and foreign employer and are consequential to amendment No. 16.  Amendment No. 22 is consequential to amendment No. 23.  Amendments Nos. 29 to 31, inclusive, are drafting amendments and are consequential.  Amendment No. 48 is a consequential technical amendment.<br \/>Amendment No. 49 provides for sector-specific employment permits.  Amendment No. 50 provides for the duration of an employment permit in respect of an intra-company transfer to be set out on that permit.  Amendment No. 52 specifies the persons to whom copies of an employment permit should issue.  With regard to amendments Nos. 72 and 104, it is critical that the Minister is satisfied that the intra-company transfer employment permit holder is adequately provided for in terms of board and-or accommodation for the duration of the permit holder's stay in the State.  <br \/>Amendments Nos. 99 to 101, inclusive, are consequential technical amendments.  Amendment No. 103 brings the connected person and relevant person, that is, the person in the State with whom a contractor has entered into a contract of service, into the scope of the revocation provisions of section 16 of the Act of 2006.

'remuneration' shall be construed in accordance with section 1A;&quot;,<\/blockquote>(f) by deleting the definition of &quot;employment regulation order&quot;, and<br \/>(g) by deleting the definition of &quot;registered employment agreement&quot;.&quot;.<\/blockquote>The Minister's preference is for all employment holders to be employed, salaried and paid under an Irish employment contract.  However, in the case of the intra-company transfer employment permit and contract for services employment permit, he acknowledges that the employment in the State is temporary and so facilitates the permit holder remaining on the foreign payroll.  However, this concession has, in practice, introduced a level of complexity to the evaluation of documentation submitted to support such applications.  This has resulted in considerable engagement with applications leading to delay and in some cases refusal.  <br \/>Amendment No. 24 provides for the insertion of a new section 1A into the Act of 2006.  Amendment No. 25 provides the new definition of remuneration for the purposes of the employment permits Acts and fulfils two important functions.<\/p> <p>On the one hand, it offers a clear definition of what is meant by remuneration and how it is to be provided for all categories of employment permit.  This provides clarity and certainty to employers.  On the other hand, it introduces clear rules for those applying for intra-company transfer and contract for services employment permits, covering remuneration, duration of time with foreign employer, requirements to top up to Irish statutory minimum wages as well as &euro;40,000 minimum remuneration threshold, before a permit will be issued.<\/p><p> Amendments Nos. 37 and 38 set out the principles applying to the remuneration paid to the holders of intra-company transfer employment permits and contract for services employment permits.   Amendment No. 73 makes it imperative that the intra-company transfer employment permit holder is adequately provided for in terms of health insurance for the duration of the permit holder&rsquo;s stay in the State.  Amendments Nos. 74 and 76 enable the Minister to refuse to grant an intra-company transfer employment permit or contract for services employment permit where he or she is satisfied that the health insurance provided is not similar to that provided by a registered health insurer in the State.  Amendment No. 75 is consequential to amendment No. 74, while amendment No. 81 is consequential to amendment No. 82.  Amendment No. 82 allows the Minister to refuse to grant an employment permit for an intra-company transfer or a contract for services where the conditions relating to remuneration and the provision of information on remuneration set out in the amendments to section 6 of the 2006 Act are not met.  Amendments Nos. 83 and 84 are also both consequential to amendment No. 82.  Amendment No. 102 removes a reference to \"other benefits\" that can be taken into account so as to make it clear that only accommodation, board and health insurance are reckonable components for computing the remuneration to be paid to a foreign national.<\/p><p> Amendments Nos. 105 and 106 provide the Minister with revocation grounds if the holder of the intra-company transfer or contract for services permit is not adequately provided for in terms of health insurance for the duration of his or her stay in the State.   Amendment No. 109 clarifies that the remuneration in question is the salary as set out in the definition of remuneration at new section 1A to be inserted into the Act of 2006 and that the salary must not be less than national minimum wage.  Amendment No. 110 inserts a cross-reference to section 12(6)(b) which pertains to the hourly rate specified under an enactment, such as any successor to the employment regulation orders or registered employment agreements.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 111 is a consequential amendment to amendment No. 112.  The latter amendment provides for the revocation of an employment permit where the required statement of earnings does not comply with the requirements of new section 3D(1)(c) or section 3E(1)(b) to be inserted into the Act of 2006 in respect of intra-company transfer or contract for services employment permits.<\/p><p> Finally, amendment No. 116 provides for information, documents and evidence to be prescribed under section 29 at renewal stage and the provision of such information within a prescribed period.  It also requires the provision, at renewal stage, of information on the remuneration paid to the foreign national during the period for which a intra-company transfer or a contract services employment permit was granted. <\/p><p> I am considering some further minor amendments to section 5 of the Bill and will revert at Report Stage on these.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2014062600008#G03200","speaker":"979","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1403776800,"counter":663,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1403776800,"counter":664,"content":"<p>Section 5, as amended, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1403776800,"counter":665,"content":"<p>NEW SECTION<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1403776800,"counter":666,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 25:<blockquote><br \/>In page 10, between lines 15 and 16, to insert the following:<br \/><b>&ldquo;Insertion into Act of 2006 of new section 1A<\/b><br \/><b>6. <\/b>The Act of 2006 is amended by inserting the following section after section 1:<b>&ldquo;Definition of &lsquo;remuneration&rsquo;<\/b><br \/><b>1A. <\/b>(1) In this Act &lsquo;remuneration&rsquo;

As such, this is a deliberate policy decision.  During drafting of the Bill, the issue of separation and divorce was considered.  The legal advice the Department received was that the Bill cannot cross over into the legislative domain of the Minister for Justice and Equality determining or defining separation or divorce.  Second, the question for the Minister for the purposes of the dependant, partner or spouse employment permit is whether there is a subsisting relationship of spouse, partner or dependant, that is, it is for the applicant of such permit to satisfy the Minister that he or she is a spouse, partner or dependant at the time of application or renewal.<\/p><p>  The status of relationships between the primary permit holder and his or her family members is a matter for the Irish Immigration and Naturalisation Service under the auspices of the Minister for Justice and Equality.  The situation pertaining to the presence in the State of former partners or spouses of primary permits holders is in the first instance a matter for that Minister.  Establishing the situation of a spouse or civil partner whose relationship with the primary permit holder has come to an end is beyond the remit of the employment permits system.  However, the reactivation employment permit scheme should facilitate such individuals whose circumstances have changed and who have obtained permission from the Department of Justice and Equality to remain in the State in their own right.

Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n's amendment would result in an additional mandatory provision that very few foreign nationals would be able to meet - that is, only foreign nationals who have entered into civil proceedings, which would significantly narrow the field of potential applicants under this permit type.  The Minister's intention in creating this type of employment permit is to facilitate those foreign nationals who have fallen out of the employment permit system to re-enter employment in line with employment permits legislation.  It is not a back door for illegal economic migrants who have not been, or would not be under current legislation, granted employment permits.  An amendment to facilitate this would run counter to the Government's broad policy on employment permits.  It is on that basis that I cannot accept this amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2014062600010#J01700","speaker":"979"},{"type":"speech","time":1403777400,"counter":691,"content":"<p>What does one do if one cannot afford to access the provisions of the legislation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2014062600010#J01800","speaker":"1080"},{"type":"speech","time":1403777400,"counter":692,"content":"<p>There is a provision in the legislation to allow for the Minister to take the case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2014062600010#J01900","speaker":"979"},{"type":"speech","time":1403777400,"counter":693,"content":"<p>I appreciate that.

Amendments Nos. 18 and 19, respectively, define the date of dismissal and dismissal by reason of redundancy, in terms of the Redundancy Payments Act 1967.  This is required in the context of provisions in section 22 of the Bill dealing with holders of critical skills employment permits and general employment permits who have been made redundant, as well as provisions in section 7 of the Bill that prohibit an employment permit application being made where the employment concerned was the subject of redundancy in the preceding six months.<\/p><p> To provide further clarification on amendment No. 40, it ensures that employment permits are not issued in respect of vacancies that have arisen through or were positions subject to redundancy in the preceding six months.  It is designed to prevent the possibility of an employer making existing staff redundant in order to replace them with non-EEA nationals.  It is important that the legislation has safeguards against distortions to the labour market.  This is one such safeguard.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 45 adds a requirement that information regarding any recent redundancies which may relate to a vacancy for which an application is being made be submitted as part of the employment permit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2014062600011#O03800","speaker":"979","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1403778600,"counter":741,"content":"<p>A tangential issue has arisen recently, where, for example, company A would employ a number of staff on a particular wage and then company B would be formed, with roughly the same directors and owners as company A, employing staff at a far lower rate.

This is what would be required were the Deputy's amendment to be accepted.  Furthermore, the grounds on which such a waiver might be applied would necessarily be based on a third-party and possibly unsubstantiated report into the circumstances of the applicant, or an investigation into those circumstances, which would likely cause considerable delay in the issuing of the permit and consequently might jeopardise the employment in prospect.

I thank the committee for the opportunity to speak to it today on behalf of the Centre for Cross Border Studies.  The centre was established in 1999, specifically in the context of the Good Friday Agreement, with the aim of providing a non-governmental vehicle to support and promote cross-Border co-operation.  Today's submission is based on our experience of promoting and supporting cross-Border co-operation both on this island but increasingly, and more recently, in Europe as well.  I hope Members will have more details about the centre and our longer presentation in their information packs.  Our comments are based on that.<\/p><p>  I shall commence by saying that we get core funding from the Irish Government through the Department of Education and Skills which is an essential element of our sustainability.  It is very important for us to acknowledge that assistance here and outline that we are very grateful.  Like so many others recently, our primary income has been limited to time-limited project funding from Europe.  <\/p><p>  While working with other cross-border regions has been increasingly important for us, the context of the centre's work has always been, first and foremost, Strand 2 of the Good Friday Agreement.  Thus, we are very conscious that we are now 16 years on and it is 20 years since the ceasefires.  We are also very conscious of the fact that only a minority of peace agreements survive more than a decade and in the absence of comprehensive efforts to transcend social divisions, armed conflicts frequently reoccur.  In recent years we have seen an escalation in what is known as post-conflict violence, in particular sectarian, racist and other hate crimes and also other types of crimes, anti-social behaviour and crimes within communities.  The residual paramilitary violence also provides a portent of how truly terrible a resurgence in politically-motivated conflict will be if the fragile political structures atrophy or break down.  The dangers of allowing the agreement to become unravelled, or for some elements to be allowed to wither away, should be clear to all of us.  Therefore, it was reassuring that the T&aacute;naiste, in his remarks at the launch of the Government's reconciliation fund strategy, recognised the corrosive effect that legacy issues continue to have over the daily lives of people on the island, and the responsibilities of both Governments towards finding political and societal mechanisms to deal with these legacy issues. <\/p><p>  Our focus is on cross-Border co-operation.  The centre works very closely with the North-South Ministerial Council's joint secretariat and we recognise that co-operation at that level has been very effectively embedded.  We would like to see co-operation extended and deepened.  In that sense we are somewhat disappointed that there has been very little visible progress on the review for additional cross-Border bodies in areas of co-operation.  We think it would help to build greater political endorsement for the bodies if a more proactive approach was taken to ensure that the benefits of their work was better understood by the voting public in both jurisdictions.  This could be done through more robust communication strategies.  We also suggest it could be done by commissioning social and economic impact evaluations in order to provide a firm evidence base to support the case for continued public investment in the North-South bodies. <\/p><p>  Below that level, however, cross-Border co-operation is not so well embedded.  Cross-Border co-operation among other public bodies, and between public bodies and civic society, is still fragmented and weakly institutionalised.  Since the economic crisis of 2008, austerity has to some extent provided a rationale for a de-prioritisation of cross-Border co-operation.<\/p><p>  The  potential efficiencies of delivering public services on a cross-Border or all-island basis should be starkly obvious to anyone.  However, cross-Border co-operation requires capacity, skills and resources and, even more importantly, it requires leadership and clear and unambiguous direction from policy-makers.<\/p><p>  Since the demise of the Common Chapter the limited, but nevertheless important, references to cross-Border co-operation have dwindled and all but disappeared from major policy documents.  Unless there is a clear policy imperative supported by resources, and it is made clear to civil servants and other public officials that it is part of their job, even the most motivated people will find that cross-Border co-operation has become an unaffordable luxury.<\/p><p>  The European PEACE and INTERREG programmes, in particular, have made a huge contribution to normalising cross-Border co-operation networks among local authorities, public agencies and community and voluntary organisations. The PEACE programme, in particular, is well recognised as having helped to sustain the peace process at times when formal structures were stalled or suspended.<\/p><p>  Perhaps one of the most valuable outcomes of the EU cross-Border programmes has been the facilitation of cross-Border networks.  The requirement, built into the programmes for partnership working, has effected a real change in the culture for civil society organisations and gave them new access to decision-making.  Importantly, it also made a major contribution to encouraging active citizenship.  However, the fact remains that cross-Border co-operation in Ireland has been highly dependent upon the EU programmes called PEACE and INTERREG.  The only other significant sources of public funding for cross-Border co-operation has been EU and American funding through the International Fund for Ireland, and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade's reconciliation fund.  Therefore, we welcome the commitment given in the new strategy for the reconciliation fund to building a strong civil society and the explicit inclusion in the fund's criteria of support to projects that build North-South links.<\/p><p>  As the strategy states, the significant progress made since the Good Friday Agreement cannot be taken for grant and it is essential that cross-Border co-operation be mainstreamed in public policy and budget lines on both sides of the Border.<\/p><p>  The draft PEACE and INTERREG programme documents are now out for consultation.<\/p> <p>The focus of the programmes is becoming increasingly narrow and it is becoming less accessible not just for civil society organisations but also for local government.<\/p><p> We are concerned and very disappointed that there is no specific allocation within the proposed PEACE IV programme for cross-Border projects.  It is essential that a specific proportion - we recommend 15% as in the PEACE I and PEACE II programmes - be ring-fenced for cross-Border projects.<\/p><p> Similarly, there are changes to the planned match funding allocations and the two Governments allocation will now be reduced to 15% from the previous 25%, with projects now expected to find the other 15% from other sources which again will be fine for the larger statutory projects.  However, it is essential that the reduction in the national contribution to the 2014-20 programmes does not simply revert into central Government funds.<\/p><p> Cross-Border work has particular challenges and difficulties.  It requires new skills and additional resources.  We propose that the two Governments establish a new cross-Border funding programme targeted at civil society.  We recommend that approximately &euro;40 million over seven years would be a reasonable amount.<\/p><p> In 2012, the centre published a major study on the Border region economy.  More recently, we commissioned and published additional studies on the theme - towards a Border development zone.  Since then we have been supporting a Border development zone steering committee chaired by Mr. Padraic White, involving cross-Border local authority networks, the Border Regional Authority, IBEC and InterTradeIreland.<\/p><p> The Border region continues to be characterised by multiple disadvantages relative to the rest of the island and the UK and continues to lag behind the EU average on a number of social and economic indictors.  The European Union has introduced a new mechanism &ndash; integrated territorial investment &ndash; specifically intended to address such social and economic disparities and promote territorial cohesion, that is, to bring regions such as the Border region closer to the levels of prosperity and development of more affluent regions.  The centre strongly supports the concept of integrated territorial investment for the Border region.  This would ensure that not only the smaller dedicated cross-Border funds but also the main European Regional Development Funds, European Social Funds and other mainstream funding programmes in both jurisdictions would prioritise the Border region.<\/p><p> Cross-Border work has particular challenges and difficulties.  It requires new skills and additional resources and, most important, it needs a supportive policy framework.  There has not been an overarching and strategic framework to give coherence to the many valuable cross-Border initiatives that have been implemented in the past two decades.  Too often, the European Union programmes have compensated for a lack of leadership and investment rather than complementing a strategic cross-Border intervention.  Sustainable peace and development on the island requires new ways of thinking and new ways of doing business and that means public officials and representatives and the social partners thinking and working beyond their traditional jurisdictions.<\/p><p> We recommend that there is a need for a new common chapter explicitly incorporating an imperative for cross-Border co-operation in public policies and development strategies in both jurisdictions.  A new cross-Border funding programme should be established focused on civil society projects, with a minimum investment of &euro;40 million over seven years.  A specific proportion - 15% - of the PEACE IV programme should be ring-fenced for cross-Border projects and an integrated territorial investment strategy for the Border region should be developed, targeting the Structural Funds in both jurisdictions and combined with the European territorial co-operation programmes and national government contributions.  We recognise that those recommendations are very ambitious but believe that is what is needed to make a real difference in terms of sustaining cross-Border co-operation over the next two decades.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2014062600003#D00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Ruth Taillon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1403775000,"counter":1139,"content":"<p>I welcome Ms Taillon and thank her for her detailed presentation containing a lot of very good material, which is of importance to all of us, as public representatives, both North and South.  I compliment the centre which has done exceptionally good research over the years.  It has pulled together many issues affecting both sides of the Border and which need to addressed in an all-Ireland context.  That type of material and research had been lacking over the decades, so it is very important that the centre's work continues.  The centre has been a catalyst for pulling together strands on different issues relevant to all of the island.  Its work has been very important.<br\/>The tone of the contribution struck a note that we must be pretty assertive in the need for much better cross-Border co-operation and in the development of further all-Ireland bodies in the context of the review of the St. Andrew's agreement.  I had the opportunity to listen to the centre's presentation in Leinster House some time ago and to presentations at other conferences.  It has always made the very valid point that there are areas which stand out in which we need to develop cross-Border, all-Ireland bodies, including in the area of further and third level education and in the delivery of health services.  While co-operation is happening on an <i>ad hoc<\/i>basis in those areas, it needs to be pulled together and given that leadership and status.  We need to get the proper architecture around the development and implementation of those policies.<br\/>The last major programme which had a common chapter was the National Development Plan 2010-2014, which was a very important chapter.  Particular attention was paid to consultation in advance of that chapter being agreed by government.  It was very disappointing that when an investment programme was launched in Belfast almost a year ago, at which Prime Minister Cameron, Mr. Robinson and Mr. McGuinness were the main speakers, there was no political representation from Government here.  That was a missed opportunity.  Whoever devised that mechanism of not continuing the common  chapter approach has done a very serious disservice.  We can have the common chapter and we might not get the investment and progress needed but if we do not have certain parameters within which to work, then we are going nowhere.There is so much potential and so much has been achieved.  We always want to recognise what has been achieved on a daily basis between statutory organisations, both North and South, whether at semi-State level, State level or departmental level.<br\/>The centre can continue to highlight the need to harness the potential of all-Ireland development.  The Border area, in particular, needs that emphasis and attention to draw investment because as we know, sadly, over the years, we lost out so much due to the Troubles.<br\/>In regard to PEACE IV, Ms Taillon mentioned that it will not provide for funding on a cross-Border basis to individual programmes.  That would be disappointing because the idea of INTERREG and the PEACE programmes was to place a particular emphasis on the Border region plus the cross-Border aspect.  My home parish borders County Fermanagh.  When I cross over to a football match and chat to some of the locals in Fermanagh, we discuss the same issues I discuss in my home village of Bawnboy.  It is farcical to think that projects with a cross-Border element will not be supported under a programme that should be targeted at those particular areas because there has been so much success in those cross-Border projects which all of us, as public representatives, have supported over the years.  We have seen the real benefit in rural and urban communities of that investment, in particular the ownership of the projects by the local community.<\/p> <p>Whatever we as a body can do, we should highlight the necessity of an inclusive North-South measure, particularly in regard to PEACE IV, where funding is identified.  We want to ensure the funding reaches the areas, not only that we believe it should be targeted to but that need that particular additional investment.  I sincerely thank the centre for its contribution and for the excellent work it has done over the years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2014062600004#E00200","speaker":"970","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1403775600,"counter":1141,"content":"<p>I welcome Ms Taillon and her colleagues here today.<\/p><p>  We have just been through the elections in the North to the new so-called \"super councils\" that have been given increased economic powers and the councils in the South have been given increased economic development powers.

The Department of Employment and Learning cross-Border working group is looking at providing that type of information to students on both sides of the Border.  We must recognise that higher education institutions operate in a marketplace and that universities when enrolling students tend to look at the markets they want to attract.  Perhaps work needs to be done to underline the need for high quality highly skilled graduates to stay within the island of Ireland in order to address the economic issues we have, especially in the Border region.  I must highlight that work has been done on the question of alternative qualifications.  For example, the North West Regional College has worked with colleges on the other side of the Border and they work well together.  I spoke recently to the chief executive of the North West Regional College who told me about the many excellent students he has from County Donegal.  He welcomes the fact there are many students from County Donegal in the North West Regional College.  There have been questions raised at a political level on budgetary pressures that arise from the student flows through the North West Regional College and other colleges in Northern Ireland.<\/p> <p>Perhaps the Departments need to work together to address what are sometimes perceived as budgetary pressures on the colleges.  However, I must emphasise that the colleges say this is not a problem; they welcome those students and want that student flow to continue.<\/p><p> Work has been done in offering joint courses on a North-South basis, particularly at master's and PhD levels, where universities are co-operating and offering joint postgraduate courses.  However, there may be space for this type of work at undergraduate level also.

In PEACE I, the commission directed that 15% of funding had to be ring-fenced for cross-Border work.  In PEACE II, specific cross-Border measures accounted for 15%.  However, in PEACE III the funding was mainstreamed and we have not been able to ascertain the actual percentage that went to cross-Border projects.  We have some serious concerns in regard to the PEACE IV consultation document, although cross-Border projects are mentioned.<\/p><p>  Because there has always been a derogation for the PEACE programme providing that single jurisdiction projects could be funded under INTERREG programmes, which must be cross-Border projects, the PEACE programme has always allowed for single jurisdiction projects.  However, now there is so little emphasis on cross-Border projects in the documents that we are very concerned they are not being given space and will be in direct competition with every other PEACE project. Given the pressure on civil society organisations - PEACE now constitutes one of the few areas of potential funding for civil society programmes and projects - cross-Border projects could get squeezed out even more.  This is why we stress that we should go back to the 15% funding and ring-fence it for cross-Border projects.  It is a European territorial co-operation programme, so it should be a cross-Border programme and should have more of a cross-Border focus than appears to be proposed.<\/p><p>  Work is still going on in regard to the Border development zone.  We work very closely with cross-Border local authority clusters.  Unfortunately, local government reform on both sides of the Border over the past year or so has taken up everybody's energy and focus, so development has been quite difficult.  Now that reform is getting more settled in, there is quite significant support within the cross-Border local authority clusters for the Border development zone idea.  They are working on a charter which will, hopefully, go to the councils this coming autumn for endorsement.  This charter will summarise the principles of the cross-Border development corridor idea.  Then people can advocate it, as we have been doing, as broadly as possible in different areas to try to get the policy and resources focused on the Border region.  <\/p><p>  We believe the Border region is an entity in itself, with characteristics on both sides of the Border that are very similar, which make it distinct from the rest of the island.  For that reason, the area needs a concentration of interest, support and resources.  We hope the cross-Border development zone idea will percolate over the next few years.  Perhaps in ten years or so, the area could be a euro region, but in the meantime, we are concentrating on the zone as an idea.  We are talking about the Border development zone not just as some sort of special economic zone, but in terms of a holistic approach to the development of the region.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2014062600007#H00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Ruth Taillon"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1403776800,"counter":1169,"content":"<p>On PEACE IV, may I just add some comments about the civic society theme?

We call it the Dublin to Derry and Donegal route.  I remind the committee that we met in September 2012, when the delegation outlined the importance of developing the dual carriageway as a key strategic route from Dublin to the north west.  We highlighted the need to ensure connectivity between the main cities throughout the country and identified gateways and hubs in the peripheral regions.  We have come before the committee today to reaffirm the need to have the A5 dual carriageway project kept at the top of the agenda in both jurisdictions and to continue the planning for the implementation of the project in its entirety.  I will reflect on some of the progress over the past 20 years as well as the context - that is, where we see the project fitting within the Good Friday Agreement and other regional strategies.  Then I will hand over to my colleague, Danny Kelly, from Strabane.  He will go into a more in-depth discussion on the A5 route and why we see it as a continued priority.  He will then sum up what we are asking of the joint committee.<\/p><p>  We should consider this broadly in the context of the Good Friday Agreement.  I realise I am talking to people who are altogether aware of this; I am not trying to teach my granny to suck eggs but simply to set the context.  We have seen major achievements in cross-Border co-operation and collaborative work in the past 20 years, especially in the areas of health, transport, airports, tourism, waterways, and third level education.<\/p><p>  The Good Friday Agreement brought a new beginning to Ireland, North and South, to the Governments, the communities and individuals.  It focused on connecting people and communities and removing barriers to building peace, prosperity, development and growth, especially in the society and communities North and South in the Border region.  It brought a new beginning to relationships on the island of Ireland and to our expectations for a new beginning for everyone no matter where they live.  This idea is especially dear to us in the region we are discussing.<\/p><p>  To build new relationships we must remove the blockages to economic and social progress.  We have identified that the delivery of the N14-A5-N2 route to the north west would help to overcome some of the barriers that the Good Friday Agreement brought to light.  Furthermore, we believe it would help us to achieve, facilitate and make easier a range of projects and initiatives, under programmes such as INTERREG and PEACE.  We believe it will enhance the results considered to be achievable under those programmes, and this is a key aspect for the areas that we represent.<\/p> <p>There is a need to build on the goodwill generated by the agreements, to strengthen the links between the communities on both sides of the Border and to overcome the obstacles to access to each other and the wider community on the island.  It is a question of equality of opportunity.<\/p><p> The Good Friday Agreement refers to the right to equal opportunity in all social and economic activity.  The strategic transport planning is identified in the agreement as an area of North-South co-operation and for discussion by the British-Irish Council.  In respect of that, a section of the A5 has been identified but in isolation that does not work for our location.  The connection on sections of the N2 and N14 through Letterkenny to Dublin has been essential to allow the region grow and maybe help to offset the deprivation, unemployment and other factors that afflict or affect us in the north-west region, no matter which side of the Border one lives on. <\/p><p> There is a commitment in the agreement to policies for sustained economic growth and stability in Northern Ireland and to promoting social inclusion.  Transport links were identified as a suitable issue for discussion at the British&ndash;Irish Council as outlined in Strand 3 of the Good Friday Agreement.  It also recognises the importance of ensuring equality of opportunity and includes a commitment to policies for sustained economic growth and stability in Northern Ireland and to promoting social inclusion.  The implementation of these policies included a new regional development strategy which would lead to social cohesion in the rural and Border areas as well as urban settings.  The strategy would commit to making rapid progress and strengthening the physical infrastructure of the region, developing the advantages and resources of rural areas and rejuvenating major urban centres.  That is part of the focus of our discussion today.<\/p><p> This project sits well with the regional development strategy, the national development plan and the north-west gateway initiative and the St. Andrews Agreement, which further committed to ensure the executive has the capacity to make long-term capital investments to underpin the economic transformation of Northern Ireland, as well as bringing long-term benefits to the island.  The development of the A5 dual carriageway and the N14-N2 link is essential to improve connectivity to the north west and to create a peace dividend, particularly in areas that suffered social exclusion, chronic unemployment and deprivation, the areas we represent and which our respective councils fall into.  A failure to honour the commitment risks creating conditions which would have the potential to resurrect feelings of discontent and disenfranchisement in communities.<\/p><p> The National Development Plan 2007-2013 recognised Letterkenny-Derry as a gateway critical to the economic and tourist development of the north west and the Government has committed to pursuing opportunities to underpin development of this gateway, highlighting the improvements in road links to the region as among the priorities.  It ties in especially with tourism on the wild Atlantic way and the north Antrim coast.  Allowing one to hop on and hop off those routes, whether entering them at the M1 and returning that way, or travelling through Donegal and along the west coast, would help enhance those opportunities.<\/p><p> The regional development strategy recognises the need for balanced regional development in order to achieve social cohesion and build a strong regional economy.  The strategy specifies Omagh and Strabane as hubs, centres of employment and services for the surrounding rural communities.  A major part of that is having a strategic road network, bringing the project we are discussing to fruition.<\/p><p> The absence of access routes is very obvious in the north west.  The route into the north west is especially important to open up different economic and tourism opportunities. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2014062600009#N00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Campbell","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1403778300,"counter":1187,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to address it again today.<\/p><p>  The A5 forms part of the strategic road network between Derry, Donegal and Dublin.  It is one of the main arteries for the Northern Ireland economy, linking towns, cities, air and sea ports and its development would help boost industry and commerce as well as facilitating tourist travel.  It remains, however, a single carriageway unfit for purpose and operating significantly beyond capacity.  The A5 western transport corridor project aims to develop 86 km of dual carriageway from Aughnacloy on the Tyrone-Monaghan border to New Buildings just outside Derry. <\/p><p>  An agreement was reached between the two Governments that the project would be joint funded with approximately &pound;400 million coming from each.  After our last meeting with the committee in 2012 the Minister for Regional Development went on to issue the direction and vesting orders for two sections of the route, from New Buildings to north of Strabane and from south Omagh to Ballygawley.  In the interim, however, opponents of the A5 dual carriageway project sought a judicial review of the decision to proceed with the project entering 12 challenges.  The judge quashed 11 of these challenges but upheld the twelfth, relating to appropriate environmental assessments. <\/p><p>  The implementation of the A5 project has been delayed while the Department for Regional Development resolves the technical issue raised by the judicial challenge.  Four reports have been developed to assess any impacts and all designated environmentally sensitive sites, of which there are nine, in the vicinity of the scheme and, where appropriate, to introduce mitigation measures. The reports indicate that with proposed mitigations the scheme will not have an impact on the functional habitat in its vicinity.  It is not an environmental challenge that is being made, it is a question of procedure around the technicalities.  <\/p><p>  A public consultation exercise on three of these reports commenced on 30 April of this year and concluded on 13 June.  The Department has received several representations which are being considered.  The fourth report on the Tully bog special area of conservation is not finished because the study is being carried out over the summer.  It is expected it will be published for public consultation by the end of the summer.<\/p><p>  The Department of Regional Development in the North is also reviewing the environmental statement for the full length of the scheme from New Buildings to Aughnacloy, as well as the draft vesting and direction orders, and it is envisaged that the updated environmental statement, together with the draft direction and vesting orders, will be published for comment at the end of this year.  A public exhibition is also likely and should coincide with these publications.  The need for any further public inquiry will then be determined following careful consideration of the representations and any level of objection received in response to the public consultations. <\/p> <p> It would seem that a public inquiry, if deemed necessary, would take place towards late spring or early summer of next year.<\/p><p> The next slide deals with why the Dublin-Derry-Donegal route is a priority.  I hope I am preaching to the converted.  The north-west region of Ireland, with a population of approximately 500,000, needs to be connected to the strategic road network.  That is fundamental.  I am not one to boast, but there is a wealth of latent potential in the region - including its people, business, economy, tourism and culture - which could be brought to fruition given the proper infrastructure.   <\/p><p> As Councillor Campbell has outlined, the region as a whole is entirely served by single carriageway rural roads making journey times unpredictable, but predictably slow.  Journey time certainty would make the region more attractive to inward investment, dramatically improving economic performance and growth to bring the region into line with the rest of the country.  Economic productivity in the north west lags behind the national average.  There is a lower share of high value economic sectors and a greater dependence on manufacturing and construction jobs in the region, which has been badly impacted by the economic downturn.  <\/p><p> Derry, the North's second largest city - and the fourth largest city on the island - is not served by the motorway network link.  There is no real link into the north west except for the single line connection between Derry and Belfast.  As members of the committee will be aware, the air link between Derry and Dublin has recently been terminated.  <\/p><p> I do not need to remind the committee of the high levels of deprivation and unemployment that can afflict the region.  Moving to slide No. 10, statistics for this year show that Derry has the highest, and Strabane the second highest, claimant rates in Northern Ireland at 8.2% and 7.3% respectively.  The Northern Ireland average is 4.7%.  Derry and Strabane also suffer from some of the highest unemployment rates in the North, significantly above the 2013 average of 29.5%.   At 34.2%, Derry is the second highest, while Strabane is the fifth highest with a rate of 30.2%.  <\/p><p> Across the Border the situation is no different.  Donegal has consistently demonstrated some of the highest levels of unemployment.  According to the 2011 census, Donegal had an unemployment rate of 26.2% which is the highest in the country - a position it has maintained since 2006.  It is worth noting that the State's unemployment figure is 19%.  It is still too high, but is considerably less than the north west.  The results of the 2011 census, reported in July 2012, also show that Donegal has a youth employment rate of 49% which is second only to Limerick.<\/p><p> The historic deficit in strategic road investment in the region must be addressed in terms of equality for the north-west.  The A5 route currently operates significantly above capacity for a single carriageway, with daily traffic volumes more appropriate for a dual carriageway.  There are currently just under 1,400 private access junctions along the existing A5 with the implications that has for road safety.  I do not need to remind the committee that collision rates on rural two-lane roads are more than double those on dual carriageways.  We have had a significant number of deaths in collisions on those routes in recent times.<\/p><p> As regards access to services, communities living in the north west have to travel greater distances to key services such as hospitals, life-saving services provided by acute hospitals, and medical centres of excellence.  People throughout the north west have to travel significantly longer distances to access these services in Dublin and Belfast.  As members of the committee will be aware, these impact on the golden hour during which these people need to be treated.<\/p><p> Young people and students have to travel to access educational establishments and training facilities to enable them to compete on an equal basis for employment opportunities.  This is exacerbated by the poor roads network and a lack of access to public transport.  The A5's links to the N2 and N14 are essential to ensure connectivity and equality of opportunity for these communities.<\/p><p> Moving to the next slide, I will discuss why the development of road infrastructure continues to be a priority in terms of opportunities and costs.  The development of a linkage from the north west to the motorway network will undoubtedly have long-term consequences for the region and its communities in improving economic development, promoting the tourism industry, and the ability to attract foreign direct investment, as well as supporting home-grown indigenous business and enterprises.<\/p><p> Tourism is a major growth industry particularly in rural areas.  Reliable and safe access routes into the north west are vital to ensure that the potential of the region is accessed and maximised.  The delivery of the Derry-Donegal-Dublin strategic route is vital to maximise the benefit of European funding and to build the prosperity of the region, which will build and consolidate the peace.<\/p><p> For example, the A5 scheme's detailed appraisal confirms its economic worth, including an estimate of 260 permanent new jobs and &euro;180 million in wider business efficiencies.  Those figures have been superseded by a report in 2013 that was requisitioned by the UK Business Secretary in London.  <\/p><p> The progression of this vision for roads infrastructure will greatly boost the construction industry, which is one of the key employment sectors on this island.  As well as being a positive boost to the sector it would also reduce the cost to the Government in terms of employment and other social benefits.<\/p><p> I am getting to the nub of the question of why we are here again today and what we are asking the committee to do.  In essence, we are asking members of the committee to become champions for the project.  The completion of the A5 dual-carriageway is part of the outworking of the Good Friday Agreement.  We are here to ask the joint committee's members to become champions of the project.  We want them to advocate the A5 as a strategic priority with the Government, the Northern Ireland Executive, the British Government, the North-South Ministerial Council and the British-Irish Council.<\/p><p> We ask members of the joint committee to use their influence, both individually and collectively, to ensure that construction of the dual-carriageway connection to the north west is government policy in both jurisdictions and that it remains a key strategic priority for the committee in future. <\/p><p> We also ask the joint committee to urge the North-South Ministerial Council to use the window of opportunity in the next 12 to 15 months to develop a sound funding and implementation plan for the project in its entirety.  Indeed, we ask the committee to ensure that the A5 dual-carriageway project, and the phased development of the N2 and N14, are included in the next comprehensive spending review for the Northern Ireland Executive and in the next capital expenditure programme of the Irish Government.  We further ask that the Dublin-Derry-Donegal strategic route is included in any recovery programme being developed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2014062600010#O00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dan Kelly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1403778900,"counter":1189,"content":"<p>Both contributions were fairly comprehensive.

On the last occasion, Mr. S&eacute;amus Neely, gave a particular figure on the population of that area which was very high.

Every forum available to the witnesses, at official and political level, must be used by them to ensure this stays on the agenda because it is a matter that should be progressed at an early date.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2014062600011#P00300","speaker":"970","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1403779500,"counter":1192,"content":"<p>I welcome the chairmen from Donegal and Strabane, along with the rest of the delegation.

There are two Johns here from Donegal so I will ask them both the following question.  What has been the response of the Irish Government to its commitment to complete the N14 connection with the A5, south of Strabane and Letterkenny?  We are very aware of what is happening with the A5, including the court case and the fact that 11 of the 12 points made against the A5 were thrown out.  One point was upheld and there is a new timescale for the road.  We must go through the various procedures and the programme has been laid out but I wonder whether each stage must take so long.<br\/>Regarding the section of road from Ballygawley to Aughnacloy, I am worried by the fact that there is not a programme to lay out the draft vesting and direction orders in the North.  The reason given is uncertainty as to where the N2 will make the connection so clarity on this would be welcome.  The delegates from County Monaghan might know more on this.  Where will the N2 meet the A5?  If this is not watched properly we could end up with another road in the North linking Derry to Belfast, via Ballygawley.  There has not been enough focus on the section of road from Ballygawley to Aughnacloy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2014062600012#Q00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Doherty MP"},{"type":"speech","time":1403779500,"counter":1193,"content":"<p>I welcome Deputy Pringle to the joint committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2014062600012#Q00300","speaker":"997"},{"type":"speech","time":1403779500,"counter":1194,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman, I am not formally a member of the committee for the next hour or so.

Where does the dead hand come from?  Is it simply the case that there is insufficient funding at the moment but there will be enough in future so the can is being kicked up the road?  When we spoke of this project previously we outlined elements that could proceed north and south of the Border.  The delegates referred to elements that have already undergone environmental impact assessments so the next step is to get the two Governments on board.  Everyone involved in the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly and other interest groups has committed to this project.

I convey my best wishes to Councillor Ian McGarvey who is approaching 85 years of age and was a fine chairman of Donegal County Council.  He is an example of how older people can succeed and defy the endemic ageism of political life.<\/p><p>  I support totally what Councillor Dan Kelly said.  I have raised the issue of the A5 road more often than any other issue before this joint committee because I truly believe we must, as mentioned, champion the Dublin to Derry to Donegal route.  The map shows how negligent the Government has been on this.  Deputy McHugh is an excellent Chairman of this committee and my comment is not a personal criticism of him but the Government must engage.  It is only common sense to say a potential road needs a timeline because the same is true of every capital project.  The construction of motorways in the south was subject to timelines that involved planning and so on.  I want a timeline for this project because I am sick talking about it.<\/p> <p>I am extremely frustrated by what has happened in terms of the route to the north west and the impact all of this has had on economic and social development there.  There appears to be something psychologically amiss among the members of both Governments and that is why there has been a lack of progress in respect of this road.  I could discuss this matter for a week.  I have no doubt there is a major gap in the north west - in the area between Derry and Letterkenny - in the context of economic development.  It used to take all day to get to Cork but one can now make the journey in two hours.  We are able to zip around the country on all these fabulous roads that have been built but there is a glaring gap in this regard in the north west.  That is pathetic.<\/p><p> It is sad that Monaghan has been vainly seeking the princely sum of &euro;1.5 million to narrow the chosen route between Clontibret and Aughnacloy, from 400 m to 100 m, as one of the key preliminary steps in preparing for the upgrade.  If the money is eventually provided and if it is necessary to make such a narrowing, it is a bloody farce.  I am extremely frustrated.  Why the hell is it not possible to provide &euro;1.5 million to define the road clearly in order that no more time will be wasted?  Is there a lack of drive among those in the public and political sectors in respect of this matter?  What the hell is causing the problems to which I refer.  We have discussed this matter on so many occasions but no progress has been made.  If the political will is there, major changes can be effected in society.  I am of the view that the committee, under the stewardship of the Chairman, should champion some of these causes to the Taoiseach and others in government.  The Chairman should be a Minister or a Minister of State and fight for what we are seeking.  He should put the screws on the Taoiseach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2014062600012#Q00600","speaker":"1156","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1403780100,"counter":1198,"content":"<p>We are digressing slightly from the matter under discussion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2014062600013#R00200","speaker":"997"},{"type":"speech","time":1403780100,"counter":1199,"content":"<p>I do not care, it must be said.

I spoke to the county engineers in Monaghan a year and a half ago and all they want is funding in respect of the defined route in order that they can get on with the job.  What is happening in this regard is very sad and it reflects badly on Ireland Inc. that more progress has not been made.  I co-founded a business in Dublin in 1986 and it has become very successful.  Being at the centre of the market, having access, etc., proved to be of huge benefit to us.  Business people in the north west are cut off.  They lack access to broadband services and have no smart phone connectivity.  The relevant authorities are being completely negligent when it comes to the Border counties.  Who can we get to drive progress in respect of this matter?  The committee needs to act as the people's champion.  We need to wake up people to what is involved here.

There are others in our delegation who are much more qualified to deal with those of a political nature.<\/p><p>  I will begin by addressing Deputy Smith's question with regard to money.  It is important to reflect quickly on the financial position.  Some &pound;400 million was allocated in respect of the two sections of the A5 which were planned and on which work was expected to proceed when we previously discussed this matter with the committee.  Of this, &pound;350 million is being supplied by the Northern Executive and two tranches of &pound;25 million will be provided, in 2015 and 2016, by the Government in Dublin.  It is clear that none of this money will be able to be used in a practical sense.  It is particularly important - this ties in with the question on timing - that we have those moneys reallocated in the next funding round.  Indeed, it would be good to have an even greater amount allocated.  The &pound;350 million from Northern Ireland was disbursed in respect of other road projects.  Theoretically, in the next comprehensive spending round - which begins in 2015 - that money will come back onto the table again.  That is the theory in any event.  The practical reality is that there will be a debate on the matter.  We will discuss this matter with the Northern Ireland Minister for Regional Development, who has responsibility for transport, in the coming month to ensure he bids again for the money in question.  It is important to ensure that the &pound;50 million to be provided by the Government on this side of the Border is capable of being spent by the end of 2016.  As a result, it needs to be reallocated.  In terms of the next funding round, we must also obtain whatever other moneys we can for the budget from the Republic of Ireland.  That is critical.<\/p><p>  If the various studies and the environmental statement are completed and if the relevant Ministers make decisions, we expect that by the middle of June 2015 decisions will be taken in the context of moving forward with the orders.  There is a potential for a public inquiry beyond that and such an inquiry could take place in late 2015.  The outcome of the entire process is likely to emerge in 2016.  We are not expecting any sod to be turned this side of the 2016-17 financial year.  The four-year period commencing in 2016, therefore, will be important.  We would advocate that the total allocation for the entire project should cover, if at all possible, those four years.  In other words, the project should be phased over that period.  The next funding round is, therefore, absolutely critical in terms of timing.  We do not have detailed information, the Department has not completed its work and Ministers have not taken decisions.  As a result, there are many unknowns.  Obviously, there is no certainty and all we can do is provide our best guess with regard to what the timeframe for the project might look like.<\/p><p>  Mr. Pat Doherty MP's question relates to the technical issues regarding the Ballygawley-Aughnacloy section of the road.  The positive aspect is that the environmental statement will cover the area from Newbuildings to Aughnacloy.  This means that the full section has been included.  The outcome of the inspector's report on the previous occasion was that some questions arose in the context of the connections around Aughnacloy.  There is more work to be done on that.  The safe thing to do would be not to be too definitive about how the Aughnacloy aspect will be dealt with and to ensure that it does not block the remainder of the project.  Environmentally, the expectation is that it will be dealt with on this occasion.  People from Monaghan probably would be more familiar than I with the detail of what is involved but there is an engineering dimension with regard to how the bypass of Aughnacloy will be managed in the context of the new project.  That is probably a sensible approach to the design by Roads Service Northern Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2014062600013#R00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Daniel McSorley"},{"type":"speech","time":1403780100,"counter":1206,"content":"<p>Deputy Crowe referred to the Monaghan aspect.

The consultation process relating to this matter was exhaustive and extensive.<\/p> <p>Three routes emerged and one was chosen.  The route goes up towards the Border.  However issues arise in the area of the Tully Bog on the Aughnacloy to Ballygawley stretch of road.  That means the last part in Monaghan is not yet definitive.  The substantive part of the route has been chosen.  Up to 99% of the route has been defined and identified.  Senator White addressed the issue thoroughly.  The problem is that the corridor area is 400 m wide, which is causing distress for land owners, farmers and those whose son or daughter wishes to build on family land.  A 400 m corridor of land from Clontibret to the Border has been sterilised and no development of any kind is allowed on it, be it agricultural or residential.  We are making an appeal, in addition to what has been previously said on a strategic plan for funding in the coming years, namely, that in Donegal and Monaghan the process in terms of issues that are outside the constraints of the judicial process and the requirements relating to the environment, could be fast-tracked and made more shovel-ready.  We have made representations to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, on the Monaghan part of the route, and he is aware of the issue.  The matter is on his desk.  The provision of &euro;1.5 million could mean the corridor width could be reduced from 400 m to 100 m and the design phase would be completed.  The intention is that the project could be shovel-ready.  That would alleviate many of the pressures that have arisen due to the intention to have a sterilised corridor of 400 m, which is almost 0.5 km wide.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2014062600013#R01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n Conlon","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1403780700,"counter":1209,"content":"<p>I might address the issue raised by Mr. Pat Doherty, MP, on the status of the N14 and the Letterkenny to Strabane route.

However, what happened the A5 project since then means we cannot proceed as planned.  Those to whom we spoke in the NRA and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport said the road will be funded when the A5 is delivered.

We have Donegal, Derry, Dungannon, south Tyrone, Monaghan and Omagh and Strabane councils, Irish Central Border Area Network, ICBAN, and the north-west region cross-Border group so there is definitely no political blockage on the ground.  We are united on the project.  It is a rhetorical question that might be better answered by either the MPs or the TDs and Senators than us.  In the meetings we had in recent days I did not see any blockages.  There are details to be addressed, as Mr. Cummins, Mr. McSorley and Mr. McLaughlin have outlined.  The important one Senator White raised was that of the timeline.  Mr. McSorley addressed the indicative timeline, and these other elements have to come into place, and that is why we are here today.  It is the next level up.  If there is a political, money or any other blockage, it is not at the local level.  That is clear from the people around the table today.<\/p><p> Like Deputy Pringle, I am from the south west of the county.  Looking at the map one might not see a direct benefit to the Donegal-Killybegs area but I see the potential benefit.  The opening up of any area within our county will benefit the entire country, and I am aware there are a number of other projects whether it is the likes of Enniskillen or the port in Killybegs, in which the Irish Government invested significant moneys in the past ten or 15 years and is now showing some benefits.  While the benefits may seem far away at times, for our hub of Letterkenny-Derry it is essential for us that this project is progressed.  As Mr. McSorley said, we need the issue to be pushed forward by this committee, which we believe is the best committee to do that with both Administrations North and South.  I hope we have given the members enough of an outline to help them understand where we see it progressing.  There is an indicative timeline and I hope through their own good offices they will ensure that happens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2014062600014#S01800","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Campbell","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1403781300,"counter":1227,"content":"<p>It is clear, particularly from what Mr. McLaughlin said, that all the councils and agencies in the north west are very much focused on this project and are applying themselves to it.

Regarding the timescale, as Mr. McSorley outlined, in 2016 we should be starting to make progress.

Politicians North and South have a job to do to ensure that both the Executive and the Irish Government live up to the commitments they gave publicly.

We must be conscious of the timeframe.  The Irish Government has committed Stg&pound;25 million in 2015, as Mr. McSorley outlined, and Stg&pound;25 million in 2016.  We heard today that if it cannot be spent in 2015, the commitment is Stg&pound;50 million for 2016.

The Children's Rights Alliance unites over 100 organisations, working together to make Ireland one of the best places in the world to be a child.  We aim to improve the lives of all children and young people by campaigning for the full implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and through securing the necessary changes in Ireland's laws, policies and services.  We are delighted to be here and to accept this invitation.  We have a short period of time and I thought I would touch briefly on three areas: the current adoption system; gaps in the adoption legislation; and the commission of investigation.<\/p><p>  On the current adoption system, we would like the discussion to be framed by the right of a child to be adopted.  Adoption is the right of the child.  Adoption is a pathway to realising a child's right to grow up in a family.  When discussing adoption, we may rightly focus on the story of prospective adoptive parents, but we must be careful not to lose sight of the fact that adoption is about children, their rights and needs.  Adults do not have an automatic entitlement to adopt a child.  I flag that the child's right to adoption is mapped out in Article 21 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which I included as an appendix to the presentation provided to committee members.<\/p><p>  Moving on to look at why we need the Hague Convention, unfortunately, at times the adoption system can fall foul to criminal activity, including corruption, deception of birth parents, and the abduction, sale or trafficking of children.  Therefore, it is critical that there is a rigorous verification process for all adoptions.  The Children's Rights Alliance welcomed the ratification by Ireland of the 1993 Hague Convention, which was brought into law through the Adoption Act 2010.  The Hague Convention is the international standard setter and it is the best available framework for managing the risks inherently associated with intercountry adoption.<\/p><p>  We are also conscious that the ratification of the Hague Convention has had a profound and personal impact on hundreds of prospective adoptive parents.  The number of children available for adoption domestically and internationally has plummeted in recent years and this situation is unlikely to change in the near future.  We believe that we need to respond to this in three areas.  The first relates to the work of the Child and Family Agency, in terms of it having good communication about the changed circumstances in relation to the Hague Convention with prospective adoptive parents.  We believe that there needs to be clarity and a standardised policy on whether prospective adoption parents can undergo fertility treatment or foster while also seeking to adopt.  There seems to be inconsistency in practice around the country.<\/p><p>  Second, the agency should deliver its child care and adoptions services through one joined-up national service whereby staff would provide assessment and support to both prospective foster and adoptive parents while managing the interplay between the two in the different legal proceedings.  We welcome the fact that the Child and Family Agency is raising awareness of fostering opportunities among prospective adoptive families.<\/p><p>  Finally, we firmly believe the Hague Convention is the appropriate mechanism for Ireland and we would urge caution on the consideration of entering into bilateral agreements with non-Hague compliant countries.  On child protection concerns, we believe the Hague Convention is an essential component of the Irish legal framework and we should not deviate from it.<\/p><p>  As I am conscious of time, I will touch briefly on a few areas where I believe there are gaps in the adoption legislation.  The first area is information and tracing.  I understand the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Charles Flanagan, commented in his maiden speech on this issue and has committed to prioritising a Bill in this area.  This is a pressing issue.  Under the UN convention, children have the right to their identity.  That right must be respected and mechanisms are needed to ensure that such rights can be fulfilled when the child reaches the age of 18.<\/p><p>  The second area is open or semi-open adoption.  As the committee will be aware, Ireland operates a closed system of adoption.  We believe there needs to be reform to allow for an open adoption system which, we believe, would encourage parents of children who are in the care system to place their children for adoption.  We believe this is an important mechanism that would improve the adoption system.<\/p><p>  An important piece of legislation, the children and family relationships Bill, was published earlier this year.  It addresses an area which can be called either step-parent adoption or second-parent adoption.  This is an issue whereby the natural mother of a child, if she wishes for her spouse to adopt her child but the spouse is not the natural father of the child, must give up her own child for adoption and then establish a connection to her child by undergoing a joint adoption with her new spouse.  It is a convoluted process.  It represents the majority of cases that the Adoption Authority deals with - in 2013, the Adoption Authority processed 116 adoptions, 86 of which were second-parent adoptions.  We believe that this is an unnecessary mechanism to establish a connection between a non-biological parent of a child and the child.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014062600003#D00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Maria Corbett"},{"type":"speech","time":1403771400,"counter":1238,"content":"<p>Would Ms Corbett go over that again because I did not get it?<\/p> <p>It is confusing and I am sorry if I am not making it clearer.  What the children and family relationships Bill proposes to do is introduce a form of guardianship that would be extended to the spouse or civil partner to allow him to create a legal relationship with the child.  Rather than requiring the mother to give up her own child for adoption and re-adopt that child as part of a married couple, one could create a special form of guardianship to allow a connection between the non-biological parent and the child.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014062600003#D00400","speaker":"989","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1403772000,"counter":1240,"content":"<p>What are the figures?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014062600004#E00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1403772000,"counter":1241,"content":"<p>The figures I have, from the Adoption Authority, are for 2013.

There is a clear need for the commission to examine the issue of adoption.  From anecdotal evidence and initial reviews undertaken, it is likely that two issues will emerge.  It appears that some adoptions may have been forced and were, therefore, unlawful in that the full and free consent of the birth mother was not secured.  In other cases, it may have been that an adoption never actually took place but instead that the child's birth was unlawfully registered.  Obviously, both scenarios raise serious concern and require full investigation.  I acknowledge that this issue is under review but I wish to make the point that these issues really require public investigation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014062600004#E00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Maria Corbett"},{"type":"speech","time":1403772000,"counter":1242,"content":"<p>I welcome Ms Susan Lohan, co-founder of the Adoption Rights Alliance, and the co-ordinator in the North, Ms Edel Byrne.

The group was founded by me and Ms Claire McGettrick.  Shortly afterwards, we were joined by Mari Steed, our US co-ordinator.  Interestingly, Ms Steed is probably one of Ireland's first intercountry adoptees because she was one of the 2,000 children trafficked from Ireland to the United States for adoption.  Therefore, we have some valuable insight into the whole experience from her.  We can learn from some of her observations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014062600004#E00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Susan Lohan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1403772000,"counter":1244,"content":"<p>As Ms Lohan stated, it is forgotten that Ireland started out as being a sending country for intercountry adoptees.  We are gravely concerned that the Irish intercountry adoption system has become a service for adults instead of a service for children.  Adoption is not an adult right; it is about finding homes for children in extreme circumstances, whose immediate families, close relatives or wider community or fellow citizens cannot care for them.<br\/>In the Hague Convention, adoption is seen as a measure of last resort.  Since Ireland's ratification of the convention, there has been a considerable outcry over the drop in the number of adoptions.  We support the Adoption Authority's contention that its work should not be measured by the number of adoptions but, rather, by the quality and propriety of those adoptions.  Mr. Nigel Cantwell&rsquo;s opinion piece in the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>last September shows we cannot have it both ways in adoption policy.  We have the article available for members.<br\/>Ireland is not out of sync with other receiving countries.  Some journalists and certain broadsheet publications have reported that the numbers of children adopted into Ireland from abroad was 11 in 2012 when the actual number was in fact 117.  Ms Laura Mart&iacute;nez-Mora, the principal legal officer for the Hague Conference on Private International Law, reflects those numbers in her documentation.  Falling numbers of children available for intercountry adoption are becoming an international norm as sending countries develop their own domestic adoption systems.<br\/>I encourage members to review the Tristan Dowes case.<b><\/b>The circumstances in question were cited in Trinity College&rsquo;s Study of Intercountry Adoption Outcomes in Ireland and no action appears to have been taken as a result.  The Adoption Rights Alliance reported this issue to Deputy Frances Fitzgerald when she was Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, and also to the Adoption Authority and the HSE, all to no avail.  The HSE claimed it cannot monitor the success or otherwise of any adoption as it would be seen to be discriminatory.  We have anecdotal evidence to show there is some breakdown in country adoption for some children in Ireland.  Historically, Ireland&rsquo;s adoption system has put the needs and wants of adults before those of children, resulting in a disturbing culture of entitlement, which is bolstered by a lack of courage on the part of many of our politicians and public figures who bow to calls for the re-opening of corrupt countries from which we used to adopt.<br\/>Ireland&rsquo;s treatment of children in intercountry adoption has all the makings of the subject matter of a Ryan report of the future.  The mere fact that the register of intercountry adoptions, by contrast with the register of domestic adoptions, is closed will make it next to impossible for adoptees or birth families to reconnect in years to come.<br\/>It seems clear we have learned nothing from our nation&rsquo;s past and those with the power to influence and change ought to think about how they will be viewed in the court of history.  Those individuals, institutions and organisations have a duty to pay attention to the needs of these children and listen to those of us who try to give them a voice, and they should have the courage to say no to the adults demanding the right to be parents.<br\/>We should listen to Interpol&rsquo;s<font color=\"#2F2F2F\"> assistant director on human trafficking, an Irishman called Michael Moran, who has described illegal intercountry adoption as an example of human trafficking.  No Member of either House of the Oireachtas will be able to stand up in ten years&rsquo; time and claim he had no idea of what was going on.<\/font><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014062600004#E00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Edel Byrne"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1403772000,"counter":1245,"content":"<p>Let me refer briefly to Ireland's history of intercountry adoption as a sending country.  It is worth referring to the practices that obtained from the 1940s to the 1970s in that regard.  There is considerable evidence of corruption on the part of State actors and religious organisations in the movement of children to other countries.  All of this is well exposed in Mike Milotte&rsquo;s book <i>Banished Babies<\/i>.  It is disturbing that, on foot of having that knowledge, we have proceeded to develop bilateral agreements of a lower standard than what is stipulated in the Hague Convention with so many countries that would feature quite prominently at the top of Transparency International's corruption index.  I refer to countries in respect of which we would refuse or be reluctant to have trade arrangements because we simply do not trust their paperwork.  It is disturbing that, with many of the sending countries, we have no idea how they will tackle the problems of adopted people coming back in the future to trace their relatives, as is absolutely inevitable.  They will suffer many disadvantages because they will not even be able to translate their own birth records or original files.  There is very little oversight of this.<br\/>We are also troubled by the fact that, in 2013, the former Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, sought to unpick some of the protective measures that had been set out in the Hague Convention, which we ratified in 2010.  That has been criticised internationally, no less than by Nigel Cantwell, whose recent article was referred to by Ms Byrne.<br\/>We are also disturbed by the connection of intercountry adoption arrangements with trade missions that the Irish State undertakes.  There have been a number of cases in which talks on bilateral agreements have been attached to trade missions.  That only feeds into the narrative that children are really a commodity in this matter.  On the actual narrative, we are concerned about comments in the print and televisual media that the case of adoptive parents who feel disappointed at the reducing number of children available for adoption warrants cross-party intervention at the very highest level.  Mr. Nigel Cantwell and other experts in this area can readily attest to the fact that the decrease in the number of intercountry adoptions is a very positive development because it attests to the fact that countries that were previously sending children have developed more mature systems of catering for vulnerable and orphaned children in their jurisdictions.<br\/>I urge members to return to their parties and really caution fellow party members on taking at face value some of the lobbying on this issue.  If the previous Minister for Children and Youth Affairs could amend legislation to accommodate 23 couples who wanted to adopt from a country not in compliance with the Hague Convention, surely the current Minister for Children and Youth Affairs could introduce the legislation we desire.<\/p> <p>At this stage, we reckon there are about 100,000 adopted people in Ireland.  Yesterday, we were pleased to meet the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Charles Flanagan, to discuss some of the terms of reference for the commission of inquiry into practices surrounding adoption in mother and baby homes.  The Minister gave us an undertaking that he is most concerned to have tracing and information legislation out as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014062600004#E00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Susan Lohan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1403772600,"counter":1247,"content":"<p>I now welcome from the International Adoption Association (Ireland), Ms Ruth Lennon, chair, and Ms Trish Connolly, administrative director.

The IAA is a voluntary support group and the leading support organisation for families engaged in intercountry adoption in Ireland.  Currently, more than 5,000 children are entered on the register of foreign adoptions.<br\/>We understand that Ireland is in a transition period since the enactment of the Adoption Act 2020, but we have identified a number of concerns and issues within the current process.  I will outline the priority issues for us, the first of which is the capacity of the Adoption Authority of Ireland, AAI, to carry out its functions.  We also believe that the Adoption Act 2010 is too restrictive and should be reviewed.<br\/>Inconsistencies have emerged across the country through the assessment process.  Tusla is the agency managing the assessment process and there are huge inconsistencies in how people are treated during that process.  We also believe the AAI is not adequately resourced to carry out its functions.<br\/>The IAA acknowledges that the landscape is changing across the globe as regards intercountry adoptions and that numbers are falling.  As a group of parents and prospective parents, we welcome this because we see that, as reported by the ISS, standards are improving within countries.  This is leading to increased domestic adoption locally, which is welcomed by all of us.<br\/>There is no denying, however, that adoption figures have dropped.  Reports commissioned by the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption show that they have dropped by over 50% globally.  By comparison, Ireland is looking at a post-Hague Convention situation.  It is not that our adoption figures have dropped by 50%, they have completely collapsed to 11, which is an accurate post-Hague number of adoptions in Ireland in a three-year period.<br\/>The fact remains that, despite improvements at local level in countries, there are still hundreds of thousands of children languishing in institutions worldwide.  They are not getting the opportunity to become part of a family.  It is estimated there are just under 18 million orphans who have lost both parents.  They are living in orphanages, in institutions or, worse still, on the streets.  We believe they deserve and warrant the opportunity to be part of a family.  We must remember that that is one of the core principles of the Hague Convention.<br\/>In November 2010, Ireland enacted the Hague Convention which is to protect children and their families against illegal and irregular activities.  The IAA and the wider community welcome the introduction of the Hague Convention.  We recognise strongly that adoption is a service for children and not for prospective adoptive parents.  We have no doubt about that.  However, since the convention's introduction, there has been growing frustration and disillusionment across the community over the lack of effective implementation of the principles by our own central authority.<br\/>An article by Rosita Boland, published in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>in March 2004, revealed that the number of adoptions was 446 pre-Hague and 11 post-Hague.  That is the future scenario.<br\/>We have a higher standard of implementing bilateral agreements compared with our other fellow convention member states.  Currently, the condition is that every proposed bilateral agreement is required to be passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  We contend that the power of bilaterals should rest with the central authority, as is the case with other convention states.  We also believe that if a country has signed up to the Hague Convention, but has not fully ratified it and is thereby working within the principles and spirit of that convention, it should be accepted as a sending country by way of an agreement.<br\/>We are concerned that intercountry adoption has no direction.  There does not seem to be any real responsibility or idea about how we want to perform.  There is continued wasted expenditure by the State on the assessment process, which is costly.  Once people get their declaration, they have little hope of ever effecting an adoption.<br\/>The Adoption Authority has advised us that it has made 23 submissions to the Department on proposed amendments to this young legislation which only dates from 2010.  The IAA is concerned about the defensive approach that the Adoption Authority has taken, particularly in its defence of the 11 post-Hague adoptions.  We believe it is a deliberate distraction from performance failure.  We are calling for greater transparency and accountability by the authority.<br\/>Since 2010, the AAI has accredited three adoption mediation agencies.  The authority has indicated to us that that was based on the expectation that adoptions would not collapse as they have done, but that intercountry adoptions would continue into Ireland.  The Adoption Agency now confirms that there is not a need for three agencies.  We understand that the Department has confirmed it will only fund one agency.<br\/>The time, effort and cost spent by the State in processing these accreditations should be examined, along with the apparent lack of consideration for the agency's long-term sustainability.  We firmly believe that the authority needs to engage urgently with countries where children are available for intercountry adoption.  Those engagements and plans should be regularly updated and advised to those who are interested in the process.<br\/>Tusla is the agency responsible for the application process and, as I mentioned earlier, we believe there are inconsistencies.  This is our experience from people who are currently being assessed across the country.  It is broadly recognised that the age profile of a child will be older and they may also have additional needs.  However, there appears to be a lack of willingness to assess couples for adopting older children or children with additional needs.  For example, a couple advised us that they asked their social worker to assess them for an older child, but were told: &quot;No.  The criteria is that you either need to have a medical background or children in the family already.&quot;  When they said they were aware of another couple who had been approved, the response was: &quot;Oh, that must just be in a different region.&quot;  It is a matter of grave concern to us that if a person is assessed in Cork, it may be a different experience from being assessed in Dublin.<br\/>We would support the Adoption Authority on the idea of amending the legislation with regard to the current lifespan of the declaration.  The declaration has a definitive lifespan of up to three years, which is not sufficient to effect an adoption.  That matter needs to be re-examined.<br\/>When the Adoption Act was enacted in 2010, the IAA was extremely disappointed that there was no provision for post-adoption services, as laid down in our Act.  While the Hague Convention does not call for the mandatory provision of such services, it certainly highly recommends them.  While there are certain providers, their accessibility for parents and families in need of such services is not standard throughout the country.<br\/>I will now summarise the IAA's recommendations.  We request that an external review of the Adoption Authority&rsquo;s operations over the period of time since Ireland ratified the Hague Convention be carried out.  The adoption legislation is too restrictive and should be reviewed.  The Adoption Authority should be adequately resourced to make the changes necessary to implement the Hague Convention to a standard that meets the criteria as set out in the convention.<br\/>As I have already mentioned, we are concerned that the assessment process should be consistent throughout the country.<\/p> <p>A review of Tusla policy is necessary to ensure we are adequately and responsibly assessing people throughout the country in line with global intercountry adoption changes.  We require a review of availability and provision of post-adoption services on a national basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014062600005#F00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Ruth Lennon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1403773200,"counter":1250,"content":"<p>The final set of speakers in this segment is from the Adoption Authority of Ireland.

The Adoption Authority of Ireland is the national central authority for adoptions in Ireland.  The authority's functions are carried out pursuant to the Adoption Act 2010 and the 1993 Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Intercountry Adoption.  The three adoption service areas regulated by the authority and covered in my opening statement are domestic adoption, information and tracing and intercountry adoption.<\/p><p>  Domestic adoption occurs when families living in Ireland adopt a child in Ireland.  Domestic adoption was legalised in Ireland in 1952.  To date, there have been in excess of 46,000 domestic adoption orders finalised by the authority and its predecessor, the Adoption Board.  In 2013, 116 adoption orders were granted, of which 86 were step family adoptions.  The authority granted 164 declarations of eligibility and suitability for domestic adoption in the same year.  The authority welcomed the children's referendum in November 2012, the result of which has yet to be ratified, as it highlighted the rights and best interests of children and sought to ensure the voice of the child would be heard in all matters concerning the child.  In its commitment to domestic adoption, the authority works closely with the Child and Family Agency to place children in need of adoptive homes in Ireland in a timely and child-centred fashion.<\/p><p>  In 2012 and 2013, a number of issues requiring legal attention were brought to the attention of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs by the authority, including the option of open adoption; a legal means other than adoption to be explored in step family and extended family situations to establish the rights and responsibilities of adoptive parents without changing the status of the child's mother to that of adoptive parent and to prevent the birth or natural father's loss of rights and responsibilities in relation to the child; and the removal of the automatic legal right to an assessment for adoption.  Due to the legal right to assessment, no legal restriction can be placed on the number of people seeking assessment for adoption.<\/p><p>  To turn to information and tracing, I note that in Ireland identifying information is not given to people who were adopted nor to their birth relatives without each other's consent as there is no legal basis to release the information.  Case law has prohibited the release of identifying information to people involved in adoption to date.  There is, therefore, little legal basis for the existence of services in this area.  As there have been in excess of 46,000 legal domestic adoptions affecting at least 150,000 Irish citizens and unknown numbers of illegal registrations, the authority believes that provision of a legal framework in this area is urgent.<\/p><p>  The National Adoption Contact Preference Register, NACPR, was set up by the former Adoption Board in 2005.  It allows birth relatives and people who were adopted to express their choice for contact or a veto on such contact with a blood relative.  In 2012 and 2013, there were 1,236 applications to join the NACPR, which resulted in 125 matches in those years.  By the end of 2013, there were almost 7,500 adopted people and 3,400 natural relatives on the register.  This has resulted in 670 matches to date.  As the NACPR is voluntary and passive, its success depends on the number of adopted persons and birth relatives choosing to register their wishes in relation to contact.  This is because people register and are matched before any connection can be made between the parties.  Any enquirers to the authority, the Child and Family Agency's adoption services or accredited adoption service providers are routinely informed about the existence of the register and strongly encouraged to join.  The authority appeals to any other persons or organisations with an interest in this area to do the same.<\/p><p>  The authority holds the view that all people who have been adopted have rights to identifying information.  Release of birth certificates when an adult adopted person reaches 18 years must be given serious consideration by the Legislature.  The authority has made submissions to the Minister in this regard.  As is the case in other jurisdictions, the authority believes that the release of identifying information should be a legal right subject to certain conditions such as a veto for the birth or natural mother or person who was adopted of the release of information or contact, or being informed prior to the event, and counselling or mediation prior to release of the information.  International experience and research demonstrate that access to knowledge of birth family and the availability of professional counselling and mediation services in the area of search and reunion are essential post-adoption services for people involved in the lifelong process that is adoption.  In the absence of legislation to frame practice, people have resorted to a number of methods to connect with birth families.  The use of social media has resulted in immediate contact without the safeguards such as counselling and time required to protect all parties' rights in this highly sensitive area.<\/p><p>  The authority has made submissions to the Minister to the effect that people who believe themselves to be adopted or believe that they placed their children for adoption, such as people affected by illegal birth registrations, should also be free to avail of post-adoption services and have a legal right to be given identifying information where this is available.  It should also be noted that managing expectations about the level and accuracy of available information on old records is an important issue for those seeking information about birth relatives.  The Adoption Board, now the authority, called for the introduction of legislation in this area as far back as 1983.  While the difficulties of drafting legislation in such a complex and sensitive area are acknowledged, the lack of a statutory basis continues to cause difficulties in the provision of a national adoption information and tracing service to meet the needs of thousands of adopted people and their birth or natural relatives.<\/p><p>  In respect of intercountry adoption, there are at least 14 times more prospective Irish parents seeking to adopt babies and children than there are children being referred to Ireland for adoption from abroad.  People seeking to adopt young and healthy babies are most unlikely to have a child placed with them due to the worldwide decrease in the number of infants available for adoption.  However, large numbers of older children and children with special needs continue to live in orphanages and state institutions around the world and can often be available for intercountry adoption.  In 2013, the authority granted 266 declarations of eligibility and suitability to people seeking to adopt abroad and 141 entries were made in the register of intercountry adoptions.<\/p><p>  The authority hosted the 18th informal meeting of European central authorities for intercountry adoption in Dublin and 55 delegates attended from 23 countries.  Representatives from the Hague Permanent Bureau and UNICEF also attended.  Trends identified throughout Europe were that children available for adoption are getting older; the majority of children available for adoption will be regarded as \"special needs\" - a term used in those countries; the number of children available for adoption is decreasing worldwide; and the viability of many European accredited bodies is in doubt due to the decreasing number of intercountry adoptions.  As a result, the preparation for prospective adoptive parents will have to take account of the new reality and prospective adoptive parents and adoption service providers must manage their expectations of intercountry adoption in line with the current realities.<\/p><p>  During 2012 and 2013, the authority continued to progress negotiations under the Hague Convention with a number of jurisdictions in an attempt to conclude administrative arrangements in the area of intercountry adoption.  Equally important are the functions of accredited bodies in this field.  Due to the challenges faced by children with additional needs and the difficulties faced by prospective adoptive parents in effecting adoptions in foreign countries, the use of accredited bodies in facilitating intercountry adoption on behalf of families and in line with the Hague Convention is considered best practice and is promoted by the authority.  There are approximately 650 valid declarations for intercountry adoption in Ireland while there are decreased numbers of infants adoptable worldwide, notwithstanding that the numbers of older children and children with additional or special needs remain at high levels in institutions.  There are, therefore, a significant number of Irish families with declarations which are unlikely to result in the adoption of a child.  The number of children being adopted internationally has been falling significantly in recent years.  This is due to the regulatory standards imposed by the Hague Convention in the intercountry adoption process, the fact that most prospective parents want to adopt young and healthy infants, and the putting in place by many countries of origin of child protection frameworks domestically which are aimed at maintaining children within their native countries.  It must also be said that prior to the State's ratification of the 1993 Hague Convention in November 2010, Ireland had a disproportionately high level of private independent adoptions, that is, adoptions not involving the national central authority in the country of origin.<\/p><p>  Children are often over 18 months old when available for intercountry adoption.  Generally, such children are between three and six years old as well as which they may have an older or younger sibling and, in many cases, additional health or medical needs.  The international trend is that children are being placed on average from about four years of age having spent 44 months in institutional care.<\/p> <p>The authority has made a comprehensive submission to the Minister with regard to possible amendments to the Adoption Act 2010.<\/p><p> Adoption legislation was first legislated for in Ireland in 1952.  To date, there have been in excess of 46,000 adoption orders made.  The number of adoption orders made in one year peaked in 1967 at 1,493.  During this entire period, the legal definition of adoption has remained the same but the profile of adoption in Ireland has undergone tremendous change.  This change is characterised by the decline in the total number of adoption orders granted; the decline in traditional infant adoption; the practice of open adoption; an increase in family adoptions particularly step parent adoptions; in exceptional circumstances, the adoption of marital children; the legal requirement to consult birth fathers in adoption applications; a significant increase in the rate of intercountry adoption from 1991 to 2010; a significant decrease in the numbers of intercountry adoptions since 2010; an upsurge in the number of information and tracing queries countrywide; increasing demands for post-adoption services; the establishment of the National Adoption Contact Preference Register in 2005; the introduction of the Adoption Act 2010, including the Hague Convention standards; and changes in the profile of children available for adoption from babies to older children with additional needs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014062600006#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kiernan Gildea","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1403773800,"counter":1253,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Gildea.

I join the Chairman and my colleagues on the committee in welcoming each of the witnesses here.  It has been very helpful.  Indeed the witnesses' print submissions are very useful references for all of us working in these areas.  I thank the witnesses sincerely for that.<\/p><p>  I have a small number of questions.  There is a clear distinction between some of the voices here this morning concerning intercountry adoption outside of Hague Convention sign-offs.  I note that the Children's Rights Alliance expresses caution in this regard.  Could Ms Corbett elaborate on that?  I apologise that I will not be able to remain here to hear what she has to say, but I will pick it up in the transcript of the meeting subsequently.  I feel it is a very important area.  There is no question that we all understand and accept that this is about the child first and foremost.  That said, there are many prospective parents in Ireland whose hearts are broken because they have not been able to fulfil a personal and shared ambition to become adoptive parents.  That is a reality we cannot ignore.<\/p><p>  In its submission, the Children's Rights Alliance said that it urged caution in respect of the consideration of entering into bilateral agreements with countries that are not compliant with the Hague Convention given child protection concerns.  I can understand that but I will only try to open it up a bit because what better protections might some of these children have than to be placed in the care of parents who have gone through the very rigorous assessment process we have here and who tick the boxes in terms of what is expected and what must be provided?<\/p><p>  There is a pending commission of investigation into mother and baby homes and similar institutions.  We do not yet have a definitive list but I certainly do not want to stop at mother and baby homes in terms of someone's idea that this is what it is all about.  It is about an awful lot more.  We want to see terms of reference that will address this in a very holistic way.  It needs to be done.  The Children's Rights Alliance mentioned adoptions that never actually took place but where the child's birth was unlawfully registered.  I can only second-guess what the alliance is saying here but could Ms Corbett elaborate on it in order that we fully understand what she referred to?<\/p><p>  I thank Ms Lohan and Ms Byrne for their contribution.  We have the Adoption Authority of Ireland here with us.  I am very mindful of the terms of reference of the commission of investigation.  The Adoption Rights Alliance's submission referred to \"a delay largely caused by the deliberate obstruction of a registered adoption agency, never sanctioned by the Adoption Board\/Adoption Authority despite years of complaints against them\".  It is a question for the Adoption Authority of Ireland.  I have no doubt that we are looking at historic situations here.  There is not a finger of accusation as to contemporary practice but this is part of the story that must now be told and exposed.  I invite witnesses to elaborate on that because these things can be missed.  I noted the meeting with the Minister yesterday but things can be missed and if we do not get the terms of reference right, this project will fail in completing its job of work.  Would speakers from the Adoption Authority of Ireland like to comment on whether they accept or believe that this point merits historic investigation?  I appreciate that the clock has beaten me and I apologise to the rest of the attendees.  I am sure my colleagues will pick up on other questions.  I apologise but I must leave.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014062600007#H00300","speaker":"969"},{"type":"speech","time":1403773800,"counter":1255,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Troy for his co-operation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014062600007#H00400","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1403773800,"counter":1256,"content":"<p>I apologise to our guests for being late.  Unfortunately, I have another commitment and must leave shortly.  In respect of international adoption, like many of my colleagues, I have received numerous items of correspondence and representations relating to families who wish to adopt internationally.  Following the Adoption Act 2010, people can only adopt from countries that have signed the Hague Convention.  There is a growing call for more bilateral agreements with other countries - Russia and India, to name two.  I would like to hear the opinions of our guests regarding this issue.  As Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in said, the best interests of the child must be the paramount consideration in all cases.  One wonders whether a child would be better off moving to a foreign country where they would have a loving home as opposed to possibly spending the majority of their childhood in some sort of institution.  We must weigh up both scenarios.<\/p><p>  Listening to RTE radio the other evening, I heard a report from the High Court about four cases in front of Mr. Justice Henry Abbott involving fathers.  In each case, the father of the child was unknown and the parties wished to proceed with an adoption.  Until now, one had to make sure fathers had signed away their right.  Perhaps that is not the right word but I think the witnesses know what I am saying.  The challenge to the children's rights referendum has delayed matters.  The previous Minister for Children and Youth Affairs had given a commitment that she was going to update the adoption legislation.  The challenge to the referendum has delayed the updating of the adoption register.<\/p> <p>I would like to hear the view of the witnesses on what needs to be changed in the legislation.<\/p><p> Having met Ms Lohan previously, I am aware that the Adoption Rights Alliance has been to the fore in advocating for the information and tracing Bill, which will give people the fundamental right to their identity.  It is regrettable that this Government and, it must be acknowledged, its predecessors have dragged their heels on this legislation.  The harrowing stories that emerged in recent weeks regarding the mother and baby homes have highlighted the critical need for the legislation.  The previous Minister for Justice and Equality identified constitutional issues which prevent the introduction of the Bill.  I would welcome the view of the witnesses in that regard.  I apologise that I must also cover the D&aacute;il today.  That is the problem with being a Member from a small party.

I welcome that the committee is considering the issue of adoption.  As we have agreed to consider separately the issues pertaining to information and tracing, I will focus my comments on domestic and intercountry adoptions and to briefly consider the legislation.<br\/>In regard to domestic adoption, we passed the children's referendum in 2011 but the Supreme Court is still considering it.  In the absence of the Supreme Court judgment, 6,500 children are in care, of whom 92% are in foster care and just under one third, or 2,000 children, are in long-term foster care and potentially eligible for adoption.  In 2013, 20 adoptions took place involving children in long-term foster care, which equates to 1% of the 2,000 children in long-term care.  These children will potentially be available for adoption if and, I hope, when the amendment Bill is enacted.  I am conscious that every day we delay enacting the amending legislation, children are turning 18 years old and their rights are being expunged.  What is the Adoption Authority doing to prepare for the change to the law allowing these children to be adopted?  The worst case scenario is that in the time period between the approval of the amending Act and the introduction of further legislation, we will not be ready for children who can legally be adopted.  Sometimes when we discuss the issue of adoption we immediately jump to intercountry adoption.  There are children in Ireland who wish to be adopted and in respect of whom everybody agrees to their adoption.  There is no contention but they are not being given this second chance in life.<br\/>Intercountry adoption is a sensitive issue.  I am happy that Ireland is a signatory to the Hague Convention.  We were at the end of the list because we were so late ratifying it.  Mr. Gildea mentioned some of the figures involved.  According to the figures presented at the April conference, Ireland is medium to average when it comes to intercountry adoptions.  The International Adoption Association has cited a figure of 11 adoptions in the last three years.  I cannot find the basis for that figure.  Perhaps the Adoption Authority can clarify the matter.  The figure is regularly repeated in the media but I do not know the source.  This morning the authority set out a figure of 141 for 2013.  The presentation from Hague indicated that in 2012, Ireland had 117 intercountry adoptions.  I want to understand the basis for the figure of 11 adoptions.<br\/>If a prospective adoptive parent goes for assessment, he or she is automatically assessed, and often it is not until two or three years into the process that he or she is told the reality, as the authority has outlined, that there are 14 times more applications than there are available adoptees and that the children are going to be older and more likely to have disabilities.  It is a serious issue if we are not being upfront with prospective adoptive parents about the availability and the likelihood of adoption.  It is something we have to address.  We are carrying out assessments needlessly.<br\/>The International Adoption Association raised an issue regarding inconsistency in assessments.  However, I have also read about negative assessments being overturned in a study of intercountry adoptions carried out in 2005.  Children ended up in care after being adopted because they were not being monitored.  A promise was given to establish a database on these figures.  Where stands the authority in that regard?<br\/>In respect of prospective legislation, I am a supporter of open adoption and the right to identity.  The Adoption Rights Alliance and the Children's Rights Alliance have clearly stated their position on these issues.  I do not agree with the Government on the constitutional block.  If we consider the case of I. O'T. <i>v.<\/i>B, it was quite clear in regard to the right to identity in that it invited the Government to introduce legislation to clarify the situation and determine the balance by statute.  We need to consider carefully the possibility of establishing a system of open adoption and the right to identity.  However, I ask the authority, in light of its experience in this area, whether it is satisfactory, if we introduce this legislation, to arbitrarily provide that anyone born on a certain date will have a right to his or her identity but those born before the date will not have that right.  We will have to consider that issue seriously.<br\/>Several years ago a number of international reports raised serious questions about accredited bodies.  I ask the authority whether it can assure me these questions have been addressed and that all bodies' accreditation is up to date.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014062600008#J00300","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1403774400,"counter":1260,"content":"<p>Deputy Anne Ferris has introduced an open adoption Bill in the D&aacute;il.

What is the cost to the State of the several cases that are currently before the High Court?  Can parents be helped so that they do not have to go through the High Court?  I have been contacted by very distressed parents.

The most difficult thing we have to do is tell people they may become infertile.  It is desperate.  I see this from the other side and it is a discussion I have frequently.  I also have discussions with patients who have gone through cancer treatment, been cured and, many years later, are trying to engage with the adoption services.  While it is a truism, and we all agree, that children's rights must come first, there is another side to the story.  There are people on the other side who have reasonable expectations and who must be treated correctly and with sensitivity.  We must understand that the rights of the child are not some kind of balance against which the rights of the prospective parents are see-sawed.  It is better for both if adoption happens.

Could they tease that out and point out how it could be improved?  Could somebody tell me whether the number of children adopted into Ireland from abroad in 2012 was 11 or 117?  Rosita Boland, who wrote the article, is in the Visitors Gallery, and she deserves great credit for getting this public debate going again.  I would be happy if the committee were to invite Ms Boland to answer questions, now that she is here.  I would like to know the answer because everything hinges on it.<\/p><p>  I have received representations about the structure and practices of the Adoption Authority of Ireland and I would like to know more.  The assumption that legitimate, legal, ethical adoptions began only when the Irish Civil Service became involved is not correct.  We all know people who have been through adoption processes over the years which have worked extraordinarily well and have brought great joy and happiness to both sides.  What is the authority's budget?  How many administrative and front-line staff does it have?  Does it have a PR contract?  It has outsourced some of its activities to a group called Arc Adoptions.  A prospective parent who engages with the service must pay a fee of &euro;2,750 to Arc Adoptions at the outset of the process and every telephone call made with Arc Adoptions attracts a fee of &euro;66, which I find surprising.  As a doctor, I do not charge my patients or their relatives for telephone calls, and I do not think many doctors do.  I do not know why Arc Adoptions charges &euro;66 for a telephone consultation.  What functions has the authority outsourced to Arc Adoptions?  One of our expert witnesses today is a social worker with the agency.  I would like to know whether the agency has enough front-line staff to perform its functions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014062600009#K00200","speaker":"1147"},{"type":"speech","time":1403775000,"counter":1264,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  Many of the issues I wanted to raise have already been raised.  On average, how long does it take for people to get a certificate of suitability, from the date they apply to the date the assessment is completed?  What is the average time from the date a person is deemed to be suitable and has the appropriate declaration to the date of adoption?  There must be many people declared suitable to adopt on the list, because the number adopted is much lower than the number deemed suitable.  How many are deemed suitable but have not yet adopted?  It is important that people be aware of these figures.  It must be very difficult for people who are very committed to adopting and who find they are waiting, or are unsuccessful.  I am not sure people are aware of this when they begin the process.<\/p><p>  Since 1952, there have been approximately 46,000 illegal adoptions in Ireland.  Have we any idea, in view of the media coverage, of the number of illegal adoptions where different structures were established?  For example, there was a structure whereby a pregnant person checked into a maternity unit under the name of the person who wanted to adopt the child, ensuring the birth certificate gave no indication that the child was adopted.  In view of recent media coverage of one place in Dublin, have we any idea of the number of such occurrences and the scale on which it happened?  It also happened in other areas of the country.  Given that there is no information available to such people about their natural parents, is the Adoption Authority is examining structures it might establish to deal with the issue in view of recent media coverage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014062600009#K00300","speaker":"1150"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1403775000,"counter":1265,"content":"<p>I will address the issue of the bilateral agreements under the Hague Convention and the question of the unlawful registrations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014062600009#K00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Maria Corbett"},{"type":"speech","time":1403775000,"counter":1266,"content":"<p>There may be a vote in the D&aacute;il.

The Hague Convention sets out the minimum standards under which countries should operate.  It has taken us a long time to get inside the Hague Convention network.  We are there now and we cannot trust the processes in countries outside the Hague Convention countries.<\/p> <p>It is quite clear from the 2009 ISS report that the circumstances by which the children are placed for adoption have been questioned.  For example, the report states the number of \"abandonments\" depends considerably on the extent to which there is demand for the children concerned.  If there was a demand for infant children, small children were effectively being placed for adoption.  It is not conscionable that Ireland would engage in adoptions with a country when it does not know that those it is dealing with are not involved child trafficking, child abduction, deception of parents and falsification of documents.  These are the details of what has been found internationally to have happened, not 20, 40 or 60 years ago but in the past few years.<\/p><p> It is a difficult issue for the prospective adopting families and I understand their personal pain as they wish to create or expand their families.  They also wish to be protective of the children they have adopted who are being raised as citizens in Ireland as part of our community, and we need to be careful not to stigmatise them.  I am conscious that when I speak I may cast question marks over adoptions in Ireland and I may stigmatise those children.  I do not want to do that and I wish I did not have to make those statements, but I need to be clear that we are not able to trust the processes in non-Hague-Convention countries.  The convention was established to set minimum standards for adoptions and we have to stay within it.  There is no reason we would go outside it, as that would be a breach of children's rights.<\/p><p> The question was posed about children's rights versus parents' rights.  This is a child protection issue.  We do not know whether children are legitimately given up with the free and full consent of the birth parents or whether substantial money has changed hands in a corruptive practice.  We cannot engage in that.  While we are conscious of the personal plight of families who wish to adopt, our answer is not to go outside the Hague Convention and to engage with the Child and Family Agency.  It is about being honest, up-front and clear with them.  While they have a right to an assessment, do they want to be one of 14 waiting for one child in a lengthy, expensive, difficult and emotionally draining process?  We have a large number of children in the foster service.  We are constantly in need of new foster families.  There is a hope that we will, in time and with legislative backing, be able to allow children in long-term foster care to be adopted by their foster families.  This is a domestic solution to children who need homes in Ireland.  It is also a way to address the genuine need and desire of families to create or expand their own families.  I cannot put it any more black and white than this.  We have to resist the emotional request from prospective adoptive families to move us outside the convention.  There is no reason to do that.  If one respects children's rights and is concerned about child protection, we must stay within the convention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014062600009#K00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Maria Corbett","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1403775600,"counter":1269,"content":"<p>It is imperative that we stay within the convention.

To the credit of the then Government, that agreement was suspended.  There was not only an international report on those adoptions but also a domestic report done by a Vietnamese Government department, which found evidence of the same corruption.  It is naive to think that there are not people in Vietnam who are willing to exploit children and vulnerable families for this.  Nobody suggests that prospective adoptive parents in Ireland are corrupt.  Highly organised people in the sending countries are corrupt.  The expression \"triad gangs\" has been used.  They are not only involved in the corrupt trafficking of children for adoption abroad; they are engaged in trafficking abroad, because they are aware of the fact that there is a market for young children, which is demand-led.

We believe bilateral agreements should be allowed.  The Hague Convention makes provision for such agreements.  At the AAI conference on 14 April, the then Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Fitzgerald said: \"The countries that have most children for adoption are countries where bilaterals should be entered into, where they have the least organised central authorities and infrastructures.\"  However, many of those countries are operating with the principles of the Hague Convention and against certain standards.  Many of our European partners have bilaterals in place and they successfully effect transparent, ethical and not hugely costly and expensive adoptions.<\/p><p>  Fees have been mentioned.  For example, an adoption from Ethiopia will be effected for a couple of hundred euro or US dollars.  One pays one's own court fees and does not require facilitators.  I refer to other countries where we have had agencies approved.  Prior to 2010, when Ireland implemented the Hague Convention, we had a bilateral agreement with Vietnam.  The fees were on record and they were approximately $9,000 at the time.  We had a working executive agreement with China prior to bilateral agreements and the adoption of the convention.  The fee was $3,500.  This was on the record, transparent and ethical for children who were legally available for adoption.<\/p><p>  When we talk about these allegedly illegal adoptions, we do not know if the children were trafficked or were orphans legally available for adoption.  Are we questioning all the children in my home, Ms Lennon's home and in homes that members know all around Ireland?  The then Adoption Board stood over our adoptions and said they were legally recognised.  We have children since the 1991 Act and they are now hitting 20 years of age.  I have a nine year old at home.  She can read the newspaper and watch \"Prime Time,\" and she hears it on the road when we are going to school.  She asks, \"Mummy, was I stolen?  Mummy, how much did you pay for me?\".<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014062600010#L01400","nonspeaker":"Ms Trish Connolly"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1403775600,"counter":1282,"content":"<p>With regard to bilaterals, the preferred choice of the AAI is that countries sign up to the convention first, and that is where we start.  We will be cautious in any country we recommend for a bilateral agreement.  There is provision under the 2010 Act for bilaterals with non-Hague-Convention countries.  It is a unique factor in European convention countries that a bilateral would have to achieve the same standard as the convention, in that it would have to be passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  That is one of the bulwarks we have.  Any bilateral into which we enter has to go through the D&aacute;il and the Seanad.<\/p> <p>Having said that, the two countries which are probably the best candidates - if they were to be called so - for a bilateral agreement are Russia and Ethiopia, which are non-Hague countries, and were the two highest countries on the list prior to the ratification of the Hague Convention.  They are very different countries with regard to infrastructure and history, but there is no doubt that we have concerns.  We are extremely cautious with regard to entering into bilateral agreements.  There are serious and complex constitutional issues regarding a possible bilateral agreement with Russia, with regard to consular visits to houses in Ireland, registration at the embassy in Dublin and, most importantly, the constitutionality of post-placement reports.  The authority would be expected to police and monitor these and there is no statutory provision for this.  We believe it would be unconstitutional to insist on them.  It is all very desirable, but contrary to the Constitution.<\/p><p> We are also concerned about the costs with regard to Russia.  Assessment in Ireland is free, as are the services of the Adoption Authority, but there are fees for introductions of accredited bodies for facilitation.  The average cost of a Russian adoption in 2011 was &euro;43,000, and &euro;1.3 million left this country in 2011 for Russian adoptions, going to two named individuals who are facilitators.  We urge extreme caution in going down this road.  There is no central authority in Russia.

I know many brilliant parents who have adopted children, including my cousins and friends of mine, who are great people.  There is no question of this.  Nobody is questioning the bona fides of somebody who would like to adopt.  However, we must also say that sometimes life is not fair and many people are faced with many challenges which, perhaps, cannot be overcome.  There is a difference between the right to be adopted and the right to adopt.  I am not against adoption if all of the other options have been absolutely and legitimately exploited and dealt with, but this does not mean somebody has the right to adopt just because of his or her circumstances.  There is a difference.<\/p><p>  The fact that children have come into this country and, as a result, become the children of loving parents in a happy family life does not take away from the fact that some of the practices have not been appropriate, and we as citizens must stand over best practice.  The example has been given.  We all know some of the people who were illegally adopted out of this country to the United States ended up with good parents who loved them.  Of course they did, and that is not the issue.  The issue is what happened later.  Inevitably an adopted child will ask questions about his or her natural parents.

I do that mean that personally against the witnesses, but it is a problem.  How many staff does it have?  How many functions are outsourced?  There have been reports of people who were refused at the point of assessment as not suitable prospective parents who challenged this and went on to adopt, even though the assessment was negative.  How is this process regulated?  How many children who have come here from other countries have ended up in care?  There is evidence that the number may be significant.  I have not been able to get this information although I have sought it.

I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  From reading them yesterday, it is clear that everyone is on the same wavelength and believes that the child comes first.  Rightly so, and no one present would disagree.  This is a matter of finding homes for children in extreme circumstances, their rights and their needs.  In my humble opinion, no child should ever be taken away for adoption without the consent of the maternal parents or extended families.  No person who seeks to adopt a child would have it any other way.  I have personal experience in this regard.  I have seen the love and care given by many people I know, including family, friends and neighbours, who have adopted children from home and abroad and the great good that comes from those adoptions, not only for the children, but for the people who adopt them as well.  As a woman, the greatest gift I have ever been given was being able to give birth to my children.  Sadly, this was not possible for some among my family and friends.  People have a hunger for families of their own at some stage.  Being human, we try our best to ensure that everything we do works out right for our children.<\/p><p>  According to the Children's Rights Alliance's material, practice varies across the country and some families are not entitled to foster while seeking adoptions.  Why is this the case?  The provision preventing people in civil partnerships from adopting should be reversed.<\/p><p>  I will keep my next question short, as much time has passed and many questions have been asked.  It is for Mr. Gildea.  His document reads: \"Ireland had a disproportionately high level of private independent adoptions\".  Will he expand on this point?  I was not able to make sense of it.<\/p><p>  I thank the witnesses for their time and patience, particularly when we had to run up and down the stairs.

In no way am I questioning the adoption of any child in Ireland.  These are Irish citizens who need to be supported and respected.  When we try to have a conversation about processes, we can overlook what some individuals hear in it.  This poses a difficulty.  Our interest in the Hague Convention is only to ensure that we reduce the risk of engaging in adoptions over which we cannot stand.  This is our ethos.  We recommend that the Adoption Authority of Ireland mentor specific countries with which Ireland has a relationship to support them in raising their internal standards to the point at which they can ratify the convention so that we can continue adopting from them.<\/p><p>  I was asked two questions, one of which, from Deputy Byrne, was on whether prospective adopters could foster while adopting.  From what we have heard from prospective adopters, the practice varies.  In some areas, the Child and Family Agency has told them that they cannot foster while in the adoption process, whereas they can in other areas.  The same issue has arisen in respect of fertility treatment.  When a child is to be adopted, we must ensure the family is aware that it must still take on that child even if it is fostering another, but there is no reason these processes should not be able to run in parallel.  People who are interested in expanding or creating families should be entitled to explore options while having a sensible discussion on timelines, different scenarios and so on.  We are aware that the numbers for adoption are low and the number seeking adoption is high.  Let us a have a good, joined-up approach to this issue and work with families in going through common assessment and communication processes.<\/p><p>  I was also asked about unlawful registrations.  As I understand it, an adoption order was never made, so there was no adoption and the child's original birth certificate was effectively a false document, in that it did not give the birth mother's name, only the adoptive parents'.  I am sure the commission on investigation will address and tease out this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014062600012#R00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Maria Corbett"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1403776800,"counter":1305,"content":"<p>I have three questions to answer for Deputy Troy.  He asked whether it would not be better for a child to move to a loving home rather than remain in an institution.  This calls for a domestic solution.  We must always remember that the Hague Convention is a last resort.  All domestic solutions, including adoption into the child's wider family, the community or elsewhere in the country of origin, should be considered before a child is put forward for inter-country adoption.  There is a heap of evidence that many families from the sending countries who place their children in such institutions do so after being given false assurances.  Ireland also has a history of this.  In Romania, many families placed their children in orphanages on a short-term basis during the winter when food was scarce and they could not heat their houses.  They were tricked into doing so.  In Ethiopia, many of the families were illiterate.  They did not give their informed consent to put their children up for adoption.  They believed they were looking at temporary guardianship orders.  We must be mindful of this.<br\/>Deputy Troy also asked about our views on the constitutional issues under the information and tracing Bill.  I am glad that the committee will revisit the matter, as it warrants a separate discussion.  We do not accept that the constitutional issues are insurmountable.  Our opinion has been supported by a number of academic commentators, including Dr. Conor O'Mahony of UCC.  Yesterday, I suggested to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Charles Flanagan, that he should create an expert group to examine these constitutional issues with a view to reinterpreting the 1998 IO'T <i>v<\/i>. B and the Rotunda Girls' Aid Society case in the Supreme Court.<br\/>We complained about the Sacred Heart agency, as did the Adopted People's Association previously.

However, this does not necessarily mean there must be a bilateral programme in place - it is down to interpretation.  A mentoring programme that is working in one country could be used to assist another country.  <\/p><p>  Vietnam and certain agencies were also mentioned today.  Adoptions from Vietnam have recommenced.  We are told there are 15 proposals in principle, which is the equivalent of a child being referred, currently under way in Ireland.  We would like to point out that the agency that had been in operation at the time the bilateral agreement expired is now back in operation.<\/p><p>  On whether the current legislation is too restrictive, we believe it is not fit for purpose.  We are aware that the authority has made 23 submissions on the legislation.  There are four or five issues of concern to us.  We are asking, and have asked previously, that the board of the authority should consist of an adoptee, an adoptive parent, a birth parent and another person who reflects any or all of the above and comes from the wider community of all of my colleagues around the table today.  It is important somebody who can give first-hand information is on that board.  Many of us come from both ends of the spectrum and, as such, have an insight into it.  We also ask that the lifespan of the declaration be increased.  Three years is not long enough within the process to effect an adoption.  If we follow the principle of subsidiarity, which is not being talked about today, then a child is best placed in its country of origin, and if that option is not available it will then be placed for inter-country adoption as a last resort.  The children we adopt will be older and, therefore, the lifespan of the declaration while journeying through the process is not long enough.  We endorse the five-year declaration proposed by the Authority.<\/p><p>  We would welcome information on tracing.  We believe it is a valuable key to assisting every adopted child who, as he or she gets older, has questions around identity, culture, race or belief, whether he or she was adopted domestically or internationally.  It is hoped that if the provision of information on tracing is successful, it will be extended to cover international adoptions, children whose paperwork is legally available and the many children who have contact with their birth families.<\/p><p>  On required changes in the law, we are told that the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, made an amendment to the legislation during the last hour of the last session prior to the D&aacute;il's going into recess last December.  It can be done and in a timely fashion.<\/p><p>  On the issue of accredited bodies, I believe the authority will address this issue.  We have had three bodies accredited for mediation agency purposes.  They have since merged to form two bodies, yet the Department will provide funding for only one.  A lot of time, heartache and expense on the part of the State went into the assessment of these bodies, yet they are not functioning properly and the number of adoptions is very low.

Generally speaking, the consent of natural fathers is not required because they are not guardians.  Where they are, we seek their consent.  The cases mentioned yesterday were routine cases and that was the first occasion on which they had been reported on.<\/p><p>  On Senator van Turnhout's questions, I will ask Ms Loftus to address the issue of the automatic right to assessment, the overturned HSE position and statistics and the possibility of a cut-off date for the release of information to certain parties. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014062600013#S00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kiernan Gildea"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1403777400,"counter":1313,"content":"<p>On the automatic right to assessment, it is clear that there are far more prospective adoptive parents assessed and finalised than there are children available.  We know that, as pointed out, there are older children in institutions, but there are more families looking for younger and healthier children who could be directed towards fostering.  The AAI recommendation is for fostering into adoption.  We would agree that fostering should occur concurrently in respect of couples seeking to adopt also.  In terms of the automatic right to assessment, I must in this regard speak for Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, as well as the AAI, because that is a huge drain on resources.  If there are 600 applicants for inter-country adoption and the maximum number of children that can under the Hague Convention be adopted here this year is 50, then many families will not be able to adopt inter-country.  Assessment of all 600 applicants would therefore be a waste of resources.  Assessment takes place over many hours, which is often very difficult for prospective adopters.  The carrying out of an assessment, in terms of personnel and services, when it is not going to lead to the adoption of a child is a waste of resources.  We have asked time and again that the law be changed so that it does not allow for an automatic right to assessment, because that means we often have to assess couples who are elderly or ill, which is what happened in regard to Irish children adopted by American people 50 years ago.  Many of the parents who adopted children from Ireland at that time were old or in ill health.  We are now in that position.  We need to reduce the onus on the service in this regard and to put together criteria that allow us to assess couples correctly.  The current automatic right to assessment results in a wastage of resources.<\/p><p>  On negative reports, the issue in this regard is what has been described as the transition.  Previously, when a declaration came through, it was almost definite that a family would get a child.  That is no longer the case.  In fact, it has not been the case for about five years.  That had changed even prior to Ireland's ratification of the Hague Convention.  While that convention is welcome in terms of the protection of children, the remainder of it leaves a lot to be desired.  It is horrific for a couple who want children and are infertile to learn that children are not available by a route open to them up to 2010, namely, private adoption.  I accept that there was and is a great deal of corruption in the countries concerned.  It took a huge amount out of the social worker to write a negative recommendation in respect of any couple.  In many cases the board of the AAI did not endorse those negative recommendations, and generally overturned them.  Professional confidence in a person's assessment goes at that point.  We are now trying to assist couples through the assessment as opposed to giving them negative recommendations.  Since 2010, because our regulatory function is much more defined, only 20 of the 200 to 330 assessments which take place each year have been negative.  Those negative assessments, which are coming through from the bottom up, are being upheld by the board.  As such, the situation as outlined is no longer the case.  Things have changed in those few years.<\/p> <p>That is not coming out in what is being stated publicly.  Many couples waiting for younger children have old declarations; these people are waiting three to five years for a child, so a declaration is there for a long time.  The people have gone through an assessment and thought they were getting a younger, healthier child.  The position has changed completely and we give very clear information from the authority on the profile of children through assessing social workers.  Fewer couples will currently come through the assessment and make the same complaints, as it is not the case any more.  They now know what they are getting into and they are much clearer about the fact that the children have needs.<\/p><p> We need resources for inspection, and one of the questions concerned numbers.  I am a principal social worker and there are four social workers at the Adoption Authority of Ireland, AAI.  Two of them work in information and tracing and two more provide ongoing review of assessments.  That is the only inspection we have, and from that we have formulated guidelines for domestic adoption.  I would hate to hear anybody say we are not working at the AAI, as we work very hard.  We will rewrite inter-country guidelines and are in the process of formulating fostering guidelines.<\/p><p> Another question was how we are preparing for the pool of children in fostering.  The board is very willing to agree with the negative assessments and in the process of review we have come up with at least another 20% that we as the social work service at the adoption authority would not give recommendations to.  Some of those have also been overturned.  It is a misrepresentation to say that where there is a negative report, we are not agreeing with it.  We are mostly agreeing with negative reports, as they are not come to lightly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014062600013#S00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Celia Loftus","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1403778000,"counter":1315,"content":"<p>The Senator asked about different standards of information and tracing rights being legislated for.

The date from such time to adoption is an unknown figure which can be anything from two years to seven years, as it is with China.  That is where a declaration of three years is quite useless, and we have recommended five years as being a best option.  It is impossible to indicate the number of illegal registrations.

These bodies are in constant regular negotiations, virtually on a weekly basis, with the Department to establish a clear, rigorous and long-term solution with regard to State funding.  Ireland has two of these involved with inter-country adoption, but Italy, for example, has 69 bodies.  The notion of an accredited body facilitating an adoption is best practice.  There is a cost, but Ireland would be unique if it did not provide State funding in some way or fashion in this regard.  There are tax benefits, credits and grants in many other countries, and Luxembourg goes as far as providing a free service from start to finish.  We are not in that position.  Accredited bodies need State funding and the two which exist for facilitating inter-country adoptions currently get &euro;10,000 per month, which is only guaranteed until the end of this month.
