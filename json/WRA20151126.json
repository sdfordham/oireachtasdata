The Committee was tasked with examining the Irish copyright framework to identify any areas that might be considered to create barriers to innovation and, to recommend a resolution to any problems identified in terms of how any barriers identified might be overcome.  The report contains in excess of 60 recommendations covering a diverse range of copyright issues.     <\/p>  <p>  Following extensive analysis of the recommendations contained in the Report, my Department is currently in the process of developing legislative proposals for consideration by Government in the copyright area.  This follows from an in-depth assessment of the complex legal issues involved in certain of the proposals with the Office of the Attorney General as well as examination of the proposals from a policy perspective.  Where recommendations involved issues under the remit of other Government Departments, these Departments have also been consulted.  I expect to be in a position, over the next number of weeks, to bring to Government my Department&rsquo;s response to the Committee&rsquo;s Report on copyright seeking approval also for legislative proposals responding to a number of proposals recommended by the Committee.  <\/p>  <p>  The context for consideration of the Committee&rsquo;s recommendations in the copyright area must indeed, as highlighted by the Deputy, be seen also against the background of a progressive and evolving framework on copyright at EU and international level.  The Deputy rightly points also to the issue of technological developments in this area which is an issue that presents a constant challenge for legislation in a number of areas and is not limited to copyright.  I can assure the Deputy that I am very aware of developments in the EU copyright context with imminent proposals expected from the European Commission either before year end 2015 or early 2016 and, a further set of proposals expected in Spring 2016. Indeed, my officials have been active in seeking to influence the development of EU proposals in the copyright area for example in the context of the 2013 EU Commission consultation on copyright modernisation and in the context of the Commission&rsquo;s Digital Single Market Strategy published on 5 May 2015.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112600059#WRA00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1078"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":9,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 8 to 10, inclusive, answered orally.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Job Creation","counter":10,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112600059#WRA00750"},{"type":"question","counter":11,"qnumday":11,"qnumall":"[41748\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112600059#WRA00800","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the steps he has taken over the past five years to encourage job creation and new inward investment in County Donegal, given that there have been only three site visits to the county in 2015 to date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"999","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":12,"content":"<p>In the five years up to 2011, Donegal lost 3,400 jobs with big falls in manufacturing and in Construction.

Ireland's creative industries are manifest in many forms from art, music and literature, through to film, design and digital media. The quality of life and inspiration from the landscape and culture are among the strongest motivators for attracting creative people to live and work in Ireland and throughout the regions.  The important economic contribution of the film sector was also recognised in Budget 2016 and the Minister for Finance increased the cap for film relief by 40% to &euro;70m. <\/p><p>As part of the 2015 Action Plan for Jobs, we committed to developing Action Plans for every region in the country. The Action Plan for the West region was published, by the Taoiseach and I, on 16 November last. The West Action Plan for Jobs sets ambitious targets to see the creation of an additional 25,000 jobs in the West region over the period to 2020. The West Action Plan for Jobs-Regional highlights that creativity is a distinctive strength of the West region and sets out a number of measures to develop the potential of the Creative Industries in the region over the period to 2020. The designation of Galway City as UNESCO City of Film - one of only five such cities in the world - is testament to the international recognition which our creative industries have achieved. <\/p><p>The West Action Plan for Jobs-Regional sets out a number of actions which the stakeholders in the region will take forward over the coming period. These include the development and implementation of an Action Plan to support the Film industry in Galway and the West region and to explore the potential for a Regional Film Fund, over the period 2015-2107. Ensuring we have a pipeline of talent for the sector is a key priority and as part of the West Action Plan for Jobs Galway and Roscommon Education and Training Board (GRETB) will roll out a Traineeship programme in TV and Film at Level 5 to support this growing sector in 2016.<\/p><p>The Western Development Commission (WDC) disburses a range of supports for the sector in the West region. The WDC will implement a new &euro;2 million transnational project called Creative Momentum. This project will further develop new routes to export markets for creative enterprises, as well as providing international networking opportunities with creative enterprises. The WDC is also to disburse a targeted Micro-Loan fund for the Creative Industries in the Western Region and has developed the MyCreativeEdge.eu website which provides an online showcase for creative enterprises, which is advertised to the diaspora in the US and UK. To further promote growth and exports by the sector, for the past three years the WDC has partnered with the Design &amp;amp; Crafts Council of Ireland on their International Fair Fund to support craft makers from the region to attend overseas Trade Fairs. <\/p><p>The local authorities will also support the Creative Industries though initiatives such as <i>Made in Galway<\/i>, while Roscommon Co.

The details are that unemployment in the Border Region (which includes Leitrim) has fallen from 17.7% to 9.3% and in the Midland Region (which includes Roscommon) it has fallen from 18.3% to 12.4%.  While the current unemployment rates are still too high, this reduction has been a considerable achievement for this Government.<\/p><p>The banking industry has seen many changes in recent years and is constantly evolving, mainly due to different customer practices, especially the growth of online banking from mobile phones.

Therefore, working with stakeholders is exceptionally important in positioning any regional location to attract FDI and IDA Ireland continues to do so, as well as working with existing clients in all regional locations.

The EGFSN provides information on employment trends, job opportunities and demand for skills through the annual &ldquo;<i>National Skills Bulletin&rdquo; <\/i>and the &ldquo;<i>Vacancy Overview&rdquo; <\/i>reports.  It also provides information on the supply of skills from the Irish education system through the &ldquo;<i>Monitoring Ireland&rsquo;s Skills Supply&rdquo; <\/i>publication.  The EGFSN also publishes reports on specific sectoral, or cross-sectoral skills needs, as well as &ldquo;<i>Regional Labour Markets Bulletins&rdquo;<\/i>which assist in informing regional education and training provision.  Recent EGFSN reports have anticipated future job opportunities arising from both expansion and replacement demand for a range of occupational roles, including in ICT, data analytics, manufacturing, medical devices, pharmaceuticals, food and beverages, international sales and marketing, project management, freight transport, distribution and logistics, and in the hospitality sector.<\/p><p>ICT skillsets are important in both the manufacturing and services sectors.  The 2013 EGFSN report on &ldquo;<i>Addressing Future Demand for High-Level ICT Skills&rdquo; <\/i>indicated that the continuing strong demand from employers for people with high-level ICT skills across the economy could lead to 44,500 new job openings arising from expansion and replacement demand over the period to 2018.  To achieve this jobs potential, the report noted that all available policy levers would need to be utilised to increase high-level ICT skills supply. <\/p><p>In this context, the Government has initiated an ICT Action Plan which provides an integrated response within the education system to increasing the domestic supply of high level ICT skills.  The aim of the Plan is to support the flow of people into ICT education, training and careers.  Overall implementation of the Plan is driven by a High Level Steering Group which my Department co-chairs with the Department of Education and Skills.<\/p><p>The skills needs in other areas of the economy are being addressed through the Further and Higher education system, through Springboard and Momentum training courses which help to upskill or re-skill unemployed people, and through the enterprise-led Training Networks Programme run by Skillnets.

Expenditure on pensions at approximately &euro;6.675 billion is the largest block of the Department&rsquo;s expenditure in the Estimate for 2015, representing almost 34.4% of overall expenditure. Because of demographic changes, the Department&rsquo;s spending on older people is increasing year on year. The Department has had to make provision for an additional &euro;168 million this year for the increasing number of pensioners. Maintaining the rate of the State pension and other core payments is critical in protecting people from poverty. <\/p>  <p>  While the decision to discontinue the telephone allowance was a difficult one it provided annual savings of &euro;48 million and meant that the Department was able to retain the other valuable elements of the household benefits package such as the electricity and gas allowance and the television licence. The Department will spend approx. &euro;227 million this year on these elements of the household benefits package for over 416,000 customers. <\/p>  <p>  I am keenly aware of the impact of Budget decisions on the Department&rsquo;s clients, and I have sought to ensure that the money available is targeted in the most effective way. In Budget 2016, I was able to announce the first increase in the basic rate of the State pension in seven years, by &euro;3 per week.

In December 2012, I contributed &euro;250 million to the Credit Union Fund for the purpose of restructuring the credit union sector.  The placing of money in the Fund had no impact on the general Government deficit as it is only when this money is spent that it impacts the deficit.  This funding has always been ring-fenced specifically to provide financial support for restructuring credit unions.<\/p><p>To date, ReBo has drawn down &euro;6.38 million from the Credit Union Fund which can be broken down as follows:<\/p><p>- &euro;3.06 million has been used to fund the operational costs of ReBo;<\/p><p>- &euro;2.84 million has been used to provide credit unions with financial assistance incentives; and<\/p><p>- &euro;0.48 million as yet unused.<\/p><p>ReBo conducted a detailed analysis of likely funding requirements and it estimates that its net use of the Credit Union Fund will amount to no more than circa &euro;20 million.<\/p><p>Section 43  of the 2012 Act provides that,<b><\/b>when I am satisfied that ReBo has completed the performance of its functions\u00a0I can by order dissolve ReBo.  However, before dissolving ReBo, section 43(2) requires that I must conduct a review of the operation of Part 3 of the 2012 Act no later than 1 January 2016, to determine whether or not ReBo has, in my opinion, completed the performance of its functions.  This review was carried out and published\u00a0in October 2015 and\u00a0has assisted\u00a0me in making an informed decision in relation to the restructuring process and the duration of ReBo.<\/p><p>Following the section 43 review, which found that credit union engagement with ReBo has continued to increase in recent months,\u00a0I\u00a0announced that\u00a0credit unions\u00a0have until 31 March 2016 to receive a letter of offer from ReBo following the submission of a high level restructuring business case to ReBo.  ReBo will then be in a position to complete all restructuring projects in a methodical manner during 2016.  A further such review will be carried out in line with section 43(2)(b) before October 2016.<\/p><p>The &euro;250m contributed to the Credit Union Fund was provided specifically to support credit unions undergoing restructuring within ReBo's time-bound restructuring programme.  With ReBo's net use of the Credit Union Funded estimated to be no more than &euro;20 million, this will in\u00a0due course enable the return of approximately &euro;230m to the Exchequer.  While it was envisaged that significant funding would be required for credit union restructuring, it is commendable that the credit union movement itself has provided funding from within its own resources, thus minimising the requirement for drawing on Exchequer funding.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112600064#WRF00700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pensions Data","counter":145,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112600064#WRF00800"},{"type":"question","counter":146,"qnumday":59,"qnumall":"[42075\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112600064#WRF00900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of persons, other than public service occupational pensioners, receiving annual occupational pensions exceeding &euro;12,000 per annum, &euro;24,000 per annum, &euro;36,000 per annum, &euro;48,000 per annum, &euro;60,000 per annum, &euro;80,000 per annum and &euro;100,000 per annum; this group including private sector occupational pensioners and retired employees of commercial State companies; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"960","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":147,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that while social welfare pensions can be separately identified from other sources of income in Revenue records, it is not possible to distinguish income of occupational pensions from those of PAYE employments.

Extrapolated to 2020, the target contribution made by FDI will be 42,000 direct jobs or an average of circa 7,000 net new jobs on an annual basis over the period to 2020.  The agency has targeted 14,000 gross job approvals for 2015, yielding a net increase in jobs approved of 7,000 for the year in the context of 160 new FDI investment projects approved.<\/p><p>Enterprise Ireland's strategy 2014-2016 targets the delivery of an additional 40,000 gross jobs over the period of the strategy.  In the context of Enterprise 2025, the net jobs potential from Enterprise Ireland supported companies over the period to 2020 is 32,000.<\/p><p><b>Indirect jobs<\/b><\/p><p>It is anticipated that over the period to 2020, an additional 65,000 jobs will be stimulated in the wider economy indirectly, as a result of jobs created by Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland client companies.  The total contribution to the potential private sector employment growth on foot of IDA and EI client company activity will be circa 140,000 jobs.<\/p><p><b>Tourism<\/b><\/p><p>The Government's tourism strategy, People, Place and Policy: Growing Tourism to 2025 includes an overall target of 50,000 additional jobs in the sector by 2025.  In the context of Enterprise 2025, the overall interpolated employment potential for the sector over the period to 2020 is an additional 30,000 jobs.<\/p><p><b>Regional employment<\/b><\/p><p>Enterprise 2025 does not set out the break-down of the overall job creation targets for the regions.  A clearly stated ambition for the strategy is that by 2020, the overall unemployment rate in each of the regions will not be higher than 1 percentage point than the national unemployment rate.<\/p><p>The roll out of the Action Plan for Jobs at a regional level is being progressed by my Department and will drive delivery of the ambition set out in Enterprise 2025.  To date, five (out of a total of eight) Regional Jobs Plans have been launched (Midlands, South-East, South-West, Mid-West, West) as part of a &euro;250 million regional jobs strategy.  Each of these Plans set out employment growth targets along with detailed actions to be undertaken on an annual basis.  The Plans reflect a potential uplift in employment in the region of 10 to 15 percent overall in the period to 2020 consistent with the overall employment targets in Enterprise 2025 (over a 2014 base).  The levels of employment growth actually achieved within that range will depend on factors including the level of support and collaboration within the local community for the Plan, and the level of collaboration between organisations in the region and the main Government bodies involved in the plans.<\/p><p>As part of its growth strategy, IDA has committed itself to increasing the level of investment into each region of Ireland by between 30% and 40%.<\/p><p><b>Employment Forecasts relating to TTIP<\/b><\/p><p>The agreement of a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership has the potential to have an additional positive impact on job creation in Ireland, dependent on the final shape of such an agreement.  According to assessments made by the EU Commission, a comprehensive EU-US trade agreement could over time boost EU GDP by 0.5% bringing significant economic gains as a whole for the EU.  This converts into 400,000 jobs across the EU.  An independent study commissioned by my Department, carried out by Copenhagen Economics, estimates that these benefits in Ireland will be proportionally greater than in the EU as a whole.  The report suggests a boost to GDP of 1.1%, growth in Irish exports of almost 4%, increases in investment of 1.5%, and an increase in real wages of 1.5% and estimates somewhere between 5,000 and 10,000 additional export related jobs for Ireland. <\/p><p>The Copenhagen Economics assessment also suggests that Irish SMEs will be particular beneficiaries.  Many of these are part of European supply chains where their exports, feed into Europe's exports to the U.S.  In these negotiations, Ireland will seek to have opportunities created in the agreement where we have clear strengths, and we will seek to defend our interests where we have sensitivities.<\/p><p>As an economy that lives and grows by the freedom to trade, we have first-hand experience of how trade liberalisation has continually shaped and reshaped our economy.  We have used openness to trade in the past, and will continue to use it, as an instrument for structural reform, modernisation and development, creating new opportunities for innovation and stronger productivity growth with higher skilled jobs throughout the economy.<\/p><p><b>Food Wise 2025<\/b><\/p><p>The successful implementation of Food Wise 2025 will have a direct bearing on realising the overall ambition for employment set out in Enterprise 2025, through the activities of exporting indigenous and foreign owned food enterprises, locally trading food enterprises, as well as the broader non-agency supported agri-food activities related to primary production.  In addition to working with indigenous exporting and potential exporters in the food sector, Enterprise Ireland also has responsibility for the attraction of FDI in food and for working with foreign owned food entities as they develop their activities in Ireland.  All of these activities are factored into the employment projections to 2020 set out in Enterprise 2025.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112600068#WRK00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Employment Rights","counter":253,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112600068#WRK01000"},{"type":"question","counter":254,"qnumday":100,"qnumall":"[42122\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112600068#WRK01100","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"given correspondence showing a company offering a training rate of pay below the minimum wage, if he is aware of the prevalence of this practice; the steps he is taking to monitor compliance with minimum wage legislation; the number of cases that have been investigated by his Department in the past three years; and if his Department will investigate a case (details supplied).","asker":"1197","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":255,"content":"<p>With effect from 1 October 2015, the activities of the Labour Relations Commission, the National Employment Rights Authority, the Equality Tribunal and the first instance functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal and the Labour Court were merged into a new Body of  First Instance, known as the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC).<\/p>  <p>  The WRC has advised that arrangements have been made for an inspector to carry out an investigation in relation to the matters raised.

Inspections arise as a result of:<\/p>  <p>  - complaints received of alleged breaches of employment rights,<\/p>  <p>  - targeted inspection campaigns, and<\/p>  <p>  - routine inspection enquiries.<\/p>  <p>  The total number of inspections carried out in the past three years was: 2012 - 4,689; 2013 - 5,545; and 2014 - 5,591.<\/p>  <p>  In 2014, non-compliance with the National Minimum Wage Act was established in 12.5% of the cases inspected and a total of &euro;143,223 in arrears for employees was recovered. <\/p>  <p>  In the course of 2014, a total of 104 inspections were carried out in the hotel sector.<\/p>  <p>  The aim of the WRC is primarily to achieve a culture of compliance by informing employers and employees of their respective responsibilities and entitlements under employment law, and by working in close cooperation with them and their representatives.  Where an inspector determines that a contravention of specified areas of employment law (including the non- payment of money due to an employee under employment law) has taken place, and the employer concerned has failed or refuses to rectify the non- compliance, a Compliance Notice setting out the steps the employer must take to effect compliance may be issued.  Should the employer not appeal, and fail or refuse to comply with the terms of the notice, the WRC may initiate legal proceedings against that employer.<\/p>  <p>  An inspector may also, in respect of a number of acts of non- compliance on the part of the employer, serve a Fixed Charge notice (similar to on the spot fines).  Failure or refusal to pay the charge will also leave the person open to prosecution. <\/p>  <p>  In cases which are not covered by the provisions of the Workplace Relations Act 2015, such as failure to pay the minimum wage, employment permit issues and offences pertaining to non-co-operation and obstruction, the Workplace Relations Commission can initiate criminal proceedings in respect of the offences involved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112600068#WRK01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Trade Agreements","counter":256,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112600068#WRK01300"},{"type":"question","counter":257,"qnumday":101,"qnumall":"[42128\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112600068#WRK01400","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if any ongoing monitoring or review of the human rights situation in Colombia, as proposed at the Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation when it discussed the European Union free trade agreement with Colombia, will take place; and, if so, when it will take place.","asker":"1192","askee":"1016"},{"type":"question","counter":258,"qnumday":102,"qnumall":"[42129\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112600068#WRK01500","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if the mechanisms in the European Union free trade agreement with Colombia that provide for the adoption of proportionate measures, up to and including termination of the agreement in circumstances in which democratic principles and fundamental human rights, as laid down in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, are not respected, have been invoked in view of recent events in Argelia in the south-western department of Cauca in Colombia, as well as the murders of three prominent human rights defenders (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1192","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":259,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 101 and 102 together.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is concerned at the developments in Colombia in recent weeks.

The recovery in jobs and exports to date is in large part due to the considerable improvements in the business environment for enterprise that have taken place in recent years. The measures announced by the Minister for Finance in Budget 2016 last month have further strengthened the attractiveness of Ireland as a place for entrepreneurship, innovation and investment.    Government policies for Enterprise (including our ten year strategy Enterprise 2025 launched earlier this month) and Innovation set the framework for continued investment and support to establish Ireland as the best place in which to succeed in business &ndash; a place where businesses are innovative, competitive and productive, leading to growth that is sustainable and a higher standard of living for all.  <\/p>  <p>  The introduction of the Knowledge Development Box (KDB), in Budget 2016 forms part of Ireland&rsquo;s competitive offering to continue to attract FDI and to support Irish owned companies to innovate and to compete effectively on international markets. <\/p>  <p>  The KDB complements the existing suite of initiatives and supports available to companies that undertake R&amp;D activities in Ireland across the lifecycle of research and development &ndash; including R&amp;D tax credits, RD&amp;I grant supports, support for technology acquisition (S291A), significant state investments in National Research Centres and knowledge transfer infrastructures, and advisory supports for accessing Horizon 2020 funding &ndash; providing a competitive proposition for business investment. <\/p>  <p>  What differentiates Ireland in relation to the KDB is that we are the first country world-wide to offer an OECD compliant KDB offering.

Ireland&rsquo;s KDB rate is 6.25 percent (half of the corporation tax rate of 12.5 percent) and is internationally competitive. <\/p>  <p>  The Knowledge Box, as announced in the 2016 Budget speech, will support and encourage both foreign and Irish owned enterprise to undertake research and development here, to protect the intellectual property that arises and to benefit from the measure. The Finance Bill also allows for the introduction of a provision pertaining to &lsquo;Companies with income arising from intellectual property of less than &euro;7,500,000&rsquo; which will be introduced during 2016 when the necessary legislation to give it effect is enacted and will be of direct benefit to companies of a relatively lower scale, with global income of less than &euro;50 million.

Talent and skills are at the heart of Enterprise 2025, and our strategy for the future builds on the lessons of the last four years. Our success in supporting enterprises in creating jobs since we started the Action Plan for Jobs process in 2012 illustrates the impact we can have when we align our education, training and activation policies with the skill requirements of the enterprise sector.

Since 2012, the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Jobs has set out a comprehensive set of measures to improve our competitiveness performance. Ireland&rsquo;s improving competitiveness performance since 2011 has been central to securing the recovery in economic growth and employment. Overall, Ireland has moved from 25th to 16th on the IMD Competitiveness rankings, and we are ranked fourth in euro-area in the recent World Bank Doing Business Report. Notable areas of progress include the environment for start-ups, regulation, and access to credit. <\/p>  <p>  Improved competitiveness has made Irish firms more cost competitive internationally and made Ireland a more attractive location for firms to base their operations in. The recovery in jobs to date, with 135,800 more employed than at the beginning of 2012, unemployment down from over 15% in 2012 to 8.9% in October and the record levels of indigenous exports being achieved, is in large part due to the considerable improvements in the business environment for enterprises. <\/p>  <p>  We continue to focus on actions to improve Ireland's cost competitiveness and take appropriate action to address fragilities as they emerge. Budget 2016 introduced a number of measures to improve our cost competitiveness, including for example, reducing road transport costs through the introduction of a cap of &euro;900 on the largest commercial vehicles, reducing the Universal Social Charge and consequent reductions in marginal tax rates, increasing employers PRSI ceilings and thereby reducing the costs of employment, sustaining other measures such as the reduced rate of VAT for the hospitality sector and accelerated capital allowances for investment in energy efficient equipment. The introduction of the Knowledge Development Box will also allow innovation-led enterprises to benefit from a reduced 6.25% rate of corporation tax on intellectual property-related income. <\/p>  <p>  The National Competitiveness Council's 2015 Costs of Doing Business in Ireland report benchmarks key business costs across over fifty indicators and focuses on areas where Irish enterprise costs are out of line with key competitors, and on costs that are largely domestically determined. The NCC's report finds that while relative cost competitiveness is improving (i.e. although costs are increasing, they are increasing at a slower rate than in many of our competitors), this improvement is largely being driven by external factors beyond the control of domestic policymakers. In particular, a weak euro exchange rate, low ECB interest rates, and low international fuel prices have all combined to improve Irish cost competitiveness. The NCC report concludes that Ireland&rsquo;s industrial cost base has improved but pressure points are emerging in labour, property and business service costs. <\/p>  <p>I am convinced that for us to achieve the ambition in the Government's recent enterprise policy statement Enterprise 2025 of achieving sustainable full employment, we must maintain an intense focus on reducing costs that are out of line with those in competitor countries. There is a role for both the public and private sectors alike to proactively manage their cost base and drive efficiency, thus creating a virtuous circle between the costs of living, wage expectations and cost competitiveness. Measures that ensure open and competitive markets and improve productivity performance are essential.    <\/p>  <p>  I will shortly bring the Competitiveness Council's annual Competitiveness Challenge report to Government and we will ensure the required actions to address emerging issues are addressed as part of the Action Plan for Jobs process. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112600070#WRM01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Regional Development","counter":298,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112600070#WRM01400"},{"type":"question","counter":299,"qnumday":115,"qnumall":"[42249\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112600070#WRM01500","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"his proposals for job creation throughout the regions, with particular reference to the need to achieve a reasonable balance in terms of economic investment, thereby contributing to a more co-ordinated, integrated and comprehensive development of job creation opportunities; if any infrastructural deficiencies need to be addressed in this context; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":300,"content":"<p>The Regional Action Plans for Jobs Initiative was launched by Government in February of this year.

Under the Sea Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act, 2006, all operational issues of this nature concerning sea fisheries control are, as a matter of law, exclusively for the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority (SFPA) and the Naval Service. As Minister, I am precluded from getting involved in operational matters including in relation to law enforcement.  In relation to the overall framework for fisheries control in the EU, in October 2009 a new regulation dealing with fisheries controls was adopted. Council Regulation 1224\/2009 establishes a Community control system for ensuring compliance with the rules of the common fisheries policy. Control and inspection is now focused where it is most effective through an approach based on systematic risk analysis. Inspection procedures are standardised and harmonised for all stages in the market chain, including transport and marketing.\u00a0 The Control Regulations were introduced so that there is a common EU level playing field and to provide for an effective range of controls across EU waters. <font color=\"#5F497A\"><\/font><\/p><p>One of the key elements of the reformed Common Fisheries Policy is the introduction of a phased ban on the discarding of unwanted fish catches. The first part of the landing obligation, the ban on discarding pelagic stocks such as herring and mackerel, came into effect on the 1st of January 2015. The EU Commission adopted a Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1393\/2014 on 20 October 2014 which implements a discard plan for certain pelagic fisheries in north-western waters in line with the recommendation of the North West Waters Member States Group. <b><\/b>A Control Experts Group from the North West Waters Regional Group of Member States has been set up and has produced a draft set of recommendations on additional control measures for the pelagic sector in respect of the landing obligation in pelagic fisheries. These draft recommendations have been sent to the Pelagic Advisory Council and the North Western Advisory Council in accordance with article 18 of the CFP basic regulation (EU No 1380\/2013) for their observations. <\/p><p>The draft recommendations are being considered by the NWW Member States Group. The measures recommended by the Control experts cover a range of actions including the use of cameras or other remote sensing equipment on all large pelagic vessels, both freezer vessels and our own RSW (Refrigerated Seawater Tank vessels) to support the landing obligation. It also recommends control observers &ldquo;for individual trips to address dynamically &ndash; assessed risks of a more transient nature.&rdquo; It is important to note that the flag Member State would be responsible for placing control observers on its vessels. I consider that any strengthened control measures must provide tools to both the flag Member State and the coastal Member State to better monitor and control fishing activities. We will continue to work closely with the North Western Waters Member States to identify the control actions that are most useful so that the landing obligation is fully respected. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112600071#WRN01700","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agriculture Scheme Payments","counter":338,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112600071#WRN01750"},{"type":"question","counter":339,"qnumday":128,"qnumall":"[42196\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112600071#WRN01800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when payment will issue under the 2015 basic payment scheme and the areas of natural constraint scheme to a person (details supplied) in County Galway; the reason for the delay; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

This organisation had been funded under the previous SSNO. <\/p>  <p>  Subsequently, my colleague Minister Kelly decided to provide funding to a further 32 organisations to alleviate the hardship that would arise from a sudden loss of funding and to ensure business continuity in the communities that these organisations served.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112600082#WRY00300","answer":true,"speaker":"964"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","counter":595,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112600082#WRY00400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Company Data","counter":594,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112600082#WRY00350"},{"type":"question","counter":595,"qnumday":220,"qnumall":"[42235\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112600082#WRY00400","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the amount EirGrid has spent on advertising and sponsorship in 2015 to date, and for each of the past four years; who are EirGrid's competitors; and the objective of the advertisement and sponsorship spend.","asker":"1080","askee":"1024"},{"type":"speech","counter":596,"content":"<p>My Department has passed this query to EirGrid and have requested them to contact the Deputy directly. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112600082#WRY00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Energy Resources","counter":597,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112600082#WRY00550"},{"type":"question","counter":598,"qnumday":221,"qnumall":"[42096\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112600082#WRY00600","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the steps he is taking in order to ensure the Whitegate Oil Refinery is maintained as an operable refinery for the future integrity of the State, and in particular in relation to significant proposals which have been put forward which would help the Government reach its 2020 target with regard to biofuels, and yield improvement projects; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1063","askee":"1024"},{"type":"speech","counter":599,"content":"<p>The owners of the refinery, Phillips 66, advised my Department in October that they were putting the Whitegate refinery up for sale.  A refinery sale would be a commercial matter between Phillips 66 and a potential purchaser.  As this process is underway Whitegate will continue to be operated on a business as usual basis.  The Government views the continued operation of the Whitegate refinery on a commercial basis as highly desirable from an energy security and economic perspective.  Security of supply remains a fundamental tenet of our energy policy. I am in contact with my Ministerial colleagues to discuss the importance of continued operations at the facility. <\/p>  <p>  The 2009 Renewable Energy Directive sets all Member States a binding target that at least 10% of the energy used in the transport sector must come from renewable sources by 2020.  Ireland aims to meet this target mainly through the use of sustainable biofuels with electric vehicles also making a contribution. <\/p>  <p>  The Biofuels Obligation Scheme was introduced in July 2010 and obliges the road transport fuel industry to ensure that a certain amount of the fuel placed on the Irish market is biofuel.  The scheme also offers increased incentives for biofuels produced from waste materials and residues.  I understand the refinery owners have been considering the potential for Whitegate to operate as a biorefinery.  As a private entity, such an investment project is a matter for the owners.  The increasing requirement for biofuels to meet Ireland's 2020 target can afford opportunities for indigenous producers, including the refinery, particularly those which produce biofuels from wastes and residues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112600082#WRY00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Renewable Energy Generation","counter":600,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112600082#WRY00750"},{"type":"question","counter":601,"qnumday":222,"qnumall":"[42098\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112600082#WRY00800","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"when he will publish proposals on the refit for solar power; the likely rate of the tariff, at such point in time; and if he will make a statement on the matter.
