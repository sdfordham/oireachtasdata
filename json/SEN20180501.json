People with disabilities do not have confidence that the optional protocol to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities will be ratified.  I can see no reason why it could not be ratified now.  When the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, came to the House for statements on the ratification of the convention on 21 March 2018, he gave two reasons.  He accepted that it was in the roadmap in 2015 that the optional protocol would be ratified when the convention was ratified but stated his current focus had to be the ratification of the convention in the first instance.  During that debate, however, he said that the instrument of deposition had been lodged with the UN on 20 March.  In effect, the convention was ratified.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator John Dolan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2479\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2479&amp;amp;pid=JohnDolan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=01\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Ireland's instrument ratification has been lodged with the UN and, therefore, the ratification was completed in March.  We have moved from ratification to implementation.  The reason for not ratifying the protocol does not stand.  The Minister's second reason was \"the need for substantive cultural change\" and he went on to say, \"Work is continuing on the final reforms needed for Ireland's compliance with the convention's requirements\".  Every provision in the convention relates to compliance and becoming compliant and not to complied with everything before the convention is ratified.<\/p><p>The optional protocol is an instrument that gives people with disabilities the right to complain to the UN disabilities committee when they have exhausted all the normal complaints procedures within their state.  Article 3 provides that the committee will confidentially write to the state party and give it six months to respond.  There is a long, drawn-out period before anything gets to that stage.<\/p><p>The deprivation of liberty Bill and disability (miscellaneous provisions) Bill 2016 are to be passed before the end of the year.  I would like the Minister of State to confirm that commitment.  Given it is intended to have both Bills enacted by the end of the year and the State has a disability inclusion strategy of which he is proud, that gives a defence to the State if issues are raised.  He can say he is on the journey, which is what the convention is about.  Why not ratify the optional protocol now?  Are the Minister of State and the Government up for it to be ratified now?  Are they in the space to say, \"Let us do this\"?  Do his officials want to have it ratified?  The Minister of State could quickly and easily, with no cost or downside to the State, ratify the optional protocol now, which would give people confidence, given the ratification of the convention has dragged on for years, that the Government is stepping up and getting in front of this issue.  That would be what the Minster of State described as \"a critical cultural change\".  He should lead from the front.  Let us get this done and say to people that Ireland is proud of its progress to date and is comfortable with being held to account internationally.  Nobody gets it right every time when we go in front of a jury but the Minister of State should be comfortable going there.  That would be huge.<\/p><p>I have five questions.  Will the Minister of State agree to ratify the protocol now?  What reasons does he have for not ratifying the convention?  Ireland must lodge its first report on 19 April 2020.  By what date will the optional protocol be ratified if that is not done now?  Will it be the day after the report is lodged?  Will he confirm that the deprivation of liberty Bill and the disability (miscellaneous provisions) Bill 2016 will be enacted this year?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018050100002#B00600","speaker":"1419","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525181400,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this important topic.  I am delighted to have the opportunity to address the issue of Ireland's ratification of the optional protocol to the UN convention.  I always lead on this issue.  The Independent Alliance did not hang around to ratify it whereas many of the political parties whose members are jumping up and down and having a go at me ignored it for ten years.  Some of them were Ministers during that time and, therefore, I will not take lectures from them.<\/p> <p>The ratification of the convention was a key commitment in the programme for Government and it has been one of my highest priorities since becoming Minister of State.  I am pleased to have delivered on that commitment.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Finian McGrath:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1822\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1822&amp;amp;pid=FinianMcGrath&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=01\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I was privileged to represent the Government at the United Nations headquarters on 19 April - the day the convention came into force for Ireland.  That was an historic day and most of the disability leaders and organisations I met in New York over those two days were very impressed with Ireland's role and also with Ireland's services being well ahead of many other countries that had ratified some years previously.<\/p><p>Ratification followed a delay of many years and took much hard work.  I am grateful to the committed family members, carers, public representatives and activists who worked tirelessly to campaign for ratification.  Both the convention and the optional protocol cover a broad range of commitments, some of which require substantive cultural change.  Fundamental to that are the concepts of freedom, autonomy and independence, recognising the right of people with disabilities to make decisions for themselves, rather than have decisions made for them.  In this regard, I am pleased to say that I have recently received the report from the task force on personalised budgets and will shortly be bringing a memo to Cabinet on the matter.<\/p><p>I will respond to some of the points made by the Senator.  I intend to have all the legislation in place as quickly as possible.  I intend to continue the public consultation with all the disability groups and the senior citizens' groups.  As the Senator knows there are currently 92 signatories to the optional protocol, whereas 176 states have ratified the convention.  A clear timescale has been drawn up to address the remaining implementation issues in line with the principles of progressive realisation of services which operates in respect of compliance with the convention.  Priority drafting has been approved for the disability (miscellaneous provisions) Bill and a stand-alone Bill to deal with the deprivation of liberty.  Some &euro;3 million has been allocated in 2018 for the establishment of the decision-support service.  A lot of work is going on all the time and I take a step-by-step approach to the issue.<\/p><p>The Government&rsquo;s approach to meeting the terms of the convention will be one of sustained and ongoing improvement.  Work is continuing on the reforms needed for an optimum level of compliance with the convention's requirements.  In the early implementation phase, it is essential that resources are focused on the enhancement of services and not diverted into additional areas such as servicing the optional protocol before we are fully ready.  That is the key thing.  I will opt in when I am ready.  That is the best thing to do.  That is an example of best practice and other countries have done that.<\/p><p>For this reason, I see a phased approach as the most practical and realistic way of moving ahead.  While the optional protocol is not being ratified at this time, it will be ratified as soon as possible when I am satisfied that certain things are in place.  At the latest this will follow completion of Ireland&rsquo;s first reporting cycle which should be within two to three years.  This will provide us with an opportunity to identify any remaining actions needed for the highest possible level of compliance with the convention.<\/p><p>The Senator can take it that I will be opting in when I am ready and when things are in place.  That is the approach the Government will take.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018050100002#C00200","speaker":"1359","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525181400,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I asked the Minister of State four questions.

In this era of Brexit, my call to explore the potential benefits of rejoining the Commonwealth of Nations continues to provoke an interesting response.  Many of us here are democratic Irish nationalists and proud Europeans but we live in a time when our future relationships with Britain will be shaped by Brexit.  That is why I believe it is very important that we seek to develop and nurture new relationships.<\/p> <p>The stark reality of Brexit is already biting at fundamental levels.  Here is just one example.  Until recently an average of 26 daily meetings took place between Irish and UK officials.  Those regular meetings between British and Irish diplomats and politicians at a European level were instrumental in fostering good relations and understanding between the two islands.  In my personal opinion, I believe Ireland and the UK's joint entry into the EEC 45 years ago paved the way for the Anglo-Irish and Good Friday agreements, both of which have delivered peace and a shared future to our two islands.<\/p> <p>In terms of the relationship building, I do not think it is a coincidence that Ireland has recently applied for observer status to join the Francophonie, a club of French-speaking states with 57 members which is a Commonwealth-style organisation.  As a way of fostering links with French-speaking countries, it is a move which is strategic and welcome.  I have consistently encouraged debates on the merits of Ireland rejoining the Commonwealth of Nations.  Indeed, I believe that, by doing so, the Republic of Ireland could pioneer the way for new relationships with Commonwealth countries, which include the UK, and with the EU itself.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Frank Feighan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2014\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2014&amp;amp;pid=FrankFeighan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=01\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The Republic already has strong links with Commonwealth countries in terms of aid, trade, politics, education, common legal systems, the diaspora and sport.  Notably, 70% of the people born on the island of Ireland residing overseas live in Commonwealth countries.  It is estimated that more than 20 million people of Irish origin live within Commonwealth countries such as the UK, Australia, New Zealand and Canada.  With a combined population of 2.3 billion, the Commonwealth comprises 53 countries, 31 of which are republics like us.<\/p><p>In foreign aid support, the Commonwealth has helped to lift many countries out of poverty and it counts among its member states not just developing nations, but also many high-tech countries such as India and South Africa.<\/p><p>For those who are not familiar with the Commonwealth, it is a goodwill organisation that performs a positive global role.  It is not the British Commonwealth of old, but the modern Commonwealth of Nations, to which it was renamed in 1949 to accommodate republics such as ours.  It is also important to say that the UK is just one of 53 member states and accounts for less than 3% of the population.  Suffice it to say that, while Britain is still an important member of the Commonwealth, it is no longer the boss.  Furthermore, the Queen is a titular head who carries no power.  She is just a symbol of free association within Commonwealth countries, the majority of which are republics, with five having monarchs of royal households not associated with the UK's.<\/p><p>Let us be clear.  I am a realist, so I know that the debate about Commonwealth membership for the Republic of Ireland will involve many issues, complexities and sensitivities.  However, I have a firm conviction that, if we put our old prejudices to one side when we consider the merits of rejoining the Commonwealth of Nations, we will find much value in what I am proposing.<\/p><p>The most important reason I have called for a debate on rejoining the Commonwealth is that, if we truly desire a united Ireland, one Ireland or a shared island, we must show our unionist friends that we are not afraid to take this leap of faith.  We could look forward to our two islands co-operating North-South and east-west on many new fronts, with sport being just one example.  Can we not envisage the possibility of seeing an island of Ireland team in, for example, hockey and many other sports competing in future Commonwealth games?  Can we not dare to dream that such possibilities could help to pave the way for an all-island soccer team competing in future World Cup competitions and European championships?  This is worthy of serious consideration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018050100002#E00500","speaker":"1424","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525181400,"counter":24,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this issue, which he has discussed many times before and is something in which he believes passionately.

Last year, the Taoiseach announced a doubling of our global footprint.  Work has begun on the initial phase of this expansion of Ireland's diplomatic network with new embassies in Santiago in Chile, Bogot&aacute; in Colombia, Amman in Jordan and Wellington in New Zealand, and new Consulates General in Vancouver, Canada, and Mumbai, India, opening this year.  Further expansion will be considered by the Government and take into account Ireland's political, trading, cultural and other strategic interests and priorities.<\/p> <p>The UK's decision to leave the EU is regrettable and has serious implications for Ireland.  Indeed, Brexit is not good for anyone.  However, we must maintain a strong and constructive bilateral relationship with the UK.  We are fully committed to developing and enhancing that relationship over the coming years no matter what the outcome.  In the context of the UK's exit from the European Union, we will work to secure the closest possible positive relationship between the UK and the EU.<\/p> <p>While the UK and Ireland share a turbulent past, our relationship in recent times has been close.  For example, a number of successful high-level visits have had a positive impact on our relationship, most notably the state visit by Queen Elizabeth II to Ireland in 2011 and the reciprocal state visit by President Higgins to the UK in 2014.

The Good Friday Agreement provides for important institutional co-operation on an east-west basis including through the British-Irish Council, BIC.  In addition, the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly brings together elected representatives from the Oireachtas, Westminster, the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the Scottish and Welsh devolved assemblies.  These structures have, for the most part, shown their value and will continue to evolve in response to the changing circumstances.  In addition, we will also explore other avenues to maintain the &ldquo;habit of co-operation&rdquo; that currently exists where Ministers regularly meet their counterparts and work together in Brussels.

The context is that Mungret is now a highly built-up residential area, unlike other locations in the country.  A public meeting was held by the group Limerick Against Pollution in the South Court Hotel last Friday night at 7.30 p.m.  More than 300 people across all age groups attended.  It was a very representative group.  These are decent, ordinary people who are worried about the implications of the licence which Irish Cement is seeking in order to convert the Mungret plant from running on fossil fuels to alternative fuels.  This involves, in layman's terms, the burning of tyres.  It will effectively use an existing kiln, which is over 35 years old and which is currently being fired by fossil fuels, to burn tyres.<\/p><p>I want to raise a couple of points.  Irish Cement is looking at burning 90,000 tonnes per annum.  There is a move away from fossil fuels as a result of carbon credits and so on, however the question is whether what is being proposed is safer or less safe.  There has been very little engagement from Irish Cement.  I personally made contact with it to encourage it to attend the public meeting last Friday night.  It declined.  There has been some engagement, but not enough.  From speaking to residents in the area and, more recently, calling to their homes and meeting them, I know that there is a distinct lack of trust among the public in the area as regards what is happening with the Irish Cement plant.  There is an issue with what residents regard as blow-outs, although Irish Cement say they are not blow-outs.  However, from speaking to people, they are.  There are concerns about the way in which the plant is designed.  People's cars are regularly covered with lime and so forth.  There is a worry.  There are three new schools in the area.  There are many young families and an awful lot of houses which have been built very near the Irish Cement plant.<\/p><p>How does the Minister intend to regulate these heavy industries in light of environmental concerns?  In respect of the Irish Cement plant more particularly, the council has granted planning permission for the physical storage structure.  However, the operation of the alternative fuels incinerator is licensed by the EPA.  The application is currently before the EPA.  It is due to issue a draft response on 16 May.  That may change.  I encourage people in the area to make submissions.  The question I really want answered is how is it intended to regulate in this area?  <\/p><p>I brought this issue up previously and the Minister agreed to put extra air monitoring locations into operation, one of which was to be in Mungret.  There is a need for many more.  The outputs from that particular location for the last three months of last year were analysed and the analysis showed spikes.  People need assurance that this area will be properly regulated.  There is a strong need for the EPA to license activities before applications for physical structures are made to the council.  The council should not be able to grant permission if it has any environmental concerns.  The Minister of State might deal with the general point but also comment on the specific licence application Irish Cement has before the EPA.  People in the area have grave concerns that what is being proposed will be more harmful to health.  This is about public health and ensuring that Government policy promotes public health.   We must avoid a situation in which seeking to reduce the use of fossil fuels results in unintended consequences from the burning of alternative fuels.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018050100002#G00500","speaker":"1374","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525181400,"counter":32,"content":"<p>I thank Senator O'Donnell for raising this issue.

These include the agency having a key role in licensing facilities with the potential for significant environmental pollution to ensure that their emissions do not endanger human health or harm the environment.  The agency is responsible for issuing industrial emission directive licences, integrated pollution and control, IPC, licences, waste licences, wastewater discharge authorisations, genetically modified organisms authorisations and radiological protection licences.<br\/><br\/>The EPA is responsible for the licence and enforcement of large industrial plants listed in the first schedule of the EPA Act 1992, as amended.  The Irish Cement site in Mungret falls into this category and is covered by the industrial emissions directive, Directive 2010\/75\/EU.  This directive specifies the emission limit values that apply on the basis of the best available techniques.  Conditions implementing the directive&rsquo;s requirements are written into the industrial emissions licences granted by the EPA.  Details of current licensed facilities and applications for new and revised licences are available on the agency&rsquo;s website.<br\/><br\/>I believe it would be useful for me to outline briefly the application process in place for applications for industrial emissions licences, to emphasise the rigour of the process, and the wide scope for public participation in the decision making processes in each case.  Before an application is even made, applicants are required to publish a notice in a local newspaper and to erect a site notice of their intentions.  Then, on making the actual application, the applicant must pay the required fee and provide all the necessary documentation to the agency.  Within eight weeks of the application, the agency is required to publish how it proposes to determine an application.  This stage allows any person or body to make an objection within 28 days, and any such person or body is furthermore entitled to request an oral hearing.  Only then, having considered the application and all objection submissions received, is a final decision on the licence application made by the agency.  This decision is published on the agency&rsquo;s website and any person may then apply to the High Court and seek a judicial review of the validity of the decision.<br\/><br\/>When operable, such facilities are then subject to ongoing monitoring by the agency.  The agency also encourages public participation in its ongoing regulatory and enforcement activities by welcoming reports from the public of any negative environmental impacts arising from facilities that it licenses, including odours, noise or water pollution.  The Mungret facility is currently the subject of a licence review.  This process allows the public to view documents for this application or to make a submission to the EPA.  The EPA licence reference number for Irish Cement site located in Mungret, Limerick is No. P0030-05, should anyone wish to raise concerns.  The EPA operates in a fully transparent and open manner and publishes comprehensive details about its activities.  Further information is available to the public on <i>www.epa.ie<\/i>.  The Minister is precluded under legislation from interfering in the agency&rsquo;s licensing decision making process.  The Minister believes that the agency has a sufficient range of powers under the existing legislative code to adequately regulate and monitor such facilities in order to protect the environment and human health, ensure that key standards are met and enable the public, particularly local communities, to input should any issues relating to the day-to-day operation of any facility emerge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018050100002#H00200","speaker":"1314","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525181400,"counter":34,"content":"<p>The Minister of State believes the agency has sufficient powers to adequately regulate and monitor such facilities.

That should have been in a long time ago.<\/p> <p>I want to quickly address three elements.  First, I ask that Irish Cement now engage properly with the residents living in the area on this licence.  It is the minimum they require and should be in the form of a public meeting to address people's concerns and deal with the lack of trust the public in the greater Mungret, Dooradoyle and Raheen area have in what is happening in Irish Cement.  Second, I ask that the Minister of State looks at the laws for the operation of the facility.  The EPA should come before the council looking for permission.  Third, will the Minister of State give a commitment that the level of resources provided to monitor what is happening regarding emissions from heavy industries like the Irish Cement site in Mungret will be enhanced, because as of now it is inadequate?<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Kieran O'Donnell:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2207\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2207&amp;amp;pid=KieranODonnell&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=01\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This is about public health and the concerns of people living in the Mungret, Dooradoyle and Raheen areas for themselves and their children.

I also encourage those in the area who have concerns to make submissions to the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA.

He will accept that it is difficult for me to comment on an individual licence application lest I be accused of interfering in the EPA's independent licensing process.  We have to take that on board.<\/p> <p>I would also point out that while overall compliance with EPA licences is good, the EPA's office of environmental enforcement introduced a new methodology in 2015 for risk-ranking national priority sites, which takes account of enforcement performance giving a timely, dynamic and accurate picture of what regulatory responses should be directed.<\/p> <p>Targeting actions in the right places is also of critical importance to the EPA in addressing the problems in an effective and efficient manner.  It is placing a particular focus on any licensed industrial waste and wastewater facilities creating a nuisance for adjacent communities.  EPA prosecutions are particularly focused on priority sites.  In 2016, the EPA conducted over 1,500 site visits at licensed facilities and 17 prosecutions were pursued.  Anyone with concerns in respect of the operations of the Mungret facility should raise them directly with the agency.  As the Senator said, people have the opportunity to make submissions as the Senator has done, and to request an oral hearing at which these issues can be aired in public.  I would hope that all parties would engage in processes as required and that the concerns of people in the locality will be taken on board in any decision made by the Environmental Protection Agency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018050100002#K00200","speaker":"1314"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Institutes of Technology","time":1525181400,"counter":37,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018050100002#K00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1525181400,"counter":38,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte leis an Aire St&aacute;it, at&aacute; tagtha anseo chun eolais a thabhairt d&uacute;inn maidir le GMIT.

I visited Castlebar and saw the work that needs to be done.  I agree that it should be done as quickly as possible.<\/p> <p>I reiterate the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the future sustainability of the Castlebar campus of GMIT.  This is the reason the Minister for Education, Deputy Bruton, established the working group in March 2017 to develop a plan that would safeguard the future of the Castlebar campus.  I also confirm that the Department and the Higher Education Authority, HEA, are focused on ensuring that the recommendations of the working group are implemented as soon as possible and with appropriate consultation with relevant stakeholders.<\/p> <p>The GMIT working group was chaired by the HEA and comprised representatives from GMIT, the Department, Mayo County Council and other local stakeholders.  It also comprised representation from the staff and students on the Castlebar campus.  The report of the working group was published in December 2017.  It provides a wide-ranging assessment of the context within which the campus is currently operating, and outlines a proposed vision for the future of the Mayo campus.  It also provides a strategic and comprehensive plan to address the financial and sustainability issues which have been experienced by the GMIT Mayo campus in recent years.<\/p> <p>The working group recommendations are primarily for GMIT to implement.  However, there are recommendations that relate to the Department.  The Department has responded to these as a matter of priority.  To this end, the Department has provided ring-fenced funding of &euro;750,000 for the Castlebar campus for each of the next five years while the plan is being implemented.  Capital funding is also being provided for the replacement of the roof of the GMIT campus, which is currently in need of repair.  The Department and the HEA are working with GMIT to ensure that the other recommendations are being progressed.  One of the significant recommendations was the re-establishment of a sub-committee of the governing body of OMIT to oversee the management and development of the Mayo campus.

The appointment of an independent external facilitator to oversee the transition to new structural and operational arrangements is another significant recommendation.  The facilitator will play an important role in supporting the implementation of a number of the other working group recommendations.  The facilitator will also contribute to rebuilding relationships where this is necessary.  In that regard, the Higher Education Authority, HEA, wrote to the Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, GMIT, in March, requesting that progress be made on the appointment.  The terms of reference for this position are being developed by GMIT in consultation with the HEA.

I welcome both to the 25th Seanad.  I wish my former colleagues Denis Landy and Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh well in their new endeavours.<\/p> <p>I would like to mention the CervicalCheck scandal.  I commend Vicky Phelan and her family on their bravery in shining a light on this and on following through with their case against the State and the screening company in the High Court.  It is no mean feat taking on the State and large companies backed by resources and insurance funds, especially when liability is contested from the outset and up until the very end.  Listening to Vicky Phelan on the radio, I was amazed at her strength and composure.  She has done the women of Ireland a huge service.  For that, I am very thankful.  I can only imagine the anger she and her family feel owing to her treatment and the failure of the State, via the CervicalCheck programme, to disclose adequately her test results to her on time.  Had it disclosed her results to her when they were available to the programme, her clinical outcome would have been very different.<\/p> <p>The cervical cancer screening programme was first implemented in the summer of 2008 by the Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats Government.  It was a major step in the provision of health care, particularly women's health care.  It is a screening service that has saved hundreds of lives to date.  At the time the programme was implemented, there were almost 2,000 people waiting to be screened in the country.  We have also learned that the national screening service was responsible for choosing the service providers.  At the time, an American provider was awarded the tender.  Since then, and as confirmed today by An Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, in the D&aacute;il, Irish and American service providers are now used to provide the screening service.  However, Vicky Phelan's case in the High Court and the request of her to sign a non-disclosure clause was, in my opinion and that of the women of Ireland, shameful.  What is more shameful is that the State, including the Minister and Department of Health, have adopted a hands-off Bart Simpson-type approach to its knowledge of the court case.  The Government, from my understanding, states that the National Claims Agency did not discuss this matter with the Department officials or the Minister, or both.  I find this very hard to believe.<\/p> <p>Yesterday, the HSE confirmed that 17 women whose test results were viewed as part of an audit of the service have, sadly, died.  We have learned that, of the 208 whose results were scrutinised, only 46 were informed about the history of their smear test.  This non-disclosure by the State and medics working for the State is unconscionable.  Why would their results not be disclosed to them?  The Government has breached the trust of the women of Ireland.  This mismanagement has justifiably frightened the women of Ireland who have put their trust in the CervicalCheck programme.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Catherine Ardagh:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2473\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2473&amp;amp;pid=CatherineArdagh&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=01\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Confidence in this programme is gone.  We need to get to the bottom of all the facts about the CervicalCheck programme, including when exactly the Minister and his officials were aware of this particular and other such cases.  We learned today that a memo was produced.  Was this the first time the Minister was made aware of this case?  Why is there secrecy and a failure to disclose test results on a systemic basis?  We need an independent inquiry to be established without delay to get to the bottom of the facts.  We also need to ensure all the actors involved in this matter are able to contribute to such an inquiry, even if those actors happen to retire before it is established.<\/p><p>As a woman and a Senator, I urge the women of Ireland to make sure they get their smear tests as it is the best way, along with a cervical vaccine, to prevent cervical cancer.  With this controversy under way, I urge women to ensure their tests are up to date and not to delay in getting screened.  Cancer screening saves lives.  We need to improve these programmes, not abandon them.  Will the Minister attend the House to have a debate on this matter?<\/p><p>Today is World Asthma Day.  Many of us who suffer from it know there is a heightened alert regarding pollen and hay fever.  If someone feels they have the symptoms of asthma, I urge them to attend their GP for a diagnosis.

Instead, I felt there was a tension and a guardedness which was regrettable.  I do not feel confident that the higher echelons of our health service have been dealing with matters as they ought.  I believe there is a long way to go with learnings.  Senator Ardagh just referenced the issue of disclosure.  Why were there non-disclosures with regard to settlements with the State?  Why was there non-disclosure by senior medics to patients of information which was relevant to their situations?<\/p> <p>It is common case that nothing we say should ever discourage women going for a smear test or, indeed, people going for any kind of cancer screening.  That goes without saying, yet it always has to be said.  Whatever criticisms or hard findings there may be to make, whatever hard statements are made or whatever consequences there are for people high up in the health service, people must know it is always in their interests to go for screening and, in this case, smear tests.  People are entitled to ask why certain decisions were made.  They are also entitled to ask whether HIQA is capable of delivering the answers.  The uncomfortable question at the heart of all this is if it was about money.  Despite people being in a position to know and warn about farming out certain services to the United States, was a financial consideration in mind?  What do we think about that, if that was the case?  If it is the case that the decision was made to use services abroad instead of services here, has that run down our ability as a country in the near term to provide a higher quality service?<\/p> <p>There is too much at stake for people to speculate wildly about the facts.  We can only ask questions at this point but ask them we must.  I hope there will be no hedging but a straightforward frankness, respectful of people's dignity.

What is important for them is that we protect the quality of our air both internally and externally.  <\/p><p>It is important this morning to mention our two new Senators, Senators Lawlor and Marshall.  In terms of agriculture, that brings me to the two letters - AI - but we will say no more about that.  On behalf of the Civil Engagement group, I am very happy to welcome both Senators to the House.  They are on the agricultural panel.  The only thing I would say to them about an issue close to my heart is that agriculture, agrifood and all those issues are also part of rural Ireland and rural development.  Looking over the farm gate into the farm is one activity.  Looking from the other side out into the rural community is the other side of it.  Certainly in the Republic of Ireland, there are more people with disabilities in rural Ireland than there are farm families so there are issues about social exclusion.  There are many elderly farmers who are often single men who face issues like loneliness and mental health difficulties.  There are issues around agriculture that are not purely agricultural.  It is important to keep those in the story as it unfolds.  <\/p><p>I note the Seanad motion before us today that seeks to alter Standing Order 74 to some extent.  This is something in which I was involved to make sure that three Oireachtas committees could meet regarding a shared interest in people with disabilities.  Whatever about new politics, it is important that we find reformed ways of working.  I was surprised to find that there was no way without this device that more than two Oireachtas committees could meet to discuss a subject.

I look forward to working with both Senators in the time ahead.  Our opinions will diverge on some subjects but that is not necessarily a bad thing.  Much has been made of the election of Senator Marshall and the fact that Sinn F&eacute;in made the decision to support him.  Some even questioned if he is a real unionist, which made me wonder what constitutes a real unionist or a real Irish republican.  Perhaps those who pose such questions should reflect on what they need to do to create an environment of mutual respect and equality in which we are all free to be whoever we are and to create a society in which no human being is less equal and in which other individuals or communities do not have to be put down in order that we might elevate ourselves.<\/p><p>The journey that began with the collective overwhelming support for the Good Friday Agreement has some way to go.  There have been disappointments and frustrations on the pathway to agreement's full implementation, most recently when the DUP was unable to close the deal agreed to get the institutions back up and running.  However, we must not let these setbacks stop us on the journey to lasting peace and reconciliation.  No problem is insurmountable.  We have had to overcome problems in the past and we will do so again.  Sinn F&eacute;in wants the institutions back up and running and I welcome the unionist perspective that Senator Marshall will bring to the House.  After all, we only learn from those with a perspective that deviates from our own.

In particular we need to know how many women should have concerns.  Thousands of women are ringing the helpline.  As of this morning more than 6,000 women had already contacted the helpline.  We need to know if the resources will be put in place to address the concerns of the many thousands of women who have gone through CervicalCheck.  We also need to ensure that women continue to attend for screening because many women have routine appointments for screening already scheduled.<br\/><br\/>I note that the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists has stated that it is essential women continue to have smear tests when called and that screening remains the best way to detect cervical cancer.  It notes that the combination of HPV vaccination and a well-resourced national screening programme is the best way to reduce the incidence.  Of course, it should not be forgotten that we have seen a 7% decrease in cervical cancer per year in each year of the programme.  I think all of us know women and families who have been affected by cervical cancer, and we recognise this is a deadly killer.  It is vital that we ensure we have a robust screening programme and a robust vaccination programme.  The Minister and the head of the HSE need to move very swiftly to allay people's concerns.<br\/><br\/>As my party's health spokesperson in the D&aacute;il, Deputy Kelly, has pointed out, we, along with everybody else, support a review.  The key question is over the appropriate body to undertake a review.  Does HIQA have sufficient statutory powers to enable the sort of investigation to be carried out that we desperately require?  Should HIQA be further resourced or should the matter now be put into a commission of investigation or, indeed, a tribunal?  The first priority, before we descend into political discussion or questioning on it, is to ensure women's health is protected.<br\/><br\/>On a happier note, I welcome today's introduction of the sugar tax, which has also been welcomed by the Irish Heart Foundation.

As the first Northern unionist elected to the Seanad to represent the views and opinions of the people of Northern Ireland and to give their perspective, this position carries with it significant responsibility and many challenges, but presents countless opportunities for all concerned.  The time is right and public opinion supports this across Northern Ireland and across the Republic of Ireland.<\/p><p>Born in 1865, William Butler Yeats was one of the most famous pillars of Irish and British literature and one of the first Senators in this House in the first Seanad in 1922, serving two terms until 1928.  Yeats was acutely aware of the importance of taking action when the time was right when he made the following statement: \"Do not wait to strike till the iron is hot; but make it hot by striking.\"  I firmly believe that the time to strike the iron is now.  I will strive to add to discussion and debate and to offer a different perspective.  Most importantly, I will listen and I will learn, I will offer my opinion and I will respectfully challenge the discussion.  My biggest strength is my passion for my work and the industry and the country I represent, and my biggest weakness is my passion for my work and the industry and the country I represent.<\/p><p>Northern Ireland and its relationship with Ireland has changed and is evolving, evidenced notably more than 20 years ago with the signing of the Good Friday Agreement.  This momentous event in history was celebrated at Queen's University a couple of weeks ago and many of those involved were present at the university, including the T&aacute;naiste, who told the assembled that the Good Friday Agreement is as relevant now as it was then, something which I firmly believe.  Thanks to strong leadership in 1998, vision and an appetite to deliver, my children and all the children across Northern Ireland are growing up in a peaceful, progressive, shared society, cognisant of cultures working together for tomorrow.<\/p><p>Many wise words were spoken at Queen's by the assembled dignitaries that day.  Bertie Ahern spoke, as did Tony Blair, Bill Clinton and George Mitchell, to name a few.  However, the most touching sentiment actually came from an Armagh man who has lived in a village three miles from myself for as long as I can remember.  Seamus Mallon was one of the key negotiators of the Good Friday Agreement and was highly respected in political circles.  His words that day were so profound that I felt I should visit him after the 20th anniversary event to ask permission to share his words with the Chamber today.  He talked of identity in Northern Ireland, whether British or Irish, and the continual struggle of those laying claim to the title or label placed upon the Six Counties.  Making reference to competing cultural claims on the land, he said: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what they call it, as long as it has one name: home.&rdquo;  It was a truly Heaney-esque quotation and he was correct, because for all of us, irrespective of our culture, it is home.  To quote another Member of these Houses, whether one considers oneself Irish or British, both or neither, one should feel comfortable in Northern Ireland.<\/p><p>I had not planned to speak on Brexit as my thoughts are well documented, except to say that, very often in life, you do not know what you have got until it is gone.  Europe is not perfect and it has flaws, but to quote one of the panel members in Belfast two weeks ago, leaving is a profound mistake.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018050100002#T00300","speaker":"1439","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525181400,"counter":79,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018050100002#U00200","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"speech","time":1525181400,"counter":80,"content":"<p>Northern Ireland has a silent majority and there are only a few things we know about them: they are silent and they are the majority.

We often have a few battles here but overall, everyone gets on extremely well.<\/p> <p>I echo what has been said regarding this disturbing information dripping from the HSE in the past few days.  Thousands of women across Ireland have been on tenterhooks in case their telephone will ring to inform them that they are among those women who are walking around with something that could kill them.  The HSE put them in this position when it was revealed that it had not been able to contact all those affected.  The cervical screening programme is extremely important.  Early intervention, this type of screening and initiatives like the HPV vaccine are vital in reducing cervical cancer rates in Ireland.  Everyone now has devastating doubts.  There has been a breach of trust yet again.  Yet again, the women of Ireland are not being looked after and there are questions to be answered here.  I heard the briefing from the HSE yesterday and was sickened to learn that women still are being contacted today.  Those women and their families must be in hell right now.  Some women still cannot be located because no one can tally their records.  This is beyond belief and it appears as though we may not have the whole truth.  Women have died.<\/p> <p>The chairperson of the HSE serious incident management team stated that 162 out of 208 women affected by the screening were not told that a review had been conducted by CervicalCheck or of the outcome.  As a matter of urgency, the HSE must be held accountable.  As far as I have seen, the HSE is like the wild west: anything goes and there are no laws, which is unacceptable.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, must rush in to provide independent scrutiny in this regard.  It must be efficient and fast and an outcome is needed because women are suffering.  There must be a reason for someone to make a mistake and there needs to be a better system for concerns to be raised and heard.  First and foremost, women must be told as soon as anything like this happens.  I believe the Minister needs to come in and address this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018050100002#V00800","speaker":"1395"},{"type":"speech","time":1525181400,"counter":89,"content":"<p>That has already been proposed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018050100002#W00050","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1525181400,"counter":90,"content":"<p>I appreciate that.

The one thing I would say to them is, \"Enjoy it.\"<\/p> <p>We have heard many Members today speak of Vicky Phelan.  There are few words that can describe what must have gone through that woman's head.  However, there are questions that have to be asked.   I am afraid it is all too easy to drag Ministers before different Houses and have them flogged over something that happened.  Senior people in the HSE, in the State's defence, took decisions and took the most vicious and aggressive approach to this woman.  They have now been beaten into a corner where they are talking about finding some sort of solution for the other women.  We must remember sitting in here that there are over 100 women who do not know.  Bringing a Minister into any House in order to have a go for the sake of it is wrong.  I am not saying that he should not come in and answer questions.<\/p> <p>I would like to see the senior people that made decisions.  Decisions are made by the administrative side before a Minister is ever contacted.  I would like to see what decisions they made, when they made them and from where they took their advice.  I would like to know what legal person gave the advice to take this absolutely aggressive approach against a woman who was facing death.  That is the question we want to ask.  We do not want politicisation of this issue.  We want to get to the bottom line.  We do not want some long, goddamn inquiry.  We want answers now.<\/p> <p>The Minister does not get off the hook either.  I spoke to some women today who rang the helpline who naturally are beside themselves with worry.  One of the statements that has been repeated over and over again is that any woman who wants a repeat test can have it straightaway.

These are small schools located in rural areas.  Many of their buildings are old buildings, which have usually been upgraded.  Perhaps they might have an extension or something similar.  In many cases, there are narrow and dangerous roads leading to these schools.  Many of those schools were built at a time when the only traffic going to school was on foot.  The students walked to school.  That is the reality.  There is a lot more traffic on the roads now and many of these schools struggle to provide proper traffic management and parking.

It is a two-teacher school.  The only option for the staff is to park on the road.  The only option for parents dropping off kids is to do so at the roadside.  Cars are whizzing by on what is a substandard and inadequate road in any event.  The Department will not assist the school in the provision of parking or traffic management and the local authority does not want to help either.  In my view, road safety and traffic management should be the concern of both the local authority, in this case Mayo County Council, and the Department of Education and Skills.  The reality is that if these students were fortunate enough to be getting a new school, the Department of Education and Skills would require traffic management and provision for children to get in and out of transport - cars or buses - safely.  These schools cannot afford that because they are small.

That should be acknowledged and applauded in this House.  We should be very proud of our Government, diplomatic service and permanent Civil Service in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.

In all cases, they had an extraordinary awareness of our problem and support for it.  The Irish Government, our permanent Civil Service and our diplomats abroad should take a bow.  This matter is so important to me because the people in my community, along the Border in Cavan-Monaghan, stand to experience economic and social devastation and potentially a breakdown of all societal norms if we do not avoid a hard border.  I offer the House's appreciation of Michel Barnier's stance and ask our Leader to endorse it and to give us an assurance that it will be continued.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018050100002#Y01700","speaker":"1397","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525181400,"counter":120,"content":"<p>I propose an amendment to the Order of Business, \"That item 19a on the supplementary Order Paper be taken today\".<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018050100002#Z00200","speaker":"1382"},{"type":"speech","time":1525181400,"counter":121,"content":"<p>Is the Senator proposing it be taken before item 1?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018050100002#Z00300","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1525181400,"counter":122,"content":"<p>Yes.

If one rings from Three mobile or Vodafone and happens to be on the line to a Government Department for up to 30 minutes, it will cost between &euro;9 and &euro;13.50.  This is an issue we must grasp.  I am confident that certain elements of Government are aware of this because when the local property tax number was advertised, the Department was aware of the problem and changed the criteria to accommodate it.  Revenue Online is an example of where people are provided with an 1890 number and believe that they are speaking to someone on the other end for the price of a local call.  We need to be aware of that issue, and the message needs to be brought back to Government that we should desist from using such numbers and find a number that will not cost much for those who take time to ring.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018050100002#AA00500","speaker":"1396"},{"type":"speech","time":1525181400,"counter":128,"content":"<p>We are running way over time.

As Leader of the House and leader of the Fine Gael group, I join all Members in condemning the treatment of all the women involved.  This should not be happening in an Irish society that is supposed to cherish all equally.  There are 70 women who have died and 160 are waiting for answers.  As some Members of the House said, the latter are living in fear and petrification.  Senator Conway-Walsh should note I intend to have the Minister come to the House.  Unfortunately, he is in the D&aacute;il Chamber today.  I hope to have him here either tomorrow or Thursday.  I will have him in at the earliest possible opportunity.  It is critical that all of us, particularly the affected women and their families, receive the full facts and all the information.  It beggars belief that the Minister for Health did not have all the information and was not given it by the people we charge with the administration of the health service of our country.  It is time people were held to account.  Let us do so when we have all the facts and the full facts, and not just some of the facts.<\/p><p>All of us in this House are angry, dismayed and sorry, and we are sickened and appalled by the treatment of Vicky Phelan and the women involved.  I commend Vicky Phelan on her bravery and courage.  There should be no withholding of information from patients, their doctors or a Minister.  No longer can we accept it.  It should not be accepted.  Senator Conway and others are right that there are those who must be held to account who have to be held to account.  It is time that we, as a society, held to account those charged with the administration of our health system.  I will await the full facts.  I speak as a Chairman of a committee that engaged in pre-legislative scrutiny regarding open disclosure and medical indemnity.  Senator Burke was a very strong part of that committee.  We must get the full facts, whether it is through HIQA or a statutory inquiry.  I do not mind once we get all the information and the facts for those involved.<\/p><p>The Minister said the re-checks will be free.  I heard Senator Craughwell's remarks on that in terms of the telephone number.  I do believe what is advocated will be done by the Minister.  It is a matter of giving out the information.  As the Taoiseach said in the D&aacute;il regarding open disclosure, it is the Government&rsquo;s intention to bring forward legislation to provide for open disclosure and to make it mandatory.<\/p><p>It is also worth noting that we had an all-party committee dealing with the issue of open disclosure that opted to propose the voluntary route first and the mandatory route second.  That is what the Government is following and it is in the programme for Government.  The Taoiseach asked the Attorney General, on behalf of the Government, to examine the early settlement of similar cases to avoid, as many Members have mentioned, lengthy, unnecessary, costly legal cases and actions.  It is important that we see that action followed through.  The duty of candour is contained in the Medical Council guidelines, which must be followed.<\/p><p>It is important that we establish all the facts.  The statutory inquiry or investigation is not being ruled out.  What the Government will do next will be based on getting the full information and all the facts.  We must restore confidence in the cervical cancer screening programme.  It is important that we state today that the screening programme saves lives, as Senator Burke and others have said.  The HPV vaccine does prevent the loss of life.  It is worth noting that our cancer care has improved.<\/p><p>Senator Mullen raised the issue of the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists' statement.  I ask him and all Members to read it because it is about urging women to have smear tests and calling for a thorough investigation.  It is important to remember that screening for cervical cancer is an important, cost-effective public health initiative but, more important, it saves lives. <\/p><p>I will have the Minister come to the House as soon as possible.  As I said, that is my intent.  I hope Senator Conway-Walsh will accept my bona fides on that as she knows I have always endeavoured to have the Minister attend as fast as I can.<\/p><p>Senator Dolan raised the issue of World Asthma Day.  It is an important day.  Four hundred and fifty thousand people in the country have some type of asthma.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018050100002#DD02500","speaker":"1391","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1525181400,"counter":196,"content":"<p>Additional debate to follow.<\/p>"}]
