I expect to bring this Plan to Government very shortly.<\/p>  <p>  As part of delivering early on this element of the reform programme, the Government has agreed to the\u00a0establishment of an independent\u00a0board for the HSE.

As an initial first step, my Department has\u00a0undertaken a public\u00a0consultation regarding the geographical alignment of Hospital Groups and Community Healthcare Organisations. The outputs from this consultation process will inform the development of detailed proposals in this area, including the role and function of regional bodies.<\/p>  <p>  Reducing waiting times and the numbers on waiting lists is a key priority for the Government and will form an important component of the forthcoming Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Plan.\u00a0I have already put in\u00a0place a number of\u00a0important initiatives to improve waiting times.<\/p>  <p>  In Budget 2018, &euro;50 million was provided to the NTPF to provide treatment for public patients this year, which more than doubled its 2017 total allocation for the NTPF.\u00a0 The NTPF will provide all the treatment for patients in both public and private hospitals.<\/p>  <p>  I published the Inpatient and Day Case Action Plan in April, a joint initiative between my Department, the NTPF and the HSE with the aim of reducing the overall number of patients waiting for treatment.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  My Department, the HSE and the NTPF are in the process of finalising an Outpatient Action Plan for 2018.\u00a0 Also, this month I approved the establishment of a Central Validation Office in the National Treatment Purchase Fund in order to centralise the validation of all waiting lists across the HSE.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062800047#WRC02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists Action Plans","counter":149,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062800047#WRC02300"},{"type":"question","counter":150,"qnumday":58,"qnumall":"[27853\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062800047#WRC02400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the detail of the ongoing wait list validation process which is being undertaken in the Children's Hospital Group; the steps that occur; the way in which a decision is made that a child should be removed from the outpatient waiting list; if it is a clinical or administrative decision; the way in which children are safeguarded during this process; if the child&rsquo;s consultants are involved in the decision making process; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1302","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":151,"content":"<p>Improving waiting times for hospital procedures and outpatient appointments is a key commitment in the Programme for Government.

To support this, we plan to establish a new statutory scheme for the financing and regulation of home care services. The Department is currently engaged in a detailed process to progress this.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Health Service Capacity Review 2018, published in January, outlines projections of demand and capacity requirements for a range of health services to 2031. As our population, particularly our older population continues to grow, key projections from the analysis indicate, for the period 2016-2021 <\/p>  <p>  - 12% growth in overall population;<\/p>  <p>  - 59% growth in 65+ population; and<\/p>  <p>  - 95% growth in 85+ population.<\/p>  <p>  The review notes that if key reforms and productivity measures are implemented, a 120% increase in home supports will be required by 2031.<\/p>  <p>  While the new home care scheme is under development, the Department of Health and HSE are continuing to incrementally improve the existing services and meet the growing demand for home support services.\u00a0The HSE has begun streamlining services in 2018 by bringing together the funding for home help and standard home care packages, which now operate as a single home support service. This new approach will provide significant benefits including making the services easier to understand; streamlining the application and decision-making processes; and facilitating service users to move to changed levels of service as their assessed needs change, without the need for an additional application process.<\/p>  <p>  Additional funding of &euro;112 million has been provided for home support services over the past three years. Home support services were a particular area of focus in Budget 2018, with an additional &euro;18.25 million allocated. As a result, 2018 has seen a further increase in the provision of home support services. The HSE&rsquo;s National Service Plan provides for a target of just over 17 million home support hours to be provided to 50,500 people.\u00a0This represents an increase of 754,000 hours and home support for 500 more people over last year.\u00a0 In addition, 235 intensive home care packages will provide 360,000 home support hours for people with complex needs.\u00a0 Earlier this year, due to the adverse winter weather, a further initiative saw an additional 324 people being provided with home support services.<\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Government committed to increasing funding for Home Care Packages and Home Help every year. The planning and management of future health expenditure will be considered as part of the annual estimates and budgetary process which seeks to balance available funding across all the various service areas to achieve the best possible outcomes for the greatest number of service users and prioritise areas of greatest need.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062800047#WRC06100","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospitals Funding","counter":187,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062800048#WRD00200"},{"type":"question","counter":188,"qnumday":71,"qnumall":"[27817\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062800048#WRD00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if approval will be forthcoming for a request for additional funding of &euro;1.8 million from Letterkenny University Hospital to enable it to open an additional 20 bed ward and staff it appropriately in order to address an issue with persons waiting on trolleys for hospital admission; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1244","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":189,"content":"<p>In the light of the conclusions of the Health Service Capacity Review that the system will need nearly 2,600 additional acute hospital beds by 2031, I have asked my Department to work with the HSE to identify the location and mix of beds across the hospital system which can be opened and staffed this year and into 2019 in order to improve preparedness for Winter 2018\/2019.  <\/p>  <p>  A submission in this regard from the HSE is currently under consideration by my Department, which includes proposals from Saolta Hospital Group in relation to opening additional capacity at Letterkenny University Hospital.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062800048#WRD00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Speech and Language Therapy Waiting Lists","counter":190,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062800048#WRD00500"},{"type":"question","counter":191,"qnumday":72,"qnumall":"[28175\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062800048#WRD00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his views on whether waiting lists for speech and language therapy, occupational therapy and psychologists in County Meath are acceptable; if there is a shortage of professionals in these areas; and when a person (details supplied) will receive a psychological appointment.","asker":"1225","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":192,"content":"<p>I share the Deputy&rsquo;s concerns about waiting lists for primary care services, but I can assure him that every effort is being made to reduce waiting times and that the available resources are being used to best effect in order to provide assessment and ongoing therapy to those that need it in line with their prioritised needs. <\/p>  <p>  At a national level, funding has been provided for a number of specific initiatives to support development of primary care services.\u00a0In 2016,\u00a0&euro;4m was provided for the recruitment of 83 additional full-time speech and language therapists (SLT) and 74 of these posts are now filled.\u00a0 Also in 2016,\u00a0&euro;5m was provided for the recruitment of 114 assistant psychologists and 20 staff grade psychology posts and 131 of these staff are now in role.

In Germany, local public banks are called Sparkassen. These Sparkassen are only permitted to operate in specific geographic areas. The aim and philosophy of the Sparkassen is the promotion of economic development and financial inclusion in the particular regional area in which they operate, rather than solely maximising profits. Working closely and building relationships with local SMEs is an important element of the German local public banking model and the work of the Sparkassen. <\/p>  <p>  Officials in both departments have been working closely together to conduct a thorough consideration of the potential for a local public banking model in Ireland, based on the German Sparkassen model. This has included a detailed analysis of a proposal put forward by Irish Rural Link and the Savings Banks Foundation for International Cooperation (SBFIC), the international development wing of the Sparkassen group. The proposal outlines how a local public banking model, based on the German Sparkassen model I have described above, could work in Ireland.

The economics of the construction method;<\/p>  <p>  - The technical solutions chosen or the exceptionally favourable conditions available to the tenderer from suppliers;<\/p>  <p>  - The originality of the works proposed by the tenderer;<\/p>  <p>  Where the evidence suggests that the tenderer&rsquo;s price is low because of non-compliance with labour or environmental law, or where the tenderer is in receipt of State aid then it must be rejected.<\/p>  <p>  It is worth noting that recent studies undertaken\u00a0in the United Kingdom, following the collapse of Carillion, have highlighted the meagre margins that main contractors earn on building projects.\u00a0 Given the commonality in approach between the UK and Irish construction industries there is every reason to believe it is prevalent in the Irish construction sector.\u00a0 This culture must be addressed within the industry if it is to service its client base in a professional manner.<\/p>  <p>  There are consequences both\u00a0to the contractor who tenders a price that is unsustainable and to the contracting authority who accepts that price.\u00a0 From the contracting authority&rsquo;s point of view, poor quality materials and workmanship can often arise in these circumstances, claims and disputes may also arise and in cases where the contractor becomes insolvent it can lead to extensive delays to the project&rsquo;s delivery.\u00a0 Where the contractor is concerned they may be operating without a profit (if not incurring a loss), may have very poor relationships with suppliers and, in the worst cases, may become insolvent as a result of a failure to properly account for real cost of the works.<\/p>  <p>  There is a balance to be struck in deciding to award a public contract between value for money and a quality project outcome.\u00a0 From the taxpayers perspective it can be very difficult to justify a decision to reject the\u00a0lowest price out of hand, particularly in the circumstances where the contractor who has bid the price is willing to undertake the project.<\/p>  <p>  The impact of awarding contracts\u00a0at low prices was highlighted in the Report on the Review of the Performance of the Public Works Contracts published in 2014.\u00a0 A range of measures was recommended in that report to\u00a0discourage unsustainably low pricing, amongst other aspects.\u00a0 One of these measures, which has been implemented since 2016, requires contracting authorities\u00a0to prepare a bill of quantities to a defined set of rules which accurately measures all the necessary works\u00a0on larger projects.\u00a0 Tenderers are required to price all of the measured items providing a very detailed breakdown of the price bid meaning that low pricing can be identified.<\/p>  <p>  A further measure identified in the Report is the development of a medium term strategy for the procurement of public works projects.\u00a0\u00a0Engagement with industry stakeholder bodies\u00a0has recently commenced on that strategy which will outline the optimum means of procuring the necessary expertise to deliver Ireland 2040 in a sustainable, efficient and cost effective manner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062800050#WRF03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Education and Skills","counter":335,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062800050#WRF03200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Accommodation Provision","counter":334,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062800050#WRF03100"},{"type":"question","counter":335,"qnumday":124,"qnumall":"[28410\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062800050#WRF03200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if an application by a school (details supplied) will be responded to as a matter of urgency; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1320","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":336,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Deputy that my Department received an application\u00a0for additional accommodation from the school referred to within the last week.

The report assesses the cost of a further change which would provide a two scale point adjustment to new entrants recruited since 2011. The total cost of such an adjustment across the public sector is of the order of &euro;200 million, of which Education accounts for &euro;83 million.

The agreements to date have restored an estimated 75% of the difference in pay for more recently recruited teachers and deliver convergence of the pay scales at later points in the scale.<\/p>  <p>  As a result of these changes, the current starting salary of a new teacher\u00a0is &euro;35,958 and from 1 October 2020 onwards will be &euro;37,692. <\/p>  <p>  To have gone further than the pay increases that have been negotiated for 2018 would mean I would have had less money available to hire over 1,000 extra SNAs\u00a0and over 1,000 extra teachers. <\/p>  <p>  Differential pay scales were introduced by the then Government in 2010. It must be borne in mind that the pay reduction for post-2011 entrants applied to all public servants and not just teachers, and that any restoration of these measures in respect of teachers would be expected to be applied elsewhere across the public service. <\/p>  <p>  In accordance with the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform recently laid before the Oireachtas a report on the matter of the pay of new entrants to the public service. The report assesses the cost of a further change which would provide a two scale point adjustment to new entrants recruited since 2011. The total cost of such an adjustment across the public sector is of the order of &euro;200 million, of which Education accounts for &euro;83 million. The report also acknowledges that during the financial crisis there were policy changes which affected remuneration in different occupations across the public sector (including education). Addressing any issues arising from changes which are not specifically detailed in the report would give rise to additional costs over and above the foregoing figures. <\/p>  <p>  Any further negotiation on new entrant pay is a cross sectoral issue, not just an issue for the education sector. The Government also supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants. <\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform&rsquo;s report will inform discussion on remaining salary scale issues with the parties to the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 in accordance with the commitment in the Agreement to consider the issue of newly qualified pay. That process commenced with a first meeting on 12 October 2017.\u00a0 The three teacher unions attended that first meeting. Further talks began on the 27th of April with all public service unions in relation to new entrant pay. Further engagement\u00a0is being arranged as the parties continue to work through the various aspects of this issue.<\/p>  <p>  In the second report of the Public Service Benchmarking Body (issued in December 2007), the Body evaluated the pay and jobs of 109 grades across the public service, including school Principals. The Body recommended pay increases for 15 grades, including changes to the allowance payable to Principals of primary schools and of small post-primary schools. <\/p>  <p>  Under the Towards 2016 Review and Transitional Agreement 2008-2009, it was agreed that the increases recommended in the second report of the PSBB would be paid as follows: <\/p>  <p>  (a) 5% from 1 September 2008, or where the total increase is less than 5%, the full increase from that date; <\/p>  <p>  (b) The issue of the payment of any balances will be discussed between the parties in the context of any successor to this Transitional Agreement which might be agreed between the Social Partners, or whatever other arrangements may be in place on the expiry of this Transitional Agreement.<\/p>  <p>  The pay terms contained in the Towards 2016 Review and Transitional Agreement 2008-2009 were not implemented due to the State&rsquo;s worsening financial circumstances.

There are also 26 Garda Reserves and 54 civilians attached to the Division.

Broad programmes of education are provided which generally follow an adult education approach. The Department of Education and Skills funds an allocation of 220 whole-time teacher equivalents to the prisons through the ETBs. A Joint IPS\/ETBI Education Strategy 2016-2018 was launched in June 2016.\u00a0 <\/p><p>The aim of the Education Service is to deliver a high quality, broad, flexible programme of education that helps prisoners cope with their sentence, achieve personal development, prepare for life after release and establish an appetite and capacity for life-long learning.<\/p><p>The attached table shows the recorded education participation rates for each Prison Education Centre from January to May of 2018.\u00a0 These show that there had been decreases in the participation rates in some establishments in January to April this year, but participation levels have increased again in May.\u00a0 The primary reasons for the decreases in March and April are the Easter break which occurred at the end of March and into the first week of April; the suspension of some classes due to the unavailability of discipline staff and increasing numbers of protection prisoners in custody.\u00a0 There were also some closures of Prison Education Centres due to Storm Emma at the end of February.<\/p><p>In Mountjoy male prison, the drop in numbers participating in education is linked directly to the increasing number of prisoners on protection and the fact that by April all prisoners on both A and B wing were on protection. In response to this significant development, the timetable was overhauled in order to provide the same educational opportunities to those on protection as was being provided to other prisoners. This means that education is provided to non-protection prisoners only in the morning and to protection prisoners only in the afternoon. While this change makes education available to all, it has resulted in a notable reduction in overall participation levels, as many protection prisoners are unwilling to mix freely with each other. <\/p><p>The Progression Unit (Mountjoy West) allows increasing numbers of prisoners to attend external training programmes on a day release basis.\u00a0 These are not counted in the participation rates for Mountjoy Prison Education Centre.\u00a0 There is also high participation in work and training activities, which is not included in the education participation statistics. <\/p><p>In the Progression Unit Education Centre, modules have been developed to better prepare\u00a0people for the World of Work: QQI Health and Safety Awareness, Work Experience, Customer Services Occupational First Aid, Career Preparation, Self-Employment Skills, Money Management, Soft Skills, Cooking on a budget and Manual Handling. <\/p><p>Participation levels in education in Wheatfield Prison Education centre have been heavily impacted by full and partial closures from January to April this year due to officer shortages and as a result of nationally mandated closures\u00a0due to adverse weather conditions. \u00a0Wheatfield Prison Education Centre offers a comprehensive and dynamic curriculum, QQI, State Examination, Creative Arts and Holistic programmes and aims for a high level of student participation.\u00a0 In spite of restrictions due to unavailability of discipline staff, many students completed state exams, QQI and music examinations this year.\u00a0 In 2018, Wheatfield Prison Education Centre recruited new teachers to expand the curriculum.\u00a0 In order to boost participation levels, extra-curricular activities are offered one afternoon each month, a Wellness and Mental Health Weeks was hosted and frequent Musical events are also hosted for the student body. Interviews of prospective students take place on an ongoing basis and students are recruited directly from prison landings and workshops and student mentoring also takes place on some landings. A separate school is provided for the segregated landings in Wheatfield i.e. North-Three School.\u00a0<\/p><p>The current successful recruitment campaign for new prison officers will enable the Irish Prison Service to increase its staff complement and will greatly reduce the number of occasions on which classes have to be suspended due to the unavailability of discipline staff.<\/p><p>The Irish Prison Service has also put Regime Management Plans in place to manage staff detail when there is a shortfall in the number of staff on duty.\u00a0 This is designed to minimise the impact on prisoners engaged in structured activity including education.<\/p><p>The Prison Education Service works as part of the multi-disciplinary team in each prison to promote education participation, provide a relevant curriculum for students and to prepare them for the transition back to the community.<table><tr><th>Education Unit<\/th><th>Jan-18<\/th><th>Feb-18<\/th><th>Mar-18<\/th><th>Apr-18<\/th><th>May-18<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Arbour Hill<\/td><td>70.9%<\/td><td>50.0%<\/td><td>52.6%<\/td><td>46.8%<\/td><td>65.5%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Castlerea<\/td><td>45.5%<\/td><td>33.1%<\/td><td>33.6%<\/td><td>33.8%<\/td><td>32.7%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cloverhill<\/td><td>22.9%<\/td><td>19.0%<\/td><td>17.2%<\/td><td>17.1%<\/td><td>26.3%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork<\/td><td>46.0%<\/td><td>38.6%<\/td><td>34.7%<\/td><td>32.9%<\/td><td>49.7%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dochas<\/td><td>54.0%<\/td><td>39.5%<\/td><td>36.9%<\/td><td>46.2%<\/td><td>63.3%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Limerick<\/td><td>43.7%<\/td><td>36.5%<\/td><td>33.9%<\/td><td>33.9%<\/td><td>44.7%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Loughan<\/td><td>81.7%<\/td><td>59.7%<\/td><td>61.2%<\/td><td>58.5%<\/td><td>80.1%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Midlands<\/td><td>37.8%<\/td><td>27.4%<\/td><td>25.0%<\/td><td>26.5%<\/td><td>36.1%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Mountjoy<\/td><td>19.8%<\/td><td>19.5%<\/td><td>16.7%<\/td><td>18.0%<\/td><td>27.8%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Portlaoise<\/td><td>50.2%<\/td><td>44.2%<\/td><td>42.1%<\/td><td>35.9%<\/td><td>50.3%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Shelton Abbey<\/td><td>55.7%<\/td><td>42.3%<\/td><td>42.6%<\/td><td>45.7%<\/td><td>56.6%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>MJ West<\/td><td>58.1%<\/td><td>42.5%<\/td><td>47.0%<\/td><td>49.5%<\/td><td>56.7%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wheatfield<\/td><td>23.8%<\/td><td>19.4%<\/td><td>15.2%<\/td><td>19.6%<\/td><td>27.4%<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062800052#WRH03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Station Refurbishment","counter":445,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062800052#WRH03300"},{"type":"question","counter":446,"qnumday":163,"qnumall":"[28517\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062800052#WRH03400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"when Stepaside Garda station will open and will be providing a full 24 hour service; the number of full time garda&iacute; and Garda vehicles that will be assigned to the station; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1349","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":447,"content":"<p>The Deputy will appreciate that the programme of replacement and refurbishment of Garda accommodation is progressed by the Garda authorities working in close cooperation with the Office of Public Works (OPW), which has responsibility for the provision and maintenance of Garda accommodation.

In these instances, the HSE utilises a range of measures, including agency, locum and other-short term arrangements to support service delivery. Following on from its first report, in which it identified recruitment and retention problems in specialist groups in the health sector that are internationally in demand, the Pay Commission is currently giving consideration to a number of groups including nurses and consultants.<\/p>  <p>  The Health Service Capacity Review which I published in January highlighted the scale of reform needed to meet the healthcare demands of our growing and ageing population. Under the National Development Plan capital funding for our health services, &euro;10.9 billion over the next ten years, will be 165% higher than it was for the last 10 years. This provides a real, long-term opportunity to improve our health services, drive down waiting lists, increase bed capacity, reform pathways of care and modernise how we deliver health services guided by the principles in the Sl&aacute;intecare report.<\/p>  <p>  Even with the required reforms, the Review concludes that acute hospital bed capacity will need to increase by 2,600 to support timely delivery of care. This will require additional staffing at all levels and real changes to healthcare delivery in order to have a sustainable healthcare system, with an emphasis on public health and illness prevention. <\/p>  <p>  In the short term, reducing waiting times for the longest waiting patients is one of this Government's key priorities. In Budget 2018, &euro;50 million was provided to the NTPF to provide treatment for public patients this year, which more than doubled its 2017 total allocation for the NTPF. <\/p>  <p>  The most recently published National Treatment Purchase Fund figures for the end of May confirm that just under 78,600 patients are waiting for a hospital inpatient or day case procedure.  This represents a fall of more than 7,500 patients, or almost 9% in just 10 months. This positive progress in reducing waiting times for patients waiting for a hospital procedure is the result of the focus and investment by Government in this area utilising available capacity within and outside of the public health service.  In Budget 2018, &euro;50 million was provided to the NTPF to provide treatment for public patients this year, which more than doubled its 2017 total allocation for the NTPF.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062800055#WRL05900","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Primary Care Strategy","counter":651,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062800056#WRM00200"},{"type":"question","counter":652,"qnumday":232,"qnumall":"[28594\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062800056#WRM00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the extent to which primary care in all regions, urban and rural, is likely to be reorganised in line with the increased demands and ready access to the services; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":653,"content":"<p>As this question relates to service matters, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive (HSE) for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062800056#WRM00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Staff","counter":654,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062800056#WRM00500"},{"type":"question","counter":655,"qnumday":233,"qnumall":"[28595\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062800056#WRM00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the extent to which it is expected to ensure the retention of nursing, medical and consultant staff is sufficient to meet the demand nationwide; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":656,"content":"<p>Retaining and increasing the number of nursing, medical and\u00a0consultant staff\u00a0in the public health service is a key priority for me and my Department.

Nursing numbers have increased by 2,638 in the five years to end April 2018.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to consultants, numbers have increased by 101 in the 12 months to end\u00a0April 2018 and by 456 in the five years to end April 2018. The number of Non Consultant Hospital Doctors has also increased, by 284 in the 12 months to end April 2018, and by 1,368 in the five years to end April 2018. The HSE has been focussed on addressing issues associated with the creation and approval of consultant posts and successful recruitment. It is now\u00a0implementing the report 'Towards Successful Consultant Recruitment, Appointment and Retention', completed in December 2016. It is also focussed on implementing the recommendations of the 'MacCraith Group' to support the recruitment and retention of consultants and NCHDs<\/p>  <p>  Following on from its first report, in which it identified recruitment and retention problems in specialist groups in the health sector that are internationally in demand, the Pay Commission is currently\u00a0giving consideration to\u00a0a number of groups including nurses and consultants and is expected to report by the end of July. While there are many challenges I am satisfied that we will be able to recruit and retain sufficient numbers of nursing, medical and consultant staff to meet demand.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062800056#WRM00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Status","counter":657,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062800056#WRM00800"},{"type":"question","counter":658,"qnumday":234,"qnumall":"[28598\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062800056#WRM00900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of a hospital appointment for a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":659,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

On the 23rd January the Government agreed an interim Total Contributions Approach (TCA) solution for those affected by the 2012 rate-band changes. Under this approach, a person who reached pension age after 1 September 2012 (i.e. who is among those affected by the new ratebands introduced from that date) and who has a 40 year record of paid and credited social insurance contributions, subject to a maximum of 20 years of credits, will qualify for a maximum contributory pension where they satisfy the other qualifying conditions for the scheme.  Those with lesser records may qualify for a pro-rata amount.<\/p>  <p>  Up to 20 years of HomeCaring credits, and \/ or 10 years of other qualifying credits, for example when unemployed or ill, may be used, subject to the total number of credits not exceeding 20 years. <\/p>  <p>  This approach is expected to significantly benefit many people, particularly women, whose work history includes an extended period of time outside the paid workplace, while raising families or in a caring role. It will make it easier for pensioners assessed under the yearly average model, to qualify for a higher rate of the State Pension (contributory). This interim TCA will ensure that the totality of a person&rsquo;s social insurance contributions - as opposed to the timing of them - determines a final pension outcome.<\/p>  <p>  It should also be noted that taking this approach &ndash; TCA with up to 20 years of homecaring credits for periods both before and after 1994 &ndash; is more advantageous to women who cared in the home, and who were the most affected by the 2012 changes, than a simple reversion to the status quo before 2012, which would have created new inequitable outcomes.  A simple reversal along those lines would, in many cases, have resulted in a smaller increase for such women, but a bigger increase for people who did not have such caring duties and who, in many cases, would have significant income from foreign pensions, in addition to their Irish pension.<\/p>  <p>  Work is underway to draft legislation to enable implementation of these arrangements. In line with the legislation, IT solutions must be developed to implement the changes. Accordingly, in the final quarter of this year, the Department will begin inviting impacted recipients of the State Pension (contributory) to seek a review of their pension calculations, with the first payments being made in the first quarter of 2019, backdated to the 30th March 2018.<\/p>  <p>  This interim TCA solution is distinct from the one which will apply for all new pensioners from 2020, and which is currently subject to a public consultation.  The final design of that TCA model will be proposed to Government before the end of this year.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062800057#WRN04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Bereavement Grant","counter":744,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062800057#WRN04800"},{"type":"question","counter":745,"qnumday":270,"qnumall":"[28438\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062800057#WRN04900","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the estimated full cost of restoring the bereavement grant.","asker":"1252","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":746,"content":"<p>During the economic downturn, my Department protected primary social welfare rates and in recent years, as the economy recovered, the Government has concentrated resources in improving the core rates of payments, particularly for pensioners.

These include weekly-paid widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s (contributory and non-contributory) pensions, which are based on contributions or a means test, and a once-off widowed or surviving civil partner grant of &euro;6,000 where there is a dependent child.  A number of social welfare payments, including State pension, continue in payment for six weeks following a death.  In Budget 2016, the Government increased the payment after death period to 12 weeks for carer&rsquo;s allowance.  Guardian payments are available where someone cares for an orphaned child.  A special funeral grant of &euro;850 is paid where a person dies because of an accident at work or occupational disease.<\/p>  <p>  Under the SWA scheme, the Department of Social Protection may make a single exceptional needs payment (ENP) to help meet essential, once-off expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet from their weekly income, which may include help with funeral and burial expenses.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062800057#WRN05000","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fuel Allowance Expenditure","counter":747,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062800057#WRN05100"},{"type":"question","counter":748,"qnumday":271,"qnumall":"[28439\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062800057#WRN05200","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the estimated full cost of restoring the fuel allowance to 32 weeks.","asker":"1252","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":749,"content":"<p>The fuel allowance is a targeted payment of &euro;22.50 per week, paid for the duration of the fuel season from October to April.  Over 364,000 low income households benefit from this allowance, at an estimated cost of &euro;227 million in 2018.  The purpose of this payment is to assist these households with their energy costs.  One allowance is paid per household representing a contribution towards the energy costs of a household; it is not intended to meet those costs in full.  <\/p>  <p>  The cost of an additional week of fuel allowance is estimated at approx. &euro;8.6 million.  Extending the duration of the scheme from 27 to 32 weeks would therefore cost an estimated &euro;42.9 million. Any decision to extend the duration that fuel is paid for would have budgetary consequences and would have to be considered in the context of budget negotiations.  <\/p>  <p>  The fuel scheme is intended to provide some additional support for people on long-term welfare payments during the winter season which clearly does not last for 32 weeks.  By reducing the fuel season it restored the core purpose of the payment as a winter fuel support.  There was no cut in the rate of payment of the fuel allowance.  In 2016, with the improved economic conditions, the rate of fuel allowance was increased from &euro;20 per week to &euro;22.50.  The Government believed that increasing the rate during the colder weeks of the year, when the actual need was greatest, rather than extending a lower payment into months during which recipients faced a lesser heating cost, was the correct decision to make.  <\/p>  <p>  Fuel allowance is not the sole income support mechanism through which assistance is provided to people with special or additional heating needs.  My Department also pays an electricity or gas allowance as part of the household benefits package at an estimated cost of &euro;237 million in 2018.  Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, a special heating supplement may be paid to assist people in certain circumstances that have special heating needs.  Exceptional needs payments (ENP) may be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost which an applicant is unable to meet out of his\/her own resources.  <\/p>  <p>  While I am aware that fuel poverty is a very real issue for low income households, income support is only part of the answer in terms of addressing fuel poverty.   The Government is committed to protecting vulnerable households from the impact of energy costs through a combination of supports, investment in programmes to improve the energy efficiency of the housing stock and energy efficiency awareness initiatives.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062800057#WRN05300","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Free Travel Scheme","counter":751,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062800058#WRO00200"},{"type":"question","counter":752,"qnumday":272,"qnumall":"[28440\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062800058#WRO00300","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the estimated full cost of increasing the funding for the free travel scheme by &euro;5 million to make it more attractive for operators to join and to ensure that it continues to address passenger needs.","asker":"1252","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":753,"content":"<p>The free travel scheme provides free travel on the main public and private transport services for those eligible under the scheme.
