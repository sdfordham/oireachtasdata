As the Deputy will also be aware, the allocation of judicial resources and the scheduling of court cases is a matter for the Presidents of the courts and the judiciary who are, under the Constitution, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions.  The President of the Circuit Court has been very helpful as regards consideration of dedicated new court  arrangements for repossessions and the option and implications of use of pre-existing legislative powers to implement a system of specific court sittings for repossessions at specific venues on specific dates.  This is being pursued at present between my Department and the Courts with a view to possible new arrangements for the Easter law term where appropriate and having regard to constitutional constraints.  Furthermore the Government, at its meeting of 6 December 2016, decided to reassign, by appointment, three specialist judges of the Circuit Court as ordinary judges of the Circuit Court to fill three existing vacancies and so there are currently no vacancies in the Circuit Court.  The Department is actively involved in discussions, including with the judiciary and Courts Service, as regards what progress can be made on introducing the proposed dedicated arrangements for mortgage arrears cases which I hope to bring to Government for consideration in the near future.<\/p>  <p>  A key element of the commitments in the Programme for Government is, as the Deputy will also be aware, putting in place a national mortgage arrears resolution service and priority was given last year to getting the new national Mortgage Arrears Resolution Service (Abhaile) up and running and this was formally launched last October. The service, which forms part of the Programme for Partnership Government commitments on mortgage arrears, ensures that people who are at risk of losing their home have access to free independent financial and legal advice and assistance.  The objective is to help these homeowners to identify and put in place solutions to their mortgage arrears, with priority to helping them remain in their home wherever possible.<\/p>  <p>  The Abhaile service is available through the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) helpline and MABS offices across the country.  Homeowners who are at risk of losing their homes due to mortgage arrears, including those facing repossession proceedings, can contact MABS which will provide support and advice.  Support available includes in-house dedicated Mortgage Arrears advisers in MABS offices across the country, specifically to assist and negotiate with financial institutions on the borrower's behalf.  MABS can also provide access to free independent financial advice and assistance on personal insolvency and bankruptcy from a personal insolvency practitioner (PIP), and to free independent legal advice from a solicitor, under a 'voucher' system.  The advice and assistance is provided by a PIP or solicitor from expert panels, established under the Scheme respectively by the Insolvency Service of Ireland and by the Legal Aid Board.  The service also includes free support and assistance at Circuit Court repossession court lists country-wide, with MABS court mentors in attendance to provide help and advice to borrowers attending, and a 'duty solicitor', from a Legal Aid Board panel, to provide legal assistance in court to unrepresented borrowers in repossession proceedings.  The scheme also offers legal aid to borrowers seeking the new Personal Insolvency court review under the Personal Insolvency (Amendment) Act 2015.  Over 4,100 vouchers have been issued under the Scheme up to 27th January 2017.<\/p>  <p>  A further key element related to the power of a court to impose mortgage arrears solutions for those in arrears and it is critical to note that use of the key statutory provision allowing for imposition of debt solutions involving a mortgage, where the solution has been rejected by the creditors, is increasing due to the availability of the Abhaile service since last October.  I am referring to the \"section 115A\" procedure put in place under the 2015 Personal Insolvency legislation which allows the Circuit Court, in defined circumstances, to impose a personal insolvency arrangement (PIA), on application from the debtor, where the proposed arrangement has been rejected by the creditors.<\/p>  <p>  I would also like to point out to the Deputy that early indications, while based on small initial samples, suggest that the new Abhaile service is reaching those most at risk of losing their homes, and particularly the cohort of those who are in mortgage arrears equivalent to 720 days or more.  They also suggest that access to free, independent expert help, and to statutory protection against creditor pressure for those who are engaging, is a significant relief for those at risk, and that independent advice is identifying solutions which offer better outcomes for the homeowner, often enabling them to remain in their homes.  Representative outcome data for the Abhaile Service is not yet available, but this information is being tracked and collected, and full analysis will be available at a later date.<\/p>  <p>  My Department, together with the Department of Social Protection, leads both operational oversight and governance steering groups for the new Abhaile service and its effectiveness and impacts are being closely monitored as part of these processes, whilst my Department also continues to pursue the remaining aspects of the Programme for Government commitment with a view to further implementation measures in the next three months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100061#WRC03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Protected Disclosures","counter":134,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100061#WRC03550"},{"type":"question","counter":135,"qnumday":96,"qnumall":"[3851\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100061#WRC03700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the date on which she received the report from a person (details supplied) into allegations of Garda attempts to discredit a whistleblower; and when she will publish the report.","asker":"1296","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":136,"content":"<p>The Deputy is referring to a report which I have received from Mr. Justice Iarfhlaith O&rsquo;Neill of his review relating to two protected disclosures which I received from members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in early October last year.

This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime. In this regard the Deputy will be aware that Operation Thor has been put in place to tackle burglary and related crimes, in both rural and urban areas.  It is encouraging to note that since the launch of the operation in November 2015, the burglary figures have shown a significant downward trend. Indeed, the most recent CSO official recorded crime statistics for Q3 of 2016 show a decrease of 31% in burglary for the twelve months ending 30 September 2016 compared to the previous twelve month period. This reflects the success of the concerted Garda drive against crime being implemented under Operation Thor. <\/p>  <p>   It is important we build on this success by ensuring that Garda numbers continue to increase.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources she needs to allow her to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division, in the coming years.  The Government has put in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021, comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging programme of reform which is being implemented in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. In addition, approximately 300 appointments will be made to the Garda Reserve.<\/p>  <p>  Since the reopening of the Garda College, 679 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide.

The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.  In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan. This investment will facilitate the provision of more effective policing services and I have no doubt that these new resources now coming on stream will benefit all areas of Garda activity including addressing crime in rural communities such as Connemara. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na works in partnership with a wide range of community based groups, including Community Alert and Neighbourhood Watch groups, to support enhanced community safety and with particular regard to the needs of those living in rural areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100062#WRD00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Enterprise Sector","counter":141,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100062#WRD00350"},{"type":"question","counter":142,"qnumday":98,"qnumall":"[3871\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100062#WRD00400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her plans in relation to the development of social enterprises across the criminal justice system in view of the established success of such enterprises throughout Europe in securing employment for ex-prisoners and reducing recidivism.","asker":"1259","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":143,"content":"<p>I wish to inform the Deputy that my Department has put in place arrangements to progress the development of social enterprises in the criminal justice sector, recognising the potential value of social enterprises to add value to prison-based and probation activities and to provide an additional form of training, work integration and rehabilitation for ex-offenders.<\/p>  <p>  The concept of social enterprise is to explore possible pathways towards increased employment opportunities for ex-offenders, A workshop hosted by the Probation Service on 5 February 2016, identified the potential to create employment opportunities for ex-offenders through the creation of social enterprises.

Under the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008, any person found guilty of trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation shall be liable to imprisonment for a period up to life.  It is also an offence for a person to solicit or importune a trafficked person for the purposes of prostitution with a potential penalty of imprisonment for up to 5 years.<\/p><p>In September 2015, I published the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill 2015, as approved by Government.  The Bill provides for two new offences of purchasing sexual services, in the context of prostitution.  The purpose of these offences is to target the demand for prostitution.  The first is a general offence of paying to engage in sexual activity with a prostitute which carries a penalty of a fine of up to &euro;500 for a first offence and fines of up to &euro;1000 for a second or subsequent offence.  The second is the more serious offence of paying for sexual activity with a trafficked person, in the context of prostitution, and carries a potential penalty of up to 5 years imprisonment and\/or a fine.  In both cases, the person selling the sexual service will not commit an offence. <\/p><p>These proposals have been developed following extensive consultation, initiated by my Department, dating back to 2012.  The new offences also implement the recommendation of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence which called for the introduction of an offence criminalising the purchase of sexual services.

The Statute Law Revision Act 2007 specifically retained in existence, in Irish Law, the torts and offences of maintenance and champerty. <\/p><p>Under current law,<b><\/b>actions comprising maintenance and\/or champerty in Ireland are considered to be contrary to public policy in that <i>inter alia<\/i>they may assist in the development of a market in legal claims thereby promoting litigation for the benefit of the promoter rather than the litigant and are considered to have the potential to create a substantial injustice to a defendant in an action. Maintenance and champerty are not permitted as a matter of Irish law regardless of the extent of the control exercised over the conduct of the litigation by the funder.  As I understand aspects of these matters to be sub judice, I will refrain from any further comment. <\/p><p>At the same time, I am aware that some change has been taking place under the law in other jurisdictions and that this has generated public debate. For example, the torts and crimes of maintenance and champerty were abolished in England and Wales under the Criminal Law Act of 1967 and I am also aware that a number of States in Australia have since followed suit. In contrast, however, I note that New Zealand has favoured the retention of maintenance and champerty, a position which would be more aligned with current public policy in this jurisdiction. <\/p><p>Clearly, any change to public policy in relation to maintenance and champerty would require detailed and balanced consideration. I am, therefore, pleased to note the publication by the Law Reform Commission last June of its Issues Paper on &quot;Contempt of Court and Other Offences and Torts Involving the Administration of Justice&quot;. Under Issue 6 of that paper, the Commission has opened up the retention of the crimes and torts of maintenance and champerty to public consultation along with the related question of whether third-party funding of litigation should be permitted. As with any developments before the courts, any report and recommendations made by the Law Reform Commission in relation to maintenance and champerty will be fully considered by my Department and by the Government in due course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100062#WRD01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Direct Provision Data","counter":156,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100062#WRD01350"},{"type":"question","counter":157,"qnumday":103,"qnumall":"[4005\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100062#WRD01400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of children that have been born to those under the direct provision system since its introduction in 2000; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1347","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":158,"content":"<p>The information requested by the Deputy is not readily available as it is not collated by either this Department or the Registrar General of Births Deaths and Marriages.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100062#WRD01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1277"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Residency Permits","counter":159,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100062#WRD01550"},{"type":"question","counter":160,"qnumday":104,"qnumall":"[4024\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100062#WRD01600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 60 of 19 January 2017, the detail of the stamp currently held by a person (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.

I, as Minister for Justice and Equality, have no function in decisions in this regard. Having a modern valuation base, which takes account of contemporary rents and current market circumstances, is very important for the levying of business rates on a fair and equitable basis. This has been the policy of successive Governments for many years and is the express purpose of the National Revaluation Programme being rolled out by the Valuation Office. The current phase of this programme is known as \"REVAL 2017\" and covers the revaluation of all rateable properties in Counties Longford, Leitrim, Roscommon, Westmeath, Offaly, Kildare, Sligo, Carlow and Kilkenny, where a revaluation is being undertaken for the first time since the nineteenth century. It also includes the second revaluation of South Dublin Country Council. The revaluation in these counties will be completed in September 2017 and will become effective for rating purposes from 2018 onwards. <\/p>  <p>  While the current phase of revaluation is a work in progress, the first significant milestone was reached this month with the issue of certificates of proposed valuation on 12 January 2017 to all ratepayers in counties Longford, Roscommon and Westmeath. Similarly, certificates of proposed valuation issued to all ratepayers in County Leitrim on 19 January 2017. As regards the revaluation in the five remaining counties - Kildare, Offaly, Sligo, Carlow and Kilkenny - of the current phase, I am advised that work has reached an advanced stage and proposed valuation certificates will issue to ratepayers in those counties during March 2017. In the case of the second revaluation of South Dublin, which is running in parallel to the revaluation in the nine rural counties, proposed valuation certificates are expected to issue in April 2017.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that, as part of its regular engagement with ratepayers during a revaluation, the Valuation Office has put arrangements in place to assist ratepayers who may have a concern in relation to the valuation that has been placed on their property. This includes a telephone helpline and detailed information is also available on the Valuation Office's website, www.valoff.ie. Arrangements have also been put in place to run an advertising campaign in the local press and on local radio to inform ratepayers of walk-in clinics that have been arranged in the County Council offices in counties Leitrim, Longford, Roscommon and Westmeath. Similar information campaigns will be undertaken when the certificate of proposed valuation is being issued to ratepayers in the other counties included in this phase of the revaluation programme. <\/p>  <p>  I am advised by the Valuation Office that in some instances the valuation of certain properties would have increased to some degree, this would be due to the individual circumstances of the properties concerned. The experience of the most recent revaluations conducted to date in other local authority areas by the Valuation Office has indicated that about 60% of ratepayers had the valuation of their property reduced and about 40% had an increase, a pattern which is expected to be replicated when the final certificates of valuation, under the current phase of the programme, are issued in September 2017. <\/p>  <p>  There is an extensive system of redress available to those ratepayers who are dissatisfied with the proposed valuations or with any particular on the certificate relating to their property. In this regard, a dissatisfied person can make representations to the Valuation Office within 40 days of the date of issue of the certificate. The Valuation Office will consider the representations and may or may not change the proposed valuation depending on the circumstances of each individual property.<\/p>  <p>  A certificate of final valuation will issue to each ratepayer in September 2017 and the valuation shown on the certificate will be used as the basis for the assessment of rates by the local authority with effect from 1 January 2018.

Firstly, it is a very reasonable condition imposed by many sovereign governments in order to protect the public interest and public resources.

Of course the report was a very welcome and valuable contribution to the consideration of our response to white collar crime and since it was completed in November 2010, there have been a number of significant developments in our legislative framework. <\/p><p>In particular, I might mention the Criminal Justice Act 2011, the main purpose of which is to facilitate the more effective investigation of such crime and to reduce associated delays in the process.  The Act provides for procedures to facilitate Garda access to essential information and documentation to assist in investigations. The Act is targeted at specified serious and complex offences attracting a penalty of at least 5 years imprisonment, including offences in the areas of banking and finance, company law, money laundering, fraud and corruption. <\/p><p>Another recent provision of relevance is Part 5 of the Courts and Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2013.  It makes provision for the selection of up to 15 jurors to serve in a criminal trial which is likely to last more than 2 months, with 12 jurors to be selected to consider the verdict.  These provisions are of relevance to lengthy trials involving fraud or other complex financial matters where there is a risk of jurors becoming unavailable during the course of a protracted trial. <\/p><p>In terms of forthcoming legislation, the Prevention of Corruption Acts 1889 to 2010 will be replaced by the provisions of the Criminal Justice (Corruption) Bill. This Bill will replace and update the offences of giving and receiving bribes contained in existing legislation. The Bill will also enhance the ability of the DPP to bring prosecutions by providing for presumptions of corrupt gifts or payments and it will provide for penalties of up to 10 years&rsquo; imprisonment and unlimited fines for persons convicted on indictment. <\/p><p>In addition, the General Scheme of the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) (Amendment) Bill<b><\/b>was approved by Government in December. The Bill will give effect to provisions contained in the 4<sup>th<\/sup>EU Money Laundering Directive which has the aim of strengthening laws in the EU to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. The Directive adopts a risk-based approach whereby &ldquo;designated persons&rdquo; - such as banks and other bodies - must determine, on the basis of a risk assessment and taking into account relevant factors, the risk of money laundering and terrorist financing posed by a particular transaction, service or customer, and apply customer due diligence measures accordingly. While the Bill will give effect to the greater part of the Directive, some provisions (i.e. the establishment of registers of beneficial ownership of companies and trusts) will be transposed by the Department of Finance. <\/p><p>While my Department has responsibility for legislation addressing some aspects of white collar crime including fraud and corruption, other aspects, such as insider trading, Companies Acts offences and environmental offences, fall within the responsibility of other Government Departments. Relevant legislative enhancements in recent years include the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013, the Companies Act 2014 and more broadly the Protected Disclosures Act 2014. <\/p><p>The breadth and diversity of the issues connected with this form of crime are such that no one piece of legislation could effectively address all of them and therefore legislation in this area is continuously under review and development.  Further developments in this area will be assisted by a forthcoming issues paper from the Law Reform Commission in relation to Regulatory Enforcement and Corporate Offences. l am also in ongoing contact with the Garda Commissioner in relation to the arrangements in place to investigate serious crime of this nature.<b><font color=\"#000080\">  <\/font><\/b><\/p><p>Finally, I am advised that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to develop strategies aimed at targeting, dismantling and disrupting criminal networks, utilising advanced analytical and intelligence methodology.

It can also be possible to access savings early on grounds of ill health. <\/p>  <p>  I do not currently have any plans to extend the range of circumstances in which pension savings can be accessed early.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100064#WRF00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"VAT Rate Application","counter":222,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100064#WRF00500"},{"type":"question","counter":223,"qnumday":125,"qnumall":"[3961\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100064#WRF00600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the Revenue Commissioners or his Department has examined whether the recent ECJ ruling on VAT on the M50 toll will have any effect on any other applications of VAT; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":224,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that this judgment was published on Thursday 19th January and that they are considering its implications.

There are no plans to re-establish a dedicated training organisation for the sector, but rather to deliver the required education and training through the mainstream higher and further education and training sectors, in line with provision for other sectors.<\/p><p>The Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGSFN) carried out a study on the future skills needs of the sector and the report of the study was published in November 2015.  The objective was to assess demand arising within the sector in Ireland including hotels, restaurants, bars, canteens and catering over the period to 2020.  The aim was to ensure that there will be the right supply of skills to help drive domestic hospitality sector business and employment growth.  The report provides a clear and coherent framework for the development of talent in the hospitality sector in the years ahead to help drive both hospitality business and employment growth which is one the key goals of the Government&rsquo;s Tourism Policy Statement &ndash; People, Place and Policy-Growing Tourism to 2025. <\/p><p>The Study assesses skills demand at all NFQ levels, with a particular focus on career progression opportunities for those at lower skilled levels to help fill anticipated job openings.  The report provides a set of recommendations designed to address the skills requirements of the sector over the period to 2020.  A key recommendation in the report was the need to set up of a National Oversight and Advisory Group comprising all the key hospitality stakeholders.<\/p><p>Following on this recommendation, the Hospitality Skills Oversight Group was established early last year, chaired by SOLAS for the first year.  To date the group has held seven meetings.  Membership of the Group includes the Restaurant Association of Ireland, the Irish Hotel Federation, Irish Hospitality Institute, Licenced Vintners Association, Vintners Federation of Ireland, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Department of Education and Skills, Department of Social Protection, Higher Education Authority, Skillnets, SOLAS, ETBs, IoTs, DIT and Quality and Qualifications Ireland.<\/p><p>The role of the Group is to monitor progress on the implementation of the recommendations of the EGFSN and to provide a forum for on-going collaboration in addressing the skills needs of the sector and to identify and progress actions to overcome barriers on its implementation.<\/p><p>The Group plan to publish a progress report later this year.  To date work has been undertaken on careers promotion via a range of fora, the launch of the <i>Tourism Insight<\/i>online programme &ndash;aimed at promoting careers in tourism and hospitality with particular reference to transition year and Youthreach participants.  Audits of both higher and further education facilities and courses are underway as well as the establishment of a Restaurant and Hospitality Skillnet which aims to address key skills requirements of restaurants and catering companies to help drive the domestic hospitality sector, employment growth, talent attraction and retention. <\/p><p>Funded through the National Training Fund by my Department, the network plans to design tailored programmes covering all aspects of the restaurant, food and beverage industry to SMEs nationally, with a particular focus on career progression for those at lower skilled levels to help fill anticipated job openings and increase retention levels within the sector and is well placed to address key recommendations of the EGFSN 2015 Report on the Future Skills.<\/p><p>Last week, I launched the 2016-2020 Action Plan to expand Apprenticeship and Traineeship in Ireland, setting out how state agencies, education and training providers and employers will work together to deliver on the Programme for Government commitments on the expansion of apprenticeship and traineeship in the period to 2020.  The Plan sets out how we will manage the pipeline of new apprenticeships already established through the first call for proposals in 2015 and also commits to a new call for apprenticeship proposals later this year, to provide for the needs of all sectors, including hospitality and tourism.  Over the lifetime of the Action Plan, 50,000 people will be registered on apprenticeship and traineeship programmes representing a doubling of current activity.<\/p><p>Work is progressing on the development of a new Commis Chef Apprenticeship led by the Irish Hotels Federation and the Restaurants Association of Ireland working with Kerry Education and Training Board.  It is planned that this programme will commence later this year.  The Apprenticeship Council also recently approved development funding for a separate proposal to develop a Chef de Partie Apprenticeship.  The Apprenticeship Council will continue to work with the proposers of these new programmes to develop them into sustainable apprenticeships that can be delivered on a nationwide basis.  The funding for planned and forecast expansion in 2017 will see an additional &euro;20 million provided. <\/p><p>In 2015 a new Career Traineeship initiative was begun by SOLAS in collaboration with ETBs and enterprise to develop a more effective model of work-based learning, primarily at NFQ levels 4 and 5, incorporating best national and international research and practice.  Networks of Employers have been created to facilitate partnerships between ETBs and employers in identifying training needs, designing the training programmes, recruitment of learners and delivery of the training on and off the job.  The Career Traineeship model of work-based learning is currently being piloted with the Hospitality and Engineering sectors, with the involvement of seven ETBs.<\/p><p>Given the breadth and range of programmes within the Further Education and Training (FET) sector, it is not possible to provide details of funding and places on a county by county basis across specific sectoral provision.  However, one way in which Solas classify FET provision is by the career areas which it serves.  The following table on provision in the FET sector, shows the total number of beneficiaries in the career areas of Food and Beverage and Tourism in each of the sixteen Education and Training Boards for 2015 along with that planned for 2016.  As yet, final 2016 figures are not available.<\/p><p>While it is not possible to give details of expenditure at the level of career areas, the scale of total investment in FET and the numbers served on both a full and part time basis are also included in the table. <\/p><p>In relation to the number of tourism and hospitality skills training positions within the higher education sector in 2015 and 2016 and the amount of funding allocated for tourism and hospitality skills training in the same years, it is not possible to give a breakdown by county as students can apply for courses throughout the country, through the CAO application process.  However the table on provision in the higher education sector gives a breakdown outlining the number of training positions and the total estimated funding allocated which is categorised by each individual Institute.<\/p><p>In 2015 the total number of student in higher education courses in this sector was 8,220 with estimated funding allocated of approx. &euro;47.4million and in 2016 the total number of students for the sector was 8,033 with estimated funding allocated of approx. &euro;48.4m.  The funding detailed in this response includes an estimation of grants allocated to these courses, student contribution and free fees.  The student numbers are calculated as full time equivalents (FTE) which includes part time and full time student counts.<\/p><p>This analysis of the higher education sector includes all courses within the following categories:  <\/p><p>- Tourism\/Hotel\/Leisure\/Event <\/p><p>- Hospitality &amp;amp; Culinary <\/p><p>- Heritage &amp;amp; Cultural.<\/p><p>I also<font color=\"#1F497D\"> <\/font>understand that a limited amount of complementary tourism-related business development and training supports are provided by F&aacute;ilte Ireland, the agency responsible for encouraging, promoting and supporting tourism as a leading indigenous component of the Irish economy.  However, I have no role or responsibility in relation to F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  Matters relating to that agency and its training and business supports are matters for my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100065#WRG08600","answer":true,"speaker":"1351"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":351,"content":"<p>Summary of 2015-2016 - Tourism and Hospitality Courses Higher Education Sector.

educational psychology service to all primary and post primary schools through an assigned NEPS psychologist and in some cases through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA), full details of which are on the Department's website.  Under this scheme schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.<\/p>  <p>  In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service.  The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring.  Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximize positive outcomes for these pupils.  NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties.  Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process.  Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. <\/p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.

The staffing process includes an appeals mechanism for schools to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeals Board.  This process includes a provision in which schools that are not gaining an additional teaching post under the developing schools criterion can submit an appeal to the independent Appeals Board.  This appeal criterion is targeted at those schools that make a significant contribution to the provision of school places and so assist the response to demographic growth within their area.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Department uses a Geographical Information System (GIS) to identify where the pressure for school places will arise.  The GIS uses data from the Central Statistics Office, Ordnance Survey Ireland and the Department of Social Protection, in addition to the Department&rsquo;s own databases.

The review contained a range of recommendations to expand participation of apprenticeship, including the establishment of an Apprenticeship Council.

The Plan sets out a clear 10 step path for the development of new apprenticeships and also sets an overall development timeline for a new apprenticeship of 12-15 months.  The Plan also commits to examining the potential for public sector engagement with the apprenticeship system.<\/p>  <p>  The Insurance Practitioner Apprenticeship, the first of the new programmes developed through the Apprenticeship Council&rsquo;s first call for proposals, launched in September 2016 and an Industrial Engineer Apprenticeship commenced in November 2016.  13 further new apprenticeships are due to launch later this year in various sectors including medical devices, polymer processing and financial services.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, a campaign to promote apprenticeship is currently being developed by SOLAS in consultation with key partners, including the Apprenticeship Council.

The Commissioner for Valuation has sole responsibility for all valuation matters except appeals of valuation procedures set out under the Valuation Acts 2001 to 2015, as amended, which comes under the remit of an independent Valuation Tribunal.  The Valuation Acts come under the aegis of my colleague, the Tanaiste and Minister for Justice and Equality. <\/p>  <p>  Under Part 5 of the Valuation Acts 2001 to 2015, the Commissioner of Valuation is conducting a revaluation of all commercial and industrial properties throughout the State.  To date, revaluations have been completed in South Dublin County Council, Fingal County Council, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, Dublin City Council, Waterford City and County Council and Limerick City and County Council.  I understand that revaluations in 10 local authorities, including Kildare, Leitrim, Longford, Offaly, Roscommon, Sligo and Westmeath County Councils are due to be completed this year with valuations to take effect for rates purposes for 2018. <\/p>  <p>  I am aware of recent media reports that certain business owners have stated that they will face higher rates bills.  However, it is not the purpose of a revaluation to increase or decrease the total amount of commercial rates collected by local authorities but rather to ensure that the valuations used for rating purposes are up-to-date and reflect current market conditions.  With this in mind, it is possible that some ratepayers may see the rateable valuation of their properties increase while other ratepayers may see the rateable valuation of their properties decrease.  Section 56 of the Valuation Acts 2001 to 2015, as amended by section 8 of the Local Government (Business Improvement Districts) Act 2006, provides that I, as Minister, can make an order directing a rating authority to limit the overall amount of income it could raise through rates in the year following a revaluation to the total amount of rates liable to be paid to it in the previous year, adjusted for inflation.  Rate limitation orders have been made in each of the local authorities that have undergone a revaluation to date and I will be making further orders later this year in respect of the rating authorities currently undergoing revaluations. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100075#WRR02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Planning Issues","counter":551,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100075#WRR02200"},{"type":"question","counter":552,"qnumday":280,"qnumall":"[4333\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100075#WRR02300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"if there is any limit to the number of times a developer can apply for planning permission for wind turbine development at a specific site.","asker":"1232","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":553,"content":"<p>Planning legislation does not place any restrictions on the number of times an application for planning permission may be sought for a particular type or class of development on a specific site. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100075#WRR02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Motor Tax","counter":554,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100075#WRR02500"},{"type":"question","counter":555,"qnumday":281,"qnumall":"[4427\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100075#WRR02600","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"the policy rationale for the need to tax a vehicle which is to be declared off the road; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1230","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":556,"content":"<p>The Non-Use of Motor Vehicles Act 2013 came into effect on 1 July 2013.

We continue to be committed to these objectives notwithstanding the immigration policy agenda of the new Administration.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has raised the issue of immigration reform with US interlocutors &ndash; including at the highest levels &ndash; on many occasions.  I personally raised the issue when I met then-Secretary of State John Kerry in Co. Tipperary, on 30 October 2016.  I also raised it when I spoke to Speaker Paul Ryan by telephone on 23 November 2016. <\/p>  <p>  The Government has also availed of every opportunity to sensitise the incoming Administration to our concerns and interests regarding immigration reform, and the plight of the undocumented Irish in particular.  The Taoiseach raised the matter in his separate telephone conversations with President Trump and Vice-President Pence in the days following the Presidential election. <\/p>  <p>  I am very conscious that this is a time of worry and uncertainty for our undocumented Irish citizens in the United States.  This issue will therefore be high on the agenda for my visit to Washington DC later this week.  In my engagements with the new US Administration and Congress, I plan to avail of all appropriate opportunities to raise the plight of the undocumented Irish citizens and to explore any viable way of providing them with some measure of reassurance and relief.  Moreover, the forthcoming St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day engagements will provide a further opportunity to express to senior figures in the new Administration and Congress our concerns and policy objectives in relation to the undocumented.  <\/p>  <p>  The Government will continue to use high-level visits to and from the US, as well as Ireland&rsquo;s diplomatic representation in the United States, to advance these aims.  The Embassy in Washington has worked closely with members of the US Congress - in both the House of Representatives and the US Senate, and on both sides of the aisle &ndash; to advance progress on this matter and will continue to do so.  We are fortunate to be able to draw on the assistance of the Friends of Ireland in Congress and the many representatives of Irish-America, who appreciate our concerns.  I will be meeting some of these senior leaders this week in Washington and will ask for their continuing support for our undocumented citizens.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to these political efforts, our Embassy in Washington and our Consulates throughout the United States will continue to engage with Irish community groups in relation to their concerns.  On 12 January, Ambassador Anderson convened a meeting of senior immigration stakeholders at our Embassy in Washington in order to hear directly from those who work most-closely with the undocumented Irish.<\/p>  <p>  We will also continue to support organisations that deliver frontline advisory services and community care to Irish emigrants through the Emigrant Support Programme.  More than 70% of the funds allocated through this programme are directed towards welfare services, including in support of the undocumented Irish in the U.S. In the last funding round for the Emigrant Support Programme, organisations in the U.S. were allocated more than &euro;2.3 million in funding.  The Government, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and our Embassy in Washington continue to work closely with Irish-American community leaders in actively pursuing all viable opportunities to advance immigration reform.  We will encourage and promote any realistic possibilities for a solution that may arise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100080#WRW02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Redeployment","counter":742,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100080#WRW02800"},{"type":"question","counter":743,"qnumday":348,"qnumall":"[3755\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100080#WRW02900","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the number of staff within his Department who are allocated to work on Brexit-related issues full time; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1228","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":744,"content":"<p>Following the outcome of the referendum in the UK in June 2016 and in line with the Government&rsquo;s contingency plans prepared in advance, additional capabilities and resources are being assigned to cover the complex process of the UK exit from the EU.<\/p>  <p>  I am happy to set out the resources which are in place in my Department as of today.

This Memorandum sets out principles of how the two organisations will work together to ensure that appropriate and relevant information on completed OPW flood defence schemes is provided to insurers to facilitate, to the greatest extent possible, the availability to the public of insurance against the risk of flooding.  II members have committed to take into account all information provided by OPW when assessing exposure to flood risk within these areas.<\/p>  <p>  The Memorandum came into effect on 1 June, 2014 with an initial tranche of data provided by the OPW to II in respect of 12 completed flood defence schemes and showing the design, extent and nature of the protection offered by these works.  A further tranche of data was provided to II in January 2015 covering a further 4 completed flood defence schemes.  OPW will continue to provide data to II as flood defence schemes are completed.<\/p>  <p>  II estimates that flood cover is included as standard in 98% of household insurance policies throughout the country.  II has carried out a number of surveys among its members to ascertain the extent to which flood insurance cover is available in the areas for which OPW has provided data on completed flood defence schemes.  The results of the most recent survey were provided in December last year; they indicate that 83% of property insurance policies in these areas include cover against flood risk.  Where the defences are permanent in nature the percentage is 90%; where demountable defences are used the percentage is 77%.<\/p>  <p>  In line with Action No. 270 of the Action Plan for Rural Development, the OPW and the Department of Finance are now engaging with II on a quarterly basis.  At the most recent meeting on 8 December 2016, it was decided that a sub group be established to explore the legal, technical and administrative arrangements that may allow for the further sharing of data on flood insurance cover for those 300 areas where the OPW has mapped the flood risk through the CFRAM Programme.  This sub group held its first meeting on 18 January last.<\/p>  <p>  I am happy with the work of the Group thus far and am confident that it will continue to progress the issue of flood insurance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100081#WRX03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1260"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Procurement Contracts","counter":790,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100081#WRX03400"},{"type":"question","counter":791,"qnumday":365,"qnumall":"[4227\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100081#WRX03500","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the reason the framework for media monitoring was rolled out by the Office of Public Procurement without public notification or due consideration for bodies that may wish to apply for consideration; if he will consider reopening the tender process; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1323","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":792,"content":"<p>A Framework Agreement was put in place by the Office of Government Procurement for the provision of Media Monitoring Services for public sector bodies on 22\/01\/2016.\u00a0 Prior to the running of the tender process a Prior Indicative Notice (PIN) was published on the eTenders portal on 04\/06\/2015, five months in advance of the tender process, in order to notify potential suppliers of our intention to go to the market for these services.

Technical evaluations have been produced for each of the six component sites and, earlier this month, my Department convened a meeting of stakeholders from all six locations to review progress and to chart the next steps.

This is because local authorities are the primary instruments of community engagement and second, local authorities have a particular capacity for local programme delivery, especially in the context of citizen engagement.<\/p><p>I have asked local authorities to establish a Culture Team bringing together arts officers, librarians, heritage officers, museum curators, archivists and other relevant personnel which will be led by a Director of Services, with a nominated person as 'Creative Ireland Co-ordinator'.  The primary role of the Culture Team will be to develop a Culture and Creativity Plan, reflecting the overall structure and aims of the national strategy programme, and then to drive public participation in creative cultural activity in ach local authority area.<\/p><p>I have made a specific allocation of &euro;1million to the local authorities towards the implementation of the 2017 Creative Ireland Plans out of the overall funding of &euro;5m which I secured in Budget 2017 to underpin this new initiative.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100085#WRBB01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Post Office Network","counter":928,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100085#WRBB01150"},{"type":"question","counter":929,"qnumday":414,"qnumall":"[4111\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100085#WRBB01200","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the way in which her Department proposes to oversee and monitor the implementation of actions to support the post office network, arising out of the report of the post office renewal board and the Post Office Hub Working Group as outlined in point 20 of the action plan for rural development; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

It is the first plan of its kind to take a cohesive and coordinated approach across the whole of Government to both economic and rural development. <\/p><p>The Action Plan collates both new and existing rural development policies and initiatives from across Government under one cover, and the monitoring mechanisms set out in the Plan will drive their implementation.  This approach will ensure that rural development policies are cohesive, effective and fully implemented for the benefit of rural communities. <\/p><p>The actions contained in the Plan represent firm commitments from Government Departments and agencies.  Funding for the actions will be reflected in the Estimate of the relevant Department.  Many of the funding components are new, or have only been announced in recent weeks, in anticipation of the Action Plan being published.  Examples of new investments include:<\/p><p>- Up to &euro;60 million over the next three years to rejuvenate over 600 rural towns and villages.<\/p><p>- A doubling of funding for flood risk schemes to &euro;100 million per annum by 2021.<\/p><p>- &euro;6 million for investment in the development of Blueways.<\/p><p>- &euro;10 million to be invested in our National Parks and Nature Reserves.<\/p><p>- A &euro;10 million (50%) increase in funding under the SEAI&rsquo;s Better Energy Communities Programme, which will total &euro;30 million for 2017.<\/p><p>- A new Community CCTV grant scheme will be introduced by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality, while significant investment in the Seniors Alert Scheme will also be made by the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government. <\/p><p>It is important to bear in mind, however, that many of the commitments in the Action Plan involve new policy initiatives which will not necessarily require additional funding to have a positive impact. <\/p><p>As far as my own Department is concerned, I do not foresee the need for a supplementary Estimate this year.

These Directives aim to ensure the protection of habitats and species which have been selected for conservation within special areas of conservation and special protection areas. <\/p>  <p>  Significant efforts have been made by the State to resolve the issue of the protection of Ireland&rsquo;s raised bog special areas of conservation within the framework of the Habitats Directive. This has included intense and on-going engagement with turf cutting interests, the farming community, non-governmental organisations and with the European Commission, as well as the establishment of a long-term compensation scheme for affected turf cutters. <\/p>  <p>  The National Raised Bog SAC Management Plan will set out how the raised bog special areas of conservation are to be managed into the future and how the needs of turf cutters are to be addressed including exploring the options in terms of certain provisions of article 6 of the Habitats Directive.  It is intended that the Plan will be published in the coming period, subject to Government approval.<\/p>  <p>  177 applications under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme for raised bog special areas of conservation have been acknowledged by my Department in respect of Mouds Bog and 60 applications in respect of Ballynafagh Bog in County Kildare.  A total of 504 annual payments, 220 turf deliveries and 41 once-off incentive payments have been made in respect of the applications received from Mouds Bog and 125 annual payments, 22 turf deliveries and 15 once-off incentive payments have been made in respect of the applications received from Ballynafagh Bog.  79 applicants from Mouds Bog and 23 applicants from Ballynafagh Bog have expressed an interest in relocation to a non-designated bog.<\/p>  <p>  Discussions are on-going with qualifying applicants from Ballynafagh Bog with a view to relocation to a non-designated bog in close proximity.<\/p>  <p>  Due to the issues involved in terms of a relocation site for turf cutters from Mouds Bog, my Department, in consultation with turf cutter interests, is considering whether the provisions of article 6.3 of the Habitats Directive could be utilised to allow cutting within areas of the special area of conservation. Under article 6.3 of the Directive consent could only be given to cut turf on a raised bog special area of conservation where it can be shown by rigorous scientific investigations that such cutting will not have an adverse effect on the integrity of the site. <\/p>  <p>  The Review of Raised Bog Natural Heritage Area Network,  published in January 2014, concluded that Ireland could more effectively achieve conservation of threatened raised bog habitat through focused protection and restoration of a reconfigured network. Arising from this review, the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill 2016 has been presented to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and is currently proceeding through the necessary stages in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Its purpose is to provide for the implementation of a reconfiguration of the natural heritage area network arising from the 2014 Review.<\/p>  <p>  Carbury Bog natural heritage area in County Kildare is one of the natural heritage areas which is to remain designated as a natural heritage area arising from the review.

There is a possibility therefore that pike could have an impact on the number of juvenile fish available to the mussels. <\/p>  <p>  It is believed however that the juvenile fish that host the mussels are likely to have spawned close to the mussel beds, and it may be the case that such stream-living fish are not impacted by pike elsewhere in the river system.   <\/p>  <p>  My Department intends in 2017 to carry out a fish host survey, including the Owenriff, to sample juvenile salmon and trout for mussel larvae and will review available fish data to assess trends in host fish populations.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100087#WRDD01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Plean Infheist&iacute;ochta","counter":1013,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100087#WRDD01400"},{"type":"question","counter":1014,"qnumday":444,"qnumall":"[4608\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100087#WRDD01500","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"an bhfuil s&eacute; ar intinn aici airgead a chur ar f&aacute;il chun an plean infheist&iacute;ochta, a comhaonta&iacute;odh idir 80 gr&uacute;pa Gaeilge, a chur i bhfeidhm go hioml&aacute;n, rud a chruth&oacute;dh breis is m&iacute;le post agus go leor deiseanna &uacute;s&aacute;idte Gaeilge; agus an nd&eacute;anfaidh s&iacute; r&aacute;iteas ina thaobh.","asker":"1312","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":1015,"content":"<p>Is mian liom a chur in i&uacute;l don Teachta go bhfuil an Plean Infheist&iacute;ochta sa Ghaeilge agus sa Ghaeltacht &oacute; 2016 ar Aghaidh&aacute; scr&uacute;d&uacute; go gn&iacute;omhach ag oifigigh mo Roinne faoi l&aacute;thair.

Significant progress has been made in this area through the expansion of community mental health teams from 49 in 2008 to 67 currently. In addition, specialist secondary care mental health counselling and psychotherapy is provided within HSE Community Mental Health Teams, and Child and Adolescent Mental Health Teams.

Recognising the time lag in new staff taking up posts and the completion of preparations for the introduction of these services, it is estimated that the revenue spend in 2017 associated with this increased allocation will be some &euro;15 million. There will also be a further additional spend of &euro;9.5 million in mental health associated with increased pay rates. This additional &euro;24.7 million for 2017 will see the HSE Mental Health Budget increase to &euro;851 million.

This was followed in 2015 by the publication of Guidelines setting out a framework for mental health promotion in primary schools.  <\/p>  <p>  In 2015, the Government launched Connecting for Life, Ireland's National Strategy to Reduce Suicide with the aim of reducing suicide and self-harm over 2015-2020.  The Strategy sets out a vision where fewer lives are lost through suicide, and where communities and individuals are empowered to improve their mental health and well-being.  It will provide community-based organisations with guidelines, protocols and training on effective suicide prevention. <\/p>  <p>  One of the main goals in Connecting for Life is to target approaches to reduce suicidal behaviour and improve mental health among priority groups, including young people.  Several key actions have been identified to further this goal in the Education sector, including: <\/p>  <p>  - Support the implementation of the relevant guidelines for mental health promotion and suicide prevention across primary and post-primary schools;<\/p>  <p>  - Guide and encourage the implementation of the relevant policies and plans in schools, including support for Student Support Teams and for critical incident management; <\/p>  <p>  - Work with the HSE to develop national guidance for higher education institutions in relation to suicide risk and critical incident response; <\/p>  <p>  - Implement the National Anti-bullying Action Plan including online and homophobic bullying;<\/p>  <p>  - Support all junior and senior schools to implement a new Wellbeing programme; and <\/p>  <p>  - Deliver early intervention and psychological support service for young people at primary care level. <\/p>  <p>  These actions are part of the overall policy objectives of the Department of Education and Skills.  They are supported by my Department and the HSE through the inter-agency implementation arrangements provided for in Connecting for Life and overseen by the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy and Public Service Reform.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100088#WREE03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1337"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Administration","counter":1058,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100088#WREE03400"},{"type":"question","counter":1059,"qnumday":460,"qnumall":"[3799\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100088#WREE03500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding the granting of full medical cards to children in receipt of the domiciliary care allowance as announced in budget 2017; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1348","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1060,"content":"<p>My Department recently received permission from Government to draft the new Bill.

It is important that the selection of a new host country is informed by clear and careful consideration of the requirements which will need to be met in order to ensure continuity of the EMA&rsquo;s activities and a sustainable future for the Agency.  It will be particularly important to maximise the retention of the EMA staff whose expertise and skills have been key to Agency&rsquo;s development over the last 20 years and to the standing which it enjoys as a regulator at a global level.<\/p>  <p>  In October the Government decided to propose Dublin as a new home for the EMA.

Last year, the NTPF rolled out the Endoscopy Waiting List Initiative to arrange for the provision of endoscopy procedures to patients waiting over 12 months. By the end of December, over 5,500 people had come of the Endoscopy waiting list and the NTPF had managed to clear over 99% of the long waiters on that list. Building on this successful initiative, &euro;20 million was allocated to the NTPF in the Budget 2017, rising to &euro;55 million in 2018.<\/p>  <p>  In December 2016, I granted approval to the NTPF for the first tranche of funding in the region of &euro;5m, for an initiative focusing on day case procedures. It is estimated that around 3,000 day cases will be managed through this process with the aim of ensuring that no patient will be waiting more than 18 months for treatment by 30 June 2017. Tender documentation was issued last week and it is expected that the outsourcing of treatment will commence shortly.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the HSE is currently developing a 2017 Waiting List Action Plan for inpatient\/daycase procedures to ensure that no patient is waiting more than 15 months by the end of October.

The HSE advises that a number of hospitals use parking revenue solely for maintenance and re-investment in parking facilities, including repayment of loans obtained for upgrading such facilities and investment in security. The remainder of hospitals use parking revenue to cover the cost of parking services, with any additional income being used to contribute to the general hospital budget, or to fund research or specific patient facilities. <\/p>  <p>  As demand for parking services at our hospitals increases, so too do the associated costs such as the initial capital costs of purchasing or renting parking areas; the cost of developing extra parking spaces; the need to provide and upgrade security systems in hospital car parks; staffing and general maintenance of parking services.  <\/p>  <p>  Obviously the costs in providing these services need to be recouped; provision of these services to visitors, staff and patients should not impact on hospital budgets intended to provide healthcare services to patients.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE has advised that it does not have one single contract to provide parking services at all hospitals. Instead each hospital has a unique arrangement which reflects its specific circumstances. Some hospitals do not provide public car parks while a minority of others do not charge a car parking fee.<\/p>  <p>  Hospitals which charge parking fees are very cognisant of the financial implications of parking costs for patients and their families particularly those with long-term illnesses. Consequently hospitals have introduced a maximum daily fixed parking charge, thus capping this expense. While there is no national HSE policy governing car park charges, the HSE advises that it keeps hospital parking charges under review.  <\/p>  <p>  In terms of the future development of our hospital system, we must take account of public transport services. This is evident in relation to the planned development of a new Children&rsquo;s Hospital. By supporting the expansion of public transport facilities, we continue to provide more transportation choices to the public when visiting their loved ones in our hospitals. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query regarding the revenue generated from car parking services in each public hospital in 2016,  I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly as this is a service matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100094#WRLL03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Services","counter":1297,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100094#WRLL03800"},{"type":"question","counter":1298,"qnumday":538,"qnumall":"[4064\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100094#WRLL03900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if visiting times at Cavan General Hospital can be extended (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1299,"content":"<p>In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100094#WRLL04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Administration","counter":1301,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100095#WRMM00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1302,"qnumday":539,"qnumall":"[4142\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100095#WRMM00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will schedule an appointment for shoulder and wrist surgery for a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1250","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1303,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

","asker":"1255","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1392,"content":"<p>The Health Act 1970 (as amended) provides that all persons ordinarily resident in the country are entitled, subject to certain charges, to public in-patient hospital services and to public out-patient hospital services.  Section 55 provides that the HSE may provide private in-patient services to persons who are not entitled to, or who do not have or have waived eligibility to public in-patient services.  An essential element of the eligibility arrangements is that the \"public\" or \"private\" status of a patient must be specified on admission to hospital.  The holding of private health insurance is optional and has no effect on people's statutory entitlements or obligations.

The Programme for Partnership Government gives a clear commitment to increasing our mental health budget annually, as resources allow, to expand existing services.  In 2014 and 2015 funding was directed to reconfiguration of general adult teams, including psychiatry of later life, and also child and adolescent community mental health services and the strengthening of community teams.  In 2016 it was directed towards improvement of counselling services; enhanced Community Mental Health teams; improved 7\/7 response and Liaison Services; Psychiatry-of-Later-Life; and Perinatal Mental Health.  Two new mental health clinical programmes have been introduced - ADHD in Adults and Children, and Dual Diagnosis of those with Mental Illness and Substance Misuse.<\/p><p>Budget 2017 made allowance for an additional &euro;35 million for services to be initiated in 2017.  Key priorities to be addressed in the HSE's 2017 Service Plan include youth mental health, further improvement to child &amp;amp; adolescent (CAMHS) and adult services, older people's services and further enhanced out of hours response for those in need of urgent services.  Recognising the time lag in new staff taking up posts and the completion of preparations for the introduction of these services, it is estimated that the revenue spend in 2017 associated with this increased allocation will be some &euro;15 million.  There will also be a further additional spend of &euro;9.5 million in mental health associated with increased pay rates.  This additional &euro;24.7 million for 2017 will see the Mental Health Budget increase to &euro;851 million.  With other minor adjustments, the National Service Plan Budget for Mental Health for 2017 totals &euro;853.1m.<\/p><p>The Department has also given the go-ahead to the HSE for the construction of a new National Forensic Hospital at Portrane.

Significant work is underway to improve access to services outside of normal working hours.  The HSE is responsible for secondary care mental health services in Ireland.  These are specifically for people with moderate to severe mental health problems \/ illnesses such as more serious depression, bipolar illness, schizophrenia or anxiety related disorders.  Services are organised as age related specialty services, provided by multi-disciplinary teams, in line with <i>A Vision For Change.<\/i>The teams are Child and Adolescent, General Adult for working age adults, and Psychiatry-of-Old Age for those over 65 years, together with some sub-specialty teams, such as Rehabilitation \/ Recovery and Acute Hospital liaison teams.  The work of these teams is supported by a network of day hospitals, and general hospital based acute in-patient units.<\/p><p>Data on timely access to services is collected for each team on a monthly basis.  This shows 68% of children referred are seen within twelve weeks, and 74% of working age adults, and 97% of older adults within one week, illustrating improved response times to those with mental health problems. Work is underway by the HSE Mental Health Division to determine the existing level of service provision, and to examine international models of best practice on the most appropriate model of service delivery for use in the Irish context in order to enhance access to seven day services.  In addition, the HSE is progressing a detailed plan for provision of 7 day services across all HSE mental health service areas.<\/p><p>Significant and detailed work is underway in this area.  The current provision of HSE 24\/7 mental health care involves various inter-linked components involving, for example, access via Community Mental Health teams during normal working hours (i.e. 9am-5pm Monday to Friday).  During this period, access may also be made through  Emergency Departments, involving as necessary the existing Liaison Psychiatric Service for hospitals, or alternative arrangements at local level pending further development of a liaison service in some CHO areas.  There is Consultant Psychiatric-led cover in place in hospital Emergency Departments, in respect of the hours 5pm to 9am Monday to Friday, and for the weekend period.  Finally, the National Clinical Programme for the Assessment and Management of Self-Harm was initiated by the HSE in 2014, and is being developed on an on-going basis.  Overall, the HSE indicate that weekend access for each Saturday and Sunday is provided in 9 of the 17 mental health areas, with a further 7 areas having partial cover.<\/p><p>The HSE has prioritised the provision of  improved Out-of-Hours liaison and seven day responses for mental health as a key priority under its agreed Service Plan  2017.  Services, in respect of both adults and those under age 18, are being developed in the light of significant new investment being made available for mental health, balanced against an acknowledged difficulty for the Executive in securing suitably qualified and experienced staff for this care programme.  My objective, and that of the HSE , is to improve all aspects of mental health care nationally for children and adults,  including better access outside of normal working hours, or via Emergency Departments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100100#WRRR01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1337"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Primary Care Services Provision","counter":1521,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100100#WRRR02000"},{"type":"question","counter":1522,"qnumday":610,"qnumall":"[4411\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100100#WRRR02100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to open up more minor-injury units in order to alleviate the overcrowding in accident and emergency departments.","asker":"1349","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1523,"content":"<p>In September 2016, the HSE launched the &lsquo;Winter Initiative Plan 2016-2017&rsquo; which provided &euro;40 million of additional funding for winter preparedness.

The Scheme was developed in co-operation with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI), which has confirmed that AIB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank will distribute the loans, making &euro;150 million available to farmers throughout Ireland at low-cost interest rates of 2.95%.

This is one of the recommendations under the Food Wise Strategy. <\/p><p>The group consulted widely and met with or received contributions from a wide range of bodies.  Their report was finalised in early 2016 with 65 recommendations\u00a0identified and was presented to the Food Wise High Level Implementation Committee in January 2016. <\/p><p>It was crucial to the development of the Irish pigmeat sector that an appropriate forum was established to ensure follow-up on these actions.  Against that background the Department recommended the appointment of an Implementation Group and proposed the re-convening of the stakeholder group chaired by Dr. Sean Brady. <\/p><p>The Implementation group held their inaugural meeting in November 2016.  The group will meet as often as is practicable for the relevant stakeholders to implement the actions and\u00a0 the Chairman will report to the HLIC annually. <\/p><p>The sector is also supported by Bord Bia&rsquo;s pigmeat promotions.  Their current campaign will be aired for the last time in March, before it is replaced with a new pork and bacon campaign due to be rolled out in May, with additional advertising planned for\u00a0September and October.\u00a0<\/p><p>In terms of trade development and market access for the pigmeat sector, my Department continues to make these a priority.  Opening markets is of the greatest importance, particularly in the context of Brexit, to further increase the market opportunity for Irish food and drink internationally.  It is for this reason that we have undertaken major trade missions to Asia and Africa in recent times.<\/p><p>Irish pigmeat exports in 2016 increased by 2% in volume while average pig prices were almost 2% higher.  This left the value of Irish pigmeat exports up by 4% in 2016 at an estimated &euro;615 million.  Net production also increased last year, helped by a significant demand for exports, particularly in China, with volumes up an estimated 44% at 65,000 tonnes reflecting strengthening demand for product in this market.  China is the second largest market for Irish pigmeat exports after the UK, accounting for almost 30% of total exports. Increased volumes to International markets, particularly Asia, offset lower shipments to the UK.

The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of\u00a0the NBP\u00a0as a matter of priority.\u00a0 This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment by the telecommunications sector and a State intervention in those areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.<\/p><p>A key principle of the NBP is to support and stimulate commercial investment through policy and regulatory measures. Commercial investment since the publication of the NBP has considerably exceeded expectations. To date, the commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2.5bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.<\/p><p>Currently, approximately 1.4m premises in Ireland can\u00a0get high speed broadband from commercial service providers and investment by the telecoms sector is continuing to expand this footprint.<\/p><p>The High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie shows the current extent of the State Intervention area:<\/p><p>- The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or have previously indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services,\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>- The areas marked AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the target areas for the State Intervention, which are the subject of the current procurement process. It is intended that premises within this area will\u00a0have access to services of at least 30 megabits per second when the procurement process is completed and the network\u00a0rolled out.<\/p><p>The map currently indicates that 100% of the townland of Kilcossy \u00a0falls within an AMBER area and\u00a0will therefore will be included in the State Intervention procurement process under the NBP.\u00a0Individuals can check whether their premise is in a BLUE or an AMBER area by\u00a0accessing the High Speed Broadband Map and entering their Eircode.<\/p><p>A formal procurement process is now in train to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area. The Department will also shortly update the High Speed Broadband map and finalise this Intervention Area for bidders, taking into account any industry investments that have not materialised and potential other new investments. <\/p><p>Intensive dialogue with bidders is continuing and the three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution.\u00a0This provides a future proofed solution for the\u00a025 years of the contract and beyond.\u00a0 A fibre-to-the-home\u00a0solution\u00a0means that householders and businesses may\u00a0get speeds not just of 30 Megabits per second but much higher, potentially up to 1000 Megabits per second. The procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years.<\/p><p>The timeframe for\u00a0the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders, during the procurement process. During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated a 3-5 year timeline\u00a0to roll out a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP. <\/p><p>As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best roll-out strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and\/or high demand. This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network roll-out plan. A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. A detailed roll-out plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place. <\/p><p>The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the roll-out of the network once a contract is awarded. In this regard, Minister Humphreys is leading on the establishment of two regional action groups, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices and other relevant agencies to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded.<\/p><p>In a further positive initiative, last July,\u00a0I\u00a0established a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce with my colleague\u00a0Minister Humphreys\u00a0to address immediate issues in relation to the quality of mobile phone and broadband coverage.

The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of\u00a0the NBP\u00a0as a matter of priority.  This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment by the telecommunications sector and a State intervention in those areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.\u00a0 A key principle of the NBP is to support and stimulate commercial investment through policy and regulatory measures.  Commercial investment since the publication of the NBP has considerably exceeded expectations.  To date, the commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2.5bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.<\/p><p>Currently, approximately 1.4m premises in Ireland can\u00a0get high speed broadband from commercial service providers and investment by the telecoms sector is continuing to expand this footprint. <\/p><p>The High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie shows the current extent of the State Intervention area:<\/p><p>- The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or have previously indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services,\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>- The areas marked AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the target areas for the State Intervention, which are the subject of the current procurement process.

The procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years. Intensive dialogue with bidders is continuing and the three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution.\u00a0 This provides for a future proofed solution for the\u00a0 25 years of the contract and beyond.\u00a0 A fibre-to-the-home\u00a0solution\u00a0means that householders and businesses may\u00a0get speeds not just of 30 Megabits per second but much higher, potentially up to 1000 Megabits per second.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>The timeframe for\u00a0the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders, during the procurement process.  During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated a 3-5 year timeline\u00a0to rollout a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP.  As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and\/or high demand.  This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network rollout plan.  A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  A detailed rollout plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place. <\/p><p>The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the rollout of the network once a contract is awarded.

As Minister, I have responsibility for developing effective policies for the regulation and optimal use of Ireland&rsquo;s national radio frequency spectrum, underpinned by an appropriate legislative framework. <\/p><p>Implementation of those national policies rests with the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg) as independent Regulator with\u00a0statutory responsibility for the day to day efficient management and use of the radio spectrum within the policy and legal framework set by the Government and the EU.\u00a0 <\/p><p>My Department published a Spectrum Policy Statement in September 2010 and the National Broadband Plan which was published subsequently\u00a0committed to a further review of spectrum policy. <\/p><p>My Department initiated\u00a0a review in 2014 and held an extensive consultation with all interested stakeholders,\u00a0dealing with a broad range of spectrum policy issues while respecting the role of ComReg as independent Regulator. \u00a0A significant\u00a0range of issues and comments were received, all of which were considered.<\/p><p>As part of the consultation process, the Department stated its intention to amend the structure of the Statement of Policy to produce an overarching principles document and a shorter more focussed document which would set out the Department&rsquo;s Medium Term Priorities for the next 3-5 years, to be updated on a more regular basis than the overarching principles.\u00a0 While I have not yet published an updated statement, much work has been done by my Department in identifying the various medium term priorities.  Focus moved from producing a statement to prioritising work items aligned to the various EU spectrum developments underway and in particular, the Digital Single Market (DSM) which is currently under active discussion.<\/p><p>As part of the DSM package of legislative proposals, the European Commission brought forward proposals to co-ordinate the release of the 694-790MHz (700MHz) spectrum band in all Member States by 30 June 2020.  The proposals will allow mobile broadband services to use this part of the spectrum band, which is currently used by digital terrestrial television services (DTT) in Ireland.  The Commission's Digital Single Market Strategy highlights the importance of this band for ensuring the provision of broadband services in rural areas.  The band is particularly attractive for wireless broadband services, allowing higher speeds and greater coverage over long distances.\u00a0 Details of the Department&rsquo;s work on this issue can be found on the Department&rsquo;s website at .<\/p><p>My Department is in regular contact with ComReg, given its role in spectrum\u00a0management.

ComReg is also conscious of the potential developments at EU level in respect of spectrum management which may impact on national spectrum strategies and policies in due course.\u00a0 <\/p><p>The critical element\u00a0emerging from the Department&rsquo;s review of spectrum policy has been to ensure that our legal and regulatory environment support continued investment in mobile telecommunication infrastructure, which is dependent on access to radio spectrum.<\/p><p>We will continue to engage\u00a0with ComReg, and\u00a0I will keep under review the\u00a0need to publish an up to date spectrum policy document taking account, <i>inter alia,<\/i>of developments at EU level including in relation to the DSM package and the related review of the telecoms regulatory framework.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100106#WRXX02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1766,"content":"<p>Question No. 690 answered with Question No. 688.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1767,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 691 to 694, inclusive, answered with Question No. 687.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Broadband Plan","counter":1768,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100106#WRXX03100"},{"type":"question","counter":1769,"qnumday":695,"qnumall":"[4606\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100106#WRXX03200","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if the area to be covered by the national broadband scheme will have to be modified in view of recent increases of coverage by telecommunications companies of rural areas and small towns with high speed broadband and their stated intention to increase this roll-out rapidly over 2017 and 2018; the delay a remapping exercise will cause to the tender process under the national broadband scheme; when it is hoped to have concluded this tender process; the projected date for the commencement of the roll-out of the national broadband scheme on the ground; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1312","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":1770,"content":"<p>The Government considers the NBP to be one of the most significant investments in rural Ireland for decades, and one which will transform society, akin to rural electrification in the last century.\u00a0 The strategy for broadband rollout, the National Broadband Plan (NBP), aims to deliver high speed broadband services\u00a0to every city, town, village and individual premises in Ireland.\u00a0 This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment by the telecommunications sector and a State Intervention in those areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.\u00a0 A key principle of the NBP is to support and stimulate commercial investment through policy and regulatory measures.  Commercial investment since the publication of the NBP has considerably exceeded expectations.  To date, the commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2.5bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.<\/p><p>Currently, approximately 1.4m premises in Ireland can\u00a0get high speed broadband from commercial service providers and investment by the telecoms sector is continuing to expand this footprint. <\/p><p>The High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie shows the current extent of the State Intervention area:\u00a0 <\/p><p>- The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or have previously indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services;<\/p><p>- The areas marked AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the target areas for the State Intervention, which are the subject of the current procurement process. It is intended that premises within this area will\u00a0have access to services of at least 30 megabits per second when the procurement process is completed and the network\u00a0rolled out.\u00a0 <\/p><p>The map provides information on a county by county basis with a breakdown of coverage across the townlands in every county.<\/p><p>My Department is actively monitoring the commercial deployment\u00a0plans in the BLUE areas\u00a0to ensure that all premises can get access to services. \u00a0In this regard, direct feedback from consumers is important and\u00a0if customers\u00a0in these areas cannot access high speed broadband services, I would encourage them to contact my Department directly at , quoting their address and Eircode and giving details of providers they have contacted with a view to obtaining services.\u00a0<\/p><p>My Department is also actively monitoring developments of commercial operators that might impact the Intervention Area.\u00a0 This is being done in accordance with procedures set out by my Department in December 2015. <\/p><p>A formal procurement process is in train to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area.  My\u00a0Department will shortly update the High Speed Broadband map and finalise this Intervention Area for bidders, taking into account\u00a0industry investments that have not materialised in Blue areas, together with new industry investments within the proposed State Intervention Area, along with concrete and credible commitments by industry for further new investments within the Intervention Area.<\/p><p>The procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years. Intensive dialogue with bidders is continuing and the three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution.\u00a0 This provides for a future proofed solution for the\u00a0 25 years of the contract and beyond.\u00a0 A fibre-to-the-home\u00a0solution\u00a0means that householders and businesses may\u00a0get speeds not just of 30 Megabits per second but much higher, potentially up to 1000 Megabits per second.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>The timeframe for\u00a0the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders, during the procurement process.  During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated a 3-5 year timeline\u00a0to rollout a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP.  As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and\/or high demand.  This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network rollout plan.  A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  A detailed rollout plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place. <\/p><p>The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the rollout of the network once a contract is awarded.  In this regard, Minister Humphreys is leading on the establishment of two regional action groups, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices and other relevant agencies to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded.<\/p><p>In a further positive initiative, last July,\u00a0I\u00a0established a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce with my colleague\u00a0Minister Humphreys\u00a0to address immediate issues in relation to the quality of mobile phone and broadband coverage.

Of these approximately 25% have been scheduled and the average period between date of receipt of the complaint and the first hearing date is approximately 25 weeks. <\/p>  <p>  The remaining complaints received in 2016 include a number of multiple complainants against single respondents.  These complaints are \"on hold\" at the request of the parties for a variety of reasons, including the availability of the parties\/witnesses, requests from parties or their representatives for the hearing not to proceed for myriad reasons including ill health, unavailability of a key witness, settlement talks etc.  While these scenarios are outside the control of the WRC, they naturally impact on timelines for hearings. <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, it must be borne in mind that the ability of the Commission to schedule cases is influenced by a number of factors; the completeness of the information on the initial complaint form; the need to seek statements in equality\/unfair dismissal cases and the availability of Adjudicators.<\/p>  <p>  Complaints under equality legislation are, in general, complex matters, where the facts surrounding the complaint can be quite sensitive and often disputed. <\/p>  <p>  Consequently, parties are required to furnish comprehensive details of the issues in dispute, in advance of the hearing.  This enables each party and the Adjudicating Officer, to have prior notice of the arguments which the other side will be relying upon.  Moreover, there may be significant aspects of law at issue.  Affording the parties adequate time to address these matters at the outset facilitates the efficient conduct and smooth hearing of the matter later on.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may be interested to know that in feedback received by the WRC as part of its stakeholder engagement, there was a strong view that both equality and unfair dismissal cases may actually require a longer lead in time for scheduling.<\/p>  <p>  The situation under the redundancy legislation is that the Commission received 722 specific complaints in 2016, of which approximately 50% have already been scheduled.  The average period between the date of receipt of the complaint and the first hearing date is just under 19 weeks.  A considerable number of the remaining complaints are linked to complaints under other employment rights statutes, including linked claims for unfair dismissal.  These linkages impact on the scheduling period, and similar to the situation under the equality legislation, external requests for more time are also a delaying factor.<\/p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that the WRC is doing everything within its control to ensure that cases are brought on for hearing without undue delay.  However, the Commission is always mindful that parties must have sufficient time to prepare for cases bearing in mind the often sensitive nature of the cases.<\/p>  <p>  Should the Deputy have details of a particular complaint which has been lodged for eight months and has not yet been scheduled for hearing, she might contact the Commission's Director of Adjudication so that the matter can be investigated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100110#WRBBB02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1247"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ticket Touting","counter":1899,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100110#WRBBB02100"},{"type":"question","counter":1900,"qnumday":742,"qnumall":"[3949\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100110#WRBBB02200","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the action she is taking to prevent the exploitation of consumers by ticket touts and to ensure equitable access to tickets for entertainment, sporting and other events; the detail of her discussions with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport on this matter; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1222","askee":"1247"},{"type":"speech","counter":1901,"content":"<p>In\u00a0response to the public concern over the issue of ticket resale, I met with the Minister for Tourism and Sport in October 2016.

That examination led to the detailed consultation paper which I issued on 20 January 2017 together with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Minister for Tourism and Sport.  Though ticket resale has been the subject of considerable comment, there is a lack of reliable information about important aspects of the practice, including its extent, the sources of tickets put up for resale, and the prices achieved, as opposed to advertised, on the secondary ticket market.  The aim of the consultation is to provide us with a better understanding of the issue and to help us identify the practical measures that might be taken to give consumers fairer access to tickets in the future.  Those measures may include changes to the existing regulatory framework.  That will be determined following an assessment of the responses to the consultation and other relevant factors. <\/p>  <p>  My Department has overall responsibility for consumer protection.

It found that Ireland&rsquo;s cost base has improved across a range of metrics over the last five years.  This has made Irish firms more competitive internationally and made Ireland a more attractive location for firms to base their operations in.  However, despite these improvements, the Council warns that Ireland is particularly vulnerable to external shocks beyond our control &ndash; external risks at the moment include in particular Brexit, oil prices and exchange rate movements.  My Department and its agencies continually engage with relevant public and private stakeholders, as there is a role for both the public and private sectors alike to proactively manage their cost base and drive efficiency improvements.<\/p><p>Local authorities are under a statutory obligation to levy rates on any property used for commercial purposes, in accordance with the details entered in the valuation lists prepared by the independent Commissioner of Valuation under the Valuation Act 2001.  Commercial rates form an important element of the funding of all local authorities.  The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority.  The Annual Rate on Valuation (ARV), which is applied to the valuation of each property, determined by the Valuation Office, to obtain the amount payable in rates, is decided by the elected members of each local authority in their annual budget and its determination is a reserved function of a local authority.<\/p><p>As set out in the 2016 Action Plan for Jobs, the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government encouraged local authorities to exercise restraint in adopting the Annual Rates on Valuation and, where appropriate, the Base Year Adjustments for 2016.  It encouraged local authorities to provide to the greatest extent possible certainty for commercial ratepayers in terms of the impact harmonisation may have on their rates bills in future years.<\/p><p>Following the reorganisation of local government structures arising from the Local Government Reform Act 2014 there are 31 local authorities which adopted an Annual Rate on Valuation (ARV).  11 local authorities are not affected by rates harmonisation measures provided for in the Local Government Reform Act 2014.  This is due to those local authorities either having amalgamated prior to establishment day under separate amalgamations, or due to there being no former town or borough councils in the local authority area.  Two of these local authorities (Galway City Council and Limerick City and County Council) increased their ARV for 2016 and nine adopted the same ARV in 2016 as in 2015.  The average increase in ARV for this group of local authorities was 0.46%.  The remaining 20 local authorities are required by law to harmonise their rates through implementing the Base Year Adjustment (BYA) process.  In 2016 of 74 former rating authority areas within the 20 local authorities subject to the BYA, ARVs have increased by an average 3.07% in 40, decreased by an average 1.12% in 17 and remain unchanged in a further 17.  This equates to an overall average increase of 1.4% in commercial property rates.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100111#WRCCC00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1247"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Education and Training Provision","counter":1919,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100111#WRCCC00800"},{"type":"question","counter":1920,"qnumday":749,"qnumall":"[4347\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100111#WRCCC00900","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the number of tourism and hospitality skills training positions allocated to the counties of Roscommon and Galway in 2015 and 2016; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1341","askee":"1247"},{"type":"question","counter":1921,"qnumday":750,"qnumall":"[4348\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100111#WRCCC01000","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the amount of funding allocated to counties Roscommon and Galway for tourism and hospitality skills training in both 2015 and 2016; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1341","askee":"1247"},{"type":"question","counter":1922,"qnumday":751,"qnumall":"[4349\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017013100111#WRCCC01100","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the agency or Government body which has oversight and responsibility for tourism and hospitality skills training here; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1341","askee":"1247"},{"type":"speech","counter":1923,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 749 to 751, inclusive, together.<\/p>  <p>  F&aacute;ilte Ireland was established under the National Tourism Development Act 2003.

The Affordable Childcare Scheme responds to a specific need to increase the affordability, quality and supply of early years and school-age care and education services in Ireland.  It also reflects a core recommendation of the 2015 Inter-Departmental Group on Future Investment in Childcare in Ireland to replace the existing targeted childcare schemes, which are administratively complex and inadequate in terms of accessibility, with a single, streamlined and more user-friendly scheme.<\/p><p>It is important to recognise that the Affordable Childcare Scheme is only one element of a broader set of commitments and supports aimed at parents and children.

Due to contractual arrangements, each of the existing 13 sites are scheduled to come to the end of their contracts at various points throughout 2017.

The aim of this is to ensure that rather than creating parallel provision, the learning from this programme informs the ongoing reform of established services and supports for children and young people in the areas of Health, Education, and Social Services.  Mainstreaming the learning in this way will bring improvements, not only in specific areas, but across the wider system, thereby addressing all areas of disadvantage.  <\/p>  <p>  The extension of all sites to the end of 2017 will provide all sites participating in the ABC programme with additional opportunities to evaluate their activities and focus on mainstreaming the interventions and programmes that make a real difference to children&rsquo;s lives.
