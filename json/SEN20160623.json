The Minister has set out clearly the need for a ten-year strategy on palliative care.  However, we need to consider the HSE's 2015 annual report and the emphasis placed in it on the need for urgency in dealing with demographic influences.  Let us consider the figures.  In this regard, the Minister of State will have seen the figures quoted previously.  <\/p> <p>The number of people aged 65 years and over is 600,000, but by 2031 the corresponding figure will be over 1 million, which will represent growth of 400,000 within a short timeframe.  The good and interesting news is that the number in the over 85 age group is also increasing.  My understanding is that the figure has increased by approximately 20% in the past six years alone.  The HSE report cites the fact that the number in the over 85 age group is growing by approximately 4.5% per annum.  I am looking for some joined-up thinking among those involved in elderly care, including in the private and the public sectors.  The fair deal scheme is functioning well in the sense that there are now over 23,000 people in private nursing homes under the scheme.  The question is how we plan for what will happen in the long term and whether we can have the same ratio in the coming 15 years.  How can we provide for care in nursing homes without the necessity of people having to be admitted to hospital?  An issue arises when elderly persons are referred to hospital from nursing homes.  Is the emergency department the appropriate route for them?<\/p> <p>The matter I am raising relates to long-term planning and the need to put something comprehensive in place to deal with the growing number for whom we will have to provide in the coming ten, 12 and 15 years.  That is the context in which I am raising the matter with the Minister of State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016062300002#A00500","speaker":"1409"},{"type":"speech","time":1466674200,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this Commencement matter.<\/p> <p>Ireland's population is ageing rapidly, with advances in health care leading to a dramatic rise in the older population.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Helen McEntee:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2394\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2394&amp;amp;pid=HelenMcEntee&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->As the Senator mentioned, in the next 20 years the number of people over 65 will double and the number of people in their 80s will treble.  While that is obviously very positive, it brings its challenges.  These demographic changes will have significant social and economic implications.  Demand for community services is rising as more people are supported at home rather than in hospitals or nursing homes.<\/p><p>The challenges arising from population ageing can be met if we plan effectively and necessary adjustments are made over time to our services.  We need to ensure that levels of service are sufficient to meet the growing needs, that they are co-ordinated and integrated effectively, and that the preferences of our older people are at the heart of this process.<\/p><p>Significant additional resources were provided to older persons services in 2015 and two weeks ago we provided &euro;40 million in additional funding to support home care services, and to develop short stay and transitional care beds.  There will, however, always be a cohort of older people who require a quality long-term residential care option.  This must continue to be available to anyone who needs it, and therefore we will ensure that the nursing homes support scheme is funded to a level whereby successful applicants do not wait more than four weeks for funding.<\/p><p>Most older people want to stay in their own homes for as long as they can.  It is widely accepted, not just within the Department and the HSE but also among advocacy groups, that people live happier, longer and healthier lives when they live in their communities and when they contribute to their communities.  Home care services are a key element of how we can support them to do that.<\/p><p>The Programme for a Partnership Government is committed to supporting, on a multiannual basis, the development of home care services.  We are now supporting more people at home with more complex needs than would have been possible in the past.  The more of this we can achieve, the more and better the options that we can offer to older people.<\/p><p>The integrated care programme for older people which is currently being established and implemented across four pilot sites, inclusive of community health-care organisations and hospital groups, will bring a focus to the clinical requirements of the small but ever increasing number of older people who have complex care needs and who are at risk of admission to hospital emergency departments in an unscheduled manner.  This was an issue the Senator raised.<\/p><p>This programme will see the development of access to specialist teams such as consultant geriatrician-led multidisciplinary teams and will bring a case management approach to supporting identified older people living in their own community through bespoke care plans and where the resources such as home care, day care and respite can be interlinked appropriately to meet their needs so that each organisation will know what each person's care plan is and can deal with it appropriately.<\/p><p>The Department of Health is committed to developing a national integrated strategic framework for health workforce planning, in collaboration with other Departments and agencies.  A cross-sectoral steering group has been established to develop this workforce-planning framework for health services that will support the recruitment and retention of the right mix of staff across the health system.  It is envisaged that a plan will be submitted by the end of the year setting out how we can ensure that there is an adequate supply of appropriately trained health professionals to provide high-quality services that are delivered safely and cost-effectively.<\/p><p>In that regard additional funding is required on an annual basis.  We also need a change in how we provide our services.  I believe that shift is happening, but obviously we need to ensure it happens as quickly as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016062300002#A00600","speaker":"1337","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1466674200,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I have a question on home care.

I congratulate the Minister of State on her appointment and I wish her all the best.<\/p> <p>A number of years ago we were told with great fanfare that the west was getting a new hospital group called Saolta that would go a long way towards solving the crisis in our health services in the west.  Unfortunately the practice has not proven to be as successful as planned.  The latest figures and statistics from the National Treatment Purchase Fund are stark for University Hospital Galway in particular.  We have had much talk of leagues and people winning games etc., but unfortunately University Hospital Galway is top of the league again for all the wrong reasons for outpatient and inpatient waiting lists.<\/p> <p>According to the latest figures University Hospital Galway is top of the list nationally with 31,417 waiting on its outpatient waiting list.  When the figures are parsed more closely we can see that 4,744 on those waiting lists have been waiting for more than 12 months.  The particular pressure points seem to be in cardiology, dermatology, general medicine, general surgery, gynaecology, neurology, ophthalmology, orthopaedics and ENT.  Particularly worrying would be orthopaedics where 4,248 people are waiting on the outpatient list for University Hospital Galway.<\/p> <p>Unfortunately the picture gets worse with the inpatient day cases by hospital.  Not only is University Hospital Galway \"top of the pops\" again, but it is actually almost double its closest rival.  It has 11,099 people on the waiting list.  Its closest rival is Beaumont Hospital with 6,065.  Again when the figures are parsed we can see that 2,907 people have been waiting for more than 12 months.  So almost one in four people have been waiting for more than a year for the treatment they need.<\/p> <p>Representatives of the Saolta hospital management group recently gave a presentation to Oireachtas Members and members of the regional health forum where they finally said publicly that they believe there is a massive issue with the hospital in Galway.  We have been saying this for years.  They said it was clear that the capacity of the present hospital cannot deal with the numbers passing through it and that is part of the reason for the consistently high numbers of people on waiting lists.<\/p> <p>The physical building is not the only problem.  There are huge issues with staffing, particularly a lack of nurses.  The lack of theatre nurses has been highlighted as an issue as are specialists in various areas.  Over the past five years I have heard that this would be addressed and there would be recruitment processes etc.  However, the lists are getting ever longer and people are suffering for longer with no apparent solution in train.  That is why this is a crucial question for the people of Galway.<\/p> <p>As Senator O'Mahony will know part of the reason for the lists being so long is that the Saolta hospital group now covers the hospitals from Donegal down to Galway, including those in Mayo and Roscommon as well.  People from all those regions are affected by such long waiting lists in Galway.  It is totally unacceptable, and needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency.  I look forward to the Minister of State's response to see what plan and strategy the Department has to ensure this is addressed as a matter of urgency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016062300002#B00500","speaker":"1377"},{"type":"speech","time":1466674200,"counter":16,"content":"<p>T&aacute; br&oacute;n orm nach bhfuil m&oacute;r&aacute;n Gaeilge agam, so I will respond in English.

I am taking this debate on behalf of my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Harris, who sends his apologies; he is elsewhere on Government business.<\/p> <p>Tackling waiting lists has been a challenge for hospitals this year to date, particularly due to increased demand for emergency care, which increased by 5.6% over last year.  Waiting lists for specialties such as rheumatology, orthopaedics, ophthalmology, urology, plastics and ENT are challenging nationally.  However, the 2016 HSE service plan undertakes to maintain 2015 levels of service in respect of scheduled care.<\/p> <p>The HSE oversees and supports hospital groups in meeting the waiting list targets and has established a scheduled care governance group to co-ordinate key actions to reduce waiting times.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Helen McEntee:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2394\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2394&amp;amp;pid=HelenMcEntee&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->University Hospital Galway, UHG, as part of the Saolta University Health Care Group, continues to monitor and act on outpatient, inpatient and day-case targets in line with the HSE national service plan.  The hospital provides tertiary level services and accepts referrals from a large catchment area, contributing to waiting list length.<\/p><p>The HSE has advised that specific measures have been taken to reduce the length of current waiting lists.  Additional outpatient clinics are taking place within UHG, while some activity is being transferred to Mayo, Roscommon and Portiuncula University Hospitals.  UHG is developing the elements required to support specialties with the longest waiting times regarding inpatient beds, high-end equipment, access to theatre and staffing, all of which are required to support greater elective surgery throughput.  Initiative clinics are running in some specialties to reduce particularly challenging waiting lists, some led by allied health professionals, such as physiotherapists and nurses.<\/p><p>The HSE has further advised that IT solutions are being deployed to validate current waiting lists and streamline outpatient appointment scheduling, as well as minimising those do-not-attend cases.  The shortage of radiographers, causing recent issues with the MRI and DXA scanning facilities, is being addressed by ongoing recruitment.  Extended hours of operation are being implemented for the MRI facility.  UHG has recently protected the surgical day ward for elective activity as demand for emergency care decreases.  Construction work is ongoing on a new 75-bed ward block, as well as a new UHG acute mental health department.<\/p><p>The Minister is confident the Saolta group, in conjunction with the HSE, is working to address waiting lists at UHG in the best interests of patients.  The programme for a partnership Government emphasises the need for sustained commitment to improving waiting times for patients, with a particular focus on those waiting longest.  It commits to &euro;15 million funding to the National Treatment Purchase Fund in 2017 for an initiative targeted at those waiting longest as part of continued investment of &euro;50 million per year to reduce waiting lists.  The Department of Health is engaging with the NTPF, while the HSE in planning a dedicated 2016 waiting list initiative focussed on endoscopy.  It has also commenced engagement with the NTPF and the HSE to deliver on the programme for a partnership Government waiting list commitments.  The fact a high number are waiting over 12 months needs to be a priority for the Minister.  I will bring it to his attention.  We have been successful in many areas but we still have much work to do in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016062300002#B00600","speaker":"1337","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1466674200,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her response.

Previously, I have called on the Minister to put together a working group to look at building a new hospital in Galway on a greenfield site with the requisite staffing and resources.

Many Members are well qualified to speak on this issue, as many of us have travelled throughout the country to get elected to this House.  We may have travelled up a few dead-end roads but that was from a purely political point of view.<\/p> <p>Monaghan is a predominantly rural county with less than 30% of the population living in an urban area, compared to the national average of 62%.  It has a strong agrifood manufacturing and engineering base with many employers living in local areas up small boreens.  It has no real public transport infrastructure and a poor national bus service.  It has the highest density of local roads per square kilometre outside of Dublin.  The county is dependent on its roads infrastructure, in particular its regional and local roads, which provide access to employment and mobility.  Monaghan has the highest agricultural export value per hectare outside of Dublin, made up mainly of poultry with 52% of the country&rsquo;s entire flock located in the county.  It is also the largest producer and exporter of mushrooms in the country.  Both of these sectors depend on commercial vehicles being able to access local roads to get produce to the marketplace.  The value of agriculture indicates approximately 2,500 people are employed in that sector in County Monaghan, the highest in any Border region.<\/p> <p>This year the roads funding allocation for Cavan-Monaghan came to &euro;13 million.  While it seems to be a lot of money, it represents a 40% decrease on the amount allocated in 2011.  An extensive survey conducted by Monaghan County Council indicated 60% of the regional local roads are in need of immediate attention.  When one thinks of the good work and investment that has gone into the local road infrastructure across the country, it is sad it is now crumbling under our feet.  It is an acute issue for an area such as Monaghan from an employment and rural perspective.  Will the Minister of State increase the funding?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016062300002#C00400","speaker":"1396"},{"type":"speech","time":1466674200,"counter":22,"content":"<p>This is my first visit to Seanad &Eacute;ireann.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016062300002#C00500","speaker":"1267"},{"type":"speech","time":1466674200,"counter":23,"content":"<p>The Minister of State is welcome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016062300002#C00600","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1466674200,"counter":24,"content":"<p>I attempted to get in here on one occasion but I was beaten by a quarter of a vote.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016062300002#C00700","speaker":"1267"},{"type":"speech","time":1466674200,"counter":25,"content":"<p>We are delighted to have the Minister of State here and hope we will have him here again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016062300002#C00800","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1466674200,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I congratulate the Leas-Chathaoirleach and all Senators on their election.

I am sure all Senators and the Leas-Chathaoirleach will agree it was a fantastic result for the country.  I see my predecessor, the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ring, in the Gallery.  They are all asking for him in sport but they are in safe hands.<\/p> <p>I thank the Senator for raising this matter which I am taking on behalf of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross, who is out of the country.  Much of what the Senator said resonates with me as I come from west Limerick, a predominantly rural area too.  While we have a large urban centre in Limerick city, the majority of the constituency I represent mirrors the area the Senator&rsquo;s.  Accordingly, I am acutely aware of this issue.<\/p> <p>The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads in Monaghan and other counties is the statutory responsibility of the local authority, in accordance with the provisions of section 13 of the Roads Act 1993.  Works on those roads are funded from the council's own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.<\/p> <p>Ireland has just under 100,000 km of road in its network and the maintenance and improvement of roads places a substantial financial burden on local authorities and on the Exchequer.  Due to the national financial position, there have been large reductions in Exchequer funding available for roads expenditure over the past several years.  For this reason, the focus has been on maintenance and renewal rather than major new improvement schemes.<\/p> <p>In January this year, my predecessor, the then Minister of Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, announced the 2016 regional and local road allocations, of which Monaghan County Council was allocated &euro;7.16 million.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Patrick O'Donovan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2316\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2316&amp;amp;pid=PatrickODonovan&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->In February and May of this year, as part of the tranche 1 and 2 funding to local authorities to remedy damage caused by severe weather, Monaghan County Council received additional funding, bringing the total for regional and local roads in the county in 2016 to &euro;12.3 million.  All available funding for 2016 has now been allocated.  An important change was made last year arising from the introduction of the local property tax, LPT, and the Government commitment that local authorities will retain 80% of revenues from 2015.  Under this new arrangement the four Dublin councils became fully self-funding in respect of the main regional and local road maintenance and rehabilitation programmes.<\/p><p>In addition, the Department has emphasised to the councils that will continue to receive Exchequer and local road grants that the commitment of local authorities to contribute significantly from their own resources towards the cost of improving and maintaining the regional and local roads network is essential and that full consideration needs to be given to utilising the local property tax to boost their own resources.  For the next number of years the financial realities are that the budgets proposed by my Department indicate that capital funding will continue to be very tight, limiting the scope for progressing additional new projects over and above the public private partnerships, PPP, programme that is already in place and the projects prioritised in the capital plan.  It is important, however, to note that the seven-year transport capital plan does provide for the gradual build-up of capital funding for the road network from the current relatively low base towards levels needed to support maintenance and aid and improve works.<\/p><p>The capital plan published in September 2015 outlined proposed transport investment priorities to 2022.  The transport element of the plan was framed by conclusions reached in the Department's Strategic Investment Framework for Land Transport.  This report highlighted the importance of maintenance and renewal of transport infrastructure, together with targeted investments to address particular bottlenecks and critical safety issues.  The capital plan provides &euro;6 billion for investment in the road network in the period to 2022, with &euro;4.4 billion earmarked for maintenance and strengthening of the existing extensive network throughout the country and &euro;1.6 billion for new projects.<\/p><p>I think we are all conscious that the recovery of the economy is generating spending pressures across the Government system, including capital investment needs.  As part of the programme for partnership Government there is an increased emphasis on the need for spending on public services, but the Government still has to operate within the EU fiscal rules and this does constrain options.  There will be a mid-term review of the capital plan and this will provide an opportunity to assess progress and consider what scope there is for increased levels of investment depending on economic growth.  On that point I am very conscious of the review of the capital plan and of where I come from and our dependence on the road network.  As the Senator has said, we do not have rail line connectivity from my county either, and I am very conscious of rural counties, tertiary roads, local roads and all of those roads on which we are so dependent in rural areas in the context of the review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016062300002#C00900","speaker":"1267","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1466674200,"counter":28,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response.

I have met officials from the Department of Transport over the last number of weeks as part of my introduction to my current role.  As a former member of Monaghan County Council the Senator will probably agree with me that a major issue is that our local authorities over the last number of years, even when they did have money, did not carry out adequate drainage.  One can find roads all over the country on which good money was thrown after bad.  Roads are crumbling, as the Senator said, because the water literally has nowhere to go.<\/p> <p>One of the issues that I was very keen to deal with as a councillor and now, having been appointed as a Minister of State in the Department of Transport, is that local authorities must also take responsibility for many of the problems, especially on our regional and local roads which are due to the fact that there is no drainage of any description.  Drains have not been maintained since the famous man with a shovel was going around, and until we get back to a situation of being able to allow water drain off our tertiary, secondary and regional roads, we will continue to have this problem.  I would much prefer to see a proper drainage network that would take the water off our roads rather than, as the Senator said, to watch our road network crumble.  I will certainly take on board the points he has made.  I will relay them to the Minister for Transport.

As he knows, Killarney House is a magnificent place, beautifully restored, with huge money invested in it by the State and his Department, and maybe one other Department gave a little help.  I think the Minister of State is now taking over responsibility for the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, which I am delighted with.

This house has the capacity, please God, to become the top tourist attraction in the south west, given that it is situated within both the town and the national park.  As the Minister of State will outline, I am sure it will become the main visitor centre for Killarney National Park.  It is immediately adjacent to the town centre.

It will provide a vital link between the town centre and the park.  The new landscaped gardens at Killarney House will lead into the natural areas of the park and will provide a wonderful view linking the town to the scenery of mountain, wood and water.  The availability of a focal point for the park within walking distance of the town will bring wider recognition to the park which is, of course, incredibly popular.  Many visitors, even short-stay visitors, wander around the town environs in the evening, especially during summer.<\/p><p>The refurbished Killarney House in its historic setting and functioning as a national park visitor centre will provide an added attraction to visitors and an excellent opportunity to explain the significance and importance of the park to the south-west region.  The refurbishment of the house and the gardens is one of the most significant developments for the local tourism sector in years.  The final phase of works to Killarney House began in early January 2014.  These works, overseen by the Office of Public Works, OPW, included a new extension for the exhibition space and visitor centre, and this is substantially complete.  The work on the interpretative centre, which will be installed in Killarney House, is continuing.  The OPW has also overseen the completion of much of the landscaping of the grounds and ornamental gardens.<\/p><p>The final phase of the work on the gardens will be completed by mid-August.  This phase involves the planting of the central formal garden, the provision of seating, and the installation of potted plants in a number of locations.  The gardens have been open to the public at weekends since April 2016, and will be open to the public on a daily basis from 10 July this year.  The gardens have proved popular, with an estimated 70,000 visitors over the past three months.  I expect the House and interpretative exhibition to open to the public in early 2017.<\/p><p>Finally, I turn to the future governance and administration of Killarney House.

My Department is examining a draft of this study which will inform our thinking on the future governance of the house and gardens.<\/p><p>I know the house, Muckross House and the area well and this will be a major tourist attraction for the town of Killarney.

We all know the famous quote that sport builds character, but what is more true is that sport does not build character as much as it reveals it.  What we saw last night was true grit from the Irish team to get a result.  The President of Ireland has extended congratulations not only to the management and players but also to the fans who have been true ambassadors for the country.  He has also extended congratulations to the other Irish team that has performed so heroically during the tournament and, equally, its fans are ambassadors for the island.  On behalf of the House, will the Leader contact both managements and teams to congratulate them on reaching the last 16 in the tournament?<\/p> <p>I raise the issue of insurance pricing, the gouging by insurance companies, the profiteering we have seen recently and the absolutely obscene demands being made.  Let us take these as the facts.  Since the beginning of the year there has been a 20% increase in insurance premiums.  In the past 12 months they have increased by 34% and since January 2014 by 60%.  If people ring an insurance company today to renew their insurance policy, they will face, at an absolute minimum, a 20% increase.  That is with a full no claims bonus and a clean record.  There are 2.1 million vehicles on the roads in Ireland and their owners are all required by law, as they should be, to have insurance.  However, the price gouging and profiteering we have seen by insurance companies mean that we will all pay more, not only for insurance but also for the services provided by those required to have vehicles on the road to provide services for us.  We do not have the 2015 figures, but we know that in 2014 the actual payouts by insurance companies compared to 2011 showed a decrease of 36%.  However, we have seen insurance premiums increase by 60%.  We have called for the establishment of a task force.  I am sure all Senators agree that the Government needs to take action and regulate.  The task force needs to examine why we have seen such price increases and what can be done about it.  Is it due to the legal profession which is blamed by the insurance companies?  Is it due to payments made by the Injuries Board?  Is it due to overregulation?  Is it due to fraud?  What is the issue?  There is no one answer, but one thing the House and the Government can do is to regulate the insurance industry because at this stage it is profiteering and making obscene demands which will cost us all.  The House must take a leading role in challenging the industry on what is doing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016062300002#G00500","speaker":"1414"},{"type":"speech","time":1466674200,"counter":45,"content":"<p>I am not a fan of soccer, but I congratulate the Irish team.

I make a final appeal to all those with a vote to vote in Ireland's interests and in favour of the United Kingdom remaining in the European Unin.  Partition is a barrier to economic growth and social inclusion in Ireland.  As a brexit would compound this, it is important that this message be conveyed in a positive way.

Every project, whether in the community or the enterprise sector, must be treated on its merits and implemented for the economic and social development of communities.

The report notes that new data released by the Health Research Board shows that young drinkers aged from 18 to 24 years have the most harmful drinking habits in the country.  It continues:<\/p><blockquote>The quantity they drink and the pattern of their drinking is putting them at increased health risk at a young age, and later in life, according to the study.<br \/><br \/>The research found alcohol is responsible for up to three deaths every day and that 50% of Irish drinking can be described as binge-drinking...<br \/><br \/>Alcohol Action Ireland said the latest research shows that the nation&rsquo;s attitude to alcohol is placing an unsustainable burden on the health service and taxpayer.<\/blockquote> <p>The reason I raise the issue is the statement by Alcohol Action Ireland that the &quot;Public Health (Alcohol) Bill is the first legislation of its kind in Ireland, as it treats alcohol as the serious public health problem&quot;.  We need more information on this legislation.  In 2014, Irish drinkers consumed on average 11 litres of pure alcohol each, which is equal to 29 litres of vodka, 116 bottles of wine or 445 pints of beer.  It is not only how much Irish people drink that causes harm but the way they drink.  In 2013, the HRB alcohol diary survey showed that more than 50% of Irish drinkers consumed alcohol in a harmful manner, too much alcohol in one sitting and more than the recommended number of standard drinks in one week.  We must find out more about the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill from the Minister because society must address these harms.  An evidence based public health response is needed, of which the measures proposed in the Bill are an example.  I ask the Leader to seek answers from the Minister on this issue and invite him to come to the House to address this serious problem.  The drinking behaviour of young people aged from 18 to 24 years has serious consequences for their health and their families.  For this reason, we must address the long-term implications of this behaviour. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016062300002#H01200","speaker":"1395"},{"type":"speech","time":1466674200,"counter":61,"content":"<p>I raise the important issue of rehabilitation services.

Important points have been made about health issues and I suppose the darker side of the culture associated with sport.  A discussion worth having is how we can utilise sport development - the Minister could be invited to the House for a debate on the issue - in health promotion because the two naturally complement each other.  Someone who is good at sports and is training, whether for his or her local GAA club, boxing club or soccer club, is instilled very early in life with how to treat his or her body and community with respect.  That is something on which the two Ministers on the island could work to promote.  I believe there was an all-island men's health promotion last week.  That is something at which we could look to initiate a specific discussion.  The Ulster Council of the GAA previously conducted an overt health promotion campaign among GAA players entitled, Drink, Drugs &amp;amp; Sausage Rolls, to instill in young GAA athletes how to look after themselves and avoid some of the dangers posed.<\/p> <p>I make the point which my leader made previously that this is the day of the referendum on Brexit.

It is a place of argument, discussion, debate, communication and, above all, listening.  The behaviour in front of our gentleman Minister, Deputy Coveney, was outrageous.  I did not enter the Chamber because I did not want to be seen silently looking on.  Using our technology without discretion is an affront to human communication, as is sometimes the case when the Leader is answering questions while the people who asked them are texting on their telephones.  The lack of acknowledgement of the Chair on the way in and out is appalling.  If one was leaving a kitchen or one's sitting room when visitors or friends were present, one would say, \"Excuse me\", or give some indication of wanting to leave or enter in the middle of someone's conversation.  The casual use of this Chamber as if it was some kind of inn, tavern, well, bus stop or snug at the back of a pub is appalling.  Some Senators ask tortured and urgent questions as if their lives depended on them, but they do not even bother to wait for an answer from the Leader, who goes to a great deal of trouble to try to understand what they are saying and to accommodate what they want.  That is outrageous.<\/p> <p>I do not want to be part of such a House, such a lack of civility, such a lack of standards, bad manners and such a lack of respect.  Neither do I want to be part of that visualisation on national and international television.  We are the Upper House of this Parliament and we need to show an example.  Who will take us seriously if our manners and respect are so lacking?  In my history of working in communications, the one thing that got different politics and ideas across was civility.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2390\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2390&amp;amp;pid=MarieLouiseODonnell&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I intend to make this speech every day next week until we understand some standard around here.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016062300002#K01000","speaker":"1427","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1466674200,"counter":96,"content":"<p>I join colleagues in congratulating the Irish team.

I support her call for the Minister for Health to come in here to address the issue.  One thing I learned this morning at the event is that by European standards Ireland should have 270 inpatient beds.  We have less than half that number in the whole country.  Another stark fact that I learned is that there are no regional inpatient specialist rehabilitation centres in the entire country.  In terms of community rehabilitation centres, there are only three teams in the entire country but European standards recommend a population of this size should have nine teams.

It would be nice to get back at France for the infamous hand ball incident.<\/p> <p>Yesterday, I met Mr. Kevin Donoghue who is president of the USI.  We spoke about their key issues and core requests.  We, in Sinn F&eacute;in, stand with them in support of their key demands.  The USI has simply asked for affordable third level education.  We do not have that in this country.  Instead, we have hundreds of students dropping out of third level education because they cannot afford the registration fees.  The USI has carried out a study on fees that shows almost nine out of ten students fear dropping out of college due to financial reasons.  Students are missing lectures and working during exam seasons just to scramble enough money together to pay their fees.  The stress that puts on students is pushing them to breaking point with three out of four students saying they have considered dropping out.  The fear that these students live with is a direct result of regressive education cuts made by the last Government and, unfortunately, that appears to be continuing under the new Government.  I ask the Leader to call the Minister for Education and Skills into this House for a debate on this important issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016062300002#L00300","speaker":"1389"},{"type":"speech","time":1466674200,"counter":98,"content":"<p>I, too, congratulate the Irish teams for their superb performances to date, in particular the Republic of Ireland's team and its management.

Their outstanding behaviour, generosity and sense of fun and craic have been acknowledged.  They have shown that people can have a good time without causing problems for other people.<\/p> <p>I echo what Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell has said with the following line.  If one seeks to learn then one has got to listen.  Yesterday, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government came in here to speak but he was continually interrupted.  I fail to see how the Senator concerned could learn anything if he is not prepared to listen.<\/p> <p>Today, I wish to raise the same issue as the acting leader on the far side, Senator Daly.  I am being kind when I say that the insurers are behaving in a very peculiar fashion in terms of the premia that they are trying to extract from people.  I know people who got quotes recently that are double what they are paying.  Therefore, it would be appropriate for the Leader to invite the Committee of Public Accounts to invite the insurers to attend a meeting.  I am fully aware of the fact that the committee cannot force the insurers to attend but their response to the invitation will speak volumes about their attitude to the public.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016062300002#L00400","speaker":"1421"},{"type":"speech","time":1466674200,"counter":99,"content":"<p>I wish to be associated with the remarks, made by the vast majority of Members, congratulating the Irish soccer teams.  In particular, I congratulate the Republic of Ireland or FAI team and wish them well on Sunday.  Last night's result was magnificent.  The players showed real determination and heart.  The management got their tactics right and deserve credit, as do the fans.  I agree with all of the complimentary remarks made about the fans.  I heard the interview given by the French ambassador this morning.  He outlined that all of the French media paid high tributes to the Irish fans above all other fans.  We should all recognise that the Irish fans are acting as ambassadors during the Euro 2016 games.<\/p> <p>I wish to touch on another issue.  Today, the Brexit vote will take place in the North and across the water.  The result will have huge political and economical consequences for the Republic of Ireland and for the rest of the European Union.  Unfortunately, other threats have emerged in the European Union.  For example, there is a high dependence on the German economy and Nordic countries.  Also, the less well-off countries such as Spain, Greece, Portugal and Italy are in a state of negative equity with a negative balance sheet of almost &euro;1.5 trillion.  I call for a two-fold debate on the European project.  We should have one debate on the euro and eurozone and another debate on the European Union.<\/p> <p>The European Union is comprised of more than just eurozone countries.  There are question marks about solidarity and the EU meeting the principles that led to its establishment back in the 1950s under the Treaty of Rome.  We must question whether the EU currently meets its founding principles in terms of solidarity and humanitarian aid being provided to Syrian refugees and others.<\/p> <p>I suggest we hold a two-fold debate.  There is an economic argument and a humanitarian-solidarity side.  It may not be possible to have the debate before the recess.  I ask the Leader to arrange for it to take place as quickly as possible because the economic stability of the EU will be a major issue over the next six to 12 months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016062300002#L00500","speaker":"1382"},{"type":"speech","time":1466674200,"counter":100,"content":"<p>I, too, congratulate both Irish teams.  It is a great achievement for the Irish soccer team to reach the final 16 of Euro 2016.  I say \"Well done\" to everyone concerned, the management, players and their back-up support.<\/p> <p>I wish to refer to an important Supreme Court decision that was issued in the past few days as it concerns checks and balances.  I advise everyone to read the decision.  I refer to a case where the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977, SI No. 551 of 2011, was declared unconstitutional by the Court of Appeal.  The Supreme Court overturned that decision in the past few days and set out clear guidelines on secondary legislation.  It advised that there must be checks and balances.  It means that when we delegate powers we must ensure there are clear boundaries and when we are dealing with legislation.  I will refer to the decision because it is relevant to all of us.  From now on, when dealing with legislation, we must not delegate too much of the powers and retain our role in providing legislative oversight.  Were the Oireachtas required to legislate for every aspect of a particular statutory scheme it would quickly become mired in detail and in the task of precisely predicting future developments, as opposed to legislating for existing trends which may change as to detail.  Instead of continual re-legislating, primary legislation can set boundaries as to what can be provided for in subsidiary legislation.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Colm Burke:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2353\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2353&amp;amp;pid=ColmBurke&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This allows subsidiary legislation to be flexible and address future developments provided those developments are keen to the mischief outlawed in the parent Act.  In this way no derogation from the constitutional imperative to exercise the democratic function is involved.  Basically, it suggests we can delegate, but it is important that we retain our right to ensure the matter is kept under the control of the Oireachtas.<\/p><p>The judgment is important in that it sets clear boundaries for what we can delegate and how we control the derogation.  This highlights the importance of our role and the role of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  Certainly, the Supreme Court has outlined the powers we can delegate to Ministers to ensure that statutory instruments do not go beyond the powers that we delegate to them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016062300002#L00600","speaker":"1409","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1466674200,"counter":102,"content":"<p>I wish to be associated with all the words of congratulation to both Irish teams.  It is a great day to be Irish.  I was proud to see them qualify and go forward to the last 16 of the European Championship finals.  It is was marvellous day and was uplifting for our country.<\/p> <p>I concur with Senator Butler with regard to what we are seeing with the airlines and what I would call exploitation of our fans.  These are ordinary people who have saved up, who wish to support our national teams and be associated with their successes on and off the field.  There is exploitation and I call on the Leader to ask the airlines to be fair.  All anyone is asking is for them to be fair and allow these people to attend to support their national team.<\/p> <p>I wish to take the opportunity to mention another great national sporting event from last weekend, one I was closely associated with.  The national F&eacute;ile na nGael championships took place in Waterford and Tipperary last weekend.  Hundreds of young teams played hurling, camogie and handball in Tipperary and Waterford.  Teams from throughout the island, north, south, east and west, came together to build new friendships.  While competing on the field of play, they created friendships for the rest of their lives.  Thousands of youngsters congregated in counties Tipperary and Waterford for what was truly a remarkable national event.<\/p> <p>I wish to put on the public record my appreciation to the GAA and all the volunteers, coaches, parents and mentors who gave freely of their time to organise such events.  This aspect often goes unnoticed and I wish to put on record in the Parliament what the event does for our young people.  It is a great national event.  The same goes for rugby, soccer and many minority sports as well.  People have spoken this morning of the ability of sport to build bridges.  Through sport our youngsters learn to build new relationships, networks and teams throughout their adult lives and it stands to them forevermore.<\/p> <p>I call on the Leader to organise a debate on funding for third level colleges, universities and institutes of technology.  Funding is essential if we are to equip our graduates to the best level possible to compete globally and internationally.  They must have access to the best equipment, research facilities, laboratories and engineering equipment.  I have heard concerns expressed from representatives of industry.  Unfortunately, in recent years because of cutbacks, facilities and equipment have been affected.  I call on the Leader to invite the Minister for Education and Skills to the House to debate this critical issue.  If we are to have the best graduates coming from this country, then our colleges need to be properly equipped and I am calling for a debate on the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016062300002#M00200","speaker":"1422"},{"type":"speech","time":1466674200,"counter":103,"content":"<p>I have timed it well.  I see that you have taken up the cudgels on my behalf with regard to the seagulls, a Leas-Chathaoirligh.  I am glad the matter is in safe hands.  Will the Leader arrange for the relevant Minister to come before the House to discuss energy security?  I am asking the question in particular in the context of the threat to our gas supply from the ever-perilous situation in eastern Europe.  For example, our supply from the Ukraine is anything but assured.  As the Leas-Chathaoirleach is aware, a sizeable delegation was in the House yesterday from Kerry to discuss a proposed liquefied natural gas terminal on the Shannon Estuary.  The project has been on the books for some time and I referred to it several times during the last term.<\/p> <p>It has never been more advantageous and timely for this project to be coming on stream again with support from one of the major global providers.  Sometimes gas from the interior of landlocked countries, for example, African states and Asian states, cannot be piped.  However, the gas can be liquefied and then transported in bulk in huge liners and brought up the Shannon Estuary, where it is degasified in a process that will of itself create energy.  This will assure us of long-term energy security.<\/p> <p>Will the Leader ask the Minister to come before the House?  In fact, two Ministers are involved but I reckon the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Naughten, would be the most appropriate at the moment.  He could outline his views on the matter.  In the previous Government, the former Minister, Pat Rabbitte, was close to doing something on this but it did not quite materialise.  I hope the Leader can facilitate that request.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016062300002#M00300","speaker":"1394"},{"type":"speech","time":1466674200,"counter":104,"content":"<p>Have I missed anyone who may have indicated?

I join them in congratulating our team on its performance last night.  A nation held its long breath for the last five minutes plus injury time.  It was a great result and I wish to congratulate Martin O'Neill and Roy Keane as well as Michael O'Neill and his team and their success.<\/p> <p>It is important that we celebrate the victory sensibly and that we pay tribute to the team for the manner of their display last night.  Many had given them no chance and, if I am to be honest, I was one of those.  However, by their character and skill they ensured a great result.  We talk about Stuttgart in 1988 or the Giants Stadium in New York in 1994 but in this case Wes Hoolahan will be remembered forever because of last night.<\/p> <p>The issue raised by Senators Butler, Coffey and Reilly relating to the cost of flights is disappointing.  It is unacceptable that airlines should be gazumping or engaging in price gouging to make profits at the cost of fans.  Our fans have been renowned throughout Europe this week and last week for their sense of fair play, fun, revelry and decency.  It is a pity that the airlines are engaging in this type of activity to maximise profits.  It is exploitation at its worst.  I call on Aer Lingus and Michael O'Leary of Ryanair - a good contributor to Irish sport in his own right - to recognise the importance of this match next Sunday.  I will write to them as Leader of the Seanad.  I hope the House will be united in calling on Ryanair and Aer Lingus not to exploit fans or engage in gazumping but to encourage them by laying on extra flights and encouraging fans to travel.  This will help to create a carnival next weekend and we can overturn the hand ball of Henry some years ago.<\/p> <p>It is an important issue but it is not simply about the airlines this week.  It could be about the cost of hotel rooms for concerts next week.  We have to be real.  I appeal to Ryanair and Aer Lingus to work with our fans, the Football Association of Ireland and the Irish Football Association to encourage our fans to travel.  It is important that they do that.<\/p> <p>Senators Daly and Reilly raised the issue of car insurance costs.  I very much agree with them that the costs have spiralled upwards.  As I have stated in the House already this week, this is the reason the Minister for Finance has asked officials in his Department to put together a review of policy involving the Department of Finance, the Central Bank, other Departments and agencies and the insurance industry to examine the factors that are contributing to the exorbitant costs of motor insurance increases and come back with a review.  Out of that review the group could then produce a set of recommendations to yield an improvement in the functioning and regulation of the insurance sector.  The Senators are right.  It is important that the matter is examined and that we come back with a comprehensive review which gives benefit to the motorist and the person who needs car insurance.  Senator Daly is correct in that we require car insurance.  Again, we should work with people to ensure they are insured appropriately and properly and that we do not see an increase in people driving without insurance.<\/p> <p>Senator Conway-Walsh raised the issue of the Leader programme in her remarks.  This week, the Minister announced funding for the Leader 2020 rural development programme.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->A total of &euro;250 million will be available for investment in rural enterprises and communities.  The funding will be provided based on a strategic approach and on priorities agreed at local level.  I have spoken to the Minister for Regional Development, Rural Affairs, Arts and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Heather Humphreys, and to the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ring, about this and can assure Senator Conway-Walsh that the latter in particular will not be found wanting when it comes to Mayo.  As it stands, 80 strategies have already been finalised, with more to come.  This is an opportunity to invest in rural Ireland to attract enterprise and to promote job creation, local tourism and community development.  I will ask the Minister or Minister of State to come to the House so that we can discuss the opportunities that the programme will present.  <\/p><p>A number of Senators raised the issue of Brexit.  It is very important, even at this, the 11th hour, that we appeal to people in Northern Ireland and across the United Kingdom to vote to remain in the EU.  Economically, it is very important to us as a country, as it is to the EU.  Whatever our concerns about the EU the old Irish saying, N&iacute; neart go cur le ch&eacute;ile, applies today.  It is important that we stand together.  The European Union is better with the United Kingdom inside rather than outside.  The UK is our most important trading partner and it is important to us that it stays in.  Again, I appeal to Members who have not already done so to engage with their friends and relatives across the UK and ask them to vote to stay.  <\/p><p>I am very happy to accept Senator Norris's amendment to the Order of Business.  Senators Craughwell, O'Donnell and Reilly raised the matter of decorum in the Chamber.  It is important that, as Members of the Upper House, we would debate issues with decorum and good manners.

I thank Senators for raising that issue.<\/p> <p>The issue of mobile devices in the Chamber is a matter for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  Sometimes when I am on my iPad in the Chamber, I am just looking for the note for the person who is speaking.  I do not mean to be rude.  I think Senator Craughwell thought I was not listening to him but I was listening.  That is the main reason for using my iPad but I apologise if it appears rude.  <\/p> <p>Senator Ruane raised the issue of the Bill to be discussed this afternoon and I look forward to the debate on same.  Senator Bacik made reference to the One Foundation event.  It was a good event and I am sorry I missed it.  That foundation is doing great work.  Senator Murnane O'Connor raised the issue of alcohol.  She is right that it is a very harmful drug of choice for many of us but the issue is being addressed by the Government.  The sale of alcohol Bill has been restored to the Order Paper.  While it will not be taken before the summer recess, it is in train.  If the Senator would like any information on it, the health committee of which I was a member in the last D&aacute;il carried out very good pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill.  I would be happy to speak to the Senator about that and to provide her with further information.  It is a very important issue that we must keep talking about in order to raise awareness, as well as dealing with it through legislation.  <\/p> <p>Senators Hopkins and Byrne raised the issue of rehabilitation services and I am happy to invite the Minister for Health to the House to discuss this issue.  A strategy has been developed but there are questions around its implementation.  We must follow up on that.  Senators Hopkins and Feighan also referred to the situation at Roscommon hospital and while that could be raised as a Commencement matter, I am happy to ask the Minister for Health to come to the House to discuss it.<\/p> <p>Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile raised the issue of sport, North-South relations and co-operation, which is very important.  It is imperative that we use Healthy Ireland, the framework created by the former Minister for Health, former Deputy, now Senator Reilly, and the special action group created under that framework, to work on a joint implementation strategy.  Senator Kieran O'Donnell made an important point about the lack of a State awards system to honour our sporting heroes, North and South.  I hope that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges will consider that matter and break new ground.  Why can we not be bold and ambitious and do it?  It is an important issue and the Senator made a very fine point.<\/p> <p>Senator Grace O'Sullivan raised the important issue of gun control, which thankfully does not apply to us here.  As we speak, Members of the United States Congress are engaged in a sit-in, led by Congressman John Lewis, a renowned parliamentarian and activist whom I had the privilege of meeting a number of years ago.  We spoke about the issue of gun control in this House in the wake of events in Orlando and I hope it forms part of the bilateral discussions between the Government and Vice President Joe Biden. <\/p> <p>Senator Davitt raised the issue of Mullingar Army barracks for which a strategy was put in place.  That strategy is currently being reviewed and the Taoiseach has been in contact with Senator McFadden on the matter.  I agree with Senator Davitt that the barracks should either be used or sold.  The Army barracks in Ballincollig in Cork was sold and as a result, the town has grown exponentially and is now one of the jewels in the crown of Cork County Council.  Perhaps that model could be considered for Mullingar.  <\/p> <p>Senator Gallagher spoke about primary care in County Monaghan.  I am happy to raise that matter with the Minister for Health and invite him to the House to discuss it.  I would encourage the Senator to submit it as a Commencement matter.  Primary care is the way forward.  While I hate to single anyone out, when Senator Reilly was Minister for Health he was a pioneer on primary care but was often criticised.  We now have over 90 primary care centres but if there are deficits, they must be addressed.  <\/p> <p>Senators Gavan and Coffey raised the issue of third level education.  The Minister for Education and Skills will come before the House before the summer recess to discuss education.  In the context of that discussion, it is important that we improve access to education and fund third level education adequately.  The Senators referred to the current USI president, Kevin Donoghue, whose term of office ends soon.  I wish to pay tribute to him because he has been a very impressive president of USI.  He has been impartial in his dealings with all of us and has been very fair and assertive in representing students.  I commend him for that and wish him well.<\/p> <p>Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill raised the very important topic of the euro and the eurozone and suggested that post-Brexit, it would be opportune to have a debate on the EU.  I hope that the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Dara Murphy, will be able to come to the House to engage in such a debate.  I will put that matter on the agenda.<\/p> <p>Senator Colm Burke raised the issue of a recent Supreme Court ruling concerning checks and balances.  That is a matter that I will take up with the Committee on Procedure and Privileges because it is important.  Senator Coffey made reference to F&eacute;ile na nGael, which took place last weekend.

I hope with the co-operation of Senators and Deputies that it will be possible to have this short but important legislation enacted before the Houses rise for the summer recess.  The primary focus of the misuse of drugs legislation is the protection of public health through the prevention of the misuse of dangerous substances.  This legislation is also an important element of the Government&rsquo;s arsenal in the fight against drug dealing and trafficking and consequent gangland crime.<\/p> <p>I am presenting this Bill as one part of the whole-of-Government approach to dealing with the serious crime situation in the north inner city of Dublin.  Following the recent murders in Dublin&rsquo;s north inner city, the Government decided to expedite the drafting and publication of parts of the Misuse of Drugs Bill originally scheduled for the autumn.  Accordingly, the primary purpose in bringing this Bill forward at this time is to aid the law enforcement functions of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in tackling crime associated with the illegal sale of certain substances.  These are dangerous substances if used incorrectly and every effort must be made to prevent their unlawful sale.<\/p> <p>The misuse of drugs legislation has two primary purposes.  First, the legislation aims to protect the public by controlling access to substances which have a medical and therapeutic value but which are harmful if misused, such as benzodiazepines, heroin and cocaine.  The legislation facilitates the safe use of these controlled drugs by means of ministerial regulations and orders but provides that it is an offence to possess or sell these unless authorised to do so under the regulations.<\/p> <p>Second, the legislation aims to protect the public by establishing a system of tight control over dangerous and harmful substances with no therapeutic or other legitimate use.  Well-known examples of these would be ecstasy or headshop drugs.  These drugs are often manufactured by persons who try to stay ahead of the law by making relatively minor changes to the molecular structure and chemical formula of a known drug to produce one which may not be controlled and, in effect, produce one which is legal.  Legal, however, does not mean safe.  Accordingly, it is important we regularly update our drugs legislation and, where appropriate, include generic definitions which potentially cover a large number of substances, some of which have not yet appeared on the streets.<\/p> <p>The substances controlled under the Act are listed in the Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977.  This Schedule was amended in March last year by emergency legislation enacted following a Court of Appeal judgment.  The Court had struck down the section in the 1977 Act under which the Government could make orders declaring substances to be controlled.  As a consequence, all substances controlled by successive Governments since 1977 became legal to possess.  The 2015 emergency legislation recontrolled all those substances.  It also confirmed several ministerial regulations and orders made under the Act, thereby giving these instruments statutory effect as though they were an Act of the Oireachtas.<\/p> <p>The State appealed the judgment to the Supreme Court.  The Supreme Court handed down its judgment yesterday in which it stated the Court of Appeal judgment should be set aside.  This judgment is most welcome, as it means future control of substances under this Act can once again be made by means of Government order.  The rationale for the control of substances under this Bill is still sound, given that we did not know when the Court would hand down its judgment until recently, nor could we be sure that the court would uphold the constitutionality of the legislation.<\/p> <p>There is a problem in parts of Dublin and elsewhere in Ireland with the on-street sale of prescription medicines.  This is especially true for some medicines not controlled under the misuse of drugs legislation, such as zopiclone, a legitimate medicine used for the treatment of insomnia.  Although its sale is illegal under medicines legislation, it is nevertheless being traded on the illicit market owing to its abuse potential.  There is ongoing co-operation between the law enforcement agencies concerned including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Revenue&rsquo;s Customs and Excise service and the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, in tackling this illegal trade with operations and searches carried out where unauthorised activity in prescription medicines is suspected.  All this work is most welcome and is to be applauded, as many of the unregulated products which are the subject of this trade clearly pose potential serious health harms.<\/p> <p>Notwithstanding this, it is still clear we need urgently to strengthen the legislation in this area, in particular to tackle the street trading in some of these prescription medicines which, in tandem with the increased prevalence in polydrug use seen in recent times, has become a feature of the drugs landscape.  Some of the most prevalent products being sold on the street, for example, the zopiclone products used to treat insomnia, remain solely under the medicinal products regulations rather than the Misuse of Drugs Acts.  It is possible for persons selling prescription medicines to be charged under the medicines legislation.  However, this legislation is framed as a regulatory measure to govern the legitimate trade in these types of product rather than as a criminal code.  It is clear there are those who are exploiting this for their own criminal gains.<\/p> <p>Problems also exist with abuse and on-street dealing of other medicines already controlled under the misuse of drugs legislation, such as benzodiazepines.  However, on-street drug dealers often carry relatively small quantities of drugs on their person, which can make it difficult for the authorities to proceed with sale or supply charges.  Accordingly, it is proposed to make unauthorised possession of controlled medicines currently being traded in this way an offence.  Bringing uncontrolled medicines under the scope of the Misuse of Drugs Acts, along with applying tighter levels of control governing their supply and that of already controlled medicines, was requested by the Garda.  The measures being proposed will certainly help our law enforcement authorities in addressing the criminal street trade in these drugs.<\/p> <p>While the illicit trade in these substances is not confined to any area, it is clear this trade has been noticeably prominent in Dublin&rsquo;s north inner city.  This problem has been highlighted by community groups and representatives from the local area, as well as by political colleagues, as one of the priority issues to be addressed as part of the Government&rsquo;s overall targeted response to issues of concern affecting Dublin&rsquo;s north inner city.  In this respect, the Bill forms part of an overall package of initial measures being introduced by the Government as a priority to strengthen further the hands of our law enforcement authorities in tackling those involved in gangland crime, the devastating effects of which have been so appallingly seen in the recent violence in our capital city.<\/p> <p>Similarly, the introduction of controls for the new psychoactive substances listed under the Bill is also essential.  These products have been identified as being of harm and have been the subject of much public and political concern.  A good example in this regard is the synthetic cannabinoid-type substance, known colloquially as clockwork orange, which the Bill will bring under the misuse of drugs legislative framework.  Concerns about the availability and use of this substance, particularly its use in the Cavan-Monaghan region, have been prominently highlighted in recent times.  Calls for the controlling of this substance under our Misuse of Drugs Acts have been made in widespread media reports concerning this product.  This product was also the subject of much attention and concern expressed at a special joint sitting of the health and justice Oireachtas committees held last July where the harms associated with the use of this substance and similar type products were highlighted.  It must be borne in mind that such products are being sold by people who are totally oblivious to the potential threats their use presents.  They have already been linked with serious adverse effects, hospitalisations and, sadly in some cases, fatalities in Ireland.  Obviously, such an illegal and dangerous trade is totally unacceptable.<\/p> <p>To make unauthorised possession of substances an offence, there is a two-step process.  The first step is to bring under the scope of the Act substances which are not controlled.  This will be done by amending the Schedule.  The second step is to introduce regulations to tighten the import, export, prescribing and dispensing controls on these substances and on others which are already controlled but not at a high enough level.  During the summer months, work will continue in my Department in drafting these regulations.  We anticipate there will be a gap of a number of weeks between enactment of the legislation and the finalisation of the associated ministerial regulations and orders required before the controls can be applied.<\/p> <p>The Schedule to the Bill will replace parts of the existing Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act.  It contains substances controlled by means of the emergency legislation last year, as well as the substances to be controlled under this Bill.  These are prescription medicines, or so-called z-drugs, namely zopiclone and zaleplon, used in the treatment of insomnia, as well as lisdexamfetamine, an amphetamine-type medicine authorised for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD.  The Schedule also lists two substances found in products selling as clockwork orange, as well as substances which Ireland is required to control under our obligations as a member of the EU and as a party to the United Nations Convention on Narcotic Drugs 1961 and the United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances.  These are new psychoactive substances known as 25I-NBOMe, 25C-NBOMe, MT-45, 4,4'-DMAR and benzodiazepine phenazepam.  A synthetic cannabinoid known as MDMB-CHMICA currently under risk assessment at EU level is the final substance on the list to be controlled.  Such new psychoactive substances have already been identified as being of harm, including where their use has been implicated in a number of hospitalisations and, in some cases, fatalities in Ireland and elsewhere.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Simon Harris:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2338\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2338&amp;amp;pid=SimonHarris&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> As previously mentioned, listing the substances in the Act is the first part of a two-step process.  Regulations are required to regulate the legitimate use of these substances and subject them to the appropriate level of control.  Accordingly, the Bill provides for the revocation of the existing regulations.  This will enable new regulations to replace them so as to take account of the new substances and regulate their import, export, supply and possession.<\/p><p>The Bill provides for a number of updated definitions of midwives, nurses and practitioners, all of which are consequent on the enactment of the Nurses and Midwives Bill 2011 and the commencement of a new register of nurses and midwives under that legislation.  This will ensure references to these persons in the regulations to be made will be up to date.<\/p><p>The Bill provides for the amendment of two sections of the Act to allow for commencement of section 7 of the Irish Medicines (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006 which provides for the transfer of responsibility for the issuing of licences under the Act from the Minister for Health to the Health Products Regulatory Authority.  The proposed amendments will mean that all references in the Act to licences will correctly refer to the authority.  While unrelated to the primary purpose of the Bill, it was considered an opportune time to make these amendments so as to finally allow the completion of the transfer of licensing functions from the Minister to the HPRA.  While the authority will be responsible for the issue of licences, the Irish Medicines (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006 provides that it will comply with any directive or guideline issued by the Minister to it in respect of policy on controlled drugs.<\/p><p>The final provision in the Bill is a standard one to provide for a collective citation and that the Bill and preceding misuse of drugs legislation can be construed as one.  Significantly, this provision also allows different sections in the Bill to be commenced at different times, thereby allowing the necessary flexibility to revoke confirmed regulations and orders and update them on a phased basis.<\/p><p>Of course, drug supply measures which is what these provisions represent form only one aspect of our overall response to the complex problem of drug misuse.  I want to be clear on this because Senator Lynn Ruane and I discussed the matter in a recent Commencement debate.  This is not the Government's response to drug addiction; that is to come in the second misuse of drugs (amendment) Bill which is due in the autumn and the new national drugs strategy led by the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, which will be published this year.  We must continue to prioritise and resolutely address all aspects of the problem which is so corrosive for our society.  In that respect and as I previously stated in the House, the Government intends to deliver on the commitment in the programme for Government to having a health-led rather than a criminal justice approach to drugs use.  It includes legislating for injection rooms, as I am happy to confirm again.  Accordingly, I intend to publish a second misuse of drugs Bill in the autumn to provide for supervised injecting facilities for chronic drug users.  I have heard incorrect commentary that we are moving away from that commitment and I am very pleased to correct the record.  I know that this will be welcomed, in particular, by Senator Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in who advocated for these changes during his recent tenure as Minister of State with responsibility in this area.<\/p><p>A further programme for Government commitment concerns the development of a new national drugs strategy.  The strategy is within the remit of my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne.  A wide range of stakeholders in the statutory, community and voluntary sectors have been working hard under an independent chairman to oversee a comprehensive review of the current strategy and develop proposals for the future to address this complex human and social problem.  The Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, will take the rest of this legislation through both Houses of the Oireachtas.  We will have an opportunity to hear ideas from Senators and Deputies on this and future Bills.<\/p><p>There is significant debate, both nationally and internationally, on the issue of decriminalisation and-or alternative approaches to the current criminal justice approach to the simple possession of small quantities of illegal drugs for personal use.  The issue is also live here as part of the ongoing discussions on the drafting of a new national drugs strategy.  The development of the new strategy will include a public consultation phase which will provide an opportunity to have a constructive and wide-ranging public dialogue on our current policies and approaches to the issue.  It is expected that the steering group will present its report to the Government towards the end of 2016.<\/p><p>By introducing import and export controls and an offence of unauthorised possession for personal use or the supply of these medicines, it is intended to assist the Garda in dealing with the public on-street dealing in these medicines.  The Garda is supportive of the legislation.  In introducing it we are also taking the opportunity to control a number of dangerous psychoactive drugs, including clockwork orange and drugs from the N-BOMe family.<\/p><p>The Bill is not about targeting addicts but about disrupting gangs and giving An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na the power it needs to do so.  I hope all Senators will consider backing the Bill to help to ensure its smooth and speedy passage through the Oireachtas before the summer break.  I look forward to the more detailed debate on drugs policy, the national drugs strategy and injecting rooms that will take place in the autumn.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016062300002#P00300","speaker":"1251","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1466674200,"counter":130,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and the Minister of State for being present in the House for this debate.  I particularly thank the Minister, Deputy Simon Harris, for his helpful explanation of the amendments involved.<\/p> <p>Having spoken to community activists from many communities blighted by drugs, in particular, activists in the north inner city, we, in Fianna F&aacute;il, feel compelled to support the Bill.  There has been a sharp rise in the number of people presenting with addiction problems associated with these drugs and who have overdosed on them.  The fact that they can be sold with impunity and yet have the same effect as other illegal drugs such as heroin, cocaine and cannabis has driven this growth.<\/p> <p>I am informed by a community activist in the north inner city that Summerhill is now known as \"the sleepy mile\", given the prevalence of zopiclone in the area.  It is a psychoactive drug with a hypnotic agent often used in the treatment of insomnia.  It was linked with 51 deaths due to poisoning in the north inner city in 2013 alone.<\/p> <p>The sellers of these prescription drugs arrive in the area at 8 a.m. every day and by the time children are walking to school less than one hour later they are stepping over empty blister packs and witnessing individuals under their influence of these drugs.  During the Easter break one community group of residents in the north inner city ran an anti-bullying programme specifically to stop children from being pressured into being lookouts and couriers for dealers while off school for Easter.  Activists have widely voiced their view that the trade in zopiclone is now bigger than that in heroin, cocaine and cannabis.<\/p> <p>Clockwork orange is another one of the drugs being discussed.  It is a head shop drug and a particular problem in countiesd Cavan and Monaghan where it has been associated with two recent deaths.  Despite being banned in Ireland since 2010, it is being sold legally in the North and brought to the South for sale.  It is designed to mimic the effects of cannabis.  Users of the drug have had problems with delusions, hearing voices and suicidal thoughts.<\/p> <p>In January this year a number of students in Cork were hospitalised following a house party.  They admitted to taking psychoactive substances which the Bill seeks to make illegal.  Clearly, there is a huge concern about these drugs and the effect they are having on individuals and communities.  However, we, in Fianna F&aacute;il, are very concerned about the cut in the number of garda&iacute; who are working to prevent and investigate drug crime.  Areas in Dublin saw a severe reduction in resources for dedicated drugs squads in recent years.  The entire Cavan-Monaghan Garda district has no Garda drugs unit and this is the area which has been particularly affected by clockwork orange, as I mentioned.  I appeal to the Minister for Justice and Equality to increase substantially Garda numbers in the dedicated drugs units without delay to ensure the Bill, if passed, is to have any meaning<\/p> <p>We also call on the Government to invest substantially in the provision of treatment services for addicts of both drugs and alcohol and to ensure services are available across the country, in both urban and rural communities.  We cannot simply make these drugs illegal and expect the problem to go away.  Making the them illegal is just the first step which needs to happen in conjunction with having properly resourced addiction services, as well as the other essential health, local government and social services.  It needs to happen across the country.<\/p> <p>Withdrawal symptoms from zopiclone, in particular, are similar to those from heroin and include cramps, nausea and fits, the particular reason many drug treatment centres will not accept users who want to detox as they are not equipped to deal with them.  However, detox supervision is necessary, given the risks involved.  This often leaves addicts with no safe detox option, which is completely unacceptable.<\/p> <p>Last week the Fianna F&aacute;il motion on homelessness was passed unanimously by the House.  Contributions made by various Members highlighted the increased poverty levels and the extremely difficult housing problem faced by tens of thousands of people.  This reality cannot be divorced from the rise in the level of abuse of prescription drugs.  In particular, zopiclone users are primarily homeless.  Users have reported that they use the drug to kill the hours of the day and make them forget the reality of their housing problem.  In addition, addiction cannot be overcome if housing is overcrowded, inadequate and not permanent.  I, therefore, call on the Government to act immediately to resolve the housing crisis and tackle in a meaningful way the problems associated with it such as addiction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016062300002#Q00400","speaker":"1376"},{"type":"speech","time":1466674200,"counter":131,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State.

Earlier, on the Order of Business, I referred to the Supreme Court judgment which set aside the Court of Criminal Appeal judgment.  The reason I referred to that matter was the delegation of powers in respect of bringing in regulations or statutory instruments to add to existing legislation in the drugs area.  The drugs available change by the day.  It is important, therefore, that the Minister of State and the Department respond in a timely manner.  That is what occurred until the Court of Criminal Appeal decision, which held that the SI 551 of 2011 was not constitutional and, therefore, that the conviction in a particular case was not in order.  The State appealed the decision to the Supreme Court.  It was right to appeal the decision and the judgment issued yesterday clearly sets out that the State was correct in its arguments and that we, as legislators, cannot legislate for every simple detail in respect of what happens on the street every day but we can give an overall view of how we can manage our affairs and then delegate the responsibility to the Minister and the Department.  That is what the 1977 Act does and this Bill also does that.  The Minister is setting out clear guidelines in respect of the management of the drugs sold illegally and making sure the necessary powers are in place for the Garda and other authorities to deal with them.<\/p><p>This demonstrates how the drugs culture changes by the day.  A number of months ago, a 16 year old in transition year was in my office in Dublin and he advised me that he had worked with a GP in a methadone clinic in the Dublin area.  He outlined that the blue light system, which was used in many public places to prevent people injecting, is null and void.  People purchase small sachets of lemon juice to put into the syringe in order that if they do not hit a vein, the lemon juice will react to their tissue, giving a sting.  They know this whether they are hitting the vein.  As a result, the blue lights in toilets no longer have the same effect as they had previously.  A 16 year old was able to update me on this issue.  It goes to show how the matter changes so fast.  The importance of this legislation is to make sure we likewise can react quickly and we are not relying on legislation to address every detail that needs to be changed.  The Minister of State is correct to bring this legislation forward because we need to respond.<\/p><p>A number of colleagues highlighted the issue of the slowness to respond to the challenges that affect some areas.  This issue is not confined to Dublin.  Some people may be under the impression that Dublin is the only place with this problem.  However, every place in the State is affected.  The availability of drugs and the misuse of them is an increasing problem and it will continue to increase.  We will have to work through a process to make sure adequate resources are available to the Garda and the health services to deal with this.<\/p><p>I welcome the legislation.  It is important to support the Minister of State and to make sure new regulations are introduced in a fast and efficient manner.  Yesterday's Supreme Court decision highlighted the fact that when SIs are laid before the House, we have the right, as legislators, to amend them if we feel they exceed the powers of the legislation.  There are, therefore, controls and checks and balances in place.  Sometimes we forget that we have an important power to challenge regulations brought forward by Ministers or Departments and laid before the House.  It is important that the legislation should pass at the earliest date and the subsequent regulations and statutory instruments are brought forward in a timely manner in order that the relevant powers are given to the authorities to deal with the illegal trading of drugs and other substances and limits and controls are put in place to make sure the problem does not continue to expand in the way it has over the past two years.  I thank the Minister of State for bringing the Bill forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016062300002#Q00500","speaker":"1409","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1466674200,"counter":133,"content":"<p>I was interested to hear what the Minister of State's predecessor had to say.  I particularly welcome Deputy Byrne because Part 2 provides for public consultation on relaxation of the criminalisation of all drugs.  This is an important matter, which I fully support.  It is sad that so many in our society feel it necessary to obliterate their consciousness and to remove themselves from contact with reality and with society.  I recall the phrase used in the 1960s: \"Tune in, turn on and drop out\".  We all thought it was a bit of a laugh but this is far from a laugh.  Almost 30  years ago, I advocated the decriminalisation of drugs in the House.  I did so not because I was in favour of pushing drugs and so on, although I have no problem whatever with cannabis.  It is a recreational drug and I do not see any great problem with it, as it much less harmful than alcohol.  However, I was not advocating the taking of drugs but I was looking at the situation simply from an abstract point of view.<\/p> <p>Money is driving the drugs epidemic.  There is a financial incentive and if that is removed and the impetus that drives people towards selling drugs destroyed, a large part of the problem would be obviated.<\/p> <p>Experiments were conducted in England and Holland through which heroin was made available free of charge.  One was conducted by a priest and a doctor in Liverpool.  They were closed down eventually, even though they reduced crime levels by 80%.  There has been a huge change in this country since I was a child.  I am aged 72 now but when I was a child, I never heard of drugs.  I would see some boozing around the docklands area and so on but there was no such thing as drugs.  I am fed up as a resident of the north inner city at the way this area of our capital city is treated by the city authorities and by Government.  It has been stripped of every decent institution and facility but drug treatment facilities and so on have been dumped in residential areas.  It is absolutely outrageous.  The people living in the north inner city are never considered.<\/p> <p>This type of legislation is not a legitimate response.  The explanatory memorandum states it is an important element in the Government's arsenal in the fight against drug dealing and trafficking and consequent gangland crime.  There may be a marginal impact but I have lived there for 40 years and I have witnessed this area being systematically starved of investment, except on the occasion my late friend and colleague, Tony Gregory, was in the other House campaigning on the issue and secured the Gregory deal.  I recall people squealing about the deal and saying, \"That is not politics\".  What else is politics?  They were objecting that some little snotty nosed person from the north inner city was doing the deal.  That is what got up their noses but I rejoiced in that fact.  A long-term solution, not a short-term solution, is needed with massive investment in the north inner city in housing, employment and education.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator David Norris:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=1758\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1758&amp;amp;pid=DavidNorris&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That is the only thing that will stop it.  When we see a fleet of consultants and surgeons coming from Summerhill and driving around in their sports cars, we will have the proper role models.  Third generation unemployed persons have no hope.  They look around and see those involved in selling drugs driving their big cars, with their Spanish villas and so on and who, of course, become role models.<\/p><p>Things have moved on in the 30 years or thereabouts since I made the suggestion that we decriminalise.  There are now many laboratory-created psychotropic drugs available.  They pose the real danger because we do not really know or understand what they do to the brain.  That is one reason I was always careful to avoid the subway in New York after 6 p.m. because one never knew if the person sitting opposite had swallowed something that made one look like a six-headed beetle with hammers and saws instead of arms and legs.  They would have been perfectly justified in doing someone in.<\/p><p>On the Bill, the regulations will be laid before the House, but I ask the Minister of the State if the House could be alerted to them because often regulations go through on the nod without being discussed.  One does not see them at the back of the Order Paper.  Will the Minister of State arrange to have the House alerted when the regulations are placed before it in order that we can have a proper debate on them?<\/p><p>Also, there will be a hiatus between the abolition of the existing regulations and the introduction of new one.  Is the Minister of State concerned about what might happen within that period and will she give an indication of how long that period will be?<\/p><p>I would welcome a debate on decriminalisation and so on, but I refer to the possession of small amounts of drugs for personal use.  I gather that, officially, there is a fairly relaxed attitude towards this, but how does it square with the statement at the conclusion of the contribution by the Minister, Deputy Simon Harris, that \"by introducing import and export controls and an offence of unauthorised possession for personal use...\"?  What is that about?  I thought we were moving towards a position where unauthorised possession for personal use of small amounts would be tolerated to a certain extent.  Perhaps that is because drug pushers carry only small amounts of drugs and go to a third person to obtain big amounts.  I seek an assurance that the provision will not be used against what I describe as ordinary civilians who just want to smoke a joint on a Saturday night, something many of us have done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016062300002#R00200","speaker":"1392","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1466674200,"counter":135,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, and wish her well.

I do not agree with him in saying he does not have a problem with the use of cannabis.  I have to say I have a major problem with it.  The drug treatment centres tell us that in the past year there has been a huge increase in the numbers of students referred to them for cannabis rather than alcohol use.  Cannabis use can lead to a person taking harder drugs.  That is what I am hearing as the scientific evidence and as the parent of teenagers, I would not like to see them using cannabis.  The Senator was being jocose, but this is a very serious issue.  If it is now the norm among students to take cannabis which possibly can lead to the use of harder drugs, it cannot be condoned in any way or allowed to become the norm because it has consequences.<\/p> <p>I come from Limerick city which has suffered from gangland crime during the years.  The Garda has done tremendous work in dealing with it.  It is primarily drugs-related and a problem we have to tackle.  <\/p> <p>I welcome the legislation, with one caveat.  I agree with Senator David Norris on a technical point.  We have to make sure the new regulations are in place before the legislation is enacted because if people need to use a drug for legitimate medical reasons, we must ensure a lacuna will not be created whereby, effectively, we will have legislation in place which outlaws its use.<\/p> <p>Where people are exploiting the system in creating drugs that are neither legal nor illegal, the legislation and the regulations will fill the void.  Furthermore, the Garda can continue to fight crime.  We cannot compare people who smoke cannabis at a dinner party for social recreation purposes with those living in poor areas who, in many cases, move on to using heroin.  I would not like to see drug use, be it cannabis or some other drug, glamorised, but in some of the comments he made Senator David Norris did this.  It is an issue about which I feel very strongly and one we must treat with great care.  If students sitting examinations come to a drug treatment centre as a result of smoking cannabis due to stress and it is affecting their academic achievement, there are other issues that need to be dealt with, but telling people to smoke a joint because it will sort out their problems is not the answer.  I have a major problem with this.<\/p> <p>There was a flippant attitude to the use of drugs during the economic boom when various commentators spoke about taking cocain at dinner parties as if it was the norm.  It is not.  The Minister of State will know from her experience the devastation drugs wreak.  There is no glamour in seeing people walk like zombies down a main street not knowing where they are and who are a danger to themselves and others.  Drugs use is not glamorous.  Cannabis use is not glamorous.<\/p> <p>I very much welcome this legislation and ask the Minster of State to introduce it speedily.  The key element is ensuring she works with her officials to bring forward the regulations governing legitimate use as quickly as possible.  <\/p> <p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in particular, is at the cutting edge in dealing with this issue.  I am aware of the fantastic work being done by Superintendent Dave Sheehan and his colleagues in Limerick, but the fight is continuous.  The drug lords are making excessive amounts of money on the backs of very poor and disadvantaged individuals, some of whom end up having very short lives, which is not acceptable.<\/p> <p>I commend the Bill to the House and look forward to the Minister of State coming before the House again with the regulations.  I wish the her well in her brief.  People speak about this being a serious debating Chamber.  Cannabis use is not good for anyone.  I disagree with Senator David Norris on the wider implications of drug use for society and, in particular, individuals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016062300002#S00400","speaker":"1374"},{"type":"speech","time":1466674200,"counter":138,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, to the House and thank the Minister for Health for his statement.<\/p> <p>I am not sure whether Senator Kieran O'Donnell carries out research on his claim because it conflicts with his assertions about cannabis.

Perhaps the matter needs a further conversation.<\/p> <p>The Misuse of Drugs Act 1977, as amended in 1984 and 2015, and the Criminal Justice (Psychoactive Substances) Act 2010, are Oireachtas Acts that regulate drugs in this State.  These Acts define the penalties for the unlawful production, possession and supply of drugs.<\/p> <p>Sinn F&eacute;in has voted to support both sets of legislation in both 2010 and 2015.  Our party believes that the misuse of drugs should be treated as a public health matter rather than being about the criminalisation of addicts.  We favour a holistic and health-based approach to addiction.  It is effective and needed.<\/p> <p>I want to make it crystal clear that my party has many reservations and severe misgivings about this amendment.  We believe it should be taken in isolation rather than being part of a suite of measures issued before us for consideration. <\/p> <p>Within the Misuse of Drugs Act substances are scheduled in accordance with this State's obligations under international conventions.  Where there is evidence that they cause significant harm to public health in Ireland then we must act.  The list of scheduled substances has been kept under review.  Action is taken in cases where evidence emerges that substances are being abused and causing significant harm.  This is what we are here to debate.  As legislators, we must have due regard to any review and the action being requested.  The purpose of the Government's amendment is to include prescription drugs, that are commonly known as benzos or Zs, a certain headshop and designer drugs, such as Clockwork Orange, to the existing legislation.  <\/p> <p>Drugs have a devastating impact on our communities, families and the unfortunate addicts.  As suggested by Fianna F&aacute;il, these drugs have overtaken heroin in their usage.  There is no difference between dealing in these drugs and dealing in heroin.  Drug addiction can be found in every county.  Parts of inner city Dublin have been described as an open air supermarket for drugs with dealers feeding on the pain, needs and wants of addicts created by them in the first place.  Mams and dads throughout the inner city of Dublin and in my area of Dublin south-central, can stand at the gates to their houses and see young children and adults being used as runners for the drug barons who remain hidden but make a fortune.  Parents are afraid to let their children out of their homes.  They are fearful that their children will be influenced by what they see on the street.  Parents try to shield their children from this reality but that is often impossible.  This scourge of drugs is intolerable and unacceptable.  <\/p> <p>There is an onus on the Government to provide the Garda with powers to tackle the supply of drugs, including the abuse of prescription drugs, and to resource agencies and community groups to tackle drug taking in the community.  The Government must also support addicts and users along their road to recovery, not hinder them.  When communities get together civic pride takes over and people realise that their place matters.  Some of them clean up their areas on a seasonal basis.  The bags of debris that are collected contain piles of empty blister packets that once contained benzos such as diazepam, zimovane and zopiclone.  Communities are disheartened by their discoveries.  People pick up the empty packets and recycle them but the problem remains.  Children may pick up the discarded empty packets and think the contents must be special.  People are afraid their children will be attracted to the buzz generated by such drugs.  Children are especially at risk of emulating the behaviour of younger adults who are involved in this trade.<\/p> <p>The Bill on its own will not tackle the scourge of drugs and put the major drug dealers out of business.  The Bill is only targeted at a small section of the problem.  Proscribing drugs will have no impact unless it is backed up by resolute action to tackle dealers.  Communities must receive investment because they have been alienated by successive Governments and the problem has been allowed to fester.  The Bill will fail in its aims unless it is matched with additional investment, resources and services.<\/p> <p>Sinn F&eacute;in, after careful consideration, will vote in favour of the legislation on Second Stage in order to allow it proceed to Committee Stage.  At that time we will table meaningful amendments, as is necessary, to strengthen the legislation in line with the vision we set out in a policy document A Better Health Policy for All.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016062300002#T00300","speaker":"1388"},{"type":"speech","time":1466674200,"counter":141,"content":"<p>I apologise before I start speaking because I am extremely angry and disheartened at the legislation's short-sighted vision for tackling gangs.  The legislation is an attack on the addict and does nothing to dismantle the drug trade at a high level.  If one went out onto the street right now one will meet people with benzos in their pockets.  It is dealing with the person lying in the doorway, the person in the hostel and the young man in an estate.  Arresting such people will not bring down the drug trade.  This legislation will create a logjam in the prisons and in the courts system.  This legislation is the weakest link in the chain.  It is simply a reaction to make it look like we are doing something about the north inner city and the drug trade.<\/p> <p>I shall outline what happened to drug services over the years.  When a drug was banned and when the economy changed, people moved from one drug to another.  When heroin disappeared crack cocaine came in.  When the economy improved cocaine usage increased.  The types of drugs used keeps changing and the services cannot keep up.<\/p> <p>We have had a benzo problem for the past 15 years and the services are only just beginning to realise that we need extra beds and equip ourselves to deal with the likes of benzo fits.  Now we are going to try and further force benzos out of the market but addicts will shift to another drug.  It will take another ten or 15 years for us to cop on to what that drug is and how to deal with it through drugs services.  Only a handful of beds are available for addicts coming off benzos.  There are a couple of beds in Beaumont Hospital but they have a waiting list of several months.  Again, this legislation attacks the addict.  Attacking the supply of benzos will lead to addicts suffering benzo fits that may occur in a hostel or at home if they cannot get a hold of drugs.  <\/p> <p>Empty blister packs were mentioned.  People in this city walk across empty bottles and cans every day.  My child would not look at an empty blister pack when walking down a road because it is a piece of litter.  Drawing attention to empty blister packs is completely irrelevant in this argument.  We should be happy that the blister packs are empty and not full because then they would be harmful.  <\/p> <p>Drug laws have completely failed.  Removing drugs at a low level simply plays into the hands of drug dealers.  Low level drug dealers will have drugs taken from them.  Do Senators think that drug debt will just disappear?  No, low level dealers will have to sell a larger quantity of drugs the next time to make up for the quantity that has been taken off them on the street in order to pay the drug dealer that these laws will never reach.<\/p> <p>I call on Senators to reconsider what they are doing here.  I urge them to have conversations with users of these drugs.  Of course, we need to keep them safe and understand what is in these drugs.  This legislation does not do that and drives the problem further underground.  I am really upset that we are taking 1 million steps backwards in terms of addressing addiction.  We can keep saying that this legislation is not addressing addiction and that we will address it as a health matter, but this legislation is an attack on addicts.  The legislation will affect injecting rooms at some level.  Even if people are allowed to have drugs on them within a certain vicinity of these injecting rooms, if garda&iacute; can arrest people for having zopiclone in their pocket, do Senators think they will not use the fact that there is an injecting room in the city to stand so many feet away from a user in order to make an arrest?  If garda&iacute; are seen anywhere near the city centre then users will not avail of the injecting rooms.  Known drug users will be afraid to use the injecting rooms for fear of being arrested for the possession of drugs.<\/p> <p>I was hopeful at the beginning that Sinn F&eacute;in would support my stance but it decided not to do so.  I shall table amendments next week but today I ask Senators to reconsider their views before trying to push this legislation through.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lynn Ruane:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2481\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2481&amp;amp;pid=LynnRuane&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I am really confused that people cannot see that this does not hit the intended target and that it has unintended consequences of which people are not aware.

Between now and next week when the Bill goes through, I ask that I bring Senators to talk to the people these amendments will affect.  The hostels will gladly open up to Senators.  Nine out of ten people there are strung out on zopiclone and this affects them because the next time they go to buy something and have a small amount in possession they are at risk of being arrested.<\/p><p>That was a complete rant because I am actually just angry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016062300002#T00400","speaker":"1404","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1466674200,"counter":143,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State and wish her well in her endeavours.  It is a positive to have a Minister of State with responsibility for the national drugs strategy with the background that she has, and also that she has no other responsibilities and that this will be her main focus.<\/p> <p>The Bill arises from the High Court case of March 2015.  So we have been waiting for this legislation for over a year.  I agree with Senator Ruane's overall remarks in that this legislation flies in the face of what every other western democracy seems to be moving towards, which is to decriminalise the addict, the user, and to focus the attention on the pusher and those who benefit and profit from the drugs trade.  I do not believe that having legislation that criminalises someone for possession of an illegal substance does anything for that individual.<\/p> <p>In today's debate I have heard words such as \"zombies\".  Other words are used in media to describe people in addiction.  A number of months ago two individuals died from heroin overdoses within a couple of hundred yards of each other, one in the toilets of Connolly Station and another man who was found after a number of nights exposed in the open air.  These individuals did not make the news.  There was no march, petition, public outcry or media interest.  At some level collectively, we seem to have decided that addicts are the authors of their own misfortune and, therefore, that their deaths are somehow self-inflicted.  If we continue to go along with that type of narrative, we are destined to repeat the failures of the past.  I do not believe it should be a criminal offence for a person to be caught in possession of something to which he or she is addicted.  I am of the view that it is a waste of Garda time.<\/p> <p>I also do not believe this legislation should separate out the issue of injecting centres.  In my previous role as Minister of State with responsibility for this area, I felt I had gone a long way down the road of getting cross-party agreement on the part of the Bill relating to injecting centres.  It had been passed by Cabinet and was due to be included in this Bill.  With the best will in the world, I do not understand why the injecting centre part has been separated to be dealt with at a later stage.  It does not make any sense.<\/p> <p>My suspicion is that the responsibility of Government to react to the High Court case of March 2015 is foremost in the minds of those in the Department, the Minister of State and the Government, and that any progressive, forward-thinking way of tackling the drugs issue has to take second place.  I am concerned and I hope the Minister of State can dampen those concerns and reassure me that the Government will give the same level of priority to the injecting centre model as it is giving to this legislation.  However, it is very disappointing that it has separated it out.<\/p> <p>If we reinforce what we always done, we will always get what we have always had.  People have always taken drugs and it is quite likely they always will.  To demonise and criminalise someone who has an addiction problem is in many respects to criminalise marginalisation.  A disproportionate number of those who engage in drug misuse come from areas of social disadvantage and are people with disabilities, members of the LGBT community, migrants and Travellers.  Statistically, it can be proven that the further people are disconnected from the mainstream of Irish society, the more likely they are to get sucked into addiction.  When we criminalise possession of substances for personal use to feed a drugs misuse issue and to feed an addiction, we are criminalising marginalisation.  That is effectively what we are doing.<\/p> <p>I invite the Minister of State to go to the drug court, if she has not done so already.  It is a good initiative with some limited success.  Effectively, what one sees there is a bunch of sick people sitting in a courtroom.  Sick people do not belong in a courtroom; sick people belong in a medical facility.  It is pointless in the extreme to continually suggest that the solution to the drugs issue in Ireland is a criminal justice one.  It is not; it is a health solution.  We will eventually will come to the conclusion that what has been done in Portugal is a much more humane and potentially successful approach because it puts the needs of the addict at the centre of public policy and does not dehumanise that addict by using words such as \"zombie\" or terminology that others in the media use openly and without censure, effectively categorising them as being little more than junk.<\/p> <p>While my party and I are happy to see this Bill progress to Committee Stage, I am disappointed at the separating out of the injecting centres.  This move feeds my suspicion about the commitment to that not being as strong within this Government as it was in the previous one, notwithstanding the Minister of State's personal commitment to the issue.  I have no difficulty with controlling substances and continuing to control substances that are causing intense harm.  However, if we continue to criminalise the possession of substances to which people are addicted because their bodies are crying out for them, we will continue along the road that has caused so much hurt.<\/p> <p>There were 679 drug and alcohol-related deaths in Ireland in 2013.  Not all of them were drug-related incidents.  Many were traffic-related incidents and many were suicides.  Everybody in this Chamber should ask why they did not hear about those two individuals who died of heroin overdoses in a toilet in a train station and a few hundred yards away on Foley Street only three months ago.  It may be because we continually blame the person who is the victim.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016062300002#U00200","speaker":"1410"},{"type":"speech","time":1466674200,"counter":144,"content":"<p>I lend my support to the points made by Senators Ruane and &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in in advising the Government against this.

I agree with the Senator that those who have been addicted and who are tarred because of their condition are looked on like our second cousins in the corner whom we never want anything to do with.<\/p> <p>My role as Minister of State with responsibility for the national drugs strategy is to listen to what people have to say.  We are in the process of putting a strategy together and there will be public consultation.  I will ask all those who contributed to the debate, the many people I have met in communities down through the years, some of whom I have spoken to, and Deputies to make sure that when the process is under way, they all fully participate in it because it is about people's lives.  It could be ours sons, daughters, grandchildren or someone from our extended families who, unfortunately, become trapped in one of the worse scourges facing society.  There is not proper legislation to address many of the drugs used by young people.

When I was spokesperson on drugs policy for Fine Gael in opposition, it was one of the ten points I included in the document I put together.  It was second on the list, with the first being detox beds, particularly for people aged under 18.  I have no intention of letting it fall off the table.

I spoke to them about the clean injection facilities and not one person opposed them, no matter where they will be located.  We need to step up to the mark.  For too long, addicts have been seen as misfits and people who do not belong to society.  Last week, I celebrated the lives of those who have died from addiction and suicide in St. Matthew's Church, Ballyfermot, and the Church of St. Agnes in Crumlin.  I am always reminded when I attend the celebrations for these people, both young and old, that the beautiful framed pictures could be of one of my children, nieces or nephews or grandchildren.  I am always taken aback by the community's response to people who are less fortunate than ourselves and who get up caught in drug and alcohol addiction.<\/p> <p>Senator Norris is correct that we have neglected parts of our society for too long.  He hit the nail on the head.  Parts of Dublin city and the country have been neglected not because of a lack of funding but because of a lack of infrastructure to deal with people who live, in particular, in social housing and council complexes.  I spoke at length when I was Lord Mayor and in the D&aacute;il about councils across the country having a responsibility to look after their tenants.  I visit flat complexes in my own area and see excrement, urine, needles and other paraphernalia discarded on the steps.  I would not like my family to have to climb 75 steps past all this to the third or fourth floor of a flat complex on a daily basis.  Councils across the country and Dublin City Council, in particular, need to step up to the mark.  The council has allowed complexes in the inner city to become uninhabitable and derelict.  People do not want to return to them even when they are refurbished.  Bricks and mortar are not the solution; it is much more complex than that.<\/p> <p>I am happy that Members have said they will support the Bill, particularly Senator Clifford-Lee.  I agree entirely with her remarks.  I come from an area that has been devastated by drugs and I have been dealing with the issue since I was a voluntary youth worker locally in the early 1970s.  One of the problems with addiction is that addicts who have entered their 30s or 40s could be wiped off the list because they have gone so far that it would be difficult to bring them back.  We need to focus on young people from the day they are born in these communities and bring them through a process with their families and communities that emphasises that education is the sole way to make sure they have a life ahead of them.  I am very much in favour of using the national drugs strategy to deal with under 18s who are addicted at the moment.  They find it difficult to enter a detoxification programme.  That is key to helping young people.<\/p> <p>Senator Norris said money fuels the drug culture in our society but greed is also a factor.  When young people see somebody down the road who does not have a job and who left school early driving around in a BMW, they see that as the easy option and that is what they go for.  It is a sad option and we need to stop it.<\/p> <p>I do not want to criminalise anybody who takes drugs because of addiction but decriminalisation is a complex issue and it has to be worked out properly before we can say people should not be criminalised for carrying drugs in their pockets.  When I reflect on the pictures of all the young people in the church in Ballyfermot the other night - brothers, sisters, cousins, nieces and nephews - they were remembering relatives whose lives were torn apart because somewhere along the way somebody handed them a pill from his or her pocket.  We have to look into this.  No decision has been made on decriminalisation but we need to examine this in great depth in conjunction with the Department of Justice and Equality.  If we decriminalise addicts, we need to consider how that will affect other people.  It is being looked at and I would not like Members to think otherwise.<\/p> <p>Senator Devine mentioned children being used as mules and gophers.  I had a call from a woman three weeks ago who told me the day her child made her communion, she was asked to bring a package of drugs across the road.  That was the day the child was standing in her communion dress outside a church.  That is a reflection on the lengths these people will go to.  They do not care who they use or how young or old they are.<\/p> <p>A number of Members raised the issue of what happens until the legislation is enacted.  We will stay with the regulations until this is enacted and, therefore, there will not be a gap.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Catherine Byrne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2186\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2186&amp;amp;pid=CatherineByrne&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> I am delighted to thank all of those who contributed on this debate.  I wish to conclude Second Stage with a few remarks on the importance of the Bill and to assure Senators of my commitment and that of the Government to addressing the problems associated with drug use.  Let us remember what the misuse of drugs legislation is about, namely, preventing the misuse of dangerous substances.  The Bill aims to minimise those risks by regulating the possession, supply, manufacture, import and export of these substances.  No one would argue with these aims.  Every drug user is a human being with a family, neighbours and a community.  Drug users are schoolchildren, students, mothers, fathers, aunts and uncles.  They may be in paid employment, unemployed, living at home, homeless or rich, although the majority are poor.  Some misuse drugs that have a legitimate use and others use drugs that have no legitimate use.  Some drug users are what we might term recreational drug users whereas others have become trapped in their drug habits.  This is an important point.  It is as if they are in a tumble dryer with no way out of their addiction unless proper services are on the ground to help them.  What they have in common is a drug use that impacts to some degree or other on their lives and that may negatively affect their relationships with their families, friends and neighbours and the wider community and society.<\/p><p>The proposed amendments to the Misuse of Drugs Act, and the regulations to be made subsequently, will introduce controls on substances that are open to abuse and are being openly and unlawfully traded.  The aim of the Bill is to assist the law enforcement authorities in dealing with the scourge of the unlawful availability of substances that are harmful to health.  As the Minister stated, policy will be led by concerns about people's health, not criminalising them.  No one could argue with these points.<\/p><p>Undoubtedly, problem drug use continues to be one of the most significant challenges facing our country.  I am aware of the trust placed in me by the Government to lead in addressing these challenges, but it is not all down to me.  It is for all Members in this Chamber, as human beings living in our communities, to ensure that young children are protected against people who have no sense of age or difference when leading others down the road to drug addiction.  It is a challenge for everyone.  Directly or indirectly, every community is affected by drug abuse and addiction.  All communities deserve our protection through the control of the unlawful supply of dangerous substances and through access to treatment and other services when needed.  I have spoken with some Members of the Oireachtas about access to services.  Services on the ground in my community do their best to do a good job, although many could do much better.  There are too many services.  We must consider what services are being supplied to addicts and their families and ensure that quality rather than quantity is our approach.  We must have quality services in communities instead of services being splintered everywhere.  Addicts and families in trouble should not be running to ten different services.  This matter will form part of the national drugs strategy, into which we will all have an input.<\/p><p>I would like to address some of the Senators from areas outside Dublin.  As the House knows, I am from Dublin and many Senators come from across the country, but this issue affects people everywhere, not just those living in Dublin.  It affects people living in Cork, Mayo, Donegal and Letterkenny.  I am getting calls and e-mails from people in every little town and village claiming that they do not have services and asking what they should do when they find their children starting to take recreational drugs.  We need to expand a service into communities and draw people together regardless of how small or large those communities are.  This is in line with the programme for Government's commitment to a health-led rather than a criminal justice approach to drugs use.<\/p><p>The emphasis on health-led policy is not new.  The National Drugs Strategy 2009-2016 aims to tackle the harm caused to individuals and society by the misuse of drugs through a concerted focus on the five pillars of supply reduction, prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and research.  The strategy aims to encourage problem substance users to engage with and avail of such services.  Treatment is provided through a network of statutory and non-statutory agencies using a four-tier model of service delivery.  This model is based on the principle that drug treatment is best provided at the level of complexity matching the patient's need and as close to the patient's home as possible.  It is all about tackling the problem within the community.  Under the strategy, the HSE has reoriented addiction services so that they are capable of dealing with all substances.  This recognises that polydrug use is endemic among people attending drug treatment and makes treatment even more complex.<\/p><p>The provision of harm reduction measures such as needle and syringe programmes and methadone maintenance treatment reduces drug-related harm and facilitates recovery by providing a pathway into services.  Our focus is to move people on to drug-free lives where that is achievable.  I have listened to statistics down the years about the number of people who are on methadone.  People in my life, in my community, talk on a daily basis about how they will work on taking methadone.  Some have been on it for eight or ten years.  I do not accept this.  It is wrong.  They should have been moved on a long time ago.  That approach must form part of our considerations on the drugs strategy.  Addiction is not a choice - it is a health care issue.  This is why I believe that it is imperative that we approach our drug problem in a more compassionate and sensitive way.<\/p><p>I have attended the funerals of young people whom I knew closely and who died due to addiction.  Some came from good families where there were no problems but who, for some reason or another, found themselves getting sucked into the tragic belief that if they only took a small amount of drugs, they would not become addicts and move on to heroin and other lethal substances.  I am sure that Senators can reflect on the many funerals that they have attended because of suicides or drug addiction.  Most striking is how the families have become lost in anger at themselves over not being able to do anything about what happened.  After I speak with them, I often leave believing that, besides the child who has passed away, we must help the families.  They are lost in a black hole when their loved ones are taken away and they do not have the answers.  Many people who commit suicide do not even leave notes explaining why they did it, so their families do not know why it happened.  The funerals are for young people, some as young as 12 or 13 years of age, whose lives were only beginning.  As a public representative and citizen of this country, I have an obligation to do my best to help such young people.<\/p><p>The programme for Government contains a commitment to legislating for supervised drug injecting facilities, and it is my intention to publish a Bill in the autumn to deal with this issue.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Catherine Byrne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2186\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2186&amp;amp;pid=CatherineByrne&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This move is in line with the findings in a recent report from the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, which found that supervised drug consumption facilities can be an effective intervention in harm reduction and a means to encourage drug users to enter treatment.  This is what we all want.  Many Senators will be familiar with the Merchants Quay Ireland facility, which is in my constituency.  I might as well be honest - it is the best facility of its type in Ireland.  It deals on a daily basis with people with whom others in society are not prepared to deal.  Those who go to Merchants Quay Ireland are not just looking to avail of its needle exchange service; they also want to be able to go into a programme.  Many of those who use the Merchants Quay Ireland facility are brought into a programme and are helped.  That is what safe injection facilities should be about as well.  I have to inform Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in that I have not visited one of these facilities.  I have been asked to visit them, but my big problem is that I would have to go away to do so and I am afraid of my life of flying.  I intend to visit one of them because I believe they work.  That point has been made clearly by the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction.  We need to look at that.  I guarantee the House that I will do my utmost.  The facilities in question have been shown to be effective in engaging populations of drug users who are difficult to reach.  This is especially the case for marginalised groups, such as the homeless and those who use drugs on the streets or in other risky and unhygienic conditions.  I am nearly finished.  I apologise for moving away from the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016062300002#V00200","speaker":"1307","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1466674200,"counter":149,"content":"<p>No, no.

The steering committee that has been established to oversee this process is representative of key stakeholders.  It will provide guidance and advice to me on how the new strategy should address the problem of drug use, the structures through which this might be done and the incorporation of key performance indicators to measure the future effectiveness of the new policy.  It is important for people to contribute to the open public consultation programme.  It is envisaged that a health-led approach to drug use will be among the range of issues to be considered by the steering committee in the course of developing the new strategy.  This will help to ensure people with drug problems are put at the centre of our drugs policy.  This, in turn, will assist such people in leading the lives they want and aspire to in their communities.<\/p> <p>Many of us who know people who are addicted to drugs are aware that such people often become outcasts in their communities.  Their communities do not want to know them, even though they are sleeping in streets and gardens at night.  If we are to give any hope to younger people, in particular, who find themselves caught up in the trap of addiction, we must change the attitudes that cause them to become outcasts in many communities.  I emphasise that people can come back out of this dark hole.  In many cases, they return to their communities and have children of their own.  Last week, I attended an awards ceremony in Ringsend for people who have gone through addiction and availed of addiction services.  A young man in his early 30s spoke about his experiences as someone who had been an out-and-out addict.  There is no other way to describe it.  He was on the ground.  He said he was ashamed of the things he had done in his life.  He said he would not have got to where he is today if services had not been provided to help him back out of the hole he was in.  I do not think there was a dry eye in the house when he finished the passionate speech he made to the approximately 200 people who were in the room.  He then introduced us to his 11 day old child, whom he had brought along to show us how much his life had changed.  I mention this to show that there is hope for drug users.<\/p> <p>I am keen to ensure there is a broad, comprehensive and inclusive consultation process that provides opportunities for public participation, particularly in communities that are affected by drug problems.  It is intended to launch the public consultation process by the end of July.  In line with the commitment in the programme for Government, it is expected that the steering committee will be in a position to submit its final report to me for consideration at the oversight forum on drugs in December 2016.  I hope to receive the report in early December.  I do not want to get it on Christmas Day or Christmas Eve.  I want it early in December.  I reiterate my commitment as a citizen, as a public representative and as Minister of State with responsibility for the national drugs strategy, and the commitment of the Government, to addressing in a balanced and effective way the challenges posed by drug misuse to individuals and their families, neighbours, friends and, above all, communities.  I thank everybody who contributed to this debate.  I think will be back here for a few hours next week.  If Senators want to propose amendments, I will be more than happy to address them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016062300002#X00300","speaker":"1307"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1466674200,"counter":151,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1466674200,"counter":152,"content":"<p>Committee Stage ordered for Tuesday, 28 June 2016.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1466674200,"counter":153,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to sit again?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016062300002#X00600","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1466674200,"counter":154,"content":"<p>At 2.30 p.m. next Tuesday.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016062300002#X00700","speaker":"1409"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1466674200,"counter":155,"content":"<p>The Seanad adjourned at 2.15 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 28 June 2016.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
