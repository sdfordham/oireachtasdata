Today we have a number of sessions and this morning's, in session No. 1, is a public hearing with Mr. David Begg, former general secretary of ICTU and non-executive director of the Central Bank and CBFSAI, and Mr. John Dunne, director general IBEC and non-executive director general bank of ... sorry, non-executive director general bank and IFSRA.  In doing so, I would like to welcome everybody to the public hearing of the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis today.  At this morning's hearing, our witnesses are Mr. David Begg, former general secretary of ICTU and non-executive director of the Central Bank, and Mr. John Dunne, former director general of IBEC and non-executive director, Central Bank and IFSRA.<\/p><p>This session will focus on our witnesses' respective roles with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the ... and IBEC, and as non-executive directors of the Central Bank and Financial Regulator.  Mr. David Begg was general secretary, Irish Congress of Trade Unions, from 2001 to 2015.  He was also a non-executive director of the Central Bank from 1995 to 2010.  Mr. John Dunne was director general of IBEC from 1993 to 2000, and chairman of the IDA from 2000 to 2010.  He was also a non-executive director of the Central Bank and IFSRA from 2003 to 2010.

If you are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and you continue to so do, you are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of your evidence.  You are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  I would remind members and those present that there are currently criminal proceedings ongoing and further criminal proceedings are scheduled during the lifetime of the inquiry which overlap with the subject matter of the inquiry.  The utmost caution should be taken not to prejudice those proceedings.<\/p><p>In addition, there are particular obligations of professional secrecy on officers of the Central Bank in respect of confidential information they've come across in the course of their duties.  This stems from European and Irish law, including section 33AK of the Central Bank Act 1942.  The banking inquiry also has obligations of professional secrecy in terms of some of the information which has been provided to it by the Central Bank.  These obligations have been taken account by the committee and will affect the questions asked and the answers which can be lawfully given in today's proceedings.  In particular, it will mean that some information will be dealt with in a summary or aggregate basis only, such that individual institutions will not be identifiable.<\/p><p>Members of the public are reminded that photography is prohibited in the committee room.

I understand that I've been asked to give evidence to the inquiry by virtue of my roles as non-executive director of the Central Bank and as General Secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  As you know, Chairman, the regulatory regime was altered radically as a result of the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Act 2003, which amended the original Central Bank Act of 1942.  It established the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority as an autonomous entity and it was given responsibility for prudential regulation.  The powers formerly held by the Central Bank for the regulation and supervision of the financial institutions were transferred to the regulatory authority under section 33C of the new Act.  The Central Bank was left with residual responsibility for stability of the financial system and various functions related to the European system of central banks.  Henceforth, the regulator was accountable to the Oireachtas and communicated directly with the Department of Finance.  The regulator also published a separate annual report.<\/p> <p>  The Central Bank was opposed to the changes, as they would essentially interdict the line of sight between financial stability and the soundness of the banks.  My personal view supported this evaluation and I also felt that the change was, to some extent at least, motivated by ideological considerations.  I was involved with the Governor and other board members in making representations to the Minister for Finance about it.  And, clearly, the 2008 crisis exposed the institutional flaws in this structure and it was reversed, as you know.  With the enactment of the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Act in 2003, I was reappointed to the board of the Central Bank but not to the authority.  Thus, I had no further involvement in supervision or regulation of the banks.<\/p> <p>  This change coincided with the advent of EMU, the financialisation of the global economy, a sea change in the volumes of financial transactions and the emergence of shadow banking.  One consequence of the liberalisation of capital markets was that large financial flows looking for investment outlets contributed to keeping real interest rates low worldwide.  The abundance of liquidity and low interest rates encouraged financial institutions and asset holders to try to increase the rate of return on their portfolios by increased leverage at the cost of higher risks.  The global financial crisis emanated from the conjunction of widespread financial fragility and a lopsided globalisation process proceeding rapidly amidst large financial imbalances.  A principles-based regulatory system was unsuitable for these circumstances, and the problem was compounded in the Irish case by competitive pressures associated with the presence of foreign banks regulated from outside the jurisdiction and also a remit to promote the financial services industry.  In a sense, it was like trying to control a blaze with a mixture of both water and oil.<\/p> <p>  It is manifestly the case now that supervision was neither effective nor appropriate but principle-based or light-touch regulation was not exclusively an Irish phenomenon.  It was derived from the ideas governing regulation generally in Europe and, indeed, internationally.  Almost certainly, the regulator subscribed to those ideas but did not originate them.  It is worth recalling that, in 2007, the IMF ranked Ireland&rsquo;s regulatory system highest in a study of accountability and independence in 32 countries.  The truth is that, notwithstanding the shortcomings of the Irish approach, regulatory policy was located in an international context that was deeply flawed.<\/p> <p>  The problem of assuming that self-interest &ndash; Adam Smith&rsquo;s invisible hand &ndash; would make people do the right thing was that it wasn't actually correct.  This is the flaw to which Alan Greenspan referred when he recanted his views about efficient markets before a US Congress committee in October of 2008.  He accepted that the pursuit of self-interest, however beneficial in the economy as a whole, does not necessarily lead to financial stability.  Unfortunately, Greenspan&rsquo;s conversion came too late.  Regulators elsewhere who followed the same set of beliefs had, for too long, taken a benign view of the banks and the risks they were taking.  In Ireland&rsquo;s case, this was reflected back to the assessments of macroeconomic stability by the Central Bank.  Financial stability reports did identify major vulnerabilities building up in the financial system leading to credit growth and indebtedness and house prices increases and increasing repayment burdens to the household sector, but these were located in a context where the banks were assessed to be generally sound, usually in accordance with the Basel II directive, which has subsequently found to be fairly flawed.<\/p> <p>  These assessments were also made in the context of the eurozone Stability and Growth Pact.  The Stability and Growth Pact failed in a number of ways to prevent deficit and debt, both public and private, problems arising within the euro area.  It was overly focused on current budget balances and not enough on the sustainability of member states&rsquo; public finances or underlying economic conditions.  In the case of Ireland and Spain, the criteria specified in the pact were consistently met even though the property markets were booming.<\/p><p>It is a matter of record also that neither the IMF nor the OECD were any more prescient.  As recently as 2006, the IMF financial assessment programme concluded in relation to Ireland that &quot;financial soundness and market indicators are generally very strong&quot;.  In the years when the crisis was incubating all the international agencies - the IMF, the OECD and the ECB - took a positive view of the performance of the Irish economy.  Earlier, in or around 2003, the European Commission disagreed with the Minister for Finance about budgetary policy but their case was undermined by the fact that Ireland was fully compliant with the Stability and Growth Pact while Germany and France were not.  In summary, the likelihood of a gradual adjustment dominated official thinking.  The soft landing hypothesis might have been possible up until the Lehman Brothers collapse but not afterwards.  We were seriously exposed in the banking sector and we didn't know it.  The risks to the economy were identified in the financial stability reports but they were qualified by assurances about the fundamental strength of the banks which were wrong.<br\/><br\/>Chairman, an earlier witness has told the inquiry that pre-crisis regulation was conducted within the paradigm of the great moderation.  The Great Moderation described the long period of macroeconomic calm which predated the crisis.  It held that, through policy alone, central banks had managed to create stable conditions of strong growth and low inflation.  The great moderation was constructed on three pillars, namely: first of all, the disinflationary influence of cheap Chinese manufactured exports; secondly, a cheap credit model; and, thirdly, the change in the balance of power between capital and labour consequent upon the growth of the global labour force by about 1.5 billion people following the demise of the Soviet Union and the decision of China to become capitalist by decree.  The thinking was that cheaper goods would increase purchasing power.  The decline in labour's share of national income due to the weakened collective bargaining position would exert a downward pressure on inflation and could be compensated for by the ready availability of cheap credit.<br\/><br\/>This paradigm was opposed by European and Irish trade union movement, which broadly remained committed to social, democratic ideas in politics and neo-Keynesian ideas in economics.  It was only to be expected that these competing paradigms would cause a degree of creative tension between me and some colleagues on the Central Bank board from time to time.  But by 2004 it became clear to me, as general secretary of congress, that the economy was heading in the wrong direction.  Our pre-budget submission of that year called for the removal of all property-based tax incentives.  By the following year, 2005, our pre-budget submission voiced concern about overheating in the economy in the following terms, &quot;Future economic policy should consider focusing on optimising economic growth rather than continuing the relentless pursuit of growth for growth's sake which has both economic and social down sides.&quot;  In  May 2005, congress made a detailed submission to the Department of Finance, arguing the case for the abolition of property tax incentive scheme.  And this theme of sustainable growth was covered in a speech I made to a social policy conference in UCD in October 2005, which I've actually furnished to you with the documents, Chairman.  It was a theme re-echoed in up to ten speeches and newspaper articles between 2005 and 2008.  It informed my contributions to the debates in the National Economic and Social Council and, indeed, the Central Bank and it was also the subject of representations made directly to the Minister for Finance at the time.<br\/><br\/>Mr. Chairman, you wrote to me on 26 May advising that a witness had named me in his evidence and I assume this relates to the following passage in his statement.  The statement was: <\/p><blockquote>\tIn fact, I should say that one member of the Board did have grave doubts about what was happening; his words ring in my ears to the effect that 'it was all a house of cards and would end in tears.'  However, his views appear not to have had any impact on policy-making in the Bank. <\/blockquote><p>Now, frankly, Chairman, I can't actually remember precisely that ... whether I made that statement or not, but I can confirm that I did alert the board to what I saw happening in the real economy.  I argued that what was happening in the construction sector was unsustainable because Irish people were borrowing to invest in buy-to-let houses built by immigrants who were then renting the same houses and it didn't take a genius to work out that a vicious circle with a huge vulnerability was being created.<br\/><br\/>I wish to turn now to the question of social partnership because the booklet of core documents sent to me contains a lengthy extract from the 2004 IMF review in respect of which I have submitted a supplementary opening statement.  I found it difficult to identify any causal relationship between social partnership and the banking crisis.  It seems to me that any adverse impact social partnership might have could only be in relation to fiscal policy.<\/p><p>The fact is that the Exchequer was in surplus for the five years preceding the crisis and Ireland&rsquo;s gross debt-to-GDP ratio was less than 25%, one of the lowest in the OECD area.  Ireland did not have a fiscal crisis up to that point; it had a banking crisis.  In so far as there is any link between social partnership and the 2008 crisis, it is a mitigating one.  According to Fritz Scharpf, who is the director of the Max Planck Institute for the Study of Societies in Cologne, the peripheral economies found no effective way to counteract domestic booms and were driven by the cheap money effect of uniform nominal and divergent real interest rates.  But he acknowledges that both Spain and Ireland did try to use the instruments of macroeconomic policy that were still available nationally, including social pacts to restrain the boom; it's just that they were insufficient.<br\/><br\/>Social partnership sometimes seem as a domestic Irish phenomenon but this is not so.  In 1985 an American academic, Peter Katzenstein, in a seminal work on industrial policy in the small open economies of Europe, attributed their success to systems of democratic corporatism.  Democratic corporatism is built on three pillars: a strong situation of peak organisations of both unions and employers, an ideology of social partnership and, thirdly then, a constant process of bargaining.  The small open economies of northern Europe that Katzenstein studied, essentially the Nordic countries excluding Finland and the Netherlands, realised that the cost of adjustment to international market forces could not be exported, as might be the case with a larger country.  You had to be internalised and the only way to manage the situation was to combine openness to trade with flexibility and high levels of social protection.  Internal disputes were an indulgence that could not be afforded.  The trade unions in Ireland were attracted to this approach in 1987 because it seemed like a workable alternative to the zero-sum game that industrial relations in Britain had become.  By history and culture, the Irish trade union movement is closely linked with Britain.  While the overall assessment of the IMF paper is positive, it is a fact that over the 22 years of its existence, some misconceptions have arisen from time to time about how social partnership operated.  Foremost amongst these, and it is mentioned in the IMF paper too, is that it undermines the powers of the Oireachtas.  In my experience, social partnership only ever subsisted within the space ceded to it by Government and this is especially true where coalition partners in the Government had negotiated a programme.  There is no evidence that this has been a problem in the other European countries where social partnership is the norm.  Where fiscal issues arose, no Government has ever made a specific commitment outside of the budgetary process.<br\/><br\/>With regard to competitiveness generally, an ESRI paper, McGuinness <i>et al<\/i>., 2010, found in a survey of 6,500 firms that social partnership agreements enhanced the country&rsquo;s competitiveness.  In particular, they stated &quot;This result suggests that there have been large gains, in terms of competitiveness, to [multinational companies] that locate in Ireland&quot; and this actually was the experience of the  ICT sector in Finland as well.  It is worth recalling too that the convergence criteria required for membership of EMU were managed within the social partnership process.  Not alone that, but the wage terms of the various agreements held, even where the economy was growing at rates exceeding 10% in circumstances of extremely tight labour markets and where labour&rsquo;s share of national income fell from 65% in 1990 to 56% in 2009.  The 2004 IMF paper advocates wage flexibility, short duration agreements and the incorporation of social partnership within a medium-term fiscal framework.  Now most of this was taken on board subsequently.  It is the case that a sophisticated system for dealing with employer inability to pay claim .... to pay ... inability to pay claims was dealt into the ... was built into the process, that worked by way of a panel of accounting experts, appointed by the Labour Relations Commission, which could be drawn upon by the Labour Court to assess the financial health of a firm claiming to be in difficulty.  And this operated, I think, in a broadly satisfactory manner.<br\/><br\/>The last of the agreements, Towards 2015, was a ten-year framework agreement with provisions for pay reviews on a two-yearly cycle, thus detaching the process from fiscal policy.  The other issue of concern raised in the IMF paper is the linking of tax concessions to pay agreements in the longer terms.  And, as it happens, I agree with the IMF on this point, but, perhaps, for different reasons.  When I became General Secretary of Congress in 2001, I started shifting away from the wage-tax trade offs and towards pay claims based on inflation and productivity.  The reason is that I wanted to try to get closer to the Nordic model where universally available, high-quality public services like, for example, child care are part of the social wage.<\/p><p>Having a high level of public service provision is crucial for low to middle income earners.  Wage activity alone will not create conditions of equality, or anything like it, for this cohort of the population.  Quality public services cannot be sustained by low levels of taxation.<\/p><p> Refined down to its core, the essential purpose of social partnership was to settle the distributional issues leaving Government the freedom to get on with the business of growing the economy.  My personal conviction is that it is not possible to successfully manage a small open economy without embedded institutions for managing distributional conflict.  Now, I think the truth of this is implicitly recognised in the recent report of the five EU presidents - that's Juncker, Dijsselbloem, Tusk, Draghi and Schulz - setting out a plan for strengthening EMU, published on 1 July.  It suggests that a common template for national competitiveness authorities to guide wage negotiations and to restrain wage divergence throughout the eurozone.<\/p><p> So, Chairman, we are now in our eighth year of wage restraint.  I cannot see that lasting indefinitely.  A combination of pent up wage pressures, competition between unions, free collective bargaining and a tightening labour market suggest to me that the kind of co-ordination proposed by the five presidents will be challenging outside of a framework allowing some harmonisation of social wage issues in addition to pay.<\/p><p> In terms of the cost of the crisis, the most significant learning for me out of this experience relates to how EMU actually worked in practice.  I did not expect that, in the event of an exogenous shock, and absent the facility to devalue the currency, that the whole burden of adjustment would fall on labour markets.  The Finns were better prepared as a labour movement than we were.  They used their collective agreement to negotiate buffer funds to cushion the impact of adjustment but then again such funds might have been raided to bail out the banks as the National Pensions Reserve Fund was raided.<\/p><p> Congress opposed austerity.  We feared it would lead to deflation and a Japanese-style slump.  We knew that fiscal consolidation would have to happen but we wanted it to be spread over a longer timescale, to 2017, in fact, and back-loaded, not front-loaded, to try to keep up domestic demand and let growth do some of the heavy lifting of adjustment.  We also wanted the consolidation to be more focused on tax measures than public service cuts and we campaigned for this approach under the banner, the better fairer way.  But would this have been better?  Well, Chairman, we really ... we don't know what the counter-factual is.<\/p><p> During the period when Ireland was a programme country, my colleagues and I met quarterly with the ECB-IMF-EU troika.  I have to say it was a dispiriting experience and utterly valueless, in my view.  My impression of the troika was one of an uncaring technocracy of neoliberal zealots devoid of empathy.  I exclude the IMF from this description.  They were more reasonable, which was a surprise to me because I had first-hand experience of IMF structural adjustment programmes in the developing world during the 1990s but we were able to establish a useful separate dialogue relationship with the IMF.<\/p><p> It is clear to me also that there is no social institution to balance the independence and power of the ECB.  An institution with the sole remit of price stability is not concerned with 26 million people out of work.  The remit of the ECB should be changed to reflect the same range of social and economic responsibilities as the Federal Reserve Board in the United States is.<\/p><p> The so-called Great Moderation, upon which so many incorrect assumptions about markets were based, turned out to be a chimera.  In his seminal work, The General Theory, Keynes wrote about the differences between risk and uncertainty.  Risk can be quantified and therefore mitigated - uncertainty cannot be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015072200002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Begg","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1437519600,"counter":13,"content":"<p>Mr Begg, we are over time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015072200002#G00200","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1437519600,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I'll just finish the last sentence, Chairman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015072200002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Begg"},{"type":"speech","time":1437519600,"counter":15,"content":"<p>Thank you very much.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015072200002#G00400","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1437519600,"counter":16,"content":"<p>Regulation in future must be aimed at minimising risk in the knowledge that uncertainty will always be with us.

By way of introduction, I referenced my period of office as director general of the Federation of Irish Employers from 1988 and as the first director general of IBEC in 1992.  I retired from IBEC in 2000.  At the beginning of 2000, I was appointed to the board of the IDA and subsequently in June to the position of chairman.  I was reappointed chairman in 2005 and retired in 2010.  I believe that my role within IBEC was a significant factor in my being asked to join the board of the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority and subsequently of the Central Bank.  My CV did not include any specific banking or financial experience but the challenges and successful outcomes of the creation of IBEC were, I believe, viewed as relevant and useful.  <\/p> <p>  The committee will note my retirement from IBEC in 2000.  I was appointed to the board of the Financial Regulator and the Central Bank as a non-executive director in 2003 and am therefore unable to comment, from an IBEC perspective, on any of the issues raised, other than social partnership to 2000, in the committee's terms of reference for my appearance before it.<\/p><p>I confirm that I advised the committee secretariat of the position immediately on my receipt of the committee's request for my participation in its work.<br\/><br\/>Initially, I wish to make a number of  general points.  Firstly, I have no interest in seeking to apportion responsibility and-or blame between the bank and the regulator.  Secondly, and in view of the comments made by another witness to the committee, I wish to assure members that I have never had any political affiliations and have acted completely independently in my participation in various public sector organisations.  Thirdly, I have never had any connection with banking or financial institutions or anything to do with property interests.  And, fourthly, I did not on any occasion discuss the business of the IDA within the CBSIA or<i>vice versa<\/i>other than to note some areas of overlapping interest.<br\/><br\/>I believe it's relevant to outline some of the issues which impacted on the work of the new organisation.  First of all, I believe there was a general consensus that emerged amongst authority members that the construct was flawed.  The regulator was set up as an independent entity, but, in certain key respects, had an umbilical cord back to the Central Bank.  It was housed in the bank; it had key services, notably HR and IT, provided to it by the bank; its remuneration were controlled by those of the bank; its budget was the subject of consultation with the bank and required the approval of the Minister of Finance.  Cost pressures arose from the operation of the levy which was shared 50% between the Central Bank and the industry and the staff of the regulator were mainly drawn from the Central Bank.  In these circumstances, the achievement of real operational independence was a major task.  From the bank's point of view, the main change was a loss of the direct contact in operational areas with financial institutions and its dependence on the regulator for key information critical to its financial analysis and policy formation.  And, of course, the new order created grey areas where both organisations may be said to have had overlapping responsibilities.<br\/><br\/>In addition to the above,. there were policy issues pulling in competing directions.  In particular, the enhanced consumer protection emphasis, whilst entirely worthy in the overall context, sat somewhat uneasily with prudential regulation and attracted attention and priority from it, particularly in the early stages.  There seemed some confusion, certainly externally, about the fundamental role prudential regulation had in the overall protection of consumer rights.  Another example was the bank's mandate for the development of the financial services sector and the lack of clarity, notwithstanding the good co-operation and operational MOU which existed between the bank and the regulator over who was responsible for what.<br\/><br\/>For all these reasons, the challenge of building the new body into an effective organisation was always going to be significant.  This challenge was made even more demanding for the regulator by the discontinuity caused by the loss of its initial CEO after only three years, and two years later, of its chairman, and, of course, by the scale of the crisis, which later developed internationally and domestically.<br\/><br\/>I turn now to the regulatory system.  A critical issue which the committee has heard about <i>ad nauseam <\/i>from previous witnesses and which was fundamental to all that subsequently transpired was the choice of regulatory system.  It is not my intention to rehearse all the points already made but I believe it is relevant that, at the formation of the new structure, I can recall no challenge to the adoption by the regulator of that principle-based system.  It was, in fact, already in use by the Central Bank.  It was consistent with attitudes to good regulation here at the time and it was in widespread use internationally.  Specific rules were always part of the system, and these were added to over time as a result of EU and domestic decisions.  The Financial Regulator laid out clearly that under the system of the ... under the system, that proper management and control of a financial services provider and the integrity of its systems rested with the board of directors and its senior management and specified the nature of the monitoring checks and inspections that the regulator would undertake.  There is now no gainsaying, in the light of what happened, that the original principles<i>cum<\/i>rules based system was not adequate and, in any event, had not been implemented intensively or intrusively enough.  Regulatory systems internationally have now been completely revamped since the crisis.  Intensive and intrusive regulation is now the order of the day.  The actions of the banks have ensured that this must be the case.<\/p><p>However it is, I believe, also appropriate to acknowledge the very real concern that actions or opinions which might have been taken or expressed by the regulator or the bank could have had unattended consequences - specifically, that they could precipitate the outcomes in relation to the banking system or the property market which the regulator the bank were seeking to prevent.  Even although, with the benefit of hindsight, its clear that much more could and should have been done, these concerns were material in discussions at the time, particularly when the consensus amongst domestics and international commentators was for a soft landing.  <\/p><p> I've been of the view that the international dimension has not been given sufficient weight in the various inquiries and reports into the crisis and its genesis.  In my responses to the Honohan and Nyberg investigations, I raised these international issues and the passage of time has not altered the views I expressed to these bodies.  I still believe there was a possibility that, without the international financial crisis which engulfed us in 2008, a \"soft landing\", defined as a 20% or even slightly greater reduction in property prices from the peak, might have occurred.  The problems in liquidity across the financial markets changed the situation fundamentally.  Other witnesses to the committee have, I believe, made the correct connection between the crisis in liquidity, dramatically caused by the Lehman's situation, and the resultant, to all intents and purposes, closure of the wholesale markets and the onset of the spectre of insolvency, pending fresh injections of capital.  The capital requirements, which most commentators, both internal and external, believed were adequate in the pre-Lehman scenario, were proved inadequate  once the failure of Lehman's happened.  All of this was compounded by the almost immediate onset of the recession internationally.<\/p><p> There are three issues, which have been covered in previous testimony, on which my own views as a member of both boards and as a member of the budgets and remuneration committee of the regulator and the bank may be helpful.  On the issue of contrarian views, I know of no instances were at board authority or committee levels, there was any attempt to shut down such views.  I am not privy to issues of this kind if there were any arising below board or authority levels.<\/p><p> On the issue of resources, it is a fact that there were cost pressures at work.  Within the Central Bank board, the Department of Finance representative, in particular, had quite properly a continue ... continuing interest in this area.  So too had the consultative panels.  In this context, the procedures of the regulator's budget and remuneration committee, known as the BRC, are important to appreciate.  The committee received a draft budget from the executive, compiled from detailed discussion within the various divisions of the regulator.  The proposals were then the subject of rigorous examination by the committee, and discussion between it and the executive.  The outcome was the subject of agreement between the two parties.  That outcome was always subject to the requirement that the agreed budget was sufficient for an organisation to carry out its functions and mandate in an efficient and cost effective manner.  I was always satisfied that this procedure was sufficiently rigorous to ensure that adequate resources were in place to allow staff to perform the tasks that were asked of them under the system in place at the time.  However, as mentioned in other testimony, despite the best efforts of the authority, a full complement of agreed numbers was never reached.  <\/p><p> Finally, in regard to the operation of the authority in the Central Bank board, as a non-executive director, I believe both operated well and to their respective remits.  I agree that, although a number of the non-executive directors had significant banking and-or financial skills and experience, there was a case for more specialist input.  This lack of such expertise was perhaps a hindrance in the ability of the authority to engage fully with the executive in the detailed way that was necessary, particularly as regards the interrogation of credit risk data and the proper interpretation of such data.  The main lack, however, was that the authority should have pushed the executive much more forcefully for outcomes in the preface ... in the face of prolonged obfuscation from some institutions. <\/p><p> I now address the lines of inquiry indicated by the committee.  Appropriateness of the macroeconomic and prudential policy - during the period in question the Government was generally following a pro-cyclical economic policy.  There was significant growth, continuing over a prolonged period, and claims from many quarters for actions whose efforts would have been ... whose effects would have been to further fuel expansionary tendencies.  Low interest rates, a major problem for Ireland, were a function of the ECB.  Against this background, the macroeconomic and prudential policies advocated by the Central Bank, and which formed an important conditioning environment for the regulator, whilst cautionary, were generally optimistic.<\/p><p>Overall these policies, whilst recognising and publically pointing to a variety of risks, nevertheless consistently pointed to a soft landing.  The vehicle used was through the Central Bank's financial stability reports.  Here the bank was confronted by the dynamic I mentioned in the introduction to this opening statement, that of triggering events which it was actually seeking to prevent.<\/p><p> Final editing of the reports was undertaken by the Governor of the bank and were nuanced to reduce the risk of unintended consequences but without changing their substance.  In hindsight, it's clear that from 2005 to 2006 onwards the policies being pursued were not appropriate to the situation which was developing and understated the underlying risks in the growth of credit and related matters.  Measures such as increased capital requirements were taken by the regulator but were not sufficient.<\/p><p> Nature and effectiveness of the operational implications of the macroeconomic and prudential policy - overall, the thrust of the financial stability reports was that the banking system was sound.  They acknowledged that while there were significant risks in relation to certain key areas the capital position of the system as a whole and of individual banks was at a level which could cope with these concerns.  In his evidence, the then Governor outlined the range of considerations which, in the banks view, would keep the situation under control.  He also set out a number of factors which subsequently altered the scenario originally envisaged and rendered the actions made inadequate.  With hindsight, it is clear much stronger action was needed.<\/p><p> Appropriateness of the expert advice sought, quality analysis of the advice and how effectively the advice was used - throughout my period of office, a range of external consultancy advice was sought to augment resources.  Those in which I was most involved were the Mazars report on business process, resource benchmarking and the efficient use of resources and the PwC report commissioned in the aftermath of the September 2008 guarantee into the position of the main banks at that time.  In both these cases, it was clearly appropriate that such advice be sought.  In the Mazars case, issues around resource levels and allocation and the possibilities for a greater effectiveness were, I believe, self-evident from the earlier discussion relating to staffing levels in the regulator.  The quality of the exercises was, I believe, at a high level, relevant and based on sound analysis.  The overall conclusion was that resources were adequate for the system in use.  In so far as the PwC exercise was concerned, this was largely necessary in the light of the guarantee.  PwC had a large team working on the issues involved.  I've no reason to believe that the assignment was carried out in anything but an extremely professional manner.  However, the outcome, notwithstanding many caveats, was that the banks were at that specific point in time adequately capitalised, and that they would continue to be in the short to medium term.  This conclusion was relied upon by the regulator as a key indicator of the health of the system at that time.  The detailed views of the bank and the regulator on the PwC report was supplied to the Minister for Finance.<\/p><p> Assessment of what has been done, work in progress and what remains outstanding, etc. - since I retired from any association with the regulator-bank in July 2010, I cannot really comment under this heading.<\/p><p> Cost of the crisis and sharing of the impact - I accept the estimate of the cost of the crisis made by the current Governor of the Central Bank.  The indirect costs are impossible to calculate in financial detail at this stage, but perhaps of more importance are the social implications of the crisis and the acute personal distress which so many people have endured.  It's not clear to me what alternatives existed domestically for sharing the impact of the crisis consistent with the need to restore soundness to the financial system and to promoting renewed growth in the economy, with its vital social consequence of rebuilding employment levels.<\/p><p> Role and influence of the ECB - this is clearly an issue of substance but I can add little to the sum of knowledge already available.  The political issues continue to be the subject of debates.<\/p><p> And, finally, options for burden-sharing - the options under this heading have also been the subject of intense debate.  It seems correct that all practical options be considered, and I believe this occurred.  Again, these are matters which are primarily in the political domain and which I understand are still being actively pursued.<\/p><p> Finally, I should say that I fully acknowledge that whilst I contributed to the best of my ability to the regulatory authority and to the board of the bank, in hindsight key issues were missed and I shall be ever mindful of the consequences of this.  As mentioned earlier, the damage caused to the social fabric of the nation and to individuals has been immense and is a matter of enormous personal regret.

So I mean, I was aware generally speaking that yes, that was happening.  A lot of the discussion that took place between ourselves, my delegation and the Minister, was concerned about, sort of, some longer-term strategic issues, pensions being one of them, but also about how you might go about creating some kind of stimulus to the economy with a view to getting people back into employment - you remember that the construction industry, for instance, had been particularly badly hit.  I think we had about 286,000 people working in the construction industry and that had really been decimated at that point in time.  We were quite anxious to try to get to some point where we could have investment in infrastructure that might, you know, ameliorate the condition in the construction industry particularly.

One is from the Wright report and it's under the heading there - whether income was a cause.  Just a mid-paragraph analysis.<\/p> <blockquote> \tWage settlements accelerated markedly from the late 90s, in absolute and in relative terms. The &quot;trilateral&quot; wage agreements continued but became less relevant as workers negotiated supplementary wage increases against the background of full employment and an overheating economy.  Compensation per employee, which had grown more or less in line with the euro area average until 1996, increased at two to three times the euro area average from 1997 to 2008.  In nominal terms, annual gross wages in Ireland in 2007 were the highest in the euro area except Luxembourg.  Ireland had also the highest price level in the euro area according to Eurostat statistics.  Competitiveness deteriorated significantly. <\/blockquote> <p>That's from Regling and Watson.<\/p><p>On the next column below it there, and I'll just take the mid-paragraph out of that, it says:<\/p> <blockquote> \tBut budgetary policy veered more toward spending money while revenues came in. In addition, the pattern of tax cuts left revenues increasingly fragile, since they were dependent on taxes driven by the property sector and by high consumer spending. Ireland was also unusual in having tax deductibility for mortgages, and significant and distortive subsidies for commercial real estate development, yet no property tax. <\/blockquote> <p>Now, the premise that could be presented by these statements is that social partnership was a win-win for everybody and everybody was going to get something out of the pot.  But that, in reality, the pot wasn't big enough to accommodate everybody's needs and there wasn't enough in there and eventually it would come asunder.  The ... those five reports are quite critical of the social partnership model to all parties associated, not just workers, but business and all the rest.  How would you respond to those criticisms, do you think that they're valid, or that they're inaccurate or would you like an opportunity to address the criticisms that have been raised in those reports, Mr. Begg?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015072200002#S00900","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1437519600,"counter":242,"content":"<p>Well, I would reject them quite frankly.  First of all, I think, in terms of wage movements, that wage movements only tracked inflation over the period of those agreements and inflation was running at around 4.5% on average.  And that was against the cost of living situation, which was 29% higher than the European Union average.  So I don't think that there was anything, kind of, irrational or immoderate about all of that and I think the significant thing actually is that the wage agreements held in circumstances of very tight labour markets at a time when the economy was growing at over 10%.  I mean, it's very easy with the detached people to take a critical view of something like that.  But I very well remember the first serious crisis I had to deal with as General Secretary of the congress was when I took over in 2001 when the secondary teachers had actually left the congress of trade unions at that time, over disagreements essentially with congress about what the levels of pay should be and about moderation.  And if I may, for a second, just quote to you a statement made by the president of SIPTU at an ICTU conference at that stage, which encapsulates this and which precipitated that great difficulty for me.  He said, in relation to the aspirations of people, particularity in the teaching profession at the time, and I quote him now.  He said:<\/p> <blockquote> \tYou don&rsquo;t live on the moon. Don&rsquo;t expect that private sector workers are going to sit back and see you going in for your special, and your other special and your other special, plus the other national pay agreements and say, &quot;That&rsquo;s grand. We don&rsquo;t notice&quot;.  Survival into the next millennium is entirely dependent on our ability to manage success effectively.  We mustn't take our eye off the ball of social wage.  If we descend into mere sectionalism, if we descend into the worst form of dog-eat-dog capitalism, because that is what it is, the strong will succeed and the poor will go to the wall. <\/blockquote> <p>Now, that wasn't me.  That was said before I went in but I think it does demonstrate a very responsible, long-term view about what the trade union movement was trying to achieve.  The other thing I would say, Chairman, in relation to it as well is that this was at a time when significant productivity improvements were taking place in Ireland.  Ireland was about 30% ahead of the EU in terms of the rate of increase or productivity.  And it was happening also at a time when that was taking place while labour share of national income actually drifted down by about 10% in the period between 1990 and 2009.

And the position of IBEC, far be it for me to speak for IBEC, but I'm just recalling what the position was, that IBEC stayed in the agreement for much longer after the collapse of those talks because they hoped that it could be kept going.

What I think happened, actually, was this: if you reflect back on that period of time, around 2006 there was a, sort of, a tapering off which appeared to suggest, you know, that the cooling off was actually happening in the economy.  There was a lot of concern publicly about this, in political circles and so on, a lot of commentary on it, and then suddenly the whole thing started to rev up again, right.  But then, in 2007, it began to taper off again.  So the initial, sort of, shock, I suppose, that the construction sector was in cooling was, kind of, assuaged a little bit by the trend ... the second part of that trend.  And I think that's what probably gave rise to the assurances about the soft landing or the conviction that the soft landing would actually happen.  But I want to be at pains to say that my personal thinking is that this all has to be located in the context of what was the international orthodoxy at the time.  And my feeling is - just to finish on this point very quickly - I mean, the epitome of that was Greenspan going before the US congressional committee and saying, \"There's a flaw.  I didn't think there was a flaw, but there is a flaw\".

It represents the broad spectrum of business.  And we would have to say that ... I can only speak up to the period of 2000 but up to that point, I have no doubt that the social partnership process in the round was beneficial to everybody in the country, including employees, people on social welfare benefits, because it raised all the boats around the place, maybe not at the same level but by and large, I've no doubt that for those ... for that period of time it was beneficial across the board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015072200002#AA00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Dunne"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1437519600,"counter":463,"content":"<p>Sorry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015072200002#AA00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Begg"},{"type":"speech","time":1437519600,"counter":464,"content":"<p>Deputy Higgins?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015072200002#AA00700","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1437519600,"counter":465,"content":"<p>Now, from my point of view, you know, social partnership was a critical engagement.  It's ... it doesn't mean that everybody thinks and acts exactly the same.  As I explained earlier on, we were following a model which is prevalent in the small open economies of northern Europe, and which goes back, actually, to the 1930s and it's based on a belief that, look, if you are a small, open economy and you're trying to survive the ravages of international markets, you basically ... the best way to try and do that is to be as flexible as possible, to engage with the economic conditions at the time, with appropriate social protections for the population at large.  I would never contend that social partnership reached its apotheosis at any stage while I was there, in the sense of protecting those people.  The point you make is quite right, that these conditions regarding housing and so on were very, very difficult, and as a matter of fact, again I refer back to that speech I made in 2008, and I ask you just to have a look at it in close detail again, because it deals with a lot of these questions and it did particularly draw attention to the need to focus on, you know, four or five or six critical objectives that were necessary in order to protect people, affordable housing being one of them.  And there's a very strong critique in that speech about the difficulties of trying to make the affordable housing agency work so that ordinary working people who couldn't afford to take part in this property bubble would actually have the opportunity to get a house.  And, as I explained earlier on, sure I experienced this myself in my own family, where members of my family had to go living 60 miles away from where they worked and, you know, look, it didn't work, that didn't work, I don't mind admitting that, but we definitely made a strong attempt to make something like that work.  And at the end of the day, and this is my last point, Chair, sorry, I'll finish up on it, I won't say another word about this, but going back to the era of young Jim Larkin in 1916, young Jim made a speech at one stage when he was dealing with a considerable amount of wage militancy in the ... in the trade union movement at the time, and he said, as simple as this: \"What do we do about poor hospitals?  Ask for more wages.  What do we do about poor housing?  Ask for more wages.  What do we do about unemployment?  Ask for more wages.  What do we do with underemployment?  Ask for more wages.\"  He was pointing out that you need a much more holistic approach, including the social wage, to protect people.  And that's the difference here we see today.  Like, we're now the recipients of a model from Germany, which appears here as hard-nosed neoliberalism.  It doesn't appear that way in Germany because it is located in the context of a social market economy in Germany, where German citizens have access to all of these public services at a level that saves them quite a lot on their basic income.  So that's what we were trying to do.  We never got the model perfect, you know, and probably we won't at this stage, for obvious reasons, but I think it was a good thing to do and it is the right thing to do and as I indicated in my earlier evidence, I believe that's the way the country should go again in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015072200002#AA00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Begg"},{"type":"speech","time":1437519600,"counter":466,"content":"<p>Okay, I'm going to bring matters to a conclusion, unless there's any other final comment you like to make by means of closure, Mr. Dunne and Mr. Begg?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015072200002#AA00900","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1437519600,"counter":467,"content":"<p>No, thank you.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015072200002#AA01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Begg"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1437519600,"counter":468,"content":"<p>No, thank you.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015072200002#AA01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Dunne"},{"type":"speech","time":1437519600,"counter":469,"content":"<p>Okay, thank you.

I would like to say that I'm happy to be here today to answer your questions and hopefully give you my personal perspective, as someone who came back to Ireland from abroad in 2007, commencing in EBS in 2008 and spent four years leading and making the changes necessary to enable EBS to get through the crisis.  Chairman, I've submitted a detailed written statement, but if convenient, I'll just take a few minutes now to make some opening remarks.  By way of background, I've spent most of my career in international or European banks, including 14 and a half years in Rabobank, working in a variety of roles in treasury and capital markets, corporate banking, general management etc., including head of global treasury for Rabobank International across 44 countries and CEO of Rabobank in Asia.  Prior to working for Rabobank, I worked for BNP Paribas for five years and before that, the KBC bank, the Belgian bank.  I became CEO of EBS on 14 January 2008, joining the board in February 2008.  I'm currently director of corporate and institutional banking at AIB, having held a number of roles on the leadership team and the executive committee of AIB over the last four years, including director of transformation and group services, which is the portfolio responsible for the majority of change management and the restructuring of the group.<\/p> <p>  On taking up the role in EBS in 2008, I was highly conscious of the sub-prime crisis in the US, as I'd spent some time there in late 2007 in a role that allowed me to view the property industry closely and had developed a growing sense of the challenges confronting that industry in the US.  I also, through my Rabobank experience, had a strong recall of the property correction that took place in the Netherlands in the early noughties, when property prices reduced by about 20% causing some stress in the economy.  My view at the time, as an interested observer, was that there certainly were challenges ahead in the Irish economy, as it had grown so strongly in the prior decade.  Property prices had risen substantially and it was noticeable on coming home how much prices had increased generally.  My view at the time was that property prices in Ireland needed to, and probably would correct by about 20%.  Something similar to the Dutch experience which, although a difficult correction in their economy, had been manageable.  So my sense of the challenges ahead did not drown out my overall positivity, indeed my pride at taking over at the helm of a financial institution in my home country, an organisation with a strong heritage and tradition in Ireland that, like Rabobank, which I'd worked in for so long, was a member organisation.  The mutual model in UK and Ireland is very similar to the co-operative banking model in continental Europe both owned by the membership and in existence to serve the membership base.  EBS had been a positive force in Irish banking and financial services for decades since its foundation by Alex McCabe and a small group of teachers and trade unionists working together to help each other to buy their family homes in ... from 1935 and I was looking forward to the challenge of leading it through the upcoming challenging period and contributing to its continued modernisation and ultimate growth.<\/p> <p>  I understood at the time that one of the reasons I'd been selected to lead EBS was my international background, outside of Ireland banking experience and my capital markets experience.  I had been deeply involved in a number of financial crises around the world.  For example, I was in Indonesia in 1997 during the worst of the financial crisis in Asia leading a triage team to stabilise the Rabobank balance sheet in Indonesia.  That was just shortly before the collapse of the Suharto regime.  The EBS chairman, who himself had only taken up the role recently at the time I joined, was a modernising and progressive force and he had been ... he had given me a mandate to bring the organisation forward, look at the operating model and structure in order to create the best possible future for the organisation and its membership.  As part of my own due diligence before joining, I did query the EBS exposure to commercial real estate and land and development sectors and was given comfort that although there were some challenges, overall the book was in okay condition.<\/p> <p>  However, only weeks into my tenure, there were external and internal signs of stress in the local markets.  Linking some up ... linking up some of the dots, in terms of my recent and past experience, I commenced a programme of retrenchment and risk containment, which unfortunately would be the dominant activity carried out in EBS during my tenure.  For example, I reversed existing plans to create a commercial property subsidiary to enable the growth and the potentially separate funding of the commercial property business, which had envisaged growing the book by circa 50% to 100%, depending upon future market conditions and opportunities.  I also initiated a withdrawal from land and development lending within four months of taking office and a withdrawal from commercial property lending within six months of taking office.  I addressed the funding and liquidity challenges by accelerating plans to create a covered bond bank, which is a very important structure to enable term funding in the debt capital markets by banks and building societies.  We commenced a further balancing of the funding structure and profile of this society by putting a huge focus on the growth of retail deposits.  EBS actually grew its retail deposits by circa &euro;2 billion through the crisis, a notable feat when compared with the exodus of retail deposits from other institutions during this period.  This particular action helped to stabilise the society and along with the actions on exiting commercial property and land and development finance and other actions, lessened the ultimate amount of capital that the organisation eventually required.  I would estimate conservatively that the risk containment activities of that first month period ... first six-month period, resulted in at least &euro;750 million of capital savings for EBS.  I reviewed the basic management operating model of the society, which unfortunately wasn't fit for purpose, and I followed up by making essential changes to ensure better governance and separation of duties.  For example, there had been no independent CRO function and the risk function reported to the finance director.<\/p> <p>  Within three months of me joining EBS, Bear Stearns went bust.  Within six and a half months of me joining, Lehman's went bust and about a week later, the Irish Government guarantee came in to place.  I learned of the CIFS legislation from a quick phone call with my chairman early on the morning of 30 September.  Neither I nor EBS had any involvement in the deliberations in the period prior to this on potential guarantees or actions.  And I was a little surprised by the decision, when I read about it that morning.  EBS had lost some institutional and international funds and deposits and we were concerned with developments but we were certainly not in a fraught position.  After the guarantee date, as it is well documented, the Irish economy, property prices and the international backdrop continued to decline through the back-end of 2008 and all of 2009.  It was more than apparent that the legacy of the '03-'07 period, whereby EBS, like many other institutions, had built up an unsustainable position in commercial property and land and development finance, a large buy-to-let exposure and built a liability structure that proved fragile, was having a profound effect.  However, it is interesting to note that in early 2010, the international backdrop started to improve and it was felt that after PCAR 2010, the worst was over and international markets were recovering.  Most Irish commentators, including the Governor of the Central Bank and the Minister for Finance, publicly observed that the worst of the crisis was over, something I was also positive about.  However, the commencement of the Greek crisis put paid to that and Ireland found itself again at the centre of a rapidly deteriorating international and local environment.  Those days were extremely challenging, as liquidity, credit quality, capital adequacy and economic confidence continued to decline, leading to the troika bailout.<\/p> <p>  I ensured we at EBS worked cohesively with all Government and other stakeholders to stabilise the system and EBS.  I approached every meeting with the starting point that whatever was best for the sovereign was probably the best for EBS, acknowledging that EBS, although an important financial institution with a strong market share in a number of areas and a brand that was less damaged than most financial institutions, was not systemically important in the same way as AIB or Bank of Ireland and that therefore, the solution for EBS may be different to the solution for one of the pillar banks.<\/p><p>As CEO, I was going to ensure that the mindset in EBS was open to any practical solution or proposal, including demutualisation, takeover of the society, etc.  It was easier for me to have that frame of mind, in that I could be objective on past performance and strategy, in that I wasn't part of it. <\/p><p> Throughout the period, I continued to lead significant improvements in governance and operational controls in EBS, continued to lend sensibly into the residential housing marketplace and improved ... and more conservatively lent and, as mentioned earlier, grew the deposit base.  A quick example of the sensible and risk-focused approach is reflected in the volume of residential lending conducted in my time in EBS.  This lending was covered 1.7 times by retail deposits, ensuring a secure and locked down conservative approach.  Throughout the crisis, I estimate that I spent about 60% of my time on strategic work around working out the long-term future of EBS, onshore merger-takeover, offshore merger-takeover, demutualisation, privatisation, acquisition by private equity etc.  We worked on a number of parallel projects all at the one time.  All of this worked culminated with a preferred bidder being selected in February 2012 after 11 months of detailed due diligence and engagement.  This transaction was terminated on 28 March 2011 and EBS was informed that it was being merged into AIB on 30 March 2011.  The success of that merger is, I think, evident in the positive restructuring, stabilisation and return to profitability of the enlarged group over the last four years.  <\/p><p> I believe the Irish banks are well on the road to a full recovery.  Huge lessons have been learnt within the banking sector and within the regulatory system.  Indeed, lessons have been learnt right across the economic and political landscape.  I hope my testimony today can add additional insight into your understanding of the crisis, Chairman.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015072200002#EE00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fergus Murphy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1437519600,"counter":480,"content":"<p>Thank you very much, Mr. Murphy.

I think the commencement of the crisis, ultimately, had its origins in the international landscape.  What was happening globally ... and I'll probably simplify the illustration just to keep it as tight as I can, but ... and it's often talked about in the context of the US and China, but it's not just the US and China, it's the East and the West, but I'll just talk about the US and China for a moment.  We were in a long boom, it was thought, that could be a 30-year boom, because of the improvements in technology and the productivity of the western world.  The US was importing a huge amount of Chinese goods.  Okay, it's not just China and the US, but, as I say, just take that example.  They were paying for those goods in dollars.  They were very large consumers.  The Chinese took those dollars and they churned them back into the western world, for example, buying significant amounts of US treasuries.  One country had a deficit, one country had a surplus; one country was an importer, one country was an exporter.  And there was a virtuous symbiotic relationship between the East and the West in terms ... and I use, again, the US and China, maybe unfairly, just as the best example, where deficits in the West were being funded by, often, moneys coming in from the East.  <\/p> <p>  Now, Ireland then was a little beta stock and, literally, at the epicentre of this either geographically or economically, and when I say a beta stock, I mean, you know, a stock or a country that moves disproportionately up or down to a certain event.  We had had an enterprise economy and a virtuous economy up to 2003.  Then we started, obviously, investing too much in property and property became a too large contributor to our GDP.  We were buying and selling property to each other and thinking we were adding real value.  So when this influx of liquidity across the world churning around was taking place we received, and our financial institutions received, more of that liquidity than we should have and it meant that Irish banks were able to go to the wholesale markets in a way that they never were before.  For example, in 1998, the EBS balance sheet was 100% funded by retail deposits.  When I took over in 2008, it was 26% funded by retail deposits.  So what had happened in the interim was the effect of what I was just describing.  <\/p> <p>  So you have this ... you had both push and pull factors.  You had this global activity taking place, which meant that, for example, in the US, because there was so much liquidity, banks were able, and financial institutions and asset managers, in general, to structure poorly put together assets, because there was so much liquidity sloshing around and investors wanting to invest that liquidity, that they wanted some kind of a yield.  So you had the formation of the sub-prime crisis in the US, with badly-structured assets soaking in the liquidity.  Similarly in Ireland, the liquidity got soaked into the property marketplace in a similar way as it did in the US in the sub-prime mortgage marketplace.  And so, a combination of the two yielded, unfortunately, the environment that we entered into and the shock and cliff-like environment that took place soon thereafter.  But, in my view, the origins of the crisis was the global activity.  We were badly prepared and badly set up for it, because of what happened in Ireland and the policies and practices, the way the banks had been run, the way, probably, the economy had been run.  But the origin was the international piece, and then we were a beta stock, if I could use that analogy.  When economists and experts were looking around the world for the likely red hotspots in terms of where this might happen first and what the effect could be, we did, unfortunately, stand out like a sore thumb.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015072200002#FF00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fergus Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1437519600,"counter":485,"content":"<p>So do you disagree with Mr. Nyberg who said that the crisis was primarily homegrown?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015072200002#FF00700","speaker":"1160"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1437519600,"counter":486,"content":"<p>I think that, ultimately, we built our economy.

That's what you would expect, that's what they're paid for, but I do feel I should say that.  So, I'm setting the tone from the top, I'm setting the new strategy, I'm relaying the risk appetite - what we're willing to do in the future, what we're not willing to do.  I'm making those big changes in terms of direction, and those levers.  The execution then clearly of the activities in a granular way through the society - it's not as big as a Bank of Ireland or AIB but it's still a large organisation - is taking place through the teams and through the executive team and the senior management and I think, though, I was able to bring a perspective to bear, which clearly shows a significant change in direction from almost hitting the ground, and I would feel good about that and I would feel that was what my role was about.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015072200002#HH00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fergus Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1437519600,"counter":535,"content":"<p>Mr. Murphy, on page six, half way down your opening statement you say on the third bullet pointon the second number of bullet points:<\/p> <blockquote> \t<b>Pursued strategy of managing down commercial book<\/b>: To aid this process, I employed a number of commercial property lending professionals, closed regional lending offices and improved controls by consolidating operations into a more centralised operation.   <\/blockquote> <p>Could you just expand upon that, and I want to give you a little bit of background?

Again, just as I summarised quickly earlier on, in 1998 100% of the liability base of EBS was retail deposits.  Retail deposits, typically, will stay with an organisation unless there's a significant issue with the organisation.  That lack of stability in the liability base was a fundamental issue and that is similar to every other institution in Ireland and many abroad and it talks to the discussion we were having on ... having earlier on with Senator D'Arcy in terms of what was happening internationally.  On the asset side of the balance sheet, again EBS had built that &euro;1.7 billion of land and development and commercial property financing, which was too much for an organisation its size.  It also had a commercial buy-to-let portfolio of about &euro;500 million or so on top of that.  It had entered into the tracker mortgage marketplace, in fairness not to the extent of some other institutions, it had a buy-to-let business and profile.  And so therefore the riskiness and the growth of the asset side of the balance sheet and the riskiness of it in the context of its components, was not suitable to a building society which should, at its very heart and ethos, be very conservative, prudential, given the fact that a building society, for example, can't raise capital in the same way as a bank can in the international markets and also the heritage and ethos and ownership.

That means that, with an international insurance company, EBS was insuring its book, so that the first loss on the book up to a particular attachment point, and I'll explain that in a moment, is taken by the insurance company.  So, for example, if the attachment point is 85% LTV, loan-to-value, then the first 15% loss is for the account of the insurance company.  In principle, that was the approach by the society.  And that was an effort by the society to protect its capital and to protect its members.  When EBS was talking about 100% mortgages, in the same way as other banks were, they, at least, were apportioning this insurance, or they had this insurance against those mortgages.  But in terms of looking at 100% mortgages, No. 1, I wouldn't agree with them, and I did away with them, and in the second half of 2008 LTVs, loan-to-values, and debt service coverage ratios, called DSCRs, and NDIs, net disposable income ratios, were all commenced and started to be moved down.  And during my tenure there were nine formal changes to the credit policy of the organisation, which reflects the credit appetite, and each of those nine formal changes brought the credit appetite more conservative, and tightened the appetite.  Interestingly, Senator, if I might say, during the period before I joined, for the six years before I joined, there were 13 changes to the credit appetite, or to the credit policy, and they were all increasing the credit appetite and loosening standards.  In terms of 100% LTV mortgages, given that I don't agree with them, but given that they were in place, the most important point in evaluating them is the affordability of the customer in relation to the loan they're drawing down.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015072200002#KK00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fergus Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1437519600,"counter":585,"content":"<p>What was Haven Mortgages?

There needs to be very strict limits around, maximum tenors and maturities.  There needs to be strict discipline and rules around the make-up of the liability base, the components of it, making sure that the organisation has a good mix of liabilities, and that the duration of the liabilities of the organisation matches, inasmuch as it can, the asset duration.  It's not possible to match them directly and typically, assets will have a longer duration than liabilities.

But I think you need a certain quotient, or a quorum, or a percentage of your board that have a very strong financial background, be it in insurance or be it in banking, because it is a different business to lots of other businesses.  If I could for a moment, you know ... if you sell a banking product to a customer, ironically and usually, that product stays on the bank's balance sheet for five, ten, 15 or 20 years.  If I sell cheese, or if I sell shoes, or if I sell whatever, once I sell it, it's gone.  Now, if it wasn't a good piece of cheese, the customer will come back and say to me, \"It wasn't very good\" and they may not buy anymore cheese from me again.  But it's very different.  You sell something to somebody but it stays on your balance sheet, so that's a different industry with a different rigour around it.  It's actually quite a complex industry and, therefore, I believe having financial services background and experience would be very, very important.<\/p> <p>  However, I think it's also very important to have people on the board of the Central Bank, or any other bank, that can bring a wide perspective outside of banking because one of the challenges and one of the, again, valid criticisms of banking is that we became so insular and so micro around the importance of banking that one could have forgotten what was actually happening in the real economy.  And so having people with strong economic background and people with strong governance background and some people with expertise from sectors outside of banking would be the right mix.

Earlier testimony here has, kind of, brought two issues to the fore: the separation of banks and bankers as being two different entities, and the concept, or the discussion earlier, that something like &euro;140 billion has been paid in fines by financial institutions post-crisis, which would indicate that there is still behavioural aspects that are of concern.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015072200002#QQ01400","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1437519600,"counter":778,"content":"<p>Chairman, I think that is a very good point and I think that, again, taking a step back, banks got way ahead of themselves.  They became extremely arrogant as a global sector and there's been, again, many lessons learned and many things have gone wrong, locally and internationally - fines of billions of euros being paid by banks around the world for misconduct of various types.  They do say - it's a little trite - you know, that culture eats strategy for breakfast.  I think it's true though, and if you build the bank around the right behaviours, which takes time, if you inculcate those behaviours steadily and consistently in the organisation, if the leadership of the organisation, starting at the board, are role models and are looking to do the right thing, if they call out good behaviours and they call out bad behaviours consistently - and that is the central mission for the board and for the management - I do believe we can continue to bring financial services, globally and locally, back into a more respectable space.  It's going to take multiple years and efforts and attempts, but that's the mission that we are all on now.  So, in that context, setting the required standards, having a meritocratic environment where people are performance managed in a fair but tough way; ensuring that conduct risk is at the very centre of the discussions again that take place around the top table.  Again, it's easier to have those discussions when you've an independent CRO reporting both in to the board and in to the chief executive, conduct risk being the ... ensuring that the bank is doing the right thing by the customer; that they're making every effort to sell them the right kind of product at the right time; that the customer's eligible for that product; and that the customer can afford that product etc., etc.<\/p> <p>  That concept of conduct risk wasn't there ten years ago.  It's a new phenomenon and if we build our bank based on conduct risk and based on having those transparent behaviours, we can bring it back to a good space.  There are some countries in the world, like Canada, which we mentioned earlier on, like Australia, like Singapore, where I lived and worked for a number of years, where banking has a better reputation.  I'm not saying that it has the very best reputation but a much better reputation than it has here, for example, in Ireland, and understandably after what has happened in Ireland, but I do believe, and I am confident, that with the right culture and the development of that culture, we can bring banking back to be a sustainable, responsible part of the economy, where people who work in banks - decent people, I mean, you know, there are a lot of ... thousands of decent people who work in banks - aren't embarrassed to get into the back of a taxi and say, when the taxi driver asks them, \"Where do you work?\" they're afraid that ... they don't want to say they work in a bank.

I am happy to answer any questions or provide clarification on my written statement, already provided.  Based on this statement, I would like to take up the opportunity to highlight a couple of points.  I want to give you a brief background of myself and my company, Ballymore, and I want to give my view on the nature of the residential property development market in Ireland during the period 2001 to 2008 and subsequently, the collapse of the housing market in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  I founded Ballymore Properties over 30 years ago.  I grew up in County Roscommon and began my working life as an AnCO trainee, becoming a bricklayer stonemason.  I served my time in Galway and came to work in Dublin.  I worked on some of the largest projects in the city and gained valuable experience in all aspects of design and construction.  Aged 25, I saw an opportunity to build once-off residential homes in Leinster and established my business.  My first ever house was in Ballymore Eustace and hence the name Ballymore Homes.<\/p> <p>  I began designing and building individual homes to individuals' specifications.  The business took off and grew as the economy picked up in the late '80s.  In the early '90s, Ballymore was one of the biggest developers of houses in Ireland.  In 1991, we realised we needed to spread our risk and be less dependent on the Irish market and looked to expand into London.  By the year 2006, our business model had become significantly concentrated on the London market.  That year, when nearly 90,000 homes were built in Ireland, Ballymore accounted for less than one quarter of 1%, or roughly 225 new-build homes in Ireland that year.<\/p><p>This shift in business continued, and today Ballymore is one of London's biggest privately-owned property development companies.  The problem for Ballymore was the fact that approximately 90% of our borrowings was with Irish banks.  <\/p><p> I would like to give you an outline of the business that we are in.  In my experience, property development is a complex business and requires considerable skills and experience: skills in buying the right property in the right place at the right price, knowing what would work on a site, and then designing a scheme that is capable of meeting future market needs.  Then there's the process of planning permission, a long-term process which would often prolong negotiations, reworking of plans and dealing with objections.  After that, there is the marketing and sales process, followed by the construction, completions, after-sales service and, in the case of Ballymore, we also manage the majority of our own estates once completed.<\/p><p> Property development is a capital-intensive business.  The business model that worked for us was based on a tried and tested approach that combined the developer working closely with a lender, a commercial bank.  This model worked.  It combined the skills and experience of the developer with the capital provider, provided by the lender.  Developers in Ireland relied almost entirely on commercial banks for the business model to work.  The banking collapse meant the business model collapsed too.<\/p><p> Let me take a quick look back at the events leading up to 2008.  Back in early to mid-1980s, falling income and high interest rates pushed house prices down.  This changed between 1987 and 1995.  Rising income and job creation drove economic growth in Ireland and rising demand pushed prices up by 5% per annum.  Virtually all price growth from 2001 to 2007 was driven by a relaxing of credit conditions.  555,000 units were built between 1996 and 2006.  In the peak of the boom, Ireland's housing construction market grew from around 4 to 6% of GNP in the 1990s to a massive 15% of GNP at the peak of the boom in 2006 and 2007.  As a direct consequence of cheap credit and a massive level of borrowings, large numbers of unskilled and inexperienced people in Ireland became property developers.<\/p><p> The rate of house building in the mid-2000s was just simply unsustainable.  Ballymore, in line with its view of the market, was not very active in Irish land acquisitions at that time.  Our research showed that by 2006, the Irish market was building over 30,000 houses per annum more than was required for housing needs.  Construction accounted for 24% of GNP, or 30% of GDP.  Over a quarter of all economic activities in 2006 was construction.  Employment in construction went from 182,000 in 2002 to 281,000 in 2007.  That represented 13.4% of total employment compared to the UK and EU average of 8.2%.<\/p><p> Despite the fact that most economists were optimistically predicting continuous growth, we knew the market was over-supplied.  We had grave concerns for the outlooks of '07 and '08.  The Irish housing market was in real trouble and this was obvious even before the international banking collapse and the knock-on on the impact of the Irish lenders.  <\/p><p> When the global banking crisis happened, the commercial banks were not able to participate in the business model.  Once the business model collapsed, values collapsed and a consequence of that was the collapse of very many businesses, the loss of thousands and thousands of jobs and ultimately, the collapse of the market.<\/p><p>The property development market is a long-play business.  The long-term nature of the business means property developers require the foresight, the patience and, of course, the capital to be able to deal with the ups and downs and the recurring nature of the market.  The international banking crisis meant that the traditional model based on bank finance for property development was no longer an option and property development companies internationally had to look for new ways of funding new projects.<\/p><p> Ballymore Properties was fortunate to have an established and well-run business with a long, strong asset base, especially in London.  We were unfortunate to have had so much of our borrowings with the Irish banks.  So while we knew we were in a good position to withstand the crisis, what Ballymore needed was time and a mechanism to get through the period between the collapse and the recovery.  NAMA provided the means for Ballymore to do that.  Ballymore entered the NAMA process with a very detailed plan.  The tight business plan provided a base for the company to operate while new financial arrangements could be put in place.  Ballymore has worked with NAMA, co-operated fully and has worked our way through what needed to be done.  While it was a most painful and costly process for Ballymore, our strong asset base, especially in London, has allowed us sustain the core business, begin raising equity and finance from new international joint venture partners and to regroup, ensuring the future viability of the business and accelerate our exit from the NAMA system. <\/p><p> In conclusion, Chairman, I would like to summarise my points as follows: the collapse of the Irish banks, following the global financial crisis, had a devastating impact on Ballymore Properties.  Despite the fact that 85% of our assets were outside Ireland, 90% of our borrowings were with Irish banks.  As the Ballymore business model relied on capital from the commercial banks, the business couldn't operate, once capital dried up.  As Ballymore had substantial assets in London, where the downturn was short-lived and property prices recovered quickly, Ballymore was well positioned to recover.  The company needed the time to restructure its financial relationship and needed time for the market to recover.  Ballymore entered the NAMA process with a strong and tight business plan.  The business had been working its way through this and is looking forward to paying its debt related to the Irish banks' borrowing very, very soon and returning to a normal market model.  <\/p><p> Thank you and I'll take some questions now. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015072200002#VV00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sean Mulryan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1437519600,"counter":792,"content":"<p>Thank you very much, Mr. Mulryan, for your opening statement and if we can now proceed on to questioners and, in doing so, can I invite Deputy Michael McGrath to open up this session.

If I can just take the two paragraphs of that, there, Mr. Mulryan.  It says:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe establishment of NAMA in the budget 2009 was done at a time of great panic.  However, the uncertainty was prolonged.  It took nine months for the legislation to be enacted and a further four months for Ballymore&rsquo;s loans to be transferred into NAMA.  This was a very difficult period for Ballymore, especially as most of its activity was in the UK, particularly London, and the market there had little understanding of what was happening with the banking crisis in Ireland.<br \/><br \/>The reputational damage that Ballymore endured during this period was compounded by the fact that NAMA took over everything related to Ballymore - all loans, not just the poorer performing loans but the good loans and unencumbered assets as well. <\/blockquote> <p>Can I ask you maybe to elaborate on the effects of this time lag, and how it impacted upon your business?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015072200002#JJJ02100","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1437519600,"counter":1085,"content":"<p>Well, it meant ... but I mean, I understand why.

But then I understand the difficulty of handing over such an enormous amount to a new entity, and they had to get their heads around it.

Good evening all and thank you for the opportunity to address the committee.  As you know from my submission, I have been in the property development and construction business for over 37 years.  During this time, I worked through the recession of the 1980s and the currency crisis of 1992-1993.  At all times, the O'Flynn companies paid every creditor and repaid all borrowings in full plus interest.  Our business model was always soundly based.  From 1978, the business grew, as did the mix of skills within the organisation, including development, planning, project management, asset management and construction, investment and finance.  Development was the origin of the group and was always at the centre of our activities.  The key focus for development was to take a total management approach from inception to completion, only building product where real demand existed.<\/p> <p>  As a group, our plan was to create a strong and valuable organisation which would be broadly based and diversified in so far as is practical in terms of locations, business and economic risk.  At the peak in the mid-2000s, the O'Flynn Group employed over 1,000 people directly and indirectly.  In the statement to the inquiry, NAMA CEO, Mr. Brendan McDonagh, and not Mr. Frank Daly, as mentioned in my submission to you, indicated a view that diversification reflected an absence of strategy amongst developers.  I disagree.  Rather, diversification is a recognised and appropriate risk management strategy operated by businesses of scale.  <\/p> <p>  By the end of 2008, the group had fully evolved to a diversified model in terms of its asset type and geographic base.  In addition to our development business in Ireland, our varied businesses extended across nine jurisdictions, encompassing commercial, retail, industrial and residential and included a very successful student accommodation business, senior living accommodation and investment properties.<\/p> <p>  My relationship with banks - I can only speak from my own experience with the banks, that experience runs contrary to some of the generalisations I have heard reported at this inquiry about easy lending which was relationship based and where the loan was up to 100% or more of the value of the asset in some cases.  This was certainly not the case in relation to the O'Flynn Group.  The cash balances of the O'Flynn Group were always strong and were applied in property acquisitions.  Even the years 2006-2008, the average amount of our cash balance was &euro;76 million.  In our property acquisitions, a mix of our own cash and bank borrowings was generally applied, with the exception of joint venture arrangements where a lender sought a much higher return based on profit share.  In such cases, funding was provided by the lender and time, skills and expertise were provided by us and profits were shared in an agreed proportion.  <\/p> <p>  To be very clear, our borrowings were not speculative.  They underpinned specific developments with a strong balance sheet and a credible and strong cash flows to support them.  I never issued personal guarantees to any lender in relation to the business and the reason for this was our track record, but also the strength of our balance sheet and by extension, the level of equity which we were bringing to each project.  In approving any loan application, the bank had to satisfy itself of the ability of the borrowing company to repay the loan and the security available.  I have never provided any form of personal guarantee to a bank to secure an O'Flynn Group loan.<\/p> <p>  The O'Flynn Group way of operating was to identify a projects that made financial sense and then go about the financing, not the other way around.  From time to time, O'Flynn Group companies are required to provide guarantees for the liabilities of other group companies and where we believed it was the right thing to do, those inter-company guarantees were provided.<\/p> <p>  The global financial crisis - access to finance is the lifeblood of developers in the way raw materials are to a manufacturer.  When the global financial crisis hit, that supply was denied to us.  Regardless of how strong a company's balance sheet is, if you and your principal customers are dependent on banks for access to cash, you will not be in a position to continue business in such circumstances.  I am hugely appreciative and grateful to the State for providing liquidity to our business when the banks were in the extraordinary and unforeseen position of being unable to provide finance.  It was the only time in my 37 years in business that I have ever seen a business environment like this and I hope I will not see it again in my time.<\/p> <p>  The role of NAMA - while the concept of NAMA was well-intentioned, I believe it was destined to realise a less than optimal return to the State.<\/p><p>NAMA was intended to save the Irish banking sector but in fact hastened its demise and along the way added to the burden on the Irish taxpayer.  There were alternative and better options, and Lombard Street Research, a macroeconomic consultancy company based in London, outlined those options in a report which was submitted by the Construction Industry Federation to the Department of Finance, a copy of which I have provided to the inquiry.  <\/p><p> I believe there are four reasons why NAMA has and continues to fail to maximise the return to the State.  Firstly, the time that it took to create this new organisation, staff it, resource it, and deal with the European Commission on competition matters, decide on a valuation mechanism, value the loans on a loan-by-loan basis and ultimately transfer the loans, which was costly.  The concept of NAMA was first mooted in April 2009 but it was April 2010 before NAMA was able to even commence the review of business plans of the first tranche of borrowers.  It led to continued financial uncertainty over an extended period.  Secondly, I firmly believe that from the outset NAMA lacked experience in many important areas but most notably in the area of asset management and development.  This had very significant consequences in terms of early action to enhance the value of the assets under management.  Thirdly, NAMA failed to distinguish between developers who knew what they were doing and had a track record in business but who were thrown into turmoil by the global financial crisis, and part-time developers or people who had gone into the development business without having any understanding of the fundamentals involved.  While in NAMA, I presented a comprehensive, professionally assisted business plan designed to ensure that the O'Flynn Group could continue in its current form and that all debt could be repaid over time at par.  We applied very significant resources to the preparation of our business plan, which extended to some 2,000 pages, and believed that it offered a realistic timeframe to allow the group to operate a successful recovery strategy, which in turn would result in full debt repayment over time.  This plan was examined in detail on behalf of NAMA by FTI Consulting, a global business advisory group experienced in complex businesses, who conducted a comprehensive exercise with which we co-operated fully.  Although our engagement with FTI was positive, our business plan was rejected by NAMA without explanation or any meaningful engagement whatsoever.  Instead we were required to implement a business plan designed by NAMA personnel unfamiliar with our extensive and varied businesses across nine jurisdictions.  <\/p><p> The NAMA plan did not accommodate full debt repayment.  Although we had no part in designing it, we were required to implement it and yet remain responsible for the full amount of the loans.  Despite attempts on my part, NAMA refused to engage with me to see how this plan could be achieved.  To this day, I am bewildered as to why this was the case but the net effect is the taxpayer suffered a loss that could have been avoided in respect of the O'Flynn Group loans.  To be clear, we did not get a loan write-down.  NAMA took over the O'Flynn Group &euro;1.8 billion loan book and sold to the Blackstone at a discount.  However, we continue to owe Blackstone the full par value of the loans.  The discount taken by NAMA on the sale of the loan has cost the taxpayer but could have been avoided, had NAMA been prepared to work with us and to take our business plan on board.  We are fortunate that following the resolution of our dispute with Blackstone we still have a business, albeit a smaller one, on which we are building up again and contributing to the economic growth of the country.  However, both the tax man and the O'Flynn Group would have benefited, had NAMA taken a more strategic approach to our business and assets.  While I can only speak for my own business, I know there were other developers where NAMA has lost out, also because of their failure to identify and work with these people though an agreed business plan to maximise the return to the State.  <\/p><p> Finally, there was an in ... there was an inability of NAMA to recognise the cyclical nature of the economic downturn, and take a longer-term view of asset realisation and maximisation of proceeds.  We are all ... we are already seeing assets purchased from NAMA being sold on at significant profits.  A combination of a failure to identify developers who knew their business and a lack of recognition of where Ireland and Europe were on the economic cycle has resulted in a significant loss for the State.  Had NAMA picked developers who knew the business and had a track record, the State would have realised more proceeds and, in addition, some of the office and housing shortages we are now ... which are now emerging due to the lack of activity in recent years could have been avoided.<\/p><p> Much of the debate around NAMA has come to be dominated by its profitability as a measure of its success.  This should not be the case.  By paying low prices for assets and by taking good loans as well as bad, it was always likely that the entity would generate a profit.  However, this profit has been achieved at the cost of an earlier recovery in the banking system and serious damage to some developers, who had loans acquired and who lost an opportunity to work out those loans.<\/p><p>It also ignores the huge hidden cost of fees which are not included on NAMA's balance sheets but, instead, added to the account of the borrower.<\/p><p> There are other failings that I think should be identified: the lack of any real oversight of NAMA in relation to the ... to the exercise of the extraordinary powers vested in it; the special Oireachtas committee to examine matters in relation to NAMA, as provided for in the NAMA Act, was never established; the refusal by NAMA to allow partial refinancing joint ventures or any other means of attracting outside equity; the so-called section 172 policy - section 172 precludes the sale of loans by NAMA to borrowers who are in default in respect of those loans; NAMA, however, operated a policy which, in fact, went far beyond what the legislation provided.  Although our loans were not in default at the time they were sold, NAMA's process precluded any proper commercial discussions between us and, thus, prospective purchasers of our loans.  It was irrational and, in my view, potentially unlawful that we were precluded from having such discussions with potential purchasers.  I believe that the State should be allowed to get the best return from the sale of assets, irrespective of who the highest bidder is.<\/p><p> Most NAMA borrowers are prevented from speaking frankly of their personal experiences within NAMA, either because their loans are still controlled by NAMA or because they are subject to confidentiality arrangements.  I've outlined in much greater detail in my submission my experiences of NAMA and a ... and the serious shortcomings of same.  I should stress, however, that I have encountered some very decent, professional and fair-minded people who worked in NAMA.  However, I have also had some very poor experiences.  The only remedy a borrower can seek in NAMA is to seek judicial review of decisions made by NAMA.  Not only does the expense of such application put it beyond the reach of most borrowers but any such application is certain to be regarded by NAMA as unco-operative and, therefore, in real terms, would be the end of that borrower in NAMA.  To be very clear, I had no role or involvement or was not consulted on the transfer of my loans, or the loans of the O'Flynn Group, when the various financial institutions entered NAMA.  I equally had no involvement in the price at which these loans were transferred, the haircut suffered by the banks and the cost to the Irish taxpayer as a result.  In fact, at the time my loans were acquired, NAMA ... NAMA insisted that the borrowers did not even have the right to make representations in relation to the acquisition of their loans.  The Supreme Court subsequently determined that NAMA was wrong in that regard.<\/p><p> Neither the acquisition of our loans from the banks nor the sale of them by NAMA had any impact on the amount we owed.  At all times we remained liable for the full par debt.  I've already repaid my personal loans in full, which I believe is a vindication of the fact that they never constituted a systemic risk and should not have been acquired by NAMA.  The O'Flynn Group submitted a business plan which would have allowed full debt repayment but this was rejected and, instead, despite remaining liable for par debt, we were required to implement NAMA's alternative plan under which full repayment could never have been achieved.  I was not permitted to be a party to the selection of the winning bid for my loans nor the price paid for those loans.  It's important to know that we co-operate fully with all prospective bidders to maximise the return to the State and this has been acknowledged by NAMA.  People talk about NAMA being a developer bailout but that is not my experience.<\/p><p> To be very clear, as I have said already, I am hugely appreciative to the State for stepping in to provide liquidity when the banks became unable to operate and I wanted to repay that.  The taxpayer lost money, of that there is no doubt.  However, I have a business that is now much smaller than it was before, resulting in a direct loss to the economy.  The main winners in all of this have been the private equity companies who have the funding and are able to buy loans and assets at a time in the economic cycle where the value realised by the State was far from optimal.  As the positive economic cycle has progressed, these assets and loans are now being realised at a significant profit.<\/p><p> The future: looking to the future, development always requires skill and judgment to be done well at a significant scale.  It's always capital intensive and it is always a risky undertaking.  It is essential that a professional developer sector is re-established to ensure that Ireland's future property needs are satisfied to meet the requirements of a modern, growing economy.  Part of the re-establishment of a professional development model would have to entail less reliance on bank finance and a greater dependence on a different funding model, where the equity comes from professional investors.  But as well as the development sector learning lessons from the crisis, there are also lessons to be learned in the area of zoning, planning and building regulations.  We should not lose the opportunity to correct all the systemic issues which ... that contributed to the demise of the property sector in Ireland.  The property ... the property market is cyclical.  The O'Flynn Group and its various companies have been through a number of peaks and troughs but we have adapted to meet circumstances and to continue in business.  It is easy in the current climate to forget the positive contribution made by the ... by the construction-property sector to the economy.  A functioning property and construction sector, with properly-managed, experienced companies, is essential in every economy.  Ireland is no exception.

So you have to identify first: what's the market need, where is the need, you can't give some, a bit to everyone everywhere in the country and you have to supply it at a cost that works.

I accept some of the tax incentives in this country probably went on longer than they should but I was involved in urban renewal, I would say urban renewal is still necessary in parts of our cities.  I think we've, we have to have more people living in cities and we have to find ways of buffering the, the brownfield or, or, you know, the brownfield cost of building and the issues around that.<\/p><p>I mean there are large parts of our cities that are not viable, some of them were not viable in the boom years and that's the blunt reality.

Ireland led the way with accommodation, with student accommodation because of tax allowances and it helped universities enormously and I read in the paper, I think today or yesterday, that one of the universities - I think our own man from Cork - was calling on further tax incentives.  We have to provide accommodation if we're going to feed our universities and I think universities are very important.
