As requested by members, my officials have brought copies of the ODCE's guide to directors duties and powers.  This document is available free of charge in both hard copy and on the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE, website.  As I mentioned yesterday, the officials from my Department will arrange another briefing session for committee members prior to Report Stage to ensure that members are fully briefed on these proposed amendments.<\/p><p>  In this context, I wish to remind members about the Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2013, which will be progressing through the Houses in the coming weeks.  This Bill will contain provisions that are considered to be too urgent to wait for the completion of the \"Big Bill\".  This Bill amends the Companies (Amendment) Act 1990 in relation to the jurisdiction of the courts in examinerships.  It provides that companies that are deemed to be small companies by virtue of the Companies (Amendment) Act 1986 may make their application to the Circuit Court instead of the High Court.  It also contains provisions concerning the making of annual returns for subsidiary undertakings.  It facilitates the reporting of offences under the companies Acts to the Director of Corporate Enforcement and his or her officers.  It authorises IAASA to collect a levy or levies from statutory auditors and audit firms auditing public interest entities.  Finally the Bill makes provision for the Minister to provide regulations in relation to third country auditors and audit entities, who carry out audits of the annual or group accounts of a company falling within certain EU regulations.  As the \"small\" Bill has not yet been enacted, it is not possible to give a more precise detail of its final version, although obviously the members of the committee will contribute to it when it comes before them in the next few weeks.  As the goal of the Companies Bill 2012 is to consolidate all existing law, it is intended that the \"small\" Bill will be subsumed into it, ideally by way of Report Stage amendments.<\/p><p>  I would also like to note that I am considering introducing amendments to Part 3 on Report Stage to harmonise advertising requirements for notifying creditors of a proposed reduction in capital and also to ensure that the requirement to advertise in one daily newspaper only is applied consistently throughout the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2013110600002#A00300","speaker":"979"},{"type":"speech","time":1383732000,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his statement.

Once implemented from 2014, it will assure young people aged 18 to 25 a good quality offer of employment, continued education, an apprenticeship or a traineeship of work experience within four months of becoming unemployed.

I am joined by my colleague Mr. Terry Corcoran, principal officer, who was a member of the delegation representing Ireland in the negotiations of the European Council recommendation on a youth guarantee.<\/p><p>  Between 2008 and 2012 employment levels in Ireland fell by about 340,000, or 16%, from just under 2.2 million to just over 1.8 million.  This lead to an increase in unemployment levels of over 220,000, from 107,000 to a peak of 328,000, a threefold increase.  According to figures from the Central Statistics Office, CSO, the overall unemployment rate increased from 4.6% to approximately 15%.  In relative terms, the reduction in youth employment levels was more pronounced than for the working-age population generally.  The number of people aged 15 to 24 years in employment fell by nearly 60%, accounting for over 210,000 of the overall reduction set out above, with just 147,000 young people in employment at the start of 2013.  However, in relative terms, the increase in youth unemployment levels was not as pronounced as for the population generally.  Youth unemployment increased by approximately 45,000 from about 38,000 to a peak of about 83,000.  The rate peaked at 33%.<\/p><p>  There are several reasons why the reduction in employment did not translate directly into a commensurate increase in youth unemployment.  First, the reduction in the birth rate during the 1980s and 1990s meant there was a net reduction of 30,000 in the number of young people entering the labour market.  Second, the reversal in migration trends since 2010 has further reduced the number of young people entering the labour market by approximately 16,000 over the period.  Finally, more young people are staying on in education, reducing the labour force participation rate of young people from about 53% to about 45%.  The combination of these factors saw the number of young people participating in the labour market fall by about 110,000 between 2008 and 2012.<\/p><p>  Recent data on youth employment and unemployment levels are more positive.  Youth employment appears to have stabilised in the first half of 2013 at about 153,000, while the level of youth unemployment has fallen from its peak of 83,000 to 65,000, equivalent to a youth unemployment rate of 29%.  It is hoped this improvement in employment of young people will continue.  Past experience in Ireland and abroad indicates that youth employment, which tends to fall relatively rapidly in a downturn, can be expected to increase relatively rapidly during a period of economic recovery.<\/p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s strategy to tackle unemployment, including youth unemployment, comprises two main elements.  First, it aims to create an environment for a strong economic recovery by promoting competitiveness and productivity, as well as encouraging entrepreneurial activity.  This is the focus of the Action Plan for Jobs as developed and managed by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  The plan&rsquo;s objective is to stimulate the demand for labour by encouraging and supporting entrepreneurial activity, along with investment in the economy, with the target of adding a net 100,000 jobs into it by 2016.<\/p><p>  Second, it aims to provide services to support and assist unemployed people in returning to paid employment.  This is the focus of the Pathways to Work approach, which is concerned with ensuring that as many as possible new jobs and other vacancies in the economy are filled by candidates taken from the live register.  Under the scheme the Government is implementing several programmes to assist unemployed people in remaining close to the labour market.  Examples of such initiatives, all of which are available to young unemployed people, include the Intreo service, JobBridge, JobsPlus and Momentum.<\/p><p>  Although it is always difficult to establish a causal relationship between intervention and outcome in the labour market environment, we are encouraged to see that the most recent statistics for the second quarter of this year from the CSO quarterly national household survey show positive trends in the labour market, both overall and for young people.  More recent live register trends suggest this positive trend is continuing.<\/p><p>  However, the level of improvement is small relative to the underlying scale of the problem, and the pace of progress is not uniform across the European Union.  Even where there is progress, it is too early to declare the recent trends will continue to develop or accelerate.  Accordingly, youth unemployment continues to present a major challenge for Ireland, as it does for all EU member states.  Throughout the EU area, it is estimated 5.5 million young people aged 25 and under are not in employment, education or training &ndash; the so-called NEETs.  In the Union overall, the rate of youth unemployment is still growing and in some countries is close to 60%.  It is even higher in Greece.<\/p><p>  Recognising the urgent requirement to tackle the challenge of youth joblessness, the European Council agreed on a recommendation for a youth guarantee in June 2013.  It states member states should \"ensure that all young people under the age of 25 years receive a good-quality offer of employment, continued education, an apprenticeship or a traineeship within a period of four months of becoming unemployed or leaving formal education.\"  In agreeing this recommendation, the Council accepted that the guarantee would need to be implemented over time on a phased basis in those countries facing significant fiscal constraints, such as Ireland.  Also, in support of the recommendation for a youth guarantee, the Council agreed that a total of &euro;6 billion would be earmarked in EU funds to support approved youth guarantee projects over the course of the seven-year multi-annual financial framework.  This &euro;6 billion comprises &euro;3 billion from within the existing European Social Fund and an additional &euro;3 billion in the form of youth employment initiative funding.  The Council also agreed this funding should be front-loaded to support projects implemented during the first two years of the framework, namely, 2014 and 2015.  It will be reserved for use in those regions where youth unemployment levels exceeded 25% during the reference year of 2012.  Both regions in Ireland satisfy this 25% threshold.  To access these funds, member states have been asked to submit a youth guarantee implementation plan to the European Commission by the end of 2013.  To develop and implement such a plan in Ireland, the Department of Social Protection has set up an interdepartmental youth guarantee implementation group with officials and programme managers from the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  The terms of reference for this group are to review the current range of youth employment services in Ireland, to assess what measures are appropriate to deliver the youth guarantee in Ireland and to develop an implementation plan for the Government's approval and transmission to the EU before the end of the year.<\/p><p>  As an input to this plan, the Department of Social Protection held a stakeholders&rsquo; consultation forum on the guarantee on October 14 and has invited further submissions from the bodies that attended.  It is intended that feedback from the forum will feed into the final design of the implementation plan.  In addition, the Department has retained the OECD to provide input and advice on the framing of the plan.  The OECD is also providing assistance to several other countries.  In particular, it has been asked to identify best international practice and how it might best be applied to the implementation of the youth guarantee in Ireland.  A delegation from the OECD has already met with stakeholders at the aforementioned forum, as well as with a range of relevant public bodies.  It is due to produce a report with recommendations for the Department by the end of November, the findings of which will feed into the final design of the implementation plan.<\/p><p>  The development of the plan will also draw on expert work already carried out by the European Commission over the past few years, as well as the output from the specially convened Heads of State meeting held in Berlin in July.  In summary, the work of the Commission, as reflected in the conclusions from the Heads of State meeting, suggests several elements for inclusion in any youth guarantee, including the development of a vocational dual-training model, as used in Germany and Austria; the support and promotion of internships; the promotion of intra-EU labour mobility; the targeted use of employment subsidies; the development of youth entrepreneurship supports, including micro-finance; the review and redesign of business processes in public employment services, PES; and the development of closer links between PES, training agencies and employers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013110600004#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McKeon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1383743700,"counter":468,"content":"<p>I am conscious that we are ten minutes into Mr. McKeon's presentation.

That is reflected in the initial steps we are taking in budget 2014 to introduce a variant of JobsPlus targeted specifically at young people, to provide for an additional intake of 1,500 young people on to the very successful JobBridge scheme, to earmark places on the T&uacute;s scheme, to develop a pilot programme to support young unemployed people in taking up work opportunities and training schemes such as Your First EURES Job, to ring-fence training places for under-25s and to make funds available to young entrepreneurs via Microfinance Ireland.

Ballymun Job Centre is a community-based organisation providing employment services to local people since 1986.  We were established as a community response to the high levels of unemployment at the time.  We are a voluntary charitable organisation and manage the local employment services in the Ballymun area.  Over our lifetime, we have built relationships and worked at local, national and European levels.  We believe the people of Ballymun have the capacity to realise their labour market potential.  We want to raise their skills and labour market aspirations and give people choice in terms of the labour market.<\/p><p>  It is within this context that Ballymun Job Centre brings its expertise to the Ballymun pilot, as Mr. McKeon mentioned.  We see this pilot as an important milestone for the future direction of a national policy on youth unemployment.  The lessons from the pilot will, we hope, inform the activation of young people aged between 18 and 24.  Ballymun Job Centre is involved in developing the pilot at local level.  I will discuss two areas in respect of the expertise we bring to this pilot.  <\/p><p>  The first is the EQUAL Youth inter-agency network, which was established in 2008 and provides an inter-agency approach to the progression of young people towards the labour market.  We are the lead organisation in this inter-agency model and have formal monthly meetings in which our caseload of young people are tracked and progressed.  It provides a continuum of seamless service to the young people from guidance through to the workplace.  <\/p><p>  Our second area of expertise is quality-driven career guidance.  We believe this is a cornerstone of any youth activation model.  We have experience from a number of projects in which we have developed an in-depth career guidance model, a quality framework on the delivery of guidance to disadvantaged jobseekers and a range of career guidance assessment tools that are online and that we use with our clients.  The guidance process involves a very in-depth assessment of the individual's needs and a tailored guidance approach identifying their aptitudes and behavioural style in the workplace.  This feeds into the development of a comprehensive career plan that both has a longer-term career objective and short-term career goals.  The implementation of this plan is conducted in a very supportive and positive way with the career guidance practitioner within our service.  Elements of this model can be implemented either in a group setting or on an individual basis.  The outcome of this guidance process is very important for the work we do.  We try to help people increase their self-awareness, improve their self-esteem, build career self-efficacy and help them become more resilient in the labour market, therefore providing more long-term sustainable outcomes for young people.  We aim to build on both the human and psychological capital of our clients, but the implementation of this type of career plan very much relies on the practitioner-client relationship.  It is highly dependent on the skills and approaches of the guidance practitioner within the context of this inter-agency model.  It relies on the continuum of this support through education and training and into the labour market.<\/p><p>  I have outlined a number of reasons guidance is important.  One reason is that it prevents uninformed career decisions.  Rather than allowing a client to make a decision to access a training course based simply on its availability in the local area, it provides the client with a more comprehensive way of making decisions about his or her career.  <\/p><p>  We recognise that there are multiple challenges within the youth guarantee model.  It is important to recognise that many people have multiple barriers to employment and some people have very few barriers to employment, so the model needs to be flexible and different levels of support may be required depending on the individual.  In Ballymun, we focus on inter-generational and community impact, which results in clustering of very disadvantaged people in certain areas.  Therefore, the flexibility of the model is paramount.  We want to focus on short-term interventions as well as longer-term robust methods so that people sustain their abilities within the labour market.  <\/p><p>  In terms of recommendations, we see career guidance as being the first step in any training, education or activation process.  It keeps people close to the labour market just by engaging with services and it should form a bridge linking the identified labour market needs of the individual to the programmes that are designed to meet those individual's needs.  However, successful implementation of a quality-driven youth guarantee model is largely dependent on the skills and approach of the guidance practitioners delivering that service and the resources put into it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013110600005#E00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Nuala Whelan"},{"type":"speech","time":1383743700,"counter":472,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Whelan.

The National Youth Council of Ireland is a representative body for about 45 national voluntary youth organisations across the country.  We certainly welcome the opportunity to speak about the youth guarantee.  We have been working on youth unemployment for a number of years, and as far back as March 2011 we called for an examination of a youth guarantee in Ireland.  The Department has already outlined the context and background so I will not talk about the \"why\".  I think we all agree on the need for a youth guarantee.  I want to talk about the \"how\" - how can we make this happen and how we can make it work.  We would acknowledge that it will be challenging to deliver a guaranteed place for every young person who has been unemployed or out of the education system for four months or more, but we think it can be done.  I would like to present some of what we consider to be the key components of the youth guarantee, many of which have been mentioned by Mr. McKeon and Ms Whelan.  I will go through them very quickly.<\/p><p>  Perhaps it sounds like common sense, but the concept of a guarantee does have a certain currency in our language.  Given that young people are facing a very difficult labour market and many challenges and frustrations, if we go out there and sell them the idea of a guarantee, we must also meet our side of the bargain.  We think it can be done, but we must be very careful not to over-promise and under-deliver because that would be a further frustration for them.  We should strive as a country to implement the best youth guarantee in Europe because it is something that will affect the entire European Union.  We must also be realistic and say that if we are going to deliver a quality youth guarantee, we must make the investment.  There is no point in saying it can be done on the cheap.  The reality is that it cannot.  I acknowledge that Ireland is not Sweden and the context is very different, but under the Swedish model, based on the number of young people unemployed for six months or longer, it would cost approximately &euro;273 per annum.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013110600005#E00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. James Doorley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1383744300,"counter":475,"content":"<p>I invite Ms Cora Horgan to make her opening remarks on behalf of Tipperary Regional Youth Service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013110600006#F00200","speaker":"1018"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1383744300,"counter":476,"content":"<p>When one speaks later in a meeting there is a danger of repeating what previous speakers have said.  That is probably a good thing, however, because we are obviously singing from the same hymn sheet.  I work with Tipperary Regional Youth Service and I am here to speak about the youth work response to the implementation of the youth guarantee.  I have based my submission on a proven approach that has been operating in Tipperary for the last four years.<\/p><p>  We have operated as a youth service since 1970, but since 2009 we have focused on young unemployed people in our programmes.  We have delivered 11 programmes, the flagship of which is the work winner programme.  Through the work winner programme we have worked with 145 young people in the last four years, 70% of whom have progressed to education and training or employment.  We are very proud of this figure.  I would like to highlight the collaboration we have had with local agencies, such as the Department of Social Protection, the education and training boards, local partnerships and, particularly, local employers.  These partnerships have been very important in providing sustainable employment and education opportunities.<\/p><p>  The young people with whom we work are furthest from the labour market.  These are young people who left school at the age of 14 or 15 years.  They may have been out of work and education for two or three years.  That is a huge chunk of a young person's life.  They are the most challenging young people.  They face issues such as few or no employment opportunities, limited literacy skills, low levels of education and training and family backgrounds that are not necessarily supportive of going out to get a job.  Rural issues also arise.  Much of what was described by the representative from Ballymun is similar to our experience, but we must also contend with the rural nature of Tipperary town, Thurles and Cashel.  This adds further complications to our young people's lives.<\/p><p>  We have found the youth work approach to be an effective response.  We work with the most marginalised young people who need initial support and guidance to get into the jobs market and remain in it.  I agree that the relationship between the practitioner and the project worker is important from the outset.  We are an integrated youth service and, as Mr. Doorley has noted, there are a considerable number of youth work projects around the country.  We find that the integrated model provides ancillary support to young people in education, training or employment.  Many of our clients have issues with drink and drugs.  A couple of them have been off the road for the last four or five years and are living in a small and rural part of County Tipperary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013110600006#F00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Cora Horgan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1383744900,"counter":478,"content":"<p>I remind members and guests to turn off their mobile phones because it is interfering with the coverage of proceedings.

Ms Dunne and I are here as representatives of three separate groups - USI, ICTU and our colleagues in the Irish Second-Level Students&rsquo; Union, ISSU.  This highlights a unique collaboration between three representative organisations which together represent more than 1 million people in our society.  Over the summer we undertook this on the basis that the employment crisis facing young people in this country is unique and cannot be solved within any one Department or initiative.  It is a wide-ranging problem and we require joined-up thinking and a real commitment to try to solve it.<\/p><p>  While attending the consultation forum we have sent the submission with this document and are making our speeches today, and we welcome that.  However, while JobBridge has many positive elements and has done much good, there has been abuse and exploitation of it, largely due to a lack of monitoring, oversight and ongoing evaluation by key stakeholders.  With the commitment the groups here today have given to the youth guarantee and addressing this problem, with the implementation group established to design the implementation that is being sent to Europe next month, and with the ongoing roll-out of the scheme, we would like to be actively engaged and involved on an ongoing basis.<\/p><p>  In the few minutes we have I will not be able to go into this document in great detail.  It has been circulated to the members.  Given that there is much to be done in the transition from second level to third level and the workplace and from third level to the workplace, as well as job creation, the groups represented all have something to offer in terms of the proposals in our policy document.<\/p><p>  I would also like to address the issue of investment.  One of the key points in our document is that adequate financial resources need to be identified if we are going to make this work as we want it to do for young people in Ireland - namely, if we are to ensure that no young person is left longer than four months without work, training or education.  This is an area of concern for us arising from the budget.  The figure of &euro;400 million was touted in Europe as recommended.  The Department of Social protection mentioned &euro;300 million at the consultation forum.  Mr. Doorley of NYCI mentioned &euro;273 million.  While the initial investment of &euro;14 million is welcome, this should be very much the basic starting point.  The fact that the social welfare cuts directed at young people bring about a saving of &euro;32 million suggests &euro;14 million is inadequate to address this problem in the grand scheme of things.<\/p><p>  I will not talk too much about the problem because we are all aware of it.  Some 120,000 people between the ages of 15 and 24 have emigrated in the last four years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013110600007#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joe O'Connor","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1383745500,"counter":481,"content":"<p>I want to give Ms Dunne some time as well.

There needs to be investment in job creation for young people as part of the proposals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013110600008#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joe O'Connor"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1383745500,"counter":483,"content":"<p>I am conscious that the committee has heard many presentations and there is agreement on many of the issues.  The ICTU welcomes the concept of the youth guarantee.  It is important because young people have been dramatically affected by the recession and they still are the largest unemployed group even though they have flexibility in that they can remain in or return to education or emigrate.  We are disappointed with the funding for the youth guarantee.  We have heard the numbers that have been indicated to make it an effective solution and it is unfortunate that more money has not been secured.  A small amount has been allocated and we hope a larger investment will be made throughout.  We hope it will deliver for young people whatever way considerations are made.  This should be something new.  It should not be a numbers exercise or an extension of what has gone before.  It is not simply about moving people into training opportunities that are not tailored specifically to their needs.  I agree with the NYCI that implementation should be speedy and done with sufficient resources, because the objective of a youth guarantee is to ensure our young people become active in the labour market in decent jobs with decent pay and conditions and opportunities.  That is the core of what congress talks about in terms of decent work and opportunities.<\/p><p>  We have outlined a number of principles in the Locked Out? document.  As Mr. O'Connor said, the scheme should be additional.  We would also like to have an input into the implementation and design of the scheme.  Our organisations represent more than 1 million young people.  It is important that their voice is heard.<\/p><p>  The main objective of a youth guarantee should be a lead-in to sustainable employment, but there should also be a recognition that there are different routes back to employment.  Training and education are hugely important, particularly when skills are obsolete, but work placements, as Ms Horgan mentioned, are also important for those who have a higher level of education and need learning opportunities within the workplace.  There also should be a mechanism whereby jobseekers are identified along with the option that suits them most.  That will have cost implications, but if money is spent on such a guarantee, it should be as effective as possible.<\/p><p>  The scheme should also commission regular independent research to establish the contribution of each element to sustainable employment.  It is important that there is an evaluation mechanism that is clearly monitored to ensure there is no exploitation such as has happened in the JobBridge scheme and to assess the sustainability and quality of employment on the scheme, including that which has been secured after training.  Given the level of investment the Government is suggesting, decisions and choices will have to be made.  The NESC suggested recently that difficult decisions have to be made with regard to targeting and that it may have to happen under the youth guarantee.  The questions we have identified are as follows: Is it to be a quick fix?  Is it about moving people into employment or is it a numbers exercise for those to whom it is easier to allocate positions but who may benefit anyway from an economic upturn which we hope will happen soon?  Some young people who have been the subject of significant educational investment may leave the country.  Is that more beneficial?  Should the scheme address the needs of those who are further removed from the labour force, are harder to place and may not have the capacity to avail of economic growth?  Congress believes that a targeted approach is necessary in the absence of additional and adequate funding.<\/p><p>  The committee needs to consider that it is difficult to reach young people, particularly those living in unemployment black spots or those who may come from families that have experienced intergenerational unemployment.  The guarantee can assist in breaking the cycle of unemployment.  With such limited funds, we will need to ensure they deliver for our young people.<\/p><p>  The crisis in youth unemployment cannot be fixed solely by the youth guarantee.  There should be a national jobs strategy for young people and an investment stimulus.  We should look to expanding sectors such as green jobs, hospitality and high tech industries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013110600008#H00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Fiona Dunne"},{"type":"speech","time":1383745500,"counter":484,"content":"<p>We have one hour and 20 minutes left.

I do not have the Estimates with me, but I will send the detailed figures to the secretariat separately.  There are an extra 1,500 to 2,000 places for young people under the JobBridge programme at a cost of about &euro;7 million to &euro;7.5 million; there are an extra 1,500 Jobs Plus places at a cost of about &euro;5 million; and there is the youth enterprise initiative in the order of &euro;2 million.

The Nordic countries have had a kind of youth guarantee scheme in place since the 1980s.  The idea is that young people are not allowed to drift into long-term unemployment.  The studies show that Sweden invests approximately &euro;6,000 per young person covered by the youth guarantee.  There is a figure of about &euro;600 which covers administration costs, counselling costs, etc.  The scheme has proved quite successful.  The figures show that by investing money upfront, even after just 12 months in a job the investment is paid back.  We acknowledge, however, that Ireland is not Sweden.  We need to take the best from Sweden, while acknowledging that our social welfare and education systems are very different.  I attended a seminar that Senator Reilly had organised in Cavan at which a speaker from Sweden was quite critical of some elements of the Swedish project, which is not perfect.  If we implement a youth guarantee, it will not be perfect and will have problems.  However, we should aim for the best.  The figure of &euro;6,600 is an indicator of the investment needed in order to make the guarantee work in practice.  That is how we came up with the figure of &euro;273 million.  We acknowledge that we will not go from nothing in 2013 to &euro;273 million or &euro;300 million in year one.  In practical terms, we need to have phased implementation, even if the money were available, which it is not.  The Budget Statement referred to the figure of &euro;14 million as an initial allocation.  It certainly needs to be considerably more than this.  Given the potential for the Government to get the money from European Commission funds - the &euro;6 billion that needs to be spent in 2014 and 2015 - there is a great opportunity.  If we get the right model for a youth guarantee, we will get a fair chunk of money in support.  If we only invest &euro;50 million, we will only receive 66% of that sum.

There are huge concerns about employers, including the Government, abusing their position and availing of free labour under the guise of providing internships.  I welcome the emphasis in Ms Whelan's presentation on career guidance and creating a career path.  The Department has stated it will do much of this through its Intreo offices.  I am not saying Ms Whelan should not be doing it also and also support the local employment services which also do this work.  Will the Department outsource this work to organisations such as the Ballymun Job Centre or local employment services throughout the country and concentrate on other work, or will it employ career guidance teachers who have been laid off to do this work within the Department and Intreo offices?<\/p><p>  A huge number of young people are unemployed and more are coming.  If they do not emigrate, they will remain here.  Is there capacity to capture all of these young people in meaningful training schemes which will lead to meaningful jobs and in education and post-leaving certificate courses?  Many colleges of further education cannot cope with the level of demand.  Will the youth guarantee allow for additional funding to be given to these colleges to increase the number of post-leaving certificate courses which are often targeted at filling gaps in the economy?  They can identify quite quickly where a new factory will face skills shortages and capture these skills.<\/p><p>  How many other EU countries fit the criteria to qualify for the fund?  We have some idea that it will include Ireland, Portugal, Spain, Italy and Greece.  How many other countries fit the criteria?  This will give us an indication of how much Ireland will benefit from the fund.  Even though it sounds like a huge amount of money, when it is shared between 27 countries, it reduces.<\/p><p>  I did not hear much about apprenticeships and we have gone through huge change in how they are rolled out.  At the very least, apprenticeships are focused on a specific job, whereas other schemes on which the Department is concentrating do not guarantee a job or a qualification at the end.

When it comes to labour market interventions, nothing is perfect.  We must be careful that perfection does not become the enemy of the good.  JobBridge has many good aspects and I am concerned that we do not lose sight of this during the debate.  We work very hard to try to detect and prevent abuses and anybody can report abuse to us.  We have information on the website and conduct more than 3,000 random monitoring visits to firms.  There is a very good progression rate.  I have taken a personal interest in this issue and met quite a number of interns and the vast majority of feedback is positive.  This is not to say, however, that there are not and will not be employers or interns who will seek to take advantage.  That is the case in almost everything we do.  I am concerned that negative commentary will outweigh the many positive aspects.<\/p><p>  Local employment services will be part of the picture.  Local employment services and job clubs are core and critical to what the Department does.  We have provided almost &euro;1 million for Ballymun local employment services each year and will continue to provide this funding.  We use local employment services, in particular, for those who are more distant from the labour market such as those mentioned with low educational achievement.  In our Intreo offices we will deal with the majority of people who are unemployed, including the majority of young people who are unemployed.  Their major issue is not that they have significant barriers to employment but that they do not have employment opportunities.  Intreo offices will focus on dealing with them and trying to job-match them.  We provide some career guidance and job search assistance.  In-depth detailed personal intensive one-to-one work is done for us by local employment services and this will continue.  Some of the Intreo offices will do this also, but we see a role for local employment services in this regard. <\/p><p>  As to whether there is enough capacity in the system to offer people opportunities, last year approximately 90,000 young people joined the live register, more than two thirds of whom had left after six months.  The progression rate of young people off the live register is quite fast.  The number of places we need to find is smaller, probably 20,000 to 30,000.  We are examining whether we have capacity in the development of the implementation plan.  We certainly have capacity on aggregate, as well as some additional capacity.  If we use the capacity on aggregate and do not add to it, it will mean taking capacity away from other cohorts.  We are examining this issue in the implementation plan.  We have also asked the OECD to examine it.<\/p><p>  With regard to with how many countries we must share the EU funding, I will ask Mr. Corcoran to answer this question because he is very closely involved in the discussion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013110600010#K00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McKeon"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1383746700,"counter":499,"content":"<p>It is based on regions, as opposed to countries, with an unemployment rate for young people in excess of 25% last year.

On the former, the Union of Students in Ireland, USI, called on the then Minister for education, Batt O'Keeffe, for a national internship scheme in 2010.  JobBridge was subsequently introduced.  It is important to clarify that, while the scheme is imperfect, it has done much good for many young people.<\/p><p>  I will revert to my previous point, as some members of the committee probably want me to clarify further.  An internship, by its nature, should be intern focused.  When I think of an internship, I think of something that provides real learning opportunities and career advancement potential for the intern.  The bad type of internship, some of which we have seen in JobBridge, is the idea that it is a cheap way of getting work done for the employer.  A bad example in recent years saw the job of stacking shelves in Tesco being included in JobBridge.  The idea was to dress it up as a busy, customer-focused work environment, but such a job has no place on an internship scheme.  It could be argued that a one-off Government tender that advertises itself as providing learning outcomes in the practical installation of water meters may not provide a significant number of future job opportunities for an internship.  It is a question of into which category the role fits.<\/p><p>  An apprenticeship review is being undertaken by the Department of Education and Skills.  Work-based learning needs to form a crucial part of the youth guarantee.  Apart from a small number of sectors, Ireland does not do apprenticeships particularly well or place sufficient emphasis on them.<\/p><p>  I will highlight a point that may have been missed in the overall budgetary argument.  Although we are having this conversation, we need to focus more on apprenticeship work-based learning.  The budget has provided a mechanism under which people engaging in F&Aacute;S apprenticeships, which were previously State-funded, must now make <i>pro rata<\/i> contributions.  This sends a mixed message about the direction we want to take.  The question of whether we want added investment or less investment must be answered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013110600011#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joe O'Connor"},{"type":"speech","time":1383747300,"counter":503,"content":"<p>Ms Dunne indicated.

We see our role within the Department of Social Protection as being to ensure that as many jobs as possible created under that plan are filled by people on the live register.  This was one of the motivations behind the JobsPlus initiative.  We want to ensure that as many jobs as possible are taken up by people on the live register, particularly those who have been on it for a long time.  While youth unemployment is a huge problem throughout Europe and within Ireland, a more profound problem is long-term unemployment, including long-term unemployment independent of age.  For example, youth unemployment in Ireland according to the QNHS is approximately 64,000, of which 20,000 people have been unemployed more than 12 months.  As such, less than one-third have been unemployed for more than 12 months.  More than half of those over 25 who are unemployed have been unemployed for at least 12 months, which is the bigger problem for us.  As such, the jobs strategy must be a jobs strategy at a national level that creates jobs rather than focusing on particular cohorts.<\/p><p>  With regard to the other member states and how much Ireland will and can apply for, the total amount available is &euro;6 billion and the incremental amount is &euro;3 billion.

The proposal is to earmark some of that European Social Fund money for youth unemployment initiatives.  In Ireland, we have already used this money on initiatives such as Youthreach, which are already targeted at young people.  The additional &euro;3 billion is from the youth employment initiative.  Under the European Social Fund, 50-50 matching applies, which means Ireland must match every euro it draws down from the European Social Fund.  This is not required under the youth employment initiative.  This is where the 66% funding comes from.<\/p><p>  In terms of how much we can apply for, we can apply for as much of it as we want.

If one divides the &euro;6 billion by 5 million and multiplies by 53,000 one gets Ireland's likely <i>pro rata<\/i> share.  We have an expectation of approximately &euro;60 million, but are optimistic we can do better than that.  As mentioned earlier by Mr. Corcoran, this would equate to approximately &euro;100 million within the State.<\/p><p>  On training for facilitators and career guidance people and whether we have sufficient staff, there are 300 people in the Department who are trained employment advisers, most of whom have been educated through a diploma level course in NUI Maynooth in adult guidance.  However, 300 staff is nowhere near sufficient.  The Department also funds approximately 170 staff in the local employment services.  This means we have 470 dedicated staff in this area.  However, we probably need close to 2,000 people.  These are the published OECD and European Union figures.  We are currently redeploying an additional 300 staff within the Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013110600012#N00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McKeon","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1383748200,"counter":528,"content":"<p>There is the question of those who are under 18.  The Department tends to get people when they are 18 because they are entitled to jobseeker's assistance from then.  Up to the age of 18 it is likely that any implementation plan responsibility would be seen as lying with the Department of Education and Skills.  In Ireland currently there is an offer of free secondary education up to the age of 18 and the completion of senior cycle.  Separately, there is a small proportion of people who drop out before that age, and the main provision is through the Department of Education and Skills in the form of Youthreach, which has been referred to already by several speakers.  It is run through VECs - now the education and training boards - with community training workshops operating a similar model to that which has been funded to date through F&Aacute;S.  It will now effectively be integrated into the education and training boards as well.  Examining the number of young people who drop out before that age and the range of provision through Youthreach and community training workshops, it seems that for those falling into great difficulty there are substantial levels of provision between workshops, Youthreach and a few other programmes for people who drop.

The cure is to target people who are long-term unemployed and need this the most.  That makes absolute sense.  At the same time, prevention would amount to allowing people who have been the recipients of much investment - that is, highly skilled graduates - to leave the country because there is a lack of opportunities.  I argue that we should not do so.  For society, the right way to invest the money in the first instance is to target those who need it most.  For the economy, there would be massive long-term damage if we did not allow for the people in whom we have invested much and who have much to offer in helping the country to recover.  If the youth guarantee is not going to be the solution for those people, we must formulate an alternative.<\/p><p>  On the youth entrepreneurship issue, there is the idea that it should be across all disciplines and course curriculums, but we must also move towards a position in which students across departments work together as part of a project team.

An implementation plan is being formulated and it must be delivered before the end of the year.  Will that be acted upon?  We need to deliver against that guarantee rather than just a budget.  At a minimum, we must consider how to deliver the guarantee and the cost of that delivery.  If we cannot deliver the guarantee for certain resource reasons, we may have to step back a bit.

Do the witnesses believe we could look at trying to incentivise that programme further by channelling resources towards increasing the amount a participant receives?  In rural areas and in the constituency I serve, one of the problems relayed to me is that people are delighted to get an internship, that they are learning, that it is good for their curriculum vitae and that they feel it enhances their prospects for future employment.  However, the cost of travelling to work and paying for lunches and so on is far more than &euro;50 in some cases, especially if one considers someone might have to travel from Ballinskelligs to Tralee in County Kerry, which is the same as travelling from Dublin to Limerick time-wise.

It would be a great help.  In a way, it would be like a dating website but for employment.  It would not disclose someone's personal information but rather basic information.

How will we get to the starting base to know the reality of what we are dealing with rather than just looking at the live register?<\/p><p>  Mr. Doorley mentioned churning.  How will we avoid churning?  If we put people through a scheme, how will we prevent them going back to square 1 once they finish their placement?  We do not want to move people from scheme to scheme.  How will we make sure they are in a sustainable position?  How will we track these people?  The National Youth Council of Ireland had a conference on the youth guarantee and a representative from the Finnish national youth council said that of those who completed the guarantee in Finland, 39% had disappeared from the statistics and that they do not know what they are doing. <\/p><p>  I refer to conditionality and the concerns raised about that.  Will sanctions be imposed on people who do not take up a particular position?  I mention the dangers that might surround an obligatory system which might not match particular skills or needs.  The long-term unemployed might eventually drift back into unemployment.  I know the career plan will be important but if we do not do it right, will the participant be punished for being put on the wrong scheme which he or she did not like and comes off it?  Is there room for trial and error?  As was mentioned, we must ensure jobseekers are at the centre of the initiative and that they are active participants.  Ms Whelan mentioned that we need to ensure young people do not just take up positions on a course based on availability in an area.  <\/p><p>  I refer to payments made to young jobseekers.  How will that happen?  Deputy Griffin mentioned people from rural areas.  If somebody in a rural area is looking at a position in his or her catchment area which does not meet his or her skillset, how will we ensure he or she can go from Cavan to Dublin, for example, to do a course which suits his or her career trajectory?  Ms Whelan mentioned the rurality issue also.  Does she believe the pilot in Ballymum will transfer to rural areas?  How will it be provided for in the future?<\/p><p>  I refer to funding.  The Swedish model was mentioned.  Based on the Swedish model, the ILO put the cost of the youth guarantee in Ireland at &euro;347 million, without the administrative costs.  When one adds the administrative costs, it will be &euro;435 million.  How did we get to the &euro;14 million formula?  How was it worked out that we would allocate &euro;14 million?

We are looking at this question using data from the CSO as well as our own data and have calculated that the number of people aged 18 to 24 who are inactive and not in touch with any of the services is extremely small.  That is primarily because the means test for people living at home for jobseeker's allowance is such that people will get something, even if their parents have middle to high levels of income if they register with the welfare services.

The EU commitment is that services will be available after four months.  However, we would not want the message to go out to young people that if they are unemployed for four months all of these options will be available to them if we cannot deliver.  That would be very detrimental and Deputy Ryan is right about that.  We are reaching a point where some hard choices will have to be made and obviously the Government and the Department will have to make those choices about where we start.  I acknowledge that we have probably been wrong in our approach in looking at the money and working backwards.  What we really need to do is determine what we need to deliver a youth guarantee.  We need to work out how many places we need, how much support is required and then examine the money question.  Even leaving aside the EU money, we need to look at it in the broader context of an investment in young people.  Obviously it will be great to get the money from the EU but we must not develop our plan solely on the basis of amounts emanating from the EU.<\/p><p>  Another issue which has not been raised is the contribution of employers.  We have a parallel labour market in a way, with very high tech areas where employers are screaming out for skilled people and on the other had, we have employers who are finding it difficult to get people to take the jobs they have on offer.  I am of the view that because employers benefit from the fact that people have received education and training, they should make some contribution to this.  If this is going to cost money but they are going to benefit from it, then it should not be just the taxpayer who is investing in the youth guarantee.  That needs to be examined, although perhaps not in the short term, given the timeframe involved.  However, in the longer term, the larger employers in particular, many of whom would probably be willing to contribute to a youth guarantee, should be asked to do so.  <\/p><p>  I agree with Deputy Griffin's point about the role of the universities and institutes of technology.  We would be of the view that the scheme should be nationally led but locally delivered, particularly in areas where there are universities or institutes of technology.  They could contribute a lot to the scheme.  Even in the context of Ballymun, DCU is only down the road and is a big employer.  <\/p><p>  Finally, regarding the question of sanctions, we must have a real debate on that.  We are concerned to ensure that the youth guarantee be seen as an opportunity for people.  Some young people might be sanctioned when they may have literacy issues and might not even understand the letters they are receiving.

To respond to Deputy Ryan's question, there are some jobs out there but we have found that because it is a locally-based solution, they are willing to create opportunities within their businesses for young people.  It is then up to young people to prove themselves and to create a permanent space for themselves.  We have also had a number of smaller firms in Tipperary who, because of their participation in this scheme and their general development, have new and upcoming opportunities and they will go for the devil they know rather than the devil they do not know.  If they have worked with somebody already through a scheme, they will make those opportunities available to that person in the first instance.<\/p><p>  Deputy Griffin asked about young people taking up jobs.  Young people have to be convinced of the merits of taking up employment and of the benefits of work experience to their curriculum vitae.  That might go some way towards cancelling out the costs of taking up work or work experience, particularly when they are not getting additional supports.  Sometimes we underestimate the enthusiasm and eagerness of our young people to get work.  <\/p><p>  Finally, local employment services and jobs clubs do exist and are certainly an avenue for providing opportunities for young people, via the youth guarantee.  However, there must be other responses too.  Some of those responses may need to be softer because we are dealing with young people who are under 25 and who have a different set of needs to older unemployed people.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013110600015#Q00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Cora Horgan"},{"type":"speech","time":1383749400,"counter":558,"content":"<p>Thank you.

On Syria, Mr. Wrafter's notes refer to a special session on Syria being held on 2 December 2011 and states that a rapporteur on the human rights situation was appointed at that time.  Some NGOs working in the region - not just in Syria but also in the adjoining countries - have before this committee described the position there as the humanitarian issue of our generation.  Is this on the agenda of every session of the Human Rights Council?  If not, it would be highly remiss of it.<\/p><p>  I wish to raise two further issues, the first of which concerns Israel's continued violation of human rights.  The Palestinian people have ensured more than four decades of military occupation.  They have witnessed - and unfortunately continue to witness - violence against civilians, restrictions on movement and forced displacement of persons.  I understand that at the human rights session last March, the European Union stated it \"would like to avoid the proliferation of reports and mechanisms under item 7\".  Moreover, the European Union did not participate in the item 7 discussions in June and September.  This is happening despite Israel's continued violation of international law and it must be disappointing if the European Union is literally withdrawing from discussion of that issue at the Human Rights Council.  Is it the policy of the Department or the Government to prioritise the raising of Israel's ongoing violation of human rights and international law?  Can Ireland, through its membership of the European Union and of the Human Rights Council, encourage the European Union to participate on this particular issue?  It is a major Union and trading bloc comprising 28 countries and the withdrawal of our representative - that is, the voice of the European Union - from such discussions on important issues sends out a bad message and exacerbates the climate of impunity for violations.  This must be of concern to Ireland because, over the years, successive Governments have consistently raised the entire Israel-Palestine issue.<\/p><p>  I have one further question concerning the expiration of the millennium development goals.  Mr. Wrafter will be aware that some organisations welcomed them, while others criticised some of the different measures.  In its recent international development policy and strategy, the Government quite rightly notes the promotion of human rights and international development as being part of our foreign policy, and in respect of international development, it also notes the importance of promoting and protecting human rights through development co-operation.  One is very much dependent on and supportive of the other.  What policy does or will Ireland have to maximise the work on the Human Rights Council to press for human rights to be a central focus in the ongoing debates on the future of international development policy after 2015 on foot of the expiration of the millennium development goals?  At times, 2015 can appear to be a long way away.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013110600004#C00500","speaker":"970","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1383749400,"counter":583,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his comments and observations.  He mentioned NGOs, Syria, Israel, international development, human rights and the proposed 2015 agenda.  I will deal with them in that order.<\/p><p>  I did not mention in my statement that we enjoyed a good relationship with the Irish NGOs working in the area of human rights.  Through the standing committee which meets four or five times a year where we have an exchange of views with human rights organisations on what is happening at the Human Rights Council.  We have found these exchanges extremely valuable, both in preparing us for membership and also in terms of what we do as a member of the council.  It is partly for that reason that we place such emphasis on civil society space.  We hear from the Irish NGOs about the problems relating to the shrinkage of civil society space that they are experiencing and of which they are aware in countries in Africa and eastern Europe.<\/p><p>  In Syria the situation is, of course, to put it mildly, deplorable.  Peace remains our overall objective.  The most important priority in the short term is to ensure there will be full participation in the Geneva II talks, whenever they take place.  It is not quite clear when they will take place.  From the Irish Government's position, it is for the people of Syria to choose their own government, but it is impossible to envisage a continued role for President Assad and his closest affiliates in any new Syrian leadership.  The Assad regime has committed serious war crimes, as have parts of the opposition.  There must be accountability for the horrendous violations of international law, including the use of chemical weapons, committed during the war.  As a matter of record, the question of human rights in Syria was raised at the Human Rights Council in September.  We made a long statement on 16 September in which we expressed our concerns about what was happening in the country.<\/p><p>  We take a strong position on the question of human rights in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories.  We intervened most recently at the universal periodic review, UPR, hearing on Israel which took place the week before last when we raised a number of issues, including, specifically, the detention of Palestinian children and their treatment at military courts.  We also raised the questions of the demolition of houses and restrictions on humanitarian assistance for the victims of such demolition.<\/p><p>  There has been a debate inside the European Union on Item 7.  The Israelis argue that they are discriminated against because Israel is the only country with its own agenda item at the Human Rights Council.  This dates back to the establishment of the council in 2005-06.  The EU position is that we will continue to raise the question of the situation in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories regularly in the three sessions per year of the Human Rights Council under whatever agenda item is appropriate.  The question of intervening on Item 7 is open.  There is an ongoing debate in the European Union about the appropriateness of intervening, but the Deputy can rest assured that we will continue to argue for a full expression of the Union's views on human rights.<\/p><p>  The Deputy raised the question of development and human rights.  This is a matter of particular interest to Ireland.  It is an area in which my unit and I do not take the lead.  It is taken by the development co-operation division of the Department.  Frankly, the question of the relationship between development and human rights was avoided in the drawing up of the millennium development goals the last time out, with the exception of gender issues.  This time we must be much more conscious that development and human rights are two sides of the one coin.  The debate will take place in New York rather than Geneva, but we are already keenly aware of the issues the Deputy has raised and on which we are working closely with our colleagues in Irish Aid.  Speaking personally, one can no longer distinguish between the two issues as they are two sides of the same coin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013110600005#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colin Wrafter"},{"type":"speech","time":1383749400,"counter":584,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Wrafter for the report.<\/p><p>  From being a member of this committee and heading the Irish section of the Association of European Parliamentarians with Africa, AWEPA, in which role I have visited a number of African countries, there is no doubt that Ireland is held in high regard.  Sometimes we do not capitalise enough on this.  It has come from a variety of sources, including the Department, the NGOs which are doing amazing work, missionaries who forged the trail initially and our ambassadors.  Certainly, our ambassadors to Lesotho and Nigeria whom I met are very much hands on and actively involved in what is going on.  They have greatly enhanced Ireland's reputation.<\/p><p>  I support what Deputy Brendan Smith stated about human rights being at the centre.  I also welcome what Mr. Wrafter stated, that development and human rights go together.  I refer to one right, in particular, the right to decent work.  During the centuries we have seen historical patterns of exploitation of workers, for example in Africa, in the growth of certain industries, including those involved in extraction, but there are others.  There will be massive growth in agricultural production, etc.  We can use our position because we are represented in these countries and they listen to us.  We can put the right to decent work, labour conditions, pay, health and safety on the agenda.  In that regard, I want to see Ireland playing a bigger role.  I am always struck by the disconnect between what is written on paper about rights and the abuse of these rights.  We can be a strong voice in that regard.<\/p><p>  I mention Colombia, in particular.  Looking at our policies, we want to defend civil society space.  We defended a resolution on reprisals against human rights activists, yet there are significant abuses of those involved in civil society in Colombia, particularly trade unionists and farmers.  Only today we received word about another murder, the murder of Mr. C&eacute;sar Garcia, an environmental activist and farmer who was murdered in front of his children.  That crime will go unpunished.  There was also a report about a particular community which had been displaced.  Under the Santos Administration, they were allowed to return, but they have since been displaced again.  Another trade unionist, Mr. Huber Ballesteros, is in jail for doing what we in western society do all the time - speak outing and making our voices heard.  Any trade agreement must include a clause on guaranteeing respect for human rights.<\/p><p>  On the gender issue, the matter of child brides is still significant.  It amounts to gross exploitation.  Children have been taken forcibly from families.  Does this form part of the gender debate in which the Department is involved?<\/p><p>  We have spoken about the situation in Syria.

As I stated in response to Deputy Brendan Smith, the development and human rights agendas are moving closer together.  From an Irish Aid perspective, we are conscious that we need to be able to interact, both in terms of our programmes and also policy, with our host or partner countries.  What we try to do is encourage these countries to respect human rights standards.

Collectively, we sing from the same hymn sheet where human rights are concerned, but I wonder whether we are not in a bubble.  Perhaps Mr. Wrafter might help me to understand whether that is the case.<\/p><p>  We should record the fact that the Chairman and all members of the committee worked assiduously with the ambassadors from each country with a view to lobbying them in support of our nomination.  It was an extra tier of lobbying.  Ireland is one of 47 countries represented around the table.  We have a sophisticated western liberal democracy&rsquo;s attitude to the issues of female genital mutilation, child brides and hunger.  I was interested in learning from the briefing notes that we were working extremely hard to achieve limited goals.  However, I presume we must also contend with opposition at meetings of the Human Rights Council.  Mr. Wrafter supported the Hungarian position, for example.  The case for human rights defenders not being discriminated against was won, but there were people on the council who voted against this.  Ireland fought very hard to get its nominee on the council.  Is Mr. Wrafter telling me that not all 47 council members adhere to the principles to which we adhere?  Are there internal struggles.  It is interesting to note the voting patterns of some representatives.  Only one voted against the Hungarian position, but there was a substantial number of abstentions.  Are we viewing the human rights arena differently from others?<\/p><p>  With regard to the issue of female genital mutilation, we discovered that it was part of the culture when we were in Sierra Leone where some 50% of the children were affected.  It is almost like making one's First Holy Communion in that it is a big event in the village.  There will never be a shortage of human rights issues to be addressed.  There are millions of them and the case in Syria is the one making the headlines.  There are huge problems that we have not mentioned, including the human rights issue affecting the Roma, many million of whom are floating around Ireland, England and the rest of Europe.  What is our position on it?<\/p><p>  What is the position of the 47 ambassadors on the vulnerability of minorities?  Gays and lesbians comprise but one minority and their case keeps being highlighted.  There are also religious minorities operating in very restricted conditions.  I include Christians in the Sahel area where Muslim terrorism is strong.  There were recent horrors in Kenya involving guns.  It reminded me of Northern Ireland when people were pulled from the back of a lorry and asked whether they were Catholic or Protestant.  Either the Catholics or Protestants were killed; I forget which.  Elsewhere, individuals were asked whether they were Muslim and if they could not recite the equivalent of the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer or something else, they got a bullet in the head.  Is there a western view of what constitutes human rights and is there another view?  What is the political balance among the 47 representatives?<\/p><p>  Mr. Wrafter has stated the council has been mandated to provide technical assistance.  Can we receive further information on this?  How does the council provide technical assistance and for capacity-building?  Is there a separate budget for such matters?<\/p><p>  It is important that Mr. Wrafter highlight the space for civil society.  This is key because, if it is provided, it will open all sorts of doors.<\/p><p>  I would have believed the health of children under five years would have been more a matter for UNICEF or the World Health Organization.  How does the council relate with those charged with the provision of health care for the children in question?<\/p><p>  I believed I had heard of all the countries in the world until Mr. Wrafter mentioned Tuvalu.

Having said that, every country has its own interests.  In our membership of the Human Rights Council we are not pretending to prioritise everything.  We could not possibly do so.  What we are doing is picking issues we believe are important and in respect of which we have something to offer.  A good example is the issue of mortality among the under-fives.<\/p><p>  Civil society space is an issue in many countries which may have many kinds of political system.  There are problems in Africa and eastern Europe.  Some countries place great emphasis on economic and social rights.  Traditionally, western countries have emphasised political and civil rights.

There are a number of human rights principles that should be at the core of our thinking in all aspects of the post-2015 agenda, including the importance of addressing inequality and discrimination.  Inequality and discrimination against vulnerable groups constitute one of the main barriers to achieving the eradication of poverty, including extreme poverty.<\/p><p>  Gender equality and women's empowerment will be a critical element of this, and action to address this must be strengthened in the new post-2015 framework.  A cross-cutting approach to inequality is essential, including recognising the rights of vulnerable and marginalised people everywhere, including poor people and persons who may be marginalised for other reasons, such as persons with disabilities, children, ethnic groups or geographically marginalised groups.  <\/p><p>  Ireland also recognises the importance of supporting governance as well as designing a framework to address the needs of conflict-affected and fragile states, and that would address critical development to challenges related to conflict and violence.

Other speakers mentioned the great excitement both at this committee and across development organisations when Ireland gained a place on the UN Human Rights Council.

Does he see a difficulty with special trade agreements between those two regions, Ireland and the EU generally?  Given the human rights record in Colombia and Israel, many people feel this is almost like rewarding bad behaviour, rather than tackling it.  Does Mr. Wrafter have a view on that?<\/p><p>  Can Mr. Wrafter give an overview of what we are, and will be, doing differently on that council?  Do we see ourselves as a voice for people who are not on the council?  Can Mr. Wrafter cite some examples in that regard?<\/p><p>  Mr. Wrafer mentioned human rights offenders.  The Universal Periodic Review of Development and Co-operation refers to operations and recommendations, as well as playing a role in the development of co-operation and work in partner countries.

Are UPR recommendations included when decisions are made concerning the focus of Irish Aid's work?<\/p><p>  The issue of human rights abuses comes up all the time, but what about alleged human rights abuses in Ireland?  What is Mr. Wrafter's view on that?  Does his office receive letters on such matters?  What is the structure concerning that?  Is his office seen as part of the much larger organisation, or can he engage in dealing with such matters?<\/p><p>  Other speakers have mentioned placing human rights at the heart of the post-2015 development.  Irish Government policy for international development notes the importance placed by citizen-organised civil society on promoting and protecting human rights.  Can Ireland capitalise on its membership of the UN Human Rights Council to press for human rights to be at the centre of critical ongoing debates at UN level?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013110600007#F00400","speaker":"1037","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1383751200,"counter":594,"content":"<p>This folder here contains all the statements we have made at the UN Human Rights Council over the past three months.  The reason I am showing it is that as a member of the council we try, in so far as possible, to engage on almost every issue.  To give an extreme example, in September we intervened in a debate on albinism, the rights of albinos, which is a particular problem in African countries.  We are very conscious of our responsibility as a member of the council to engage with issues that may not normally be on our radar.<\/p><p>  The Deputy raised the issue of the universal periodic review, UPR and Irish Aid.  We are very conscious that there has to be a relationship between what Ireland is doing on the ground in aid countries and the human rights situation in them.  Nigeria, which is not a partner country, is an example of where there are problems with anti-gay legislation.  In Uganda, which is a partner country, there have also been problems with anti-gay legislation and irresponsible rhetoric in this area by local politicians.  We have made our position quite clear both publicly and privately in this regard.  It is almost a rule that where an Irish Aid partner country is examined under the UPR, we take a definite interest in that examination and make recommendations through our embassies on the ground.  Irish non-governmental organisations also lobby us on particular issues in various countries.<\/p><p>  There is much follow-up work on the two national initiatives mentioned already, civil society and space and preventable under-fives morbidity and mortality.  We have started the ball rolling in both of these but we need to keep it so.  As I stated earlier in my presentation, we hope to have a more substantive resolution on civil society-space at the September 2014 session.<\/p><p>  We will continue to follow the human rights situations in particular countries.  The Hungarian resolution on reprisals against human rights defenders where they co-operate with the UN is a good example of where we have taken an active role.  It was not our baby but we felt it was an important role.  Norway led on the human rights defenders issue at the March 2013 session, an occasion on which we took an active role in support of it.  At the General Assembly, Norway has a resolution on women human rights defenders which is related to but not the same resolution.  Again, we are taking an active role in promoting this.  We want to contribute to the work of the council, help make a difference, in so far as we can, but also to enhance our reputation as a serious player in the international human rights fora, as well as a country with a strong and honourable tradition of promoting and protecting human rights that goes right back to the 1960s.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013110600008#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colin Wrafter"},{"type":"speech","time":1383751200,"counter":595,"content":"<p>To answer Deputy Eric Byrne&rsquo;s earlier question, Tuvalu is a Polynesian island, a former UK colony, whose Head of State is Queen Elizabeth and its national anthem is &ldquo;God Save the Queen&rdquo;.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013110600008#G00300","speaker":"974"},{"type":"speech","time":1383751200,"counter":596,"content":"<p>I congratulate the Chairman on all the research he did in the meantime.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013110600008#G00400","speaker":"1030"},{"type":"speech","time":1383751200,"counter":597,"content":"<p>Maybe we could distribute atlases to all members.<\/p><p>  I regret we do not have a sub-committee on human rights.  The committee&rsquo;s remit was extended to include trade but there was no extension to cover human rights.  This is unfortunate, particularly considering our role on the UN Human Rights Council.<\/p><p>  It is hard for Ireland to move child morbidity and mortality as an individual issue because it is linked to the millennium goals.  I feel we are aiming low in our aspirations when we should be aiming higher.  Being tied into the EU Presidency earlier this year gave us some opportunities but it also limited what we could raise.<\/p><p>  There are other human rights issues which we could tackle.  My colleagues earlier brought up the issue of human rights clauses being included in trade agreements.  I know Ireland pushed hard to have such a clause included in the Colombian trade agreement, much to the resistance of many.  However, clear violations of human rights clauses have no consequences for trade agreements.  Could the delegation expand on this?  What are the reporting mechanisms for such breaches?  Relying on individual governments to investigate themselves which could result in the suspension of a trade agreement is laughable.<\/p><p>  I note Sri Lanka will chair the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting next week but Canada has refused to attend it because of concerns, that in the space of a little over 100 days during the final days of the country's civil war, Sri Lankan forces killed between 40,000 and 70,000 civilians in a no-fire zone.  A UN report was done on this and the UN Secretary General discussed the matter with the Sri Lankan President, and his brother who is foreign Minister.  They have not been held to account when there is a case for war crimes and crimes against humanity.  There was no follow-up to some of the recommendations of the UN report on what happened in Sri Lanka.  It made it quite clear that Sri Lanka needed to investigate events at army level, up to the commander in chief, and at a political level.  What is Ireland doing about this?  Will it raise it at the next council meeting?<\/p><p>  The Sri Lankan President being made the chair of the Commonwealth is nothing short of rewarding war criminals.  As leader of his country, he orchestrated an attack and told his generals to set up no-fire zones where people were told they would be safe.  Every time they moved into these zones, however, they were targeted by the Sri Lankan military which resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of innocent civilians.  I will accept there were war crimes on both sides.  However, Ireland should raise this matter at the council.  We should grab the opportunity even if it upsets some people.  If we are on the council only to make friends of the whole world, we will definitely achieve nothing.  We have a Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade but no human rights Minister or committee that could assist this delegation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013110600008#G00500","speaker":"1159","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1383751800,"counter":599,"content":"<p>Thank you, Senator Daly.

I welcome co-operation with Hungary in regard to the civil society space.  I am pleased to see that link-up, because I see many instances, particularly at EU level, where people criticise that country without having done any research.  In fact, Hungary has changed its constitution and done a great deal of good work on fundamental human rights.  It might not, however, conform to the ideological selectivity that goes on in some areas regarding human rights, which are distorted into adult rights rather than human rights.<\/p><p>  I also welcome the campaign to prevent mortality and morbidity among children under five years of age.  That is a very good initiative.<\/p><p>  The report refers to the safeguarding of freedom of opinion, expression and religion as priorities for Ireland.  I would argue that freedom of conscience, which is something more than just freedom of opinion and expression, should be included.  We saw a serious breach of that principle in these Houses before the summer.  It is important that we recognise where we are failing.  We might not have a great deal of credibility on this issue at this time, in light of the events to which I referred, but we should try to include it.  It is a factor in many countries across the world.<\/p><p>  With regard to the promotion of gender equality, a heavy emphasis should be placed on developing a strategy to oppose the practice of rape being used as a weapon of war.  That is very common in many parts of the world and has horrendous effects on the victims and on society as a whole.  It should be a strong priority for us.  In the context of a three-year term, there is time presumably to flush out and enhance the agenda.<\/p><p>  Regarding freedom of religion, the persecution of Christians is probably the single most significant discrimination applying to any minority group.  The number of Christians killed every year is quite significant and much of it is taking place in the Middle East.  We have talked before in this committee about Boko Haram in Nigeria, the situation in Egypt and so on.  In fairness, this is also a problem in Europe, where we see a growing but more subtle intolerance and discrimination against Christians.  Standing up for the rights of Christians flies in the face of some of these ideological movements, but it should be done.  The right to life is fundamental.<\/p><p>  I attended the launch last Thursday of a book by Ann Cadwallader called <i>Lethal Allies<\/i> which deals with the collusion that applied during the Troubles, particularly within the murder triangle in Northern Ireland.  Many of the victims told their stories to the justice committee, of which I was a member at the time.  They are seeking the truth of what happened.  Mr. Justice Barron, who chaired the initial inquiry into these matters, sought to assist them, as did the justice committee and indeed the Houses of Oireachtas.  A motion was passed by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann calling on the British Government to co-operate, but that has never fully happened.  The message must go out that where a person fails to co-operate with inquiries or conceals information that would expose collusion, then that is a continuation of the collusion.  Such a person is as complicit as if he or she was involved from day 1 in the atrocities.  That message needs to be brought home to the British Administration.  Our position on the Human Rights Council should be used to highlight this issue of collusion, which is also happening in other countries, including Sri Lanka.<\/p><p>  An issue about which I feel very strongly from a human rights perspective is the protection of the unborn.  I was appalled last week to see an attempt at the European Parliament to have abortion - the killing of the unborn - declared a human right.  That is an appalling position.  Can the delegates tell me whether Mr. Anand Grover is the rapporteur to the Human Rights Council?  In his capacity as rapporteur to one of the UN's human rights committees, he goes around the world promoting abortion, which is the killing of the most innocent of all.  If anybody dismembered a baby at one, two or three months of age, it would be considered a major crime and there would be a huge outcry globally.  The fact that it is done three or four months earlier does not make it any less of an atrocity.  The protection of the unborn  should be declared a human right.  The inclusion of that protection in our Constitution puts us in a position to advocate and promote the principle at European level.<\/p><p>  I presume the UN will be marking the fact that 2014 has been declared the year of the family.  I would like to see an initiative which seeks to give a human rights underpinning to the family.  In all objective surveys that are done, particularly in larger countries, there is clear evidence that the institution of marriage provides far and away the best outcome for children.  If we place children as our priority, we must move away from a position where certain human rights are allowed to morph into adult human rights rather than human rights <i>per se<\/i>.  Our human rights evolve in the mere fact that we are human.  We should try to promote that philosophy and have it accepted more widely.  That is not to claim that women are not affected by the abortion issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013110600009#H01100","speaker":"1126","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1383752400,"counter":610,"content":"<p>I want to raise a topic I have raised before.  To what extent do we make an effort to deal with the human rights of prisoners in various hot spots across the globe?  We have referred to a number of locations at committee meetings.  In some former or serving politicians have been interned.  There may be different degrees to which their human rights have been abused, but I know from visits to Israel that at least four groups, three in particular, have taken prisoners in the past few years.  The prisoners are not treated well, for want of a better description.  There is also the case of Ms Tymoshenko which has been ongoing for a number of years.  We have raised other issues here, including the detention of an Irish citizen overseas.  We spend a lot of time agonising over the issue and I wonder to what extent the international community is alert to it, having been prompted by Ireland.  I compliment the Department on the work it has done on it.  Is the international community sensitive to these issues or does it just hope they will go away?  On my most recent visit to Israel, I was anxious to meet prisoners in all areas to find out exactly what was going on.

His comments about gender equality and rape as a weapon of war are correct.  It is a source of serious concern for us that gender-based violence is a problem in Syria and the Democratic Republic of Congo.  Rape has been a problem in the Balkans where it has been used as a weapon of war.  In the context of peacekeeping and the Security Council, it is important that the gender equality aspects of peacekeeping and the reconciliation process in various countries take account of the need to deal with these problems.<\/p><p>  With regard to the persecution of Christians in which the Senator has a strong interest, we are very concerned about the position in a number of countries.  This applies in general in the context of freedom of religious beliefs and particularly in the context of the persecution of Christians.  In Iran we are very unhappy with the position of the Baha'i community.  Baha'i is not even recognised by the authorities as a religion, whereas Christianity is recognised as a legitimate religion by the government.  The political turmoil that has overwhelmed many countries in the Middle East in recent years has led to unprecedented concerns which we share about the safety of Christians in Egypt, Iraq and now, pressingly, Syria.  This is an issue in which the Senator has a particular interest.  The descent of Syria into violence and disarray has left small Christian communities very exposed and sometimes subject to direct attack.  We raised the issue of the safety of Christians in our bilateral contacts with the countries in question, stressing the responsibility of the government concerned to protect minorities.  There was a meeting of the European Union Foreign Affairs Council on 21 August.  In his interventions at the Council the T&aacute;naiste ensured there was particular reference to the persecution of Christians in the Middle East in the statement released by the Council.  In the Middle East region Irish Embassy officials have met local Christian leaders to discuss issues affecting their communities.  Sometimes, as the Senator will appreciate, we are asked not to say things in public because it can work to the detriment of those involved, but we do what we can.  Certainly, in contacts with governments we stress their responsibilities.  There is a question about the individual rights of members of Christian communities, but there is also the danger to the heritage, including the cultural heritage, of Christian communities dating back almost 2000 years in countries in the Middle East.<\/p><p>  I note what the Senator has said about the year of the family.  I am not completely up to speed on it, but he makes a valid point on human rights in the context of the family.<\/p><p>  Deputy Bernard J. Durkan asked about prisoners, which issue arises in particular but not exclusively in the context of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails.  A topic which we have not mentioned is the death penalty.  We are active in a bilateral, quiet way in countries in which the death penalty is still used in trying to work towards a situation where it will eventually be phased out.  We are also active in the context of a resolution passed every second year at the United Nations General Assembly, not the Human Rights Council, on the death penalty.  We were active last year and will be active again next year. <\/p><p>  Deputy Dan Neville referred to mental health, a matter of which the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is cognisant.  There was reference to the need to help people with disabilities in the context of development.  We see this as a human rights-based approach to vulnerable persons in countries with which we deal.

As always, it is a pleasure to come before the select committee.  The Arms Trade Treaty was adopted by the UN General Assembly on 2 April last by a very large majority of states.  The text was negotiated at two diplomatic conferences held in July 2012 and March 2013.  It is the product of a very positive and constructive process in which all states participated and involved a substantial input from civil society, with which my Department maintains a regular channel of communication.<\/p><p>  The process which ultimately led to the Arms Trade Treaty could be said to have begun before 2000, with efforts in the United Nations to find a shared approach to the problem of the uncontrolled spread of small arms and light weapons.  However, it was not until 2006 that the first resolution on the Arms Trade Treaty was passed in the General Assembly.  The subsequent negotiating process was marked by strong support from across all regions.  The support of those states most affected by uncontrolled flows of weapons in Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, in particular, was vital to ensuring the successful outcome of the process.<\/p><p>  Ireland and the European Union also made a strong contribution to the process.  We were particularly committed to ensuring that the treaty contained strong provisions on international humanitarian law and international human rights law, as well as provisions relating to the often disproportionate impact of weapons and conflict on women and children.<\/p><p>  For the first time, the treaty sets out legally binding obligations on states involved in the arms trade.  These include an obligation to deny authorisation for an arms transfer where the arms involved would be used to commit genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes or attacks on civilians; an obligation not to authorise arms transfers which would have a negative impact on<\/p><p>  In Ireland, we already have an export control system in place which meets the requirements of the Arms Trade Treaty.  For this reason, the implementation of the treaty in Ireland will not require additional legislation.  Our export control system is run by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, which considers all applications for licences to export military goods in consultation with my Department.  The criteria used to consider such applications are set out in the EU common position on military transfers, 2008\/944\/CFSP.  As it is the outcome of a negotiating process, the Arms Trade Treaty is not perfect and there are areas in which we would have liked stronger provisions to be included.  For example, there is no common definition of the term \"overriding risk\" with regard to violations of human rights.  While arms and ammunition must be included in export control regulations, they are not covered by the obligations relating to imports, brokering or transit, or under the transparency measures.  We would also have liked the reference to gender-based violence to be stronger.<\/p><p>  Nevertheless, the Arms Trade Treaty represents a very significant step forward.  Never before has the international community set out, on a legally binding basis, the terms to be observed in authorising the transfer of arms.  Never before has the vital importance of assessing the likely end use, the consequences of transfers on civilian populations and the link between arms transfers and human rights been set out so clearly.<\/p><p>  The treaty will not achieve anything if it is not adequately implemented.  This is the next phase of activity.  Already, 114 states have signed the treaty, including all 28 EU member states, and eight states have ratified it.  It is noteworthy that seven of the eight states that have ratified the treaty are from regions affected by the illicit trade in arms - the Caribbean and Africa.  The treaty will enter into force 90 days after the 50th state ratifies it.  It is important that entry into force come as early as possible.  I am determined that Ireland should deposit its instrument of ratification as soon as possible in order that we contribute to early entry into force.  With the approval of this motion, Ireland will have completed its domestic procedures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOS2013110600002#A00300","speaker":"951","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1383757200,"counter":624,"content":"<p>I welcome this treaty and compliment officials and the T&aacute;naiste on their participation in the treaty talks.  This is a landmark arms trade treaty.  It has been a long-standing Irish policy over decades to seek a ban on the illegal trading of arms.  This policy probably goes back to the 1940s when Frank Aiken was Minister for Foreign Affairs.  Ireland got great plaudits at the time for the efforts made by it as a relatively young State and the lead it took on these issues.<\/p><p>  There are many positive aspects to the treaty.  The briefing note we received states that the arms trade treaty, ATT, prohibits a state from authorising arms exports where it has knowledge that the weapons will be used in the commission of genocide, crimes against humanity, grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and other war crimes.  This is particularly appropriate at a time when we are seeing so much devastation, loss of life, hardship and infliction of pain in areas such as Syria and many other places throughout the world.  I hope the treaty can be ratified and that the figure of 50 states can be reached as soon as possible.<\/p><p>  The industries involved in the manufacture of arms make huge profits.  Perhaps we should consider the imposition of a levy on those profits to generate revenue to ensure the treaty is implemented as comprehensively as possible.  The T&aacute;naiste said that we would give whatever assistance we could to countries that might not have the capacity or expertise to reach the standards required in this area.  Perhaps the industry itself should be obliged to contribute towards advancing the treaty and ensuring it is as effective as possible.

Deputy Smith suggested the imposition of a levy to generate resources in respect of implementation.  That is a worthwhile proposal.  A UN trust fund - UNSCAR - which is designed to facilitate implementation and provide help to NGOs which are involved in assistance programmes has been established.  This could possibly be used for the purpose to which the Deputy refers.<\/p><p>  Deputy Crowe referred to our EU partners.  The treaty will require the approval of the Foreign Affairs Council because there are shared competences involved.  There is already a European Union export control system in place and a common position arrived at in 2008 governs the export of military and technological equipment.  The common position to which I refer is actually more stringent in nature that what is contained in the ATT.  As a result of the fact that it is already in operation here, we do not need to introduce new legislation in order to give effect to this.  Export shipments from Ireland mainly involve components such as the ball bearings - to which Deputy Durkan referred - electronic equipment, digital material and so on.  In many cases, this is dual use material.  What happens is that an exporter will apply to the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation which will then consult the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade with regard to the country to which that exporter wishes to ship goods.  If an issue arises in respect of human rights or whatever, we will make a judgment with regard to the use to which the relevant equipment is likely to be put and we may decide that a licence should not be issued.  That is the system which is currently in place.  The ATT places an obligation on countries involved in importing goods.<\/p><p>  Deputy Eric Byrne inquired about the countries which voted against the treaty.  These were Iran, North Korea and Syria.<\/p><p>  Deputy Durkan asked about the countries which have not signed up to the treaty.  We are involved in a process here.  This country has a long record of promoting disarmament over many decades.  I acknowledge the role played by Frank Aiken in that regard in the 1950s.  The process begins with the emergence of a UN treaty - in this case the ATT - and countries then sign it.  The latter is their indication of support for the treaty, which they must then ratify.  The treaty comes into effect when a certain threshold is reached.  In this instance, the number is 50.  When that number of states ratify the treaty, it will come into force 90 days later.  It will then be a matter of trying to encourage the remaining countries involved to ratify it, those who have not yet done so to sign it and to implement it.  The position with regard to the penalties and sanctions to be applied will evolve over time.  Penalties and sanctions will probably be imposed on a case-by-case basis.<\/p><p>  I was asked if the treaty explicitly covers components.  It does not do so but the European Union export control system makes provision in that regard.  The treaty does not cover ammunition.  However, Ireland, along with the majority of other states, did seek to have ammunition included within the scope of the treaty.<\/p><p>  As Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan stated, the treaty is not perfect.  However, it represents both a start and progress.  The international community has placed major emphasis on nuclear disarmament and there have been discussions in recent times on the problem of chemical weapons.  Much of the suffering and grief that occurs across the globe is largely as a result of the sale of smaller arms and this treaty represents the start of a process to try to control and regulate the trade in this regard.  There is still a long way to go in terms of having the treaty implemented but we have made a positive start.  We sought the putting in place of a treaty of this nature and I am of the view that it represents progress.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOS2013110600004#C00100","speaker":"951"},{"type":"speech","time":1383757800,"counter":632,"content":"<p>I thank the T&aacute;naiste.

The Department has indicated that the last date for Ireland to opt into the first three-month period is mid-December.  A briefing document has been circulated to members.  I welcome the Minister and his officials to this meeting.  They are here to assist the committee in its consideration of these matters.  I invite the Minister to brief us on the motions.

I thank the committee for its willingness to deal with this matter today.  It is important that Ireland is seen to be in a position to play a full part in the negotiations which have begun on both of these instruments.  A positive response to the motions which have been tabled will facilitate that objective.  Both proposals were presented by the Commission in July of this year.  In effect, they amend proposals into which we have already opted.  Their legal basis is to be found in Title V of Part Three of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.  In consequence, the protocol we share with the UK, whereby we have three months to exercise our option to take part in the adoption and application of relevant measures, applies.  The exercise of that option is, of course, subject to the prior approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas.<\/p><p>  We have been informed that the three-month period in respect of the proposal relating to Regulation 1215\/2012, commonly referred to as the Brussels I Regulation, will expire on 18 December next.  The expiry date for the other proposal has yet to be determined, but it is likely to be early in the new year.  In case there is any confusion on this point, I should explain that the three-month period runs from the date on which the last official language version of a proposal was circulated to the Council.  Therefore, it is not always the case that the period expires exactly three months after the date of the Commission proposal as first published.  There are two motions before the committee for consideration.  In the interests of efficiency, I would like to deal with both of them in this presentation.  These proposals are the most recent in a long line of proposals to which the protocol applies and which have come before the Houses of the Oireachtas in recent years.  Neither is especially controversial.  I hope the committee will be willing to give them its support.<\/p><p>  I will turn firstly to the proposal which has as its objective the amendment of the Brussels I Regulation.  That instrument has been part of our legal order in one guise or another since the 1980s.  It is widely regarded as a seminal instrument in the civil justice area.  It provides a degree of certainty in relation to which court in which member state will take jurisdiction in an international case.  It also provides a mechanism enabling judgments given in one member state to be recognised and enforced in each of the other member states.  The most recent revision of the Brussels I Regulation took place in 2011.  Those revisions are due to apply from January 2015.   A key feature of the new instrument is that a declaration of enforceability will no longer be needed before a judgment coming from one member state is enforceable in another.  This represents a simplification of the scheme which currently applies.  The need for an amendment to Brussels I arises because certain adjustments are needed to accommodate an agreement which was reached in December 2012 on what is generally referred to as the \"patents package\".<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013110600002#A00300","speaker":"1025","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1383747000,"counter":644,"content":"<p>We could not possibly comment.

Second, there is no duplication of paperwork.  Third, it is much cheaper.<\/p><p>  The patents package will have four major advantages.  The first two are costs and administration.  It creates a unitary patent with a unit form protection, so it will be across the 25 member states that are participating in it.  The unitary patent will be available in the one-stop shop at an affordable cost, granted by the European Patent Office, with no further need for validation or translation.  It will create a unified and specialised patent court for participating member states, which is the big issue around the holding of a referendum.  This single jurisdiction for patent matters will enhance legal certainty.  It obviates the possibility of different courts in different jurisdictions reaching different conclusions in this area.  There will no longer be a need to take individual court proceedings across patent countries.  If there is an allegation of a breach of a patent at the moment in more than one EU country, one could find oneself engaged in a multiplicity of litigation.  The new system would bring that possibility to an end.  It would also ensure that patent information is available in all the official languages of the European Union though computer translation.  The information would be available online and be free of charge.<\/p><p>  If we are talking about doing business in Europe and about the major multinational companies in this country engaged in research and development, then instead of having to register their patent in Ireland, in England, in France, in Italy and so on, they will register it with the European Patent Office and upon registration, that patent is effective in 25 different EU member states.  There are huge savings to businesses, as I pointed out in my speech.  The variation in estimates is enormous, but common sense indicates that there will be substantial savings.

I echo Senator Zappone's words about our being ready to help.  The second proposal, which I gather is the first one on our agenda, is the motion relating to COM (2013) 452, which has a rather obscure title.  I am keen to explore the matter a little further.  As the Minister has said, the Commission has proposed that the delegated acts approach is preferable for each of the instruments listed.  As I understand it, this is a compendium proposal that covers a range of more than 160 legislative acts.  The Commission is seeking to provide for the proposal to go through a different process, that is, the delegated acts approach.  The Minister stated member states are not completely enthused by this, that negotiations have begun on the proposal and that differing views have been expressed and so on.<\/p><p>  This gets to the heart of an issue I often have when we are debating proposals for European Union measures in the committee.  There is something of a lack of information for us about what position Ireland is taking in these negotiations.  Are we enthused by the delegated acts approach?  I assume from the Minister's language that we are not and that we want to opt-in at this stage to be active participants in the negotiation process.  However, I am keen for some clarification.  What are we going to say about the Irish point of view at the negotiations?

There is always a degree of concern on the part of member states when the Commission is making proposals of this nature.  There might be a little more to it and member states might find that some decisions or something that is perceived to be a mind change might be made without the necessary consultation or engagement and this can give rise to tensions.  However, we are happy to engage on this and I believe it is important that we do so.  Ultimately, if the overall view of most states was to accept the Commission's proposals I would not lose too much sleep over it either.  It is one of these things that we think we should constructively engage in.  It will involve some further consultation between the member states.<\/p><p>  This is always the difficulty with the procedure we have.  We are asking people to opt in to facilitate our engaging in a discussion of an instrument that has not been finalised.

It means at the end of the day we would be a party to whatever instrument is accepted.  The other side of the coin is that if we do not opt in at the early stage then once an instrument has been finalised we can opt in and there will be some element of discussion we can still be a party to in the development of the instrument, but we would not really be in a position to formally propose amendments to it or to have the full engagement that would be desirable.  In the civil law area we are in a position no different to most other member states and there is no detriment to our being engaged.  I maintain the balance of advantage is in being engaged in that we make our contribution and we consider the appropriate amendments that might be made.  Our intervention may produce a compromise proposal which could be of assistance to other states.<\/p><p>  It is one of these strange technical proposals.  Clearly, there is need to consider the approach in the context of minor issues.  If we are discussing form changing or a new member state joining and becoming a party to an instrument, there is a somewhat over-elaborate structure applied at the moment.  It is not efficient and it is time-consuming.  An element of what the Commission is proposing makes sense.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013110600005#D00700","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1383747600,"counter":658,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his full reply.

Often those who most oppose such common sense measures are the people who constantly complain that the European Union is too bureaucratic and makes life far too difficult unnecessarily for business and everyone else.

We opt in and if there is a final outcome we are part of it, or we do not opt in which means we cannot formally propose amendments to it and when it is decided in its final form we decide whether we should opt in to it as it is, warts and all, even if there are parts we do not like and on which we might have had a greater impact had we participated.  That is why it is important to opt in, to exercise our influence.<\/p><p> In response to the question about the difference between a delegated Act and an implementing Act, the Lisbon treaty introduced two new articles - I mentioned this briefly earlier - that allow the member states and the European Parliament to delegate powers to the European Commission.  These articles effectively replace the old comitology procedures, which were often criticised for lack of transparency.<\/p><p>  The articles in question are 290, which provides for delegated Acts and 291 which provides for implementing Acts.  I should add that, while the procedures are separate and distinct, there is a certain overlap so that in many cases there would be a margin of discretion in respect of the choice made as to which approach is to be followed.  Given the newness of the procedures it is also the case that the parameters of each are still not altogether clear &ndash; this is about as clear as mud because these are relatively new procedures.  That being said, in broad terms, Article 290 of the TFEU allows the European Legislature, that is the European Parliament and the Council, to give powers to the European Commission to amend or supplement legislative Acts.<\/p><p>  These powers are limited in nature.  They are not intended to enable substantive amendments to be made to a basic instrument.  A common example where such amendments might occur arises in relation to changing the content of forms - I gave that example earlier &ndash; in respect of particular matters.  The forms are normally annexed to a regulation.  A form might facilitate the practical operation of some particular measure or provision contained in the regulation and it may be discovered after the regulation has been adopted that there is some defect in the form, that it could be better framed and that it would be in the interests of those who have to utilise it that it was better framed.  In that context the Commission can be given delegated authority.  It cannot affect the substance of the regulation but it can provide for a better form.<\/p><p>  I could give a domestic example of this, one of the bees in my bonnet for several years was the incomprehensibility and difficulty that confronted those who apply for citizenship in Ireland when presented with the forms.  People came into my law office asking me to help them fill out the forms.  As a lawyer I found some of the questions obscure and difficult.  When I went into the Department I discovered that 50% of the forms submitted on citizenship applications were returned because of failure to fill them in or because there was some part that someone did not understand.  Several people in the Department were engaged in checking forms and sending them back to people, rather than processing applications.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013110600006#E00900","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1383748200,"counter":677,"content":"<p>Excuse me, Minister, I want to remind Senators, there is a division in the Seanad, for any Senators who wish to vote.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013110600006#E01000","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speech","time":1383748200,"counter":678,"content":"<p>One of the first things we did was to change all the forms.

Our position and our lobbying, in Ireland and in Europe, has always been about the greening of commercial road transport at source, improving road safety and encouraging innovation, in order to get goods moved from A to B as efficiently and safely as possible.  The current proposal goes against all these trends.  It is coming from a very strong rail lobby, particularly in Austria, which is a transit country that wants to see large volumes of goods being moved on rail.  Ireland, on the other hand, is a peripheral country at the edge of Europe in which 99% of our goods are moved by road.  We cannot get away from that reality or alter the prominence of road as a mode of transport.  We are asking the committee and the Government to do their best to work with our industry to ensure goods are moved as efficiently as possible.<\/p><p>  Members will be familiar with the European modular system, which takes one truck unit - that is, one engine and one driver - off the road by allowing a 20 ft. truck, which is the normal distribution truck in a city or town, to have an articulated trailer linked onto its back.  The equipment involved requires no large investment from the industry or manufacturing and has been used, for example, for the haulage of timber in Norway, Sweden and Finland for the past 15 or 20 years.  The current proposal is to ban all such modular configurations, including in the countries in which they have operated for more than a decade.  We appeal to the committee to lobby hard in support of the European modular concept.  In addition, we ask members to support our call to maintain existing weight and dimension requirements within member states.  We have seen in the past week how the reduction in the height threshold to 4.65 m has had implications for trade between Ireland and the United Kingdom, where the same restriction does not apply.  We ask the committee to investigate in due course the impact this anomaly is having on trade between the two jurisdictions.<\/p><p>  On the issue of aerodynamics, recent developments in the United States have seen haulage vehicles beginning to look more like aeroplanes, being narrower at the back.  European legislation will not allow for that, because of the requirements regarding maximum allowable lengths and widths.  In the absence of such restrictions on dimensions, there is room in the United States for experiment.  We encourage the committee to lobby for greater flexibility in this regard which would allow for aerodynamic kits to be fitted either in the front or back of vehicles.  It is all about greening the industry.<\/p><p>  In regard to the enforcement of weight and dimension thresholds across different sectors, we have a major problem in this country with out-of-State operators who are failing to comply with the requirements of road traffic legislation.  For instance, we had a situation in Foynes in September regarding the transport of wind turbines.  We are calling on the committee to conduct a full investigation, without delay, into illegal haulage practices by out-of-State operators.  We have written to the Chairman on this matter and are appealing again today for his support.<\/p><p>  My colleague, Mr. Kiersey, vice president of Irish Road Haulage Association will comment on alternative fuels and related issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013110600004#H00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eoin Gavin"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1383730800,"counter":730,"content":"<p>In 2005 and 2006, the then Minister for Transport, Mr. Noel Dempsey, introduced MOTR 1 and MOTR 2, respectively.  These were motor oil tax relief schemes which meant that a farmer could grow and produce rapeseed oil which hauliers could use to run their trucks.  In the following years, we converted the majority of our trucks to run on rapeseed oil.  In fact, astounding as it sounds, we were getting 90% of our fuel from Irish fields.  Rapeseed was a very beneficial product for the farmer and for the land on which it was grown, bringing all types of environmental benefits such as a reduction in the need for fertiliser and an increase in the subsequent crop yield.  Rapeseed is grown as a break crop, in the same way as potatoes or sugar beet, but its great advantage is that it increases the subsequent cereal yield by a minium of 10%.<\/p><p>  We spent in the region of &euro;300,000 converting all our lorries to run on rapeseed oil.  The problem arose when as part of a subsequent Government, the Green Party pulled the plug on the relief scheme.  Farmers were now obliged to levy excise duty on the product, which made it unattractive to us.  As a consequence, the creators of the kits we had on our trucks went broke, as did the people who installed them.  We eventually had to take them off because we were having technical problems and could no longer, in any case, secure a supply of oil.  There is documented evidence that rapeseed oil has been produced in this country for more than 200 years, having been used in flax mills in Donegal and Derry.  We ignore it to our cost because it is a wonderful product.  I ask the committee to examine this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013110600004#H00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jerry Kiersey"},{"type":"speech","time":1383730800,"counter":731,"content":"<p>I thank the delegates for outlining their concerns on the implications of the proposal.

However, what is proposed would involve connecting the equivalent of an articulated trailer, at 45 ft. in length, and a rigid trailer, at 20 ft. in length.  The prime example in this regard is a cattle truck and what is proposed would probably only be 10 ft. longer than that.  What would be involved, therefore, would not be a super or mega item of equipment.  These vehicles are already operating on our roads.  All that we are discussing here is having one engine and one driver.  It is a very good concept and it would involve using the existing equipment.

As the previous speaker indicated, if there is a level of engagement from the outset then results can be achieved.  Of all the member states of the EU, Ireland is probably one of the most dependent on road haulage for the transportation of goods.  In that context, the views of the industry must be heeded.<\/p><p>  I and a number of local and foreign road hauliers who are properly licensed and who operate in my constituency are extremely concerned about the illegal activities detected there.  I urge the committee to take on board Mr. Gavin's suggestion with regard to investigating what happened at the port of Foynes during the summer which led to its being blocked.  The commercial reality for the import and export business at Foynes is one issue but people are uncomfortable about what happened there during the summer.

It is a major problem.  Some 46% of trucks which come into Dublin Port every morning are out-of-State or foreign vehicles.  Their owners or operators contribute zero to our road network and they also contribute zero in terms of PAYE or PRSI.  However, best of all, they will be able to claim the fuel rebate.  We have a national haulage fleet of 4,000 vehicles and these are predominantly owned by family businesses.  Those businesses are struggling to survive.  Next April we will be paying &pound;10 in the North of Ireland.  The reason that there was illegal haulage at Foynes on the part of Northern Irish, UK and Scottish operators is because they do not want to register here as hauliers as a result of the fact that road tax is too expensive and the level of enforcement is too high.  If they remain both out-of-State and legal operators, they will not be subject to either enforcement or road tax.  Again, a big wedge is being driven between legitimate Irish hauliers and out-of-State operators.

Are we seeking to obtain a further derogation in respect of the restriction, despite the fact hat it has been imposed?  Has the height restriction had an immediate effect in terms of the members of the Irish Road Haulage Association?  It seems very unfair that other countries are not subject to the restrictions relating to weights and dimensions which are contained in the proposed directive.  What has been the impact of this on our guests' members?  I am not clear on the position with regard to traffic coming here from Europe.  If a different rule applies in another country, can operators from that jurisdiction still drive their vehicles here despite the fact that they may not meet the relevant criteria?<\/p><p>  The maximum height relating to the Dublin Port tunnel is 4.65 m.

The consequence of that is that a committee has come together and its rapporteur, J&ouml;rge Leichtfried, an Austrian, has sought now, because of Commissioner Kallas's mistake, to roll the whole process back.  For instance, the Nordic countries have had an agreement for 15 years or more whereby these lorries can move between those states but J&ouml;rge Leichtfried is proposing it is illegal for states, irrespective of whether they have bilateral agreements in place, to allow certain trucks that exceed the European norms to cross borders, and that will affect Ireland, North and South.  The driver of a lorry transporting cattle, as in the example given by Mr. Eoin Gavin, travelling from, say, Wexford to Belfast will have to stop at the Border where we have no border crossing.  That is the outcome of what J&ouml;rge Leichtfried is proposing.  He is seeing this proposal entirely through Austrian eyes rather than from the perspective of the whole of Europe.  There are islands in Europe but he does not seem to acknowledge that fact.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013110600006#K01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jerry Kiersey"},{"type":"speech","time":1383732000,"counter":751,"content":"<p>The consequences of this proposal would be that trucks would have stop at the Border because they would be legal in Northern Ireland and they would be illegal in the South.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013110600006#K01300","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1383732000,"counter":752,"content":"<p>They would be legal here.

I welcome their frank and forthright comments particularly on the question of over-height vehicles.  I represent a Dublin north city constituency.  As the use of the port tunnel is restricted to only vehicles under 4.65 m high, vehicles over that height have to travel along Alfie Byrne Road, up the Malahide Road and along Collins Avenue and Griffith Avenue through high density residential areas.  That has always been a source of annoyance and fear among the residents of that area.  The ban which came into effect last Friday is welcomed by my constituents and I would be pleased if it were to remain in place and there was full compliance with it.<\/p><p>  Reference was made to vehicles striking bridges.  Some vehicles over the height limit of 4.65 m have struck bridges, particularly along the DART line which runs through my constituency.  The DART service has been out of action during morning peak hours at times following a vehicle striking a bridge, and that was another argument for restricting the height of vehicles because of the danger posed.  I accept Mr. Kiersey's point that these bridges were built during the Victorian era.  Much of our infrastructure was also built around that time.  There is a concern about the risk to public transport in Dublin if a vehicle damages a bridge and such damage also happens in other parts of the country.  However, this city has a high density of population.  Such risk is a concern and that is the reason over-height vehicles were a major concern.<\/p><p>  Mr. Gavin mentioned the question of 20 ft. trucks with articulated trailers.  Having cycled around this city for a long time, I am aware that the sight of such trucks instill fear in any cyclist.  A 20 ft. truck passes out a cyclist and suddenly he or she sees the articulated trailer being pulled behind it.  Quite a number of cyclists have been killed in those circumstances.  That is the reason a ban on heavy goods vehicles, HGVs, was introduced in Dublin between the two canals, and the Garda enforce that ban.  Anybody who wants to operate outside that ban must get a permit from Dublin City Council.  The ban was introduced on the basis of safety concerns about cyclists, pedestrians and other road users.  Statistics have shown that since it was introduced the number of fatal accidents in the city has dropped considerably.  That is a credit to the road hauliers who have complied with the ban.  <\/p><p>  As Mr. Gavin said, this is all about road safety, greening our transport network while accepting that the haulage industry plays a vital road in the economy.  As an island nation, our  freight is not transported by rail, rather it is all transported by road.  Unfortunately, the container terminal in Dublin Port was built on the south side of the port some years back.  The rail head is on the north side of the port and somebody made the decision in respect of that.  It removed the possibility of transporting many containers by rail because the container terminal was on the south side of the port.  That meant that some trucks have to travel around the city and over the toll bridge and I believe they were exempt from having to pay the toll because of that.  <\/p><p>  Mr. Gavin raised some interesting questions about illegal haulage.  It would be a matter of concern if some hauliers were operating illegally.  Was Mr. Gavin referring to hauliers in Northern Ireland who transport goods form the North to Dublin Port?  There is a good deal of cross-Border trade.  He mentioned Foynes Port where it was said that some haulage operators were operating illegally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013110600006#K02100","speaker":"1021","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1383732600,"counter":761,"content":"<p>On Deputy Kenny's last point, what is happening is out-of-State operators, be they from the UK, Northern Ireland, Holland or Germany, are operating within the Twenty-six Counties without an Irish haulage licence.  One needs a haulage licence to move goods from A to B in Ireland.  These companies have licences to move goods in their own countries or to move goods from one country to another, for example, Ireland to Germany or Germany to Ireland but they do not have a licence to move within Ireland which is very important.  We would appreciate if the committee would further investigate the matter because it is happening in Dublin Port every day of the week.  Foynes was a very clean-cut example.  We knew where the loads were coming from and going to.  Hundreds of trucks go in and out of the port every day in Dublin and they are operating illegally.  We are the only jurisdiction in Europe that is tolerating such activity.  It is called breach of cabotage.  If I as an Irish haulier bring a load to Germany I can pick up a load in Berlin and bring it to Frankfurt and I could pick up a load in Frankfurt and bring it to Cologne but I must then pick up a load in Cologne and bring it to Ireland or the UK.  I cannot operate my base in Germany for obvious social reasons such as employment law, costs reasons and road tax.  None of those parameters are being adhered to in this country.  The Road Safety Authority chose not to enforce the law in that regard.  We call on the committee to carry out a full investigation as to why that is the case.<\/p><p>  In terms of the comments on the European modular system, of course a 25 m vehicle in Dublin city will not be possible.  Because of the HGV ban one cannot drive in the city now anyway.  What we are looking at is such lorries being used on the motorway network and the national routes.  If one takes the examples of Marks &amp;amp; Spencer or big stores on Grafton Street, they need deliveries every morning for the people of the city.  If it is decided to ban vehicles completely out of the city one is talking about 15 to 20 transit vans being required to bring produce with the attendant pollution and carbon footprint.  One could also ask how many vans are involved in accidents with cyclists.  There must be realistic goals and there cannot be scaremongering.  Every road user must be respected and they must all work together.  Efficiencies can be achieved by improved technologies.  We seek the committee&rsquo;s support on the introduction of new technologies and not an insistence on sticking to the model that has been in operation in Europe since 1950.  That would not be right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013110600007#L00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eoin Gavin"},{"type":"speech","time":1383732600,"counter":762,"content":"<p>I do not think any members of the committee are indicating so I will call Deputy Healy-Rae.

The reason I wish to attend the meeting is that I have a particular interest in all of these matters because of the constituency I represent.  Some of the changes that have been made already, such as the 4.65 m restriction in height will affect the farming industry in my county to a great extent because much fodder is brought in and the fact that the height of a trailer of bales must be reduced will increase the cost of transport.  In terms of forestry, I have specific questions about Directive 96\/53\/EC.  I refer to counties such as Kerry and Donegal and other places where, for example, timber must be transported from awkward places.  Trailers are left outside and filled first and one has to go back and forth in order to make up a load.  The impression I get in terms of what is emerging from Europe in regard to transport is that the shoe that fits the foot of Europe does not necessarily fit our foot.  I am most concerned about the issue.<\/p><p>  A number of years ago, in their infinite wisdom, politicians decided to do away with our rural rail network.  That was a bad decision to make at the time and we are paying the price for it ever since.  It is only the good work of the Irish Road Haulage Association and its members that has made up for it.  I am concerned about the effect of lobbying by people around Europe who have an excellent rail network.  Everyone has to bat for their own corner.  In County Kerry every animal must be loaded onto a lorry in order to be transported.  The Chairman referred to what will happen at borders.  We could not tolerate a situation where animals would have to be unloaded and loaded again at borders.  I am concerned about the implications of what is being discussed at present.  I am not a member of the committee but I wish to express my strong concern and to offer my assistance to the Irish Road Haulage Association because it does invaluable work in ensuring that everything keeps moving around the country.  It is important that the association is vibrant, hard working and on top of its game because it is required more than ever before.  Leadership by the association is also required more than ever before to ensure that we will not be forgotten by decisions taken in Europe that would have a detrimental effect on the way we carry on our business, be it farming or retail.  We must be vigilant about what is going on because the height restriction of 4.65 m will have a detrimental effect on my constituency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013110600007#L00400","speaker":"1049"},{"type":"speech","time":1383732600,"counter":764,"content":"<p>Could I ask for further clarification from Mr. Kiersey?

Mr. Kiersey can again correct me if I am wrong but the change will have considerable implications for the transport of bulky goods such as those connected with agriculture and forestry, as outlined by my colleague, Deputy Healy-Rae.  Does that not have major implications for the live export of cattle from this country, in particular to the UK?  We already have a significant problem in the UK with the Common Market in terms of live cattle because of the difficulty of killing them in the UK.  If a transportation restriction is put on top of that, will it not compound the problem with the Common Market in terms of live exports of cattle?<\/p><p>  I accept the witnesses do not want to get into detail on the height restriction of 4.65 m but I wish to ask a specific question about it.  The restriction has implications for the entire haulage industry, in particular for agriculture in terms of the transport of hay and straw because when one puts a third row of bales on a truck it will be over the threshold.  One must reduce the capacity of the vehicle by one third.  I presume what a lot of hauliers will consider is attaching a trailer to make up the difference.  Will that not have implications if what is being proposed is then replicated or transcribed into regulations in this country in the future?  Do we not have to examine the industry not just from the perspective of the overall industry but the implications it has for particular sectors?<\/p><p>  You will be aware, Chairman, of McHale&rsquo;s in County Mayo.  Their baler produces a bale that is approximately 6 in. bigger than the standard 4 ft. bale.  That makes financial sense as it reduces the amount of plastic that must be used on the bales.  There are implications for the transport of such bales.  The producers of bales in the southern part of the country will not buy or use McHale balers because of the difficulty in transporting them.  That has implications for manufacturing jobs in this country.  Mr. Kiersey gave an example earlier.  There are unintended consequences of decisions made in the transport sector that have implications on the viability of agriculture in terms of live exports but also for manufacturing jobs in the west if such a measure is implemented, enforced and has an impact on the day-to-day work of agriculture in particular.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013110600007#L00700","speaker":"1177","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1383733200,"counter":768,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013110600008#M00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jerry Kiersey"},{"type":"speech","time":1383733200,"counter":769,"content":"<p>-----and if not, why not?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013110600008#M00300","speaker":"1177"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1383733200,"counter":770,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for their comments.

If this one shoe fits all European proposal is brought forward, it will have a detrimental effect on our live export trade.  It would mean that at the first stop, the border of Rosslare Port, animals would have to be unloaded and put onto the lower trucks, which is crazy.<\/p><p>  People need to think outside the box on this issue.  We are very dependent on road transport here.  Therefore, we must do what is best for road transport.  Some of the other countries in Europe are not as dependent on road transport.  Even though 80% of goods move across Europe on trucks, 20% move across Europe using alternative modes.  The systems in Europe should complement each other.  The train works with the truck, the canal works with the train and with the truck but that is not referred to in this report.  What is happening is that one strong lobby group is putting its foot down on stopping innovation and the greening of the transport sector in general.  It has implications for everybody from County Kerry to the north of Finland.  What it means is more trucks on the road and more fumes.  There will be a driver shortage in 2020.  Our average truck driver age is 50, therefore, we must try to combat this measure.  The goods will still have to move.  Consumerism is increasing.

The FTAI is a not-for-profit membership trade association for the Irish freight and logistics industry and covers all aspects of private and public freight transport, passenger transport and logistics supply chain including road, rail, sea and air.<\/p><p>  Directive 96\/53\/EC governs the weights and dimensions of commercial vehicles in circulation throughout the EU.<\/p> <p>Current proposals amending the directive would affect the maximum authorised dimensions in national and international traffic, as well as the maximum authorised weights in international traffic.  The FTAI supports the proposed amendments to Directive 96\/53\/EC in so far as they encourage the use of hybrid and multi-fuel vehicles, encourage the manufacture of more aerodynamic and fuel-efficient vehicles and encourage the manufacture of vehicles that are safer from a pedestrian, cyclist and driver perspective and which improve overall road safety.  The FTAI opposes any amendment to Article 4 that would prohibit the free circulation across borders between two consenting states of vehicles outside the dimensions laid down in Annex I to Directive 96\/53\/EC.<\/p><p> As members are aware, in Ireland SI 366 of 2008 was signed into effect on 1 November 2008.  It specified that a maximum vehicle height of 4.65 m would apply to all vehicles from 1 November 2013, thereby allowing existing vehicles in excess of that height to wash out of the system.  Companies using what are known as high cube vehicles are mostly, but not solely, involved in the inter-depot movement of laundry, medical supplies, hanging garments, white goods, car transport, pre-packed fresh and frozen meals, horticulture, furniture, DIY, electrical, information technology and electronic goods, toys and paper products.  The removal of vehicles in excess of 4.65 m from the roads will increase the total number of vehicle movements, in some cases very substantially, and this increase will adversely affect those urban areas through which HGVs already circulate.  The beneficiaries of the removal of these high vehicles are those in three small areas around the Dublin Port tunnel, Limerick and Jack Lynch tunnels, though the latter two are not residential areas.  However, those who will suffer even more following the removal of high vehicles are everywhere on the motorway network and in the regional towns.  In the case of car transport, vehicle movements will increase by approximately 35%, while in the case of laundry, the effect will be up to 68% in increased movements.<\/p><p> However, the FTAI acknowledges the requirement to legislate for maximum vehicle heights and dimensions and supports a maximum standard vehicle height of 4.65 m.  We consider the most logical way to accommodate these two positions is to legislate for a controlled permit regime for operators of high vehicles on fixed routes, similar to the abnormal loads regime that currently exists among local authorities.  As the abnormal loads regime is highly variable between local authorities, this requires standardisation. The FTAI recommends consideration of the electronic service delivery for abnormal loads, ESDAL, system currently used in the UK.<\/p><p> In consideration of the current proposals included in Directive 96\/53\/EC, the potential exists to mitigate the effect of reducing vehicle height by adopting longer heavier vehicles under the European modular system.  However, this will not provide an adequate solution for the loss of cubic capacity resulting from the removal of trailers over 4.65 m.  Based on National Road Authority, NRA, traffic count statistics that are publically available on its website, the busiest junctions on the M50 are between Finglas and Parkwest southbound between 7 a.m. and 10 a.m., and this is reversed in the evenings northbound between 4 p.m. and 7 p.m.  Based on current HGV volumes, there typically are between 350 and 500 movements per hour during those periods.  On the basis that approximately 20% of current movements take place using HGVs in excess of 4.65 m and assuming displacement of these will result in an additional 40% of vehicle movements - both these estimates are conservative - this will increase peak hourly volumes on the north-west section of the M50 to between 374 and 540 movements per hour.  The FTAI recommends that the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport should facilitate the introduction of a controlled and limited permit regime to allow the use of vehicles in excess of 4.65 m in height on a defined route and use basis.<\/p><p> As for the proposed amendment to Directive 96\/53\/EC, the FTAI wishes to make the following points.  The most serious proposed amendment to the directive is that to Article 4, which would prohibit cross-border transport between member states of vehicles which deviated from the dimensions laid down in Annex I.  Specifically, this would prohibit the cross-border movement of vehicles in excess of 4 m in height.  The 4 m vehicle height is standard among European cross-border road transport operations, where access to tunnels with a standard 4 m height restriction is required. Depending on the fleet of the specific operator, this measure would affect up to 90% of the semi-trailers in use in the Irish fleet and would have major cost implications for cross-border operations and for seaborne freight across the Irish Sea.  The increase in articulated vehicle movements through the Dublin Port tunnel, DPT, and onto the M50 would be substantial and would seriously congest the M50 southbound following inbound ferry dockings.  Different EU geographies require differing logistical solutions.  Central European networks will require a different modal mix to Ireland. The original proposed amendments to the directive permitted cross-border movements of vehicles outside the dimensions laid down in Annex I.  However, the Leichtfried proposal is most unwelcome, is highly damaging from both an import and export viewpoint and must be robustly opposed.  The FTAI has suggested a more appropriate text for this amendment.<\/p><p> The FTAI is broadly satisfied with proposals which accommodate the use of alternative fuels.  It is in favour of the unrestricted circulation of 45 ft. containers throughout the Union and therefore, this proposal should be clarified in that respect.  We accept the reduction in dimensions of maximum permitted rearward aerodynamic extensions to 500 mm; this reflects the reality of current vehicle design and construction limitations.  This matter is rightly one for the consideration of the EC technical group.  We strongly support the certification of aerodynamic extensions within the type approval process.  Certification would mean that devices would need to actually work and so would prevent manufacturers flooding the market place with devices which may not.  We strongly support such modifications to vehicles that improve visibility for drivers.  We support the manufacturing of such modifications to vehicles that improve vehicle safety.  The FTAI also gives a qualified welcome to the introduction of onboard weighing devices to vehicles of categories N2 and N3.  However, we would need to see the details of such proposals and to consult our members on them.  The  proposal to apply the increase in maximum authorised mass generally to all multi-fuel vehicles, rather than to particular sectors, is welcomed.<\/p><p> I thank members and will be happy to take questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013110600008#M02300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aidan Flynn","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1383733800,"counter":790,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Flynn.

We explained to the Minister the huge impact this would have on trade in Ireland, the possibility of companies relocating into the North of Ireland, as well as other factors, some of which already have been mentioned already.  Basically, the Minister asked why were we were talking about this.  Our response was that in 2008 or whenever this law was created, things were good.  We then went into a period of severe austerity and those people were obliged to do things more efficiently, more cleverly and more economically and we still are in that position today.  We still are recovering from the downturn in the economy and consequently, we stated the appropriate solution for this was that these vehicles would only travel on primary routes from the port or from the North down, using the motorway network on which, as members have heard, the bridge clearance is 5.3 m.<\/p><p>  In addition, as an Irish solution to this problem, we suggested the Minister would allow these vehicles to continue to operate under a special permit scheme that was quite different to the existing abnormal loads permit scheme, which is completely unsuited for this solution.  The point is that in allowing this to happen, we would continue to recover from the economic position, would continue to save jobs in Ireland and most certainly would help to keep our carbon footprint low.  We must be mindful of the fact that come 2020, every European country, including Ireland, must reduce its carbon footprint by approximately 80% and if one considers the most recent air quality figures for the greater Dublin area, we are very close to having infraction proceedings placed on us.  Were we to proceed with this measure that restricts the 20% of vehicular movements that at present are undertaken in vehicles of more than 4.64 m, we would be worsening the air quality for all those people in north Dublin.  We very much hope the Minister will agree to allow these vehicles to continue under a special permit arrangement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013110600009#N00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Wilson"},{"type":"speech","time":1383734400,"counter":792,"content":"<p>At this stage, I will allow Deputy Se&aacute;n Kenny to contribute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013110600010#O00100","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speech","time":1383734400,"counter":793,"content":"<p>We appear to be trying to reopen the debate about the 4.65 m height.  We had that debate previously when the Dublin Port tunnel was being finalised.  I was chairman of Dublin City Council's transport strategic policy committee at the time and I remember there was a great deal of consultation.  The city council, after that consultation, agreed on the height.  I note the Department and then Minister for Transport also agreed on that height, and that set the parameter for over-height vehicles in the State.  As was stated, many years notice was given to the transport sector that it would have to make other arrangements to deal with that.<\/p><p>  Mr. Wilson is suggesting that a special permit system be introduced to get around the restriction.  He spoke of three small areas in Dublin.  I represent one of those constituencies and those living there would not regard it as a small area.  The over-height vehicles come from the port up Alfie Byrne Road, onto the Malahide Road and, maybe, along the N32 to get onto the M50, traversing the full length of the Malahide Road.  That is not a small area.  Alternatively, they use Collins Avenue and Griffith Avenue to get to the west.  These residents have lived with that problem for many years and now it is no longer permissible, and the road haulage sector will have to comply with that.  The sector has had many years notice of this and I accept it has a problem.<\/p><p>  Mr. Wilson spoke of the vehicles being washed out.  He stated that those vehicles licensed under the new permit system would travel by a defined route.  He did not specify that defined route and I want to know what defined route he has in mind.<\/p><p>  He did not mention bridge strikes, which happen in the city now and again - but, thankfully, not frequently - and often have an effect on the DART commuter service, sometimes knocking out the service for a couple of hours, perhaps during morning peak time.  That has always been an argument against over-height vehicles.<\/p><p>  I take the point that much of this infrastructure was built during Victorian times when we did not have the type of vehicles we have now, but in cities, particularly in high-density residential areas, residents do not want to see over-height vehicles coming up through their streets. The port tunnel has been built and there is the heavy goods vehicle strategy banning HGVs between the canals except where they have a special permit, yet the sector is now arguing for another permit system.  That raises many serious questions.  I thought we had resolved the matter and that compliance with the new heights would be a fact of life, and I think we are now talking about changing that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013110600010#O00200","speaker":"1021"},{"type":"speech","time":1383734400,"counter":794,"content":"<p>It has been in place since 1 November.

My company is based in Wexford and employs 430 staff in Ballinasloe, Carlow, Dublin and Cork, but the majority are in Wexford.  We are a rurally based company in an area with employment difficulties.  We have been employing people there for nearly 90 years and we hope to continue to do so.  It is increasingly difficult to be an employer in rural areas when one sees regulations such as this that tend to favour those operating in a city, where there is a natural infrastructure of motorways.  Many of our goods travel across the country.  Regulations that were brought in because of the Dublin Port tunnel are affecting our ability to transfer goods from the south east to the north west.<\/p><p>  In our 17 years of operating double-deck vehicles, we have never had a bridge strike.  Having spoken to the operators of the bridges, including Irish Rail, I am aware that bridge strikes arise almost exclusively from construction machinery that is not properly loaded or <i>ad hoc<\/i> loads.  They do not arise from double-deck trailers or high cube trailers such as those operated by my company.  Our routes are run like bus routes.  It is the same route every day.  There are only three routes: Wexford to Ballinasloe, Wexford to Cork, and Wexford to Tallaght.  For all of those, national primary routes are used, with many of our vehicles travelling at night, and the loads are then broken down into smaller distributions.  Because of the Dublin Port tunnel, however, we can no longer ship our goods under these efficient systems.  We will increase our carbon footprint by 40%, we will increase our emissions by 40% and we will increase our road footprint by slightly more.  With return trips, those living in Enniscorthy must put up with our trucks making 4,000 crossings of Enniscorthy bridge every year.

It is all well and good and will not make a huge difference if one has an extra few trucks going to Tallaght or Cork in that there is a pretty decent road infrastructure.  Sadly, however, from Wexford to Ballinasloe there is a glorified cart-track; it is nothing more than that.  To put at least 40% more vehicles on that road is nothing short of appalling.  It is putting lives and communities at risk and is placing an additional cost on an industry that is under great pressure already.  The road in question brings motorists across three of the major rail routes, namely the Dublin&ndash;Cork, Dublin&ndash;Limerick and Dublin&ndash;Galway lines.  Surely, therefore, there could be a compromise.  I accept Deputy Kenny's point that we should not have heavy goods vehicles going through residential areas, except in very rare and exceptional circumstances involving an oversized load that must be carried on a rare occasion.  The current permit system deals with that.<\/p><p>  Let us consider point-to-point delivery, not just in regard to the haulage business but also in regard to the issue that has now been raised.  Bales of hay are now much bigger, which has implications.  Hauliers carrying them did not realise the implications until the provision actually kicked in.  Had the restriction been in place earlier this year, it would have imposed a huge additional financial burden on farmers, irrespective of the implications for jobs.<\/p><p>  With regard to implications for jobs, I have two questions, one of which is on the export contracts for goods that are slightly oversized.  An example arises in the Chairman's constituency.  McHale balers produce a bale slightly bigger than the standard size.  McHale employs 500 people and has an annual turnover of &euro;55 million, and it operates in 40 countries.  The measure has implications not only for the purchase of McHale balers but also for the export of the company's product.  These implications have not been fully considered.<\/p><p>  Reducing the capacity of vehicles by 20% in regard to the weanling trade from the west to continental Europe would undermine the viability of that trade.  It would decimate agriculture west of the River Shannon.  There are major implications.  As Mr. Jerry Kiersey mentioned earlier, there are unintended consequences that have not been thought through.
