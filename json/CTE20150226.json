One from the Secretary General, Mr. Hamill, and the other reply is from the Department itself, presumably in Mr. Hamill's name, but there are two separate documents.

On the invitation we received from the National Library of Ireland, a number of us around the table visited yesterday to inspect the system and see the difficulties in the system.  A large quantity of priceless documents are housed in circumstances that are unacceptable from an environmental point of view.  If a problem arose and it involved paper, it would go up in smoke and the building would disappear rapidly.  Also, damage is being caused because documents are not being housed in a sustained environment in that it is too hot or too cold.  This is a priceless treasure in the library which is at imminent risk.  Having listened to what was said and inspected the conditions under which they operate in the National Library, I believe there should be some response from this committee to the need for urgent action to protect that invaluable resource, which goes back hundreds of years.  A great deal of the material in the library is not digitised so there is no other record of it in many cases.  The documents are in their original format but they are being housed in dangerous conditions.  We should contact the Government or make a special effort to ensure some action would be taken to protect them.<\/p><p>That is agreed.<\/p><p> No. 3A.4 is correspondence from NAMA in regard to the De Vere Hunt case.  I want to put on record that I am not one bit phased by this correspondence.  While it may be factual in terms of how it quotes what the members have said and the action that was taken, the fact of the matter is that this letter was sent to us on the day they had a meeting with this lady.  It is clear from that, therefore, and from what is in the correspondence, that they are attempting to tick off the Committee of Public Accounts, and I reject that approach.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Chairman:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=741\"><img src=\"..\/images\/info.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Information on John McGuinness\"\/><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=committees&amp;amp;code=ACC&amp;amp;memberid=741&amp;amp;pid=JohnMcGuinness&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=26\"><img src=\"..\/images\/zoom.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Zoom on John McGuinness\"\/><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->There is a reference to nominating a solicitor in this case and it mentions various things that were discussed in the course of the meeting, such as the serving of papers.  In my view, in a case where a person has died by suicide, it is not acceptable to serve papers by throwing them at the porch door.  There are other ways of doing business than using such tactics, particularly when a person is acting on behalf of the State.  I wish to put my view about that on record.  The correspondence also quotes Deputy Mary Lou McDonald.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015022600002#B01500","speaker":"1006","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424944800,"counter":25,"content":"<p>I have not had the opportunity to look at the transcript but I have no doubt they quote me accurately.  The impression I was given as a member of this committee was that mediation was the preferred channel of resolution.  A reasonable person who went back and read the totality of the exchange would come away with that impression, although I am prepared to go back and look at exactly what was and what was not said.  I may have been too emphatic in my understanding of what the delegates were saying but it does not, at any rate, resolve the issue and I do not know where it leaves this particular family or other people caught up in this process.  My impression of the delegation was that they were quite sure-footed and I felt reassured that they were committed to mediation as the best and first option.<\/p> <p>  This correspondence leads one to a different view.  It states that it outlined how mediation works, which it did, and the purpose of mediation.  It also states: \"NAMA's evidence about its attitude to mediation was very clear, as is evident from the various excerpts of the transcripts of the meeting.  It cannot be reasonably well argued in the circumstances that the committee was misled.\"  I am not saying they were deliberately misleading us but I took a different meaning from them on the day from the meaning I get from this letter.  This letter is mediocre in tone as regards NAMA's commitment to mediation but that was the whole basis of our discussion in regard to the matter we were probing in respect of Mrs. De Vere Hunt and her family.  Rather than clarifying matters, I feel this correspondence has confused things.  I would like clarity from NAMA and would like them to write to us to amplify the position they took while before the committee.

Perhaps we can clarify these figures before we talk to the HEA again.  There are a number of points in this letter.

Yet they are going down the line of this amalgamation without knowing what the costs are.  It just does not make sense.  I believe we should ask the HEA to address that fact before it comes before us again.  The other issue I want to raise on this correspondence relates to Carlow Institute of Technology.  At our meeting we referred to the costs of the two communication companies and as we can see from the reply,  the tender for the press liaison and public relations service of Wednesday, 18 September 2013, provided by Kearney Melia Communications<font color=\"#E01F25\"><\/font>was &euro;4,070 plus VAT per month.  That is &euro;78,000 per year they are paying one company for public relations.  The second company they use, by tender on Friday, 9 May 2014, provided by the Communications Clinic, was &euro;30,645.  That is &euro;109,000 simply on PR and we have not gone into the procurement process in this.  We need clarification on these points as to the plan, the costs of these PR firms and the whole procurement process that is gone into.  We may be better informed when they come before us again.<br\/><br\/>I will turn to correspondence from individuals.  There is correspondence to be noted from Mr. William Tracey of Horse Racing Ireland and from Mr. Thomas Duggan of Millstreet Equestrian Services around the ongoing issue with Horse Sport Ireland.  I would advise the committee that arising from this correspondence the Clerk and I met with Mr. Kieran Mulvey and Mr. John Treacy  of the Irish Sports Council and we discussed the detail of the correspondence in order to move the issue on.  What came from that meeting was that the mediation process initiated by Mr. Mulvey had failed to bring the parties together.  <br\/><br\/>It is to be suggested to Millstreet that a binding arbitration process be entered into by both parties.  On the matter raised today in the letter from Mr. Duggan, the Irish Sports Council will now audit the State funding to Horse Sport Ireland and will come back to the Committee of Public Accounts with that outcome.  These are the two points of action agreed upon.  <br\/><br\/>No. 3B.3  is correspondence from Mr. Gary Delaney of Loc8 Code regarding the national postcode tender process.

She quotes the Act in her response to us and reference is made to not commenting on individual cases.  We have asked that the Chief State Solicitor's Office would come before this committee for examination of its spend on administration and so on.  We are not interested in names in cases, what we are interested in is the approach to how cases are taken, the cost of each case from any Department or agency which may have gone on for years and have been lost or dropped by the State for various reasons.  The committee wants to determine the spend on those cases without needing to know who was involved in the cases.  I believe we are in agreement with the contents of the letter but we certainly want to get more detail on the administration of the Office of the Chief State Solicitor, the cost of the office and the cost of the cases I have described.  We will write back in that vein and set a date for the office to come before the Committee of Public Accounts.<br\/><br\/>No. 3C.1 and No. 3C.2 are briefing documents and opening statements for today's meeting.

The appropriation account for the OPW Vote shows gross expenditure of &euro;399 million in 2013, mainly comprising expenditure of &euro;71 million on flood risk management and &euro;323 million on estate portfolio management.  Expenditure of &euro;5 million was incurred in 2013 on the national procurement service, which engaged in central procurement of goods and services for public bodies.  Since 1 January 2014, the service has been incorporated into the Office for Government Procurement, and the related expenditure is accounted for in the Vote for that office.<\/p><p> Under its flood risk management programme, the OPW spent approximately &euro;35 million on flood relief schemes, &euro;15 million on ongoing maintenance of arterial drainage and flood relief schemes, and &euro;2.3 million in the form of contributions to minor flood relief works carried out by local authorities.  Over &euro;7 million was spent on studies and development of river catchment flood risk assessment and management plans, referred to as the CFRAM programme.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Mr. Seamus McCarthy:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->These are required to meet Ireland's obligations under the 2007 EU floods directive.  My office has examined progress on the CFRAM programme and a special report on the findings is being drafted.  I expect to complete that report in the next couple of months.  <br\/><br\/>Expenditure by the OPW on estate management included &euro;97 million spent on rent and other charges related to property rented for use by public bodies; &euro;54 million was spent on maintenance of Government property and related supplies; and &euro;48 million was spent on new works, alterations, and additions.  The committee may wish to note that the latter included payments in 2013 totalling &euro;8.9 million in relation to an unsuccessful land swap deal at Harcourt Terrace, which I have previously reported on, and which has previously been examined by the committee.  Payments under a public private partnership contract relating to the National Convention Centre in Dublin in 2013 amounted to just over &euro;48 million, while expenditure of &euro;36 million was incurred on heritage properties and related visitor services.  <br\/><br\/>Apart from the estate management expenditure accounted for in Vote 13, the OPW also incurred expenditure of the order of &euro;59 million in 2013 on a range of services and capital projects that it was carrying out on an agency basis for other public bodies, including other central Government Departments and offices.  Chapter 4 of my report outlines the results of our examination of the manner in which the accounting for this arrangement was managed in 2013.<br\/><br\/>The concept of providing certain required services on an agency basis on behalf of other public bodies is potentially useful, such as where the agent makes available specialist skills and expertise to other organisations that have no long-term requirement for such services, and which it would be costly or complex for the principals to procure in other ways.<br\/><br\/>The standard procedures to be applied by agents and principals in controlling and in accounting for such arrangements in cash-based appropriation accounts are set out in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform&rsquo;s <i>Public Financial Procedures<\/i>. <br\/><br\/>In most cases, the OPW receives funds in advance from the principals for each project or service required.  The OPW operates a separate suspense account for each project or service, with a corresponding suspense account on the principals' side.  Corresponding entries should be made in each account pair.  The amounts paid out by the OPW to suppliers should be notified promptly to the principals, who adjust their own suspense accounts accordingly and charge those costs to their own appropriation accounts.  In 2013, the OPW operated suspense accounts in respect of around 3,700 projects being carried out on an agency basis for a variety of principals.<br\/><br\/>Allowing for inevitable timing differences, balances in the OPW suspense accounts should match the balances in the corresponding principals&rsquo; suspense accounts. However, our analysis found that at the end of 2013, the OPW recorded that it held &euro;20.8 million in respect of 35 vote principals.  In contrast, the principals&rsquo; accounting records indicated that the OPW held funds of &euro;11.4 million.  There were both positive and negative variances, resulting in a net difference of &euro;9.4 million.  As a result of this analysis, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs made an adjustment of almost &euro;7 million in its appropriation account.  This reduced the difference between the OPW and the principal suspense accounts to a net &euro;2.4 million.<br\/><br\/>The examination found that some departments did not operate suspense accounts when they made advances, which they charged directly to their appropriation accounts.  In other cases, confusion about who was principal for individual projects had arisen when functions were transferred between Departments.  The OPW was late in notifying principals of some payments made in 2013, with the result that a number of appropriation accounts under-recorded their 2013 spend.  Unspent balances from advances on some accounts had not been refunded to the principals, and there were many cases of transfers and reallocation of fund balances between projects.<br\/><br\/>Overall, I concluded that the system of accounting for agency services provided by the OPW did not appear to be operating efficiently and effectively.  Improvements in accounting and control systems need to be made both by the OPW and by the Departments availing of its services.  I have made a number of recommendations for improvement, which have been agreed by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and by the OPW.  My Office will monitor the implementation of changes to ensure that a more rigorous system evolves, and that any discrepancies in records are reconciled promptly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015022600002#G00700","speaker":"965","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424944800,"counter":75,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy and invite Ms McGrath to make her opening statement.<\/p><p>I am pleased to be here today before the Public Accounts Committee to present the 2013 appropriation account for the Office of Public Works and to answer any questions that may arise.  I will first deal with today's item on Chapter 4: Accounting for Office of Public Works Agency Services, which the Comptroller has just spoken about.  In order to update the members, I have provided a short briefing note to the committee on the actions implemented to date in dealing with the recommendations.  As the Comptroller has said, the OPW provides many services on an agency basis to Government Departments.  Funding is provided to the OPW by the sponsoring Department and ultimately it appears as a charge on the account of the client organisation.  The value of these contracts and services where the OPW acts as agent, accounted for over &euro;120 million in 2014 - the Comptroller has referenced &euro;59 million in 2013 - with the main areas of investment being capital works on Government buildings, including schools, the leasing of accommodation for departments and agencies and the maintenance works on State-owned premises.<\/p><p>  The chapter under consideration today looked at the extent of these agency services provided by the OPW and the procedures in place, in both the OPW and client Departments and agencies, in accounting for these services.  The chapter, in its findings, highlighted discrepancies in the suspense balances recorded by the OPW and the client Departments in the annual appropriation accounts.  In summary, the OPW has continued to work with client Departments to reconcile these balances.  The biggest difference recorded in the report, of &euro;7 million has since been amended in the principal&rsquo;s appropriation account to agree with the OPW position at the end of 2013.<\/p><p>  Together with this reconciliation exercise the OPW has implemented a process of making detailed statements available to clients on a quarterly basis to bring to attention the early identification of any discrepancies.  These quarterly statements were issued to all clients in October 2014 and January 2015. <\/p><p>  As highlighted in the chapter, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, &ldquo;is satisfied that the OPW, as agent, provides a centralised service to a high standard of expertise which avoids potential problems in respect of procurement, contracting and inter-departmental competition that might arise if departments were to engage in construction projects on their own account&rdquo;.  <\/p><p>  I am of the view, as I have mentioned in my response to the Comptroller and Auditor General, that a review of public financial procedures could be of benefit, identifying the optimum manner of funding these agency services so that they can be provided efficiently.  In particular, when a contract is being placed by the OPW on behalf of a client, the certainty of funding required for the delivery of the project needs to be secured within the Estimates process, if necessary on a multi-annual Estimate basis.  The existing annual Estimates process and cash-based accounting sometimes present challenges for Accounting Officers when funds voted to a Department in one financial year are not fully expended, albeit contractually committed, and even though the works may have been completed, with no guarantee that those unexpended funds will be made available in the following year.  This creates an unnecessary pressure on principals to charge available funds to their Vote.  I would suggest to the committee that this practice might be considered further in terms of robust, flexible, multi-annual budget and expenditure systems.  I note that a report of the committee in October 2014 made reference to this.  I welcome that.  <\/p><p>  I will now, in summary, refer to some important aspects of the work that was funded through the 2013 appropriation account and touch on the challenges that lie ahead in the two main areas of work for the OPW.       <\/p><p>  On flood risk management, as the lead agency for the management of flood risk in Ireland, the OPW invested &euro;45 million in capital on this programme in 2013 and a total of &euro;411 million from 1996 to the end of 2014.  Major projects in 2013 included schemes completed at Clonmel, Mallow, Tullamore, and Carlow, and the continuation of works at Bray, Fermoy, and Ennis, with &euro;2.3 million provided to local authorities under the minor flood mitigation works and coastal protection scheme.  The strategy for flood risk management is being addressed through the Catchment Flood Risk Assessment Management, CFRAM, approach.  This has involved an unprecedented level of surveying and analysis of each and every river catchment area in the country.  The members will be aware that the roll-out of a public information and consultation programme is under way through public consultation days to bring this mapping exercise and the mapping of areas at risk from flooding to the attention of the public for their comments and observations.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Ms Clare McGrath:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This year much of the work in this area is focused on the development of the risk management plans for the 300 areas for further assessment identified in the preliminary flood risk assessment.   <\/p><p> The National Procurement Service or NPS was established within the Office of Public Works in 2009 and was tasked with centralising public sector procurement arrangements for common goods and services.  In 2013, contracts initiated by the NPS covered major procurement areas such as electricity and natural gas, uniforms and personal protective equipment.  As the committee is aware, a Government decision of April 2013 agreed the outline plan for the development of an expanded central procurement function and from January 2014 the Office of Government Procurement has subsumed the NPS under its own Vote as part of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform group. <\/p><p> The final programme, estate portfolio management, encompasses the management, maintenance and development of a large part of the State&rsquo;s property portfolio including the care, protection and presentation of national monuments and national historic properties.  The programme utilises a wide variety of project management and professional services such as architecture, engineering, valuation, quantity surveying and property management. <\/p><p> Expenditure under this programme in 2013 included the payment of rents on behalf of all Government Departments to the value of &euro;97 million, a much reduced figure from the 2008 outturn of &euro;131 million.  The annual reductions in both the rental bill and the State's accommodation footprint continue to be achieved through a targeted lease rationalisation programme and a dynamic approach to property management which will continue to be pursued through the property asset management delivery plan, a priority reform area for the Government. <\/p><p> In 2013, some &euro;54 million was expended on property maintenance, which includes the facilities management function of the OPW and the management and maintenance of cultural buildings such as Leinster House and Dublin Castle.  However, in 2013, the OPW also assumed funding responsibility for all non-elective building maintenance on departmental property.  Essential maintenance is now provided on a shared and prioritised basis to Government Departments from one central maintenance fund managed by the OPW.  <\/p><p> The management, conservation and presentation of 780 national monuments and 30 national historic properties continues each year with a combined provision of 70 visitor centres accounting for an outturn of &euro;36 million in 2013.  I am glad to report that visitor numbers at these sites are steadily increasing with over 4 million visitors recorded at our heritage sites in 2013 and 4.4 million in 2014.  There are, of course, many millions more unrecorded visitors.  As part of the capital works programme in 2013, the &euro;48 million invested included works at the Irish Museum of Modern Art, improvement works at Garda stations and Government offices country wide and a wide-ranging energy conservation programme.<\/p><p> Ireland hosted the EU presidency in 2013, with the OPW providing a facilities and conference management role at properties such as Dublin Castle, Farmleigh, Castletown House, the Royal Hospital Kilmainham and the Botanic Gardens, providing the Government with a centralised and cost-effective Presidency for the 245 events hosted in the six month period. <\/p><p> I thank committee members for their attention today and am happy to take any questions they may have on the 2013 appropriation account, the chapter on agency services, or any other matters they wish to raise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015022600002#H00200","speaker":"965","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424944800,"counter":78,"content":"<p>I welcome the officials from the OPW.

Certain local authorities provided us with accommodation.  If those two were not met, we had to go to the market, and in that regard, we would be looking mainly at leasehold.  One of the issues on the Government's reform agenda is that the State wants to know what the State holds.  We have developed a register of State property which is currently being populated by public bodies.

Some relate to the capital cost of the facility, which the State owns, and the rest relates to the unitary charge.<\/p> <p>  The State recognised from the outset that the lack of a dedicated convention centre was disadvantaging the State in terms of business commercial tourism.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland has identified that &euro;1,275 per person is the wider economic benefit that accrues from international delegates attending.  Some 110,000 international delegates have attended the convention centre to date.  Under the project agreement, the operators of the convention centre have targets to achieve annually in that regard.  We will work through that project agreement.<\/p> <p>  There has been a share ownership change in respect of the centre, but it has no impact on the centre's operation.  We are the State body that will consent to that change.  We were advised of it today or yesterday.  We will work through a process with our advisers on the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015022600002#O01200","nonspeaker":"Ms Clare McGrath"},{"type":"speech","time":1424944800,"counter":300,"content":"<p>Who is the new owner?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015022600002#O01300","speaker":"1045"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424944800,"counter":301,"content":"<p>I am not sure whether that information is in the public domain.

A number of years ago, flooding caused devastation throughout the country.  In the recent storms, there was also damage to coastal areas.  The OPW faces major demands in that regard.  A process to identify areas is under way, but how will the OPW progress its plans in the short term?  What is its budget and what budget does it need to complete the works required?<\/p><p>The catchment flood risk assessment and management, CFRAM, programme was established as the national flood policy.  Under the EU floods directive, we have undertaken a preliminary flood risk assessment throughout the country.  Following consultation, we have identified 300 areas that are at risk.  I am treating this matter separately from what we are doing at the moment in terms of our capital programme.  CFRAM is the strategy for the future.  We are involved in initial consultations in respect of the 300 areas.  We are publishing the flood risk maps.  The process is ongoing and we have undertaken 145 or 150 consultations on the maps.  Towards the end of this year and into the beginning of 2016, we will publish the outline designs.  They will not just be a document.  They will be outline designs for the 300 areas that are at risk, of which 90 are coastal.  The designs take account of climate change.  The return period on the fluvial side is 100 years, which is the international standard.  On the coastal side, our return period is 200 years due to the tidal impact.  The designs take account of all of these elements.<\/p><p> Our programmed capital allocation is in the order of &euro;45 million through to 2016.  Works are in train at some of the 300 areas, but it will not be until we have the outline designs that we have clarity on indicative costings.  We expect that there will be a significant increase in the demand for capital to give effect to the implementation of the schemes.  Given the current position, we expect the additional demand to occur from 2017 or 2018 onwards, depending on the Government's opinion on the duration of the programme.  If it is to be a ten-year programme, which might be our suggestion, the capital will be allocated accordingly.  We must discuss with our colleagues in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform the setting out of capital figures, but there will also be an internal capacity issue if we are to move to that level of resourcing.  We will identify it as a demand.  While we might commission consultants to develop the schemes, we will manage the schemes internally.<\/p><p> The Deputy mentioned coastal storm damage.  Following the events at the beginning of 2014, the Government made an allocation for the repair of flood defences.  That &euro;19.1 million was channelled through the OPW's Vote.  Of that amount, &euro;7.5 million was drawn down in 2014.  Local authorities applied to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government for funding based on the damage caused.  Based on those local authority demands, the Government decided on what was more or less an equivalent amount, which has been channelled through us.  The local authorities have undertaken the work.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Ms Clare McGrath:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Subject to agreement, on seeing that the work is done, they recoup the money from us, or they draw it down to undertake the works.

The Congreve Foundation holds two seats of the trusteeship and operates the gardens.  What is at issue is the cost of operating the gardens.  The trust scheme goes back to the legacy of the late Ambrose Congreve, who received substantial tax benefits from the State and in return he was to provide funds to maintain and operate the gardens for the currency of the trust.  The gardens will remain in trust for 20 years before they ultimately come to the State.  The Attorney General advised there must be further examination of how this operates.  This created a new set of issues for us.  To answer the question as to why there has been an inordinate delay, it has been because of the legal position, specifically provision of a fund to maintain and manage the gardens into the further currency of the trust.  This has created issues and proceedings have been launched before the courts by the State.  On the positive side, we are working our way through these but they are highly complicated.  We must abide by the decision and advice of the Attorney General.  As I mentioned earlier, the fact the local authority is involved in negotiations means we are hopeful we can progress this.

The disadvantage of coming last is many of my questions have already been asked.  With regard to flood risk management, the witnesses spoke a lot about coastal flooding.  The report mentions 300 areas, 66 of which are connected to the Shannon.  In 2009, we were told major works would not be done because they would not be cost-effective and we would have to wait for the CFRAM report.  To be parochial, I am concerned because in 2013, &euro;71 million worth of work was done in places such as Mallow, Clonmel and Fermoy.  When I was fighting for flood relief in my area, I was told the works would not be cost-effective and we would have to wait for the overall picture in the CFRAM report.  Why have these works been done but not others?  At the time, we were told various local authorities could receive small sums of money for minor works.  What constitutes minor work?  Of the money allocated, how much of it was drawn down and how much work was done?  I speak in particular about the River Shannon.  Those living in an area at risk of flooding have been waiting for the CFRAM report for a long time.  I assume when the report comes out there will be a lead agency for the River Shannon which will be responsible for monitoring the river.  There are many difficulties with regard to whether the OPW, Waterways Ireland or the ESB is responsible.  Will this come out in the CFRAM report?<\/p> <p>  It seems a long time ago since Deputy O'Donovan spoke about rents.  I was shocked to read &euro;17 million was spent on rent for Revenue and &euro;14 million was spent on rent for the Department of Social Protection.  I am shocked because these are not new Departments.  They have been in existence for a long time.  Why do we spend this type of money on an annual basis renting property for a Department which will obviously be in existence for a long time?  Why do we not consider buying premises or using premises we already own?  It does not seem cost-effective or business-like.  One would not do it if one was running a private business.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015022600002#T00900","speaker":"1194"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424944800,"counter":447,"content":"<p>I will come back to the question on what is being drawn down by the local authorities in the areas affected in order that the Deputy will see what was sought and what was drawn down with regard to the River Shannon.  In the 1980s, the Government made a decision to discontinue arterial drainage.  After this, it was recognised there were urban areas where schemes were needed, and ten schemes were identified.  The Office of Public Works undertook these schemes, and funds were made available.  Since then, significant flood events have occurred in particular locations, and these have been an element in driving demands with regard to considering the feasibility of what could be done and what was viable.  Much was determined on the potential costs and benefits and what would be the greater return, such as the number of houses protected.  In this exercise, 300 areas have been identified, and multi-criteria analysis will determine the order in which work will be undertaken, subject to capacity and funding.  We will use systematic and objective criteria to determine nationally what projects proceed.  The Deputy mentioned 66 locations, but a considerable number of locations along the Shannon have been identified in the CFRAM report and among the 300 locations.<\/p> <p>  It is not proposed to have a lead agency for the management of the Shannon.  As it is, there are local stakeholders such as residents, the farming sector and other sectors and other stakeholders such as the ESB, Waterways Ireland, Inland Fisheries, angling associations and other amenity users of the Shannon, some of which have statutory responsibilities and others with ownership rights.  There is also Bord na M&oacute;na and various other public bodies.  Our role, through the CFRAM process, is management of flood risk.  We do not control the Shannon and all of its elements.  It is very important to us that all stakeholders come together, which is part of our public consultation effort, to ensure we achieve balance between the competing demands while providing flood protection.<\/p><p>Given the number of agencies, there must be one lead.  Meelick is not in my constituency, but a man-made cut there, which is overgrown, is affecting my constituency.  We cannot get one half of it cleared because it is a special area of conservation and planning permission is required.  One is passed from Department to Department because it is not its responsibility.  There needs to be one lead agency in control of the entire situation.  Otherwise we will be on a hiding to nothing.  Farmers working on the shores of the Shannon know the river better than anybody.  They want this piece of the cut cleared, but they cannot get it done because there is no lead agency.  Waterways Ireland does not want it and neither does the ESB.  It is a special area of conservation.  It is absolutely ridiculous.  We are spending a lot of money on a report for which we have waited since 2009.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Gabrielle McFadden:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2399\"><img src=\"..\/images\/info.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Information on Deputy Gabrielle McFadden\"\/><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=committees&amp;amp;code=ACC&amp;amp;memberid=2399&amp;amp;pid=GabrielleMcFadden&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=26\"><img src=\"..\/images\/zoom.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Zoom on Deputy Gabrielle McFadden\"\/><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->When the report comes out it will provide maps for the whole country.  I know we have never had such maps before and it will probably be an advantage.  The people who live in the region have been affected by floods.  They are not just numbers; they are people who have homes and livelihoods in the region.  They know the River Shannon better than anybody else and want this piece of land cleared.  They cannot get that done even though they have jumped through hoops.  It would be useful to have a lead agency, which one could approach with ideas of what needs to be done, and then the lead agency could give a directive for the work to be done.  At present there are too many chief and not enough Indians.  People are saying who should do what but nobody is doing anything.  That is why I firmly believe that after the CFRAM report there should be one lead agency that will direct all the other agencies, an initiative which is very important to the people on the ground.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015022600002#T01000","nonspeaker":"Ms Clare McGrath","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424944800,"counter":450,"content":"<p>With respect, Deputy McFadden has raised a policy issue.<\/p> <p>  In respect of policy for the OPW entity, our responsibility is flood risk.

Session A today is the public hearing discussion with Mr. David McWilliams on early warnings, divergent and contrarian views.<br\/><br\/>In commencing this morning's proceedings I welcome everyone to the 11th public hearing of the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis.  At our first session this morning we will hear from Mr. David McWilliams on issues related to early warnings, divergent and contrarian views in the context of the banking crisis in Ireland.  David McWilliams is an economist, writer, broadcaster and journalist.  He worked initially as an economist with the Central Bank of Ireland, the Union Bank of Switzerland and Banque Nationale de Paribas.  Since 1999 he has been a broadcaster, writer, economic commentator and documentary maker.  He has written four books, writes two weekly economic columns and he has made various documentaries.  He has brought a one man economic stand-up show to the stage at the Abbey Theatre.  David McWilliams is credited with being one of the first economists to predict a boom in Ireland's economy and for his predictions of an Irish property bubble building from 2000 to 2007 which would ultimately burst.  He was the first to coin the phrase &quot;ghost estates&quot;.  In January 2007, David McWilliams was selected as one of 250 young global leaders by the World Economic Forum and he is a regular speaker on the international circuit.  I welcome Mr. McWilliams.<br\/><br\/>I wish to advise the witness that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If the witness is directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter, and continues to do so, the witness is entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of the evidence.  The witness is directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  The witness has been informed previously that the committee is asking witnesses to refrain from discussing named individuals in this phase of the inquiry.  Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that Members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside of the House or an official by name, or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  Can I invite Mr. McWilliams to make his opening remarks to the inquiry please.<\/p><p>Thank you very much, Chairman.  It is a pleasure to be here.  I just want to make some opening remarks about the period in question, starting with 2000 and going up to 2008 and beyond.  It is my opinion that the Irish banking system, and by extension the rest of the Irish economy, was set up to fail.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Mr. David McWilliams:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I saw this earlier than anybody else and I made this opinion and these ideas available as widely as possibly.  In fact, I probably spent the best part of a decade trying to warn as many people as possible on as many platforms as possible that our property market was going to crash and that when it did, our banking system would be in a situation where money would fly out of the system and lead to a banking crisis.  I did this in hundreds of thousands of words; not thousands, but hundreds of thousands of words, in dozens of articles, two a week in the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>, the biggest selling newspaper in the country, and in <i>The Sunday Business Post<\/i>.  <br\/><br\/>I made documentaries about this.  I had my own TV show on TV3, which was watched by tens of thousands of people.  I warned people at every juncture that our housing market was a credit bubble and credit bubbles bust and it is not a matter of if they bust but when they bust.  The documentaries of <i>The Pope's Children<\/i>book, which I wrote, were watched by 36% of the Irish watching audience; that is a lot of people.  <i>The Pope's Children<\/i>, and I do not say this for any other reason than to make the point, was disseminated extremely widely and was the bestselling non-fiction book, not of the year, but of the decade, and it was published in 2005.  So these ideas were out there, disseminated widely, in the most accessible way.  When I hear the view that nobody saw this coming or that this was in some way a shock or we were taken by surprise, I do not believe that is the case.  I think the Irish property crash and the banking crash were both incredibly predictable and absolutely preventable. <br\/><br\/>This testimony will be a little bit different in the sense that it will not be about what should have or could have happened, and if we had seen that, if we did not see that, and my God I cannot believe we missed that.  This testimony will be taken from contemporaneous articles, pieces of work that show thinking at the time.  This was not isolated thinking.  In fact, I believe, and my experience through the period from 2000 onwards was, that many thousands of ordinary Irish people could see what was happening.  The difference is that I was an economic commentator and an economist and I had the platform of the media to deploy these ideas.  I cannot tell you the number of times I went into bars and pubs and chatted to people and they said, &quot;Hold on a second, this doesn't seem right; what is going on here?&quot;  So it is not as if a significant part of the population was not already worried.  I want to make that point that this was preventable and predictable, and that these views were widely disseminated.  There were not a huge coterie of individuals doing this but it was certainly out there.  <br\/><br\/>One could probably ask oneself why did this guy, who is a former Central Bank economist, an investment bank economist, why did he not just come home to Ireland, keep his mouth shut, play the game and get on with business.  The reason is I felt that if one has a specialty, if one understands something, one has something like a patriotic duty or a moral imperative to say that the policy or numbers of policies that we have together will lead our country into catastrophe.  I think it was a patriotic thing to do.  It certainly was not a worthwhile thing to do and it certainly was not fashionable and it certainly did not make me popular.  The interesting thing is that all through this period I was accused of being unpatriotic when I believe in actual fact it was something that was essential to do if one had the education and the experience to do so.  I remember people saying that I was unpatriotic for talking down the economy.  The committee might remember that expression, &quot;Talking down the economy&quot;.  I think that was maybe a reaction on the part of certain parts of the establishment to somebody saying, &quot;Hold on a second, this thing will not last.&quot;  <br\/><br\/>It seems to me from a political perspective that on every big economic issue, Ireland tends to split between insiders and outsiders.  The insiders are people with &quot;pull&quot;, the old fashioned word, with access to power, and the outsiders are people who are actually on the outside.  In the case of the property market and the associated banking and credit explosion, the insiders were the bankers themselves, estate agents, people who were doing well out of the property market, parts of the professional classes who were doing very well, and senior Government officials who were looking the other way or were not necessarily taking on board what was clear.  These are the people on the inside who were actually doing well.  Then, of course, political parties, because if there is a property boom there will be a tax boom.  If there is a tax boom then there will be lots of goodies to give out, lots of sweeties to give out.  So I think they are the insiders and in the situation of a housing boom where house prices are rising well above what the average person can afford, the outsiders are simply the people on the outside who are forced to play a game in which the dice is loaded against them from the start.  I think that is important; there is a political context in this.  <br\/><br\/>I suppose I devoted such enormous energies to try to warn about this for two main reasons.  The first reason was because I believed that hundreds of thousands of ordinary Irish people would end up in negative equity and would end up in debt and would end up in a situation where their lives would be destroyed by the debt associated with the housing market and they would end up being the people who paid.  That is a social reason.  The second reason, and this is very important for the context of this, is that I had worked both inside the Central Bank in Ireland in a crisis but, more crucially, I had also worked outside in investment banking.  What I see and what I saw were panics in investment banks, panics in financial markets, and I could see that every single day we avoided taking responsibility for this mess.  Every single day we said, &quot;It will be grand,&quot; or, &quot;There will be a soft landing,&quot; or, &quot;Don't worry about it, it is the markets.&quot;  We were therefore condemning ourselves to run out of options when the crisis happened.  The more we ignored, the more desperate we became and therefore the more we ignored the more likely we were to end up, which we did when the crash came, in a situation where our choices were not between good and bad but between bad and worse.<br\/><br\/>The crash was inevitable.  Now why was it inevitable?  This is the key.It was inevitable because of the way in which the banks were financing themselves.  Again I wrote all of this at the time.  I was writing this in 2000 and 2001.  This is not me thinking back and looking with hindsight.  This was obvious to anybody who was trained.  It was obvious.  This is not the sort of thing that anybody who is trained could not see.  This panic did not have to happen.  The panic of September 2008 did not have to happen.  It was not anything that was pre-ordained.  It could have been fixed very early.  The problem is if there is no housing boom there will be no banking boom.  If there is no banking boom there will be no banking crisis.  If there is no banking crisis there will be no interventions, such as the guarantee, and there will be no bailout.  All of these things are the consequence of bad economic policy, not the cause.  They are the consequence.  What happens in banks when they get out of control is that they all end in bank runs.  A bank run is when people take their money out.  A bank run is called a run because it happens quickly; it is not a bank amble or a bank stroll or a bank stroll around the park with a dog.  It is a run because people panic.  That panic will be more extreme if there is what is called hot money, if there is international money financing the banks.  When I saw this in 2004 that was when I realised we had a serious problem.<br\/><br\/>The Irish banking crisis began in 2000, not in 2008 as is sometimes suggested.  It began in 2000.  The great English economist John Stuart Mill, speaking about the railway crash that happened in Ireland during the Famine, said that crashes do not destroy the wealth of a nation, they merely evidence the extent to which wealth has already been destroyed by stupid decisions taken in the boom.  So the destruction of the Irish balance sheet did not happen after 2008; it actually happened before.  That is the nub of the issue, because prevention is always better than cure; we know that.  There is a direct link therefore between not heeding the warnings and vilifying those who warn.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Mr. David McWilliams:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->There is a direct link between this and the subsequent panic which need not have happened and the decisions that were taken. <br\/><br\/>The best way to look at this credit banking panic is through the prism of a forest fire.  Let us imagine a forest fire in a small place; the pyromaniacs start the fire which, in this case, are the banks and the forest is the general economy.  The people who are supposed to be the firemen, the regulators and the monetary authorities, look the other way and say &quot;Don't worry about the fire&quot;.  Some people would have said we have had them before and they have been quite nasty but this one will be different.  The firemen say &quot;Don't worry, we'll be grand, it will blow itself out.&quot;  Then the fire engulfs, not only the forest, but is about to engulf the entire village beside it.  The village leaders, the politicians, are faced with the choice - does one let the thing blow and see what happens because one never knows maybe a house will remain, or does one put it out?  At that stage one has to put out the fire with every single method possible.  Why?  Because it is already engulfing the entire place.  If one looks at the situation in that way one can see the way in which I, who wrote this a long time ago, think about these situations.<br\/><br\/>Who started the fire?  I wrote many years ago that property markets can only increase with credit.  Property markets do not increase as a result of supply and demand.  That was a big canard.  It does not happen that way.  It is credit.  Who gave the credit?  The banks.  Worse, what happened?  When the banks ran out of our deposits - normally the bank would say to itself I have a deposit here that will allow me to lend - they borrowed other people's money to give to us to buy houses that we were buying and selling to each other at expensive prices and calling it a miracle.  Whose money did they borrow?  They borrowed from the Germans, French, British, etc.  There was hot money coming in.  For example, one of the largest banks took 100 years to build up a balance sheet of &euro;60 billion but it doubled that in three years.  Let us think about that.  Why?  Because it had all this money coming in.  <br\/><br\/>What was the regulation called?  It was called light touch regulation.  Light touch regulation means one guarantees, almost makes certain, that the banking system is going to implode because hot money always leaves.  When hot money leaves then the rest of the money leaves too.  We actually set the entire thing up and this is crucial to a fail.<br\/><br\/>The interesting thing is a lot of people said:  &quot;Don't worry.  The free market will discipline the banks.&quot;  That does not happen.  Let me explain what happens in the free markets.  On the way up the free markets do not discipline the banks but do the opposite and allow the banks to do what they want.  As a consequence we have an  extraordinary situation where one joins the EMU, which was an unusual decision we might talk about later but it had a material impact on the economy, most of which in my opinion is negative.  We have light touch regulation, we get this flood of money into the banks which facilitates over-lending and then the over-lending facilitates over-borrowing.  All of this sounds familiar now but back in 2003 nobody was discussing it or those who did were vilified.  I shall play the committee a little 40-second clip of me on &quot;Prime Time&quot; in October 2003 which was watched by 400,000 people.  This is important and I said: <blockquote>The Irish housing market is a scam.  It is an enormous financial swindle that could potentially confine an entire generation of young Irish workers to years of bad debt.  Far from being a reflection of economic vitality and fundamental demand the housing bubble is, in the main, a vacuous financial confidence trick that has been foisted upon us by an alliance of banks and the landowners.<br \/><br \/>Today, in Ireland, the price of the average house is close to ten times the average wage.  This represents an economic failure on a monumental scale.  Behind this nonsense is excessive and irresponsible lending from our financial institutions.  The situation would be laughable if it were not so serious.<\/blockquote>That clip dates from October 2003.  I said: &quot;The Irish housing market is a scam.&quot;  That is what it was and that is what I want to come back to.  It was financed by over-lending not demand.<br\/><br\/>A lot of people have asked me what made me think like that while other economists did not.  I will wrap up but I want to make the following point about what happens when house prices rise.  Economics tells us that when the price rises the demand falls, that is what we teach kids in school.  In Ireland the opposite happens with house prices.  When the price rises the demand rises because people get panicked.  One hears that all the time.  People say: &quot;Jesus, prices are going up by 10%.  I'd better get on the ladder now because if I don't I'll have to pay another 10% next year.&quot;  A very active rise in prices, once it is allowed, creates a dynamic in people's heads to buy more, not less.  This is why economists could do with common sense, which is what I have always felt.  I urge them to talk to people.  I suggest they forget the models, talk to people, ask them what they think and then think about supply.  Economists will say &quot;Oh, when the prices the supply goes up&quot;.  <br\/><br\/>The main houses we have in Ireland is a stock of housing.  The houses are already built.  Someone like my Mum would trade down from a family house, she would move on and some other family would have the home.  Let us think about what happens when house prices rise.  My mother would say, and it is natural, &quot;I won't sell that now if they are going up by 20%.  Wouldn't I be mad to sell so I shall sell next year?&quot;.  That would be a totally rational decision for my mother.  Not only does the price not work, it amplifies the problem.  It ends up that supply eventually adjusts but it adjusts far too late.  We end up building houses in the wrong place for the wrong people at the wrong price.  That is why I coined the expression &quot;ghost estates&quot;.<br\/><br\/>In 2006, I was travelling back from Westport having visited Allergan, a factory which produces Botox, not for my own use.  I visited for a piece of research I was doing about who made Botox.  While I drove back from Mayo to Dublin I saw that every little town had a huge big estate and was reminded of a conversation I had had the night before.  I was thinking, because I had talked to a local guy the night before about the famine in Mayo, about how extraordinary it was and how unbelievably catastrophic it was.  He talked about the famine villages around Delphi and that neck of the woods.  He said they were like ghost villages and were kind of creepy.  When I saw the estates on my drive back home I thought they were exactly the same and that they were ghost estates.  It is funny because when one comes up with a term one does not realise that it will drop into the lexicon so quickly.  Obviously the &quot;breakfast roll man&quot; was building the &quot;ghost estates&quot;.  All these things happened but the ghost estates are indicative of how supply does not respond.<br\/><br\/>One wonders why people behave like this.  I want the committee to understand, at the very beginning, why the economy behaves like this.  People behave like this because we are all impacted by each other.  Economists think we are all rational.  We are not.  We are highly irrational.  Has anyone every met a more irrational animal than us?  We fall in love, we follow stupid football teams - all the things that make no sense.  The reason is that everything we do is impacted by other people.  <br\/><br\/>A couple of months I was in the Aviva stadium with my son.  In Dublin, there are two types of people.  There are those people who buy their own tickets to the Aviva and there those people who get paid to go to the Aviva.  I fall into the former camp.  I remember Ireland scored three tries against Australia in the first 18 minutes.  Even though I had really good seats with my 12-year old I saw none of the tries.  Why?  Every time the Irish team did well everyone seated in front of us stood up.  Then I had to stand up and my kid had to stand up and get on my shoulders.  Then the people behind me had to stand up and that continued for all the people behind them.  That is exactly how the economy works too.  The fellas who stood up first had no idea they were sending a signal to me to stand up because I was behind them.  I had no idea that I was impairing the view of the people behind me.  We had all paid to sit in the Aviva but we ended up standing.  That is how is the economy behaves.  When people see house prices rising in Ireland they buy houses, if they can, not because they want them but because other people are buying them.  That type of herd behaviour is essential to understand why a property boom in a country like ours, if it is not controlled, gets totally and utterly out of hand unless of course one is lending to this property boom in which case one is making money so does not care.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Mr. David McWilliams:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The question is, why did the banks not see this?  Why did they not see that their own balance sheets were being impaired?  I believe it is because banks' balance sheets play tricks on them.  Every time a chunk of money goes into the economy, house prices rise.  That means the banks' collateral rises so they feel safe.  Every time the collateral rises they feel safer and safer and ultimately they lend more and more and more.  Then, if one's bonus is related to one's share price one has a greater interest in lending more because lending more makes one rich and gives one profits.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015022600002#A00100","speaker":"990","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424944800,"counter":569,"content":"<p>Move towards a conclusion now Mr. McWilliams because we also have to ask you some questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015022600002#D00200","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424944800,"counter":570,"content":"<p>I am trying to get to the point of why this economy works as it does and why we need to have a set of views of the economy which reflect what actually happens in reality and not in some dream world of academia.  I am saying the banks' balance sheets play tricks on them and they ultimately go bust.  Why is that?  Because they are allowed to borrow yet more.  They keep borrowing and the balance sheets look fine.  Then they realise the more they borrow, the worse the balance sheet is, but they do not see it.<\/p> <p> Why did the interest rate not rise?  It was because we are in the EU.  We have this crazy situation in that we have decided we are Germans.  What is that all about?  Ireland does most of its trade with Britain and the US, yet we have a currency attached to Germany.  Somebody else may elucidate as to why that is.  When German interest rates fall, our interest rates fall too.  When our interest rates fall there is no warning sign from outside.  That is hugely important because it is material to the next ten years, not just the last ten years.  <\/p> <p> We also have an issue with groupthink.  Why did nobody, or very few, speak out?  I believe groupthink is something that happens in many aspects.  I believe that if one has ideas in Ireland which are beyond the mainstream, those ideas go through three phases.  The first phase is open ridicule, the second phase is violent opposition and both of these happened to me.  The third phase is where we are now which is that everybody pretends they were on one's side all the time.  This is what happens.  Groupthink shifts because it is a conventional wisdom.

You based this on the Minsky Kindleberger credit cycle analysis.  Can you please outline to the committee what that theory means?<br\/><br\/>Can you also inform the inquiry if any person in authority contacted you in regard to the concerns you were raising at that time?<\/p><p>It is an interesting question.  The book <i>The Pope's Children<\/i>was so widely read that these ideas were in the ether.  This was not an academic book that nobody read, it was the biggest selling non-fiction book of the decade.  This has all happened before, all over the world.  We can go back to the Romans or even the Bible.  In Deuteronomy and Leviticus, two books in the Old Testament deal with debt forgiveness after booms.  We are not talking about something new, we are talking about something that is deep in our culture.<br\/><br\/>Most mainstream economists in Ireland believe in classical economic theory and I do not.  I never have.  I will give an example of what happens in peoples' heads when prices rise.  There are two stand-out American economists I learned about after I left postgraduate studies and university in Ireland, namely, Charles Kindleberger and Hyman Minsky.  They understood that once credit was put into the mix, it profoundly changes the way people behave.  Members will know this from talking to their constituencies.  Kindleberger outlined the various stages of the cycle.  There are seven stages.<br\/><br\/>One is when something material happens or actually changes.  In our case we joined the European Monetary Union and our interest rates in the long term went from a real interest rate of about 6% down to almost zero.  Our interest rates fell which changed the landscape profoundly.  House prices begin to rise in this first stage of Kindleberg's model.<br\/><br\/>The second stage is euphoria.  People begin to think it is because of themselves that their house price is rising.  They think they are clever.  House prices continue to rise.  The third phase is gearing, which is when the banks get involved with the idea that one can remortgage a house to buy two gaffs in the Algarve.  Gearing means that the whole thing starts to get a little bit crazy.  The fourth phase is the mania phase when people become manic.  People actually flew to Bulgaria to buy houses, financed by their houses in Ireland.  Banks are now pushing the money.<br\/><br\/>The fifth phase is the bubble phase.  We all lived through it and know what it is.  The sixth phase in the Kindleberger cycle is the phase of distress.  This is when people start to dislike the smell of the situation.  Early people get out and start selling.  The seventh phase of the Kindleberger Minsky cycle is called <i>torschlusspanik, <\/i>a German phrase from when it happened in Germany and Austria in the 19th century.  It translates as shut door panic, when everybody jumps and runs for the door and tries to sell.  The whole thing collapses.  This happens in assets all the time and I could see this.  <br\/><br\/>There are three phases which happen next.  The first is the Minsky moment.  This is crucial because our banks had a Minsky moment in September 2008.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Mr. David McWilliams:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->A Minsky moment is when a bank realises it does not have any money and must sell good assets to pay for the losses on bad assets, because those assets are entirely bought on margin.  Once one buys something on margin, one is in the lap of the gods.  So we had Kindleberger's seven stages, then we had a crash and then came the Minsky moment where we had bank collapses.  Again, this is all in the book.  At that stage only massive state intervention can help.  It is described as requiring a hegemon, that is, a big country or large institution, a central bank or the ECB, say, to come in and right the situation.  That is because they, like me, do not believe in classical economics.  The economy will not right itself after this type of boom and there must be an intervention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015022600002#D01000","speaker":"990","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424944800,"counter":580,"content":"<p>That leads me to my last question.

What I was trying to explain, which had not really been explained before and certainly had not been explained to the Irish people by the policy makers, was that once one joins a monetary union, what one is effectively doing, if there is no regulation of one's banks, is getting the PIN number to the ATM card of the richest person in the room.  Of course, the richest person in the EU's room was Germany.  It was rich and it was in decline.  After reunification in the early 1990s, the united country swallowed up the former East Germany and it cost it a fortune to do so.  Germany's economy then began to stagger under the weight of those repayments and as a result of the cultural and demographic shift.  The country started to go into decline in the period from 1995 to 2005.  For Ireland, this meant our interest rates, which were really set for the Germans, went to levels that were totally inappropriate for the boom we were having.  It meant that the normal way in which one warns people that things are out of kilter, which is by setting higher interest rates, not only did not happen but we actually got lower interest rates.<\/p> <p>  I was trying to explain in the book where the money was coming from.  I remember going to pubs and people asking, \"Where is all this bloody money coming from?\".  I recall a builder friend of mine who worked with me years ago in Boston saying to me that the difference in Ireland at that time, compared with the past, was there was now no problem getting money.  For the 2005 book, I invented a German character whom I named Udo Lindenberg after a German crooner.  This guy was sort of the German version of France's Johnny Hallyday - not a great gig to attend, I suspect.  I invented the character and named him for this singer I had heard of.  Udo represented the old, parsimonious German saver.  Banks hate saving because they do not make any money on them.  In fact, they pay out for saving.  In that situation, they asked themselves who they could give them to in order to make money on Udo's savings, and over here was Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015022600002#E00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. David McWilliams"},{"type":"speech","time":1424944800,"counter":588,"content":"<p>I will bring Mr. McWilliams forward now to the very early part of September 2008.

Once one has defined that reality and got the facts, then one can do something about it.  Once something has been done about it, one can then face into the crisis.

The second day after Lehman's failed, the Americans did what would be called the nationalisation route.  They nationalised AIG, the massive insurance company.  Nationalising would not have stopped the bank run in Ireland because the bank run was systemic in the sense that people were taking money out of all the banks, so you nationalise one but it just means that people will say, \"Who is next?\".  That is exactly what happened in America.<\/p><p> The next day Merrill Lynch went bust.  I did mention to the Minister that I found it ironic that his lead advisers were Merrill Lynch, people who could not even keep their own bank solvent, let alone advise others.  At the time, he was aware.  <\/p><p> The third option was that one of the big Irish banks would buy one of the small Irish banks, the idea being if you have a big balance sheet, you can actually take over a smaller balance sheet but I said to him at the time that all the Irish balance sheets were bust because we all knew they were doing the same thing.  So even without the figures, you knew that they were all bust.  I remember saying to him that I thought \"two bad balance sheets does not make a good one\".  <\/p><p> Then he said, \"What about the idea of giving a &euro;100,000 guarantee to depositors?\".  I said, \"That could work but you cannot really be half pregnant, Minister\" and I remember he kind of smiled at this.  I said that if until yesterday you said the banks are well capitalised and then tomorrow morning you say, \"Do you know what, not only are they not well capitalised, they are going to bust but we will protect some people\".  When the hot money is owned by people in trading floors, that does not cut it.  In fact, that proved to be the case.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Mr. David McWilliams:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->A limited &euro;100,000 guarantee was introduced on the Friday after that and it did not work as money continued to flow out.

Blanket guarantees have been used in 14 out of 42 bank crises.  They are not unusual, but the Irish one was followed in Denmark and Germany a week later.  It is only as a last resort and I remember saying to the Minister, \"I don't know; I don't have the facts, but I think we are at the last resort.  What you have got to do [this is very important for the record and it is written down in black and white in all of my documents] is you have got to introduce a holding guarantee which buys you the time to allow your auditors and your civil servants to go in and find out the facts.  You cannot do something permanent when you are not in possession of the facts and if you are not in possession of the facts and that is the case right now, you need to do something temporary with a time limit.

However, in all cases, there is a distinction between debt and equity for corporate finance receiverships.  Equity like instruments are never included and subordinated or junior debt is subordinate to or underneath and at no stage did I ever imagine that such debt would be included and the reason is that it is known that in all corporate finance receiverships subordinated debt is an equity like instrument.  It comes at the very, very last and has many more of the characteristics of a share than a bond.  You get paid more to hold the subordinated debt, so you are being paid for the risk.

I informed Brian Lenihan that exactly this tactic was taken by the IMF in 1998 in Asia.  There was a crisis in Thailand with the baht, followed by crises in Malaysia and then Indonesia.

His thinking, and the Department's thinking, became harder and harder and then the migration towards we are going to pay everything became almost obvious to those of us who were worried about it.  I began to write constantly warning people that this was being used as a way for full payment, in the case of a bankruptcy, which was never the objective.<\/p><p> I argued that we should move to what is called the savings and loans model in the United States.  That model came about as a result of a big collapse there in the 1980s and 1990s where eventually they realised the cost of bank bailouts was going to be too much.  They decided that what they were going to do was force the bondholders - the debtholders - to take equity which made them shareholders in the banks which, in a way, allied the banks and shareholders in the same place.  That was increasingly my thinking and then the following became so obvious to me after NAMA.  What NAMA did with the guarantee was it ensured that this country would end up selling our assets at a discount and buying our liabilities at a premium.  That is morally wrong but is also a financial disaster.  At that point we had created the ELA or emergency liquidity assistance.  That meant the banks' liquidity was solid so one could have rescinded the guarantee, kept NAMA in place and nothing would have happened because the ECB was back in there and the Central Bank was back in.

In a small country one gets significant vested interested.  When a small country experiences a banking and property boom many people will make a lot of what looks like very easy money.  That cohort of people have a clear incentive to vilify the maverick.<\/p> <p>  With respect to my own profession of economics, it amazed me at the time that so few, in any positions of power, did anything or said anything.  I have found it amazing that people were swanning around with titles like bank expert and international bank expert.  I said \"Well, hold on a second.  You were living in the country that had the most catastrophic bank crisis and you didn't open your beak.\"  People watching this are entitled to ask that question.  <\/p> <p>  There is a thing in Ireland which I refer to as conventional wisdom.  When conventional wisdom sets in it is repeated by serious people.  People say \"He is not a serious person but I am a serious person because the guy beside me is a serious person.\"  Then he repeats the mantra and then mantras replace hard thinking.  Once mantras replace hard thinking then every serious person buys into them.  J.K. Galbraith said something very interesting about changing one's mind.  It is very hard to change one's mind if one is a serious person.  He said that when faced with the choice of changing one's mind or finding the proof that indicates one does not have to, the vast majority gets busy finding the proof.  Let us consider that thought in the context of this country.  People like me were regarded with the view that it could not possibly be right, what this guy is saying, because the vista is too apocalyptic.  One of the views was \"Ah but he spent too much time abroad.\"  <\/p> <p>  I feel, and this is worrying for subsequent future years, that when this society coalesces around what I would call a simple truth, such as there will be a soft landing or the banks are well capitalised, it is an extraordinarily dangerous place to be.  It means that, like lemmings, we all go over the cliff together.  <\/p> <p>  As I have always thought, if one thinks of a quadrant of maverick, consensus, right and wrong, which applies to politics as well, if one is in that consensus and one is wrong then people adopt the view that we are all wrong together and sure that is grand.  People think \"We are all a bit stupid but we are all stupid together\".  If one is in the consensus and one is right people think \"Sure, we are all geniuses, that is great. Jesus, you are smarter than me.  Oh my God, you are outrageously smart.\"  If one is a maverick and one is wrong then one is a maverick that is wrong.  In that case one is incredibly isolated, laughed at, sneered at and regarded as being somebody who is not serious.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015022600002#J01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. David McWilliams"},{"type":"speech","time":1424944800,"counter":685,"content":"<p>Please conclude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015022600002#J01400","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424944800,"counter":686,"content":"<p>Let me make this very important point.

The interesting thing about human nature is that it never changes.  All these things happen again and again.  At the time, what really struck me as fascinating from an economic historian&rsquo;s perspective was how Spain went from being the richest and most aggressive colonialist country in Europe in the 16th century to the poorest in the 17th century.  How did that happen?  There are many theories but one in particular struck me.  What actually happened was that when they plundered all the gold from Latin America, it became easier not to work.  Huge swathes of the Spanish manufacturing and agricultural sectors stopped because the Spaniards did not bother working.  The people who actually got the most benefit from the Spanish plunder of the Inca gold were not the Spanish but the Dutch and the British who actually made the nails, the hammers, the guns and other products they sold to the Spaniards.  That always struck me as interesting.<\/p> <p>  What the Spaniards had was a massive monetary stimulus, like in the context of Ireland.  They woke up one morning and had all the money in the world.  We woke up one morning and through the banks had all the money in the world.

If the Deputy thinks about it, if one puts money into land in Ireland, how many tax breaks does one get?  Loads.  How much cheap capital does one get?  Loads.  Why does one get cheap capital?  It is because the banks say they know what land smells and feels like.  However, take someone like Apple&rsquo;s founders.  They tell the banks they are going to build the most amazing computers out of a garage and will need X millions of euro to do so but have no guarantees or collateral, just that it is all in their head.  The banks will not give someone like that money.<\/p> <p>  What I was trying to explain in the historical context was that one part of our economy would become bloated with capital while another part would become totally starved.  That is where we have to got to in Ireland.  We have a massively efficient multinational sector but very little domestic industry.  I believe this is because the way which Irish capital was given out in the boom, namely that it always favoured land.  At the very top of the boom, 88% of every single loan given out by an Irish bank in this country was to a property or property-related investment.  When one allows the banks be the sole arbiter of the distribution of capital, one will get endemic short-termism.  Why?

The beauty about Ireland is that if a currency is overvalued, one can see it not in outflows of money but in the length of the queues of Toyota Corollas at Sainsbury's in Newry to buy cheap Harp for Christmas.  Deputy Doherty will know this as someone from Letterkenny.  If the Irish currency is overvalued relative to sterling, the currency of our major trading partner, Irish people go across the Border to buy stuff.  We have a living economic experiment in Dundalk, Letterkenny and Lifford.

In 2000 I came up with a backward looking house price index whereby the last house price increase was divided by the average of the index and then multiplied by the loan-to-value ratio, which means that the increase in prices reduces the amount of money that can be lent.  It would be a dynamic system which could regulate itself.  That is how one should do it.  It is a simple statistical rule and it would be unbelievably easy to put in place.  It would strangle house price inflation because house price inflation would limit the amount of money that could be lent.

If, for example, the regulator saw that a bank had just issued a short-term liquidity instrument of &euro;500 million, which was happening all the time, it could have said, \"Hold on a second, you cannot do that.\"  The regulator would manage the bank's liabilities, which are the source of its delinquency, and as a consequence the bank would not be able to lend for commercial property.

Our objective was similarly to stop a bank run.  Sweden quickly realised it would have to set up a bad bank and it did so extremely quickly.  It wrote down the assets very quickly and minimised the cost.  However, it also devalued its currency by 40%.  Once a country devalues its currency, it is back to life.  What happened in Ireland's banking crisis was that, amazingly, not only did we not devalue our currency, but it actually increased in value between 2008 and 2010.  Sweden cut its interest rates to zero, but our interest rates went up after the crisis.

At the time we had a banking system that had been set up to fail.  It was not a matter of \"if\", it was a matter of \"when\".  The combination of hot money and a bank run is the most vicious and contagious financial episode one can imagine.  It is the financial equivalent of Ebola.  One needs to come in with all possible interventions to reduce the perceived risk in the minds of people that their money will not be there when they go to the bank tomorrow.  That is crucial.  Much of my testimony has been about how, in God's name, did we let it get to that situation.  Once one is in that situation, however, one has to ask whether one knows the facts and, if one does not, whether one should take the risk that not knowing the facts might imperil the banking system.

The most important point about regulation is that one can have the best regulation in the world but if one does not police it, it is not worth the paper on which it is written.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Mr. David McWilliams:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->As such it is better to have fewer points of regulation which are well policed rather than to have pages and pages of unpoliced regulations.

I would have thought - and I said it in all my writings - that the normal rules of corporate finance should apply in the case of insolvency.  Therefore, the guarantee would have been rescinded as the liquidity problem was already plugged.  Then one would have lined up all the creditors in a room and had a bank resolution mechanism as that is the system whereby we as a society deal with bad banks.  At the very top, one would have what I call \"trust creditors\".  They are creditors in trust, which is to say depositors.  When my mum goes to put her savings into the bank, she does not realise that technically she is lending money to the bank.  In her head, it is a nest egg, something for grandchildren and what she has put away for a rainy day.  She does not have any realisation that technically in the event of a bankruptcy, she is a lender.  Therefore, my solution, as I wrote at the time, was that as simple depositors trust the system, they should be regarded as trust creditors and encircled.  Under that, one then has the normal hierarchy of creditors which everybody understands.  It happens every single day in this country in receiverships.  That is the system we could still have.  That answers the Deputy's question.

This materialised rapidly in the significant growth of the Swedish economy in the 18 months after their banking crisis.  My feeling was and to a degree still is that the NAMA process was so slow in writing down and it never freed up the banks that had got the stuff off their balance sheets to begin the process of lending.

One values such an asset by estimating the stream of income that will come from it and multiplying it by a multiple.  UBS probably saw that the stream of income coming from Irish commercial property was falling because much of it was empty, similar to the ghost estate situation.  UBS was saying if the stream of income from the commercial property goes to zero, the loan goes bad immediately.  The only way the loan can be made good is if one continues to lend money against it, which is what happened in Ireland.  This is the type of analysis UBS would have come up with and it would have said a chunk of the balance sheet could go bust.  UBS would have asked what the share price of the company was and realised it was very high.

Professor McDonough is professor of economics at NUI Galway and has a PhD in economics from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst.  Before joining NUI Galway in 1995, he held posts at the Institute of Industry Studies at Cornell University, Canisius College, Buffalo, and Dublin City University.  He has published numerous books and academic articles, was on the editorial board of the Review of Radical Political Economics and is currently on the editorial board of the International Journal of Pluralism and Economics Education.  His current interests include globalisation, American and Irish economic history, political economy, the history of economic thought, and economics education for labour and community groups.<br\/><br\/>Before we begin, I advise Professor McDonough that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.

They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and, as they were previously informed, the committee is asking witnesses to refrain from discussing named individuals in this phase of the inquiry.<br\/><br\/>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<br\/><br\/>I invite Professor McDonough to make his opening statement.<\/p><p>I thank the committee for inviting me to testify before it today.  Along with the rest of the nation, I am looking forward to learning about many of the specific events and decisions leading up to the Irish banking crisis.  In contrast, however, I will concentrate on addressing today's brief, which concerns the international, European and Irish policy context of the banking crisis.  In doing so, I will be presenting a macroeconomic analysis of the overall crisis which still faces the world's peoples today, at least seven years after its inauguration.<br\/><br\/>It is important to understand that the situation affecting Ireland at the time of the banking guarantee cannot be characterised only as a financial crisis.  Instead, Ireland at this time was caught up in a perfect storm, one whose great winds have periodically abated only to blow up again.  It is popular in some quarters to refer to Ireland's crisis as homegrown, and it is certainly true that one storm front blew up within the borders of Ireland.  However, 2008 saw the tragic convergence of this front with two other influences, one the global storm of the international crisis of global neoliberalism.  This blew Ireland against the other influence, namely, the unforgiving shores of the euro system.  We do not have to go all the way back to the proverbial butterfly flapping its wings to find the origins of this maelstrom.  The global crisis, the European crisis and the Irish crisis all find their origins in the same basic institutions of the age.  All are rooted in the four institutions of globalisation, neoliberalism, repression of labour and financialisation.<br\/><br\/>What are these institutions?  Globalisation<i><\/i>is the disintegration of production processes into their component parts and the location of each of these components in that area of the world most congenial to making profits.  The production process is then reintegrated through free trade across borders.  This process brings employers and workers face to face across the globe.  Neoliberalism<i><\/i>is a complex phenomenon.  It can perhaps be most succinctly described as market fundamentalism, a belief that important social decisions about production and income distribution are almost always and everywhere best left to be determined in markets.  This idea manifests itself in institutions like the World Trade Organisation, policies like deregulation and privatisation and ideologies like free market economics.  The repression of labour<i><\/i>involves the erosion of the power of labour to defend its organisations, working conditions and standard of living.  It is most dramatically evidenced in the decline in union density.  Financialisation<i>, <\/i>according to the American economist Jerry Epstein, &quot;refers to the increasing importance of financial markets, financial motives, financial institutions, and financial elites in the operation of the economy and its governing institutions, both at the national and international level&quot;.<br\/><br\/>All these institutions date from the early 1980s.  Their beginnings are marked by the political victories of Ronald Reagan in the United States and Margaret Thatcher in the United Kingdom.  These new institutions can be collectively labelled the era of global neoliberalism.  This new stage of capitalism at first led to recovery.  In the 1970s, capitalism was in a period which has come to be known as the Great Stagflation, a condition of simultaneous high unemployment and high inflation which was unpredicted by the Keynesian economics of the time.  Together, globalisation, financialisation, neoliberalism and the loss of labour influence led to a period known in some quarters as the Great Moderation.  Profit rates, which had been falling from the late 1960s, bottomed out in the early 1980s and over time returned to their previous levels.  Growth recovered, although it did not reach the standards of the earlier post-Second World War period.  Employment rose and inflation fell and remained low.<br\/><br\/>However, this economic recovery is only one side of the story.  The same set of institutions which led to the global neoliberal recovery from stagflation would eventually create the most serious economic crisis since the Great Depression.  Problems became evident almost immediately.  Globalisation led to the unification of previously separate national markets for goods and services.  Competition within this new larger market led to the emergence of excess capacity in many industries.  Labour's loss of bargaining power led to the stagnation of real median family income in the United States.  This wage stagnation occurred despite the continual increase in the productive capacity of labour.  These two factors, excess capacity and stagnant wages, led to a rate of investment which, while positive, was relatively sluggish by historical standards.  This relatively sluggish investment was accompanied by restored profitability.  If the restored profits were not being invested in productive plant and equipment, where could they go?  Financialisation made it increasingly easy to fund the purchase of various categories of assets, driving up their prices and creating capital gains, which could only encourage further speculation in asset prices.  Borrowing on the basis of rising asset prices temporarily sustained demand in the face of sluggish investment and stagnant wages.  When the asset bubble burst, however, the full force of listless investment and low wages was felt in the emergence of what was, in Keynesian terms, a crisis of inadequate demand.  For the ordinary household, it was a crisis of unemployment.<br\/><br\/>That is the global context and, naturally, we are much more concerned with the specific situation of Ireland.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Professor Terence McDonough:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->A close look at the origins of the Celtic tiger, however, reveals that it was a creature of these same four institutions of global neoliberalism, namely, globalisation, neoliberalism, the repression of labour and financialisation.  As is often the case in Ireland, we had to wait a few years for the advent of global neoliberalism - Irish style.  For Ireland, the key date is 1987.  A neoliberal approach to government in Ireland began when a minority Fianna F&aacute;il Government came to power in 1987.  Minority status led to seeking a consensus economic strategy which could attract the support of other parties.  It was supported by Fine Gael&rsquo;s adoption of the Tallaght strategy under the leadership of Alan Dukes.  Two years later the neoliberal Progressive Democrats entered coalition with Fianna F&aacute;il.  O&rsquo;Riain and O&rsquo;Connell summarise the turnaround in public spending:<blockquote><br \/><br \/>Restoring order to the public finances was achieved by severe cutbacks in public expenditure in 1987-1990.  Total current spending fell by over ten percentage points in real terms between 1987 and 1989.  Total current spending fell from 57% of gross national product in 1985 to 42% in 1990.<\/blockquote>The fall in expenditure created room for tax cuts.  The top rate of income tax fell from 60% to 48% over five years.  Basic corporate income tax rates also fell.<br\/><br\/>In addition to embarking on a new macroeconomic strategy, the new Fianna F&aacute;il Government also convened the first of a series of tripartite industrial negotiations leading to a national partnership agreement, the Programme for National Recovery, PNR.  For the unions&rsquo; part, they could sense a rightward shift in the political system and feared the Government might be capable of importing the Thatcherite strategy of a massive attack on the unions aimed at negating their economic, social and political influence.  The PNR established a neoliberal pattern of achieving wage moderation through the promise of future tax cuts.  Frank Barry calculates these tax cuts accounted for about one third of the increases in take-home pay to 2004.  Such moderation under social partnership led to a falling wage share.  The wage share was 71 % of gross domestic product in 1986 and fell to 54% in 2001.  Days lost through industrial disputes dropped off drastically beginning in 1987.  Accordingly, the repression of labour in Ireland led not to wage stagnation, as in the United States, but to wage moderation under social partnership.<br\/><br\/>The social partnership process was careful not to jeopardise Ireland&rsquo;s traditional internationalisation strategy.  Teague and Donaghey conclude that social partnership operated &ldquo;hand-in-glove with the wider policy of economic openness&rdquo;.  The Single European Act came into effect in 1987 and was approved by referendum in the same year.  The implementation of the Single Market coincides with a boom in foreign employment in Ireland, with such jobs growing by 50% between 1987 and 2000.  The Single European Act was accompanied by plans to expand Structural Funds spending.  Structural Funds were doubled in 1988 and again in 1993.  A new Industrial Development Agency, IDA, strategic plan was unveiled in 1983.  The new strategy would concentrate on technologically advanced firms with high potential for market growth.  These developments copperfastened globalisation as an essential element of Ireland&rsquo;s growth strategy.<br\/><br\/>The year 1987 also saw the investment hunting capacity of the IDA applied in a new realm.  It was decided by the incoming Government to target investment in international financial services through the establishment of the International Financial Services Centre, IFSC.  By 1999, attracted by light touch regulation, 66% of all FDI, foreign direct investment, inflows were accounted for by the IFSC.  It was the source of 24% of all services exports.  The IFSC would be an important conduit for foreign capital flows and was central to Ireland&rsquo;s participation in transnational financialisation.<br\/><br\/>Irish participation in the global neoliberal social order was no longer in doubt and this institutional framework underpinned the advent of the famous Celtic tiger.  Of course, the tiger is also now infamous because, as was the case at the global level, the elements of global neoliberalism would not only set the conditions for Ireland&rsquo;s rise but also its spectacular fall from grace.  Under Ireland&rsquo;s peculiar labour institutions, wages rose but the level of inequality rose much faster.  The fear of Thatcherism had fed into the formation of social partnership.  As noted before, wage moderation was traded for tax cuts.  This tendency was strongly reinforced by the perceived need to compete globally through low taxes and a neoliberal policy preference for minimising the capacity of the State.<br\/><br\/>The economic momentum of the Celtic tiger eventually fed into blowing up the real estate market.  Financialisation provided the wind beneath the wings of the Irish asset bubble.  Rising levels of inequality created an aspiration for levels of consumption which for many could not be supported from current income.  Rising house prices provided an expensive asset of expanding value for those in the housing market and collateral for borrowing by those who already owned their own homes.  Household debt rose from less than 120% of disposable income in 2003 to 220% in 2009.  The bubble in the property market provided an alternative source of government income through stamp duty and construction-related VAT, compensating to some extent for the overall low tax regime.<br\/><br\/>Ireland was now poised for crisis.  We had a property bubble which could be traced back to financialisation.  We had high levels of household debt which could be traced to the property bubble and rising inequality.  We had a low tax regime which could be traced back to the repression of labour, globalisation and neoliberalism.  The property bubble burst in 2007, endangering the banking system.  The global crisis hit in 2008, intensifying Irish problems.  The collapse of banking, construction and the tax regime produced a fiscal crisis.  The financial crisis, the fiscal crisis and unsustainable household debt then created an unemployment crisis.  It was at this point that the global storm front and the Irish turbulence combined ran up against the sea cliffs of the inflexible euro system.  This euro system was also rooted in global neoliberalism, a global neoliberalism - euro style.  The drive for globalisation led to the Single European Market.  Globalisation linked with financialisation to create the euro currency.  The Single European Market and the euro led to trade surpluses in some countries that were recycled into blowing up asset bubbles and trade deficits in other countries which weakened their fiscal positions.  Financialisation, linked with a strong dose of neoliberal ideology, led to a fiercely independent European Central Bank aggressively limiting its responsibility to inflation control.  Neoliberal ideas of small government and limited intervention in private markets, with the declining influence of labour, led to a monetary union without any fiscal capacity to address problems through increased government spending at European level.  Together the Single European Market, the euro, the European Central Bank and limited fiscal capacity can be said to constitute the euro system.<br\/><br\/>When the turbulence hit, the euro system made sure Ireland could find no haven through devaluing its currency, conducting an independent monetary policy or receive help through fiscal stimulus.  The euro rules have forced Ireland to cut spending and raise taxes in the teeth of a depression.  Instead of a port in the storm, the backwash from the euro cliff intensified the maelstrom.  On 29 September 2008, in the dead of night, Ireland desperately tried to signal for help, but the cannon broke loose and holed the ship of State below the waterline.<br\/><br\/>How could this catastrophe have been avoided?  The only path was to have seen the storm coming and been prepared for it.  This is not a question, as some have recommended, of hiring more economists in the Department of Finance.  In fact, professional politicians and professional economists in the lead up to these events all saw the world in much the same way.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Professor Terrence McDonough:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->In fact, professional politicians and professional economists in the lead up to these events all saw the world in much the same way.  To avoid the storm, both would have had to see the world differently.  I have lived for 20 years in Galway.  It is said of the weather in Galway that it is either raining or about to rain.  Similarly, in the mainstream economic view, the economy is either calm or rapidly becoming calmer.  This theory may barely pass muster in good times, but to prepare for a storm you have to see the economy as potentially tempestuous and riven with conflict and contradictions.  A view of the capitalist economy which ignores its historical dynamics, which sees it as a haven of harmonious give and take, a peaceful equilibrium of supply and demand, which works best when interfered with least, will inevitably lead to foundering on hidden shoals amidst unexpected turbulence.  This is where Ireland still finds itself today. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015022600002#V00200","speaker":"990","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424944800,"counter":997,"content":"<p>Thank you Professor McDonough.

While there is much emphasis placed on the financial troubles that faced Ireland, Europe and the larger global capitalist system, this should not blind us to the fact that there were other deeply rooted institutional factors.  These factors contributed to the inauguration of the crisis in 2008, but also seriously contributed to the failure to address that crisis in subsequent years.  These factors particularly relate to stagnant wages; the falling power of labour to defend its working conditions; low levels of investment closely related to high levels of excess capacity associated with globalisation on international markets; the inability of governments at local Irish level, at larger European level and at the global level to find a way to intervene to compensate for the financial chaos we faced; very low levels of private investment and the increasing inability of the ordinary person to prop up consumption in the economy because of falling wages and falling standards of living.<\/p> <p>  The crisis is broad but at the same time much deeper.

The separation of local governments from the ability to conduct their own monitoring policy has been extraordinarily damaging.

I think a militantly independent central bank, insulated from democratic control, is not defensible.  <\/p> <p>  Beyond that, the European Union has unfortunately participated in a general tendency to separate economic decision-making from democratic and representative bodies and rest that decision-making in what were initially faceless bureaucracies but they have now, more or less, acquired a bit of a face.

I suppose what we could do is contrast it, on the one hand, with the fact that Irish wages did not stagnate in the same way that they did in the United States.  On the other hand, if one looks at labour's share of national income, labour's share of national income around 1980 was about 71%, that is, of everything produced in Ireland, 71% of it went to the working class or those represented by the labour movement.  By 2002, that figure was down to around 45%.  While labour succeeded in preventing an outright stagnation of wages, labour's relative weight in the economy, especially in terms of its income, declined quite drastically.  If one looks at labour density, that is, what percentage of the workforce is represented by unions, that dropped rather precipitously.

The euro without a transfer union needs to be a euro with a transfer union or we need to find a way of mutually exiting this particular straitjacket.  We have a dysfunctional ECB and we need a functional one.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Professor Terrence McDonough:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->In Ireland we need redistribution, a debt writedown and higher tax take.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015022600002#EE02300","speaker":"1060","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424944800,"counter":1155,"content":"<p>How would Professor McDonough finance this?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015022600002#FF00200","speaker":"1060"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424944800,"counter":1156,"content":"<p>We are under-taxed.

The way the amendments are worded means that they would not be workable.  The aim in developing the charter is to strengthen the position of parents generally within our school system.  The charter is the appropriate place for such issues to be addressed rather than seeking to amend the Education Acts through this Bill.<\/p> <p>  In addition, the Deputies may be aware that the Government gave approval last March to the drafting of the education (admission to school) Bill.  The Bill is at an advanced stage of drafting and will be before the House shortly.  The aim in introducing proposals on school admissions is to improve admission policies and to ensure that the way schools decide on applications is structured, fair and transparent.  It is a concern that fees might be a factor in this regard.  The proposed legislation would prohibit the charging of any fee or contribution as part of a school's admissions process, which should go some way towards alleviating the Deputy's concerns.  Other issues will be dealt with in the charter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015022600002#C00400","speaker":"1078"},{"type":"speech","time":1424944800,"counter":1209,"content":"<p>I appreciate that this Bill is not the place to do that, but it is an opportunity for us to put the matter on the agenda again.  When drafting legislation to give some structure to the situation, having it ruled out of order because it would be a cost to the Exchequer is frustrating.  By their nature, voluntary contributions are essential for many schools if they are to keep operating, given the cuts in capitation grants and elsewhere.  Many schools are struggling to meet their targets and balance the books.  However, there is significant pressure on parents to try to match those voluntary contributions.  In some schools I know, one has no access to a locker if a voluntary contribution is not paid.  I am sure this is replicated in many other schools outside my constituency.  While the contributions may be voluntary in theory, in practice many schools give the impression that they must be paid if a student is to receive the same level of service that others receive.  It is frustrating that we do not know how much schools are taking in in voluntary contributions or how that money is being spent.  There is no record-keeping in that regard.  I am sure that the money is somewhere in the overall financial records, but if parents are being asked to pay voluntary contributions towards the running of a school, safeguards need to be put in place in order that they can be assured that their contributions are being used for what they were intended.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015022600002#C00500","speaker":"984"},{"type":"speech","time":1424944800,"counter":1210,"content":"<p>The Minister has spoken on this matter a few times and is aware of it.

It relates to the evidence of estrangement needed to access Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, grants.  SUSI has done a great deal of work since its first year when it took over the processing of grants.  To be honest, that was a disaster.  Our committee discussed the Accenture report yesterday.  Many improvements have been made, but estrangement is probably the most common issue in respect of which people visit our offices.  It is difficult for students to prove that they are estranged from their parents.  The level of documentation required by SUSI goes above and beyond what many students are able to provide adequately.  We know of cases in which students who have proof from the Department of Social Protection that they are in receipt of payments at addresses that are not their parents' are still being asked for further information.  It seems that there is only a limited number of documents that SUSI will accept.  The amendment tries to expand the options available to students to prove that they are estranged by including information that is provided by advocacy workers, student unions, general practitioners and welfare officers.<\/p><p>I appreciate the concerns informing the Deputy's amendment.  We have discussed this issue in the D&aacute;il a couple of times during Question Time and so on.  The amendment relates mainly to cases in which students may need to be assessed independently of their parents' income.  The Minister has spoken on this issue once or twice and I have taken a debate on it on her behalf.  She has stated that she is taking a strong interest in examining this matter.<br\/><br\/>The Deputy stated that he has encountered quite a number of genuine cases of estrangement, but they are relatively rare.  Although they have a significant impact on individual students, each student has unique circumstances.  In that context and having carefully considered the amendment, I do not propose to accept it for a number of reasons.<br\/><br\/>Subsections 16(3)(<i>a<\/i>) to (<i>g<\/i>), inclusive, of the Student Support Act 2011 provide for the Minister to specify a class of applicant or criterion that may be considered in determining whether an applicant is a student of a particular class.  For example, the student grant scheme under SI 201 of 2014 provides in Article 21(3) for a dependent student to be exempted from having parents' income taken into account where it is established to the satisfaction of the relevant awarding authority that he or she is irreconcilably estranged from both parents and neither parent furnishes financial support to him or her.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Damien English:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=1781\"><img src=\"..\/images\/info.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Information on Deputy Damien English\"\/><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=committees&amp;amp;code=ED1&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=26\"><img src=\"..\/images\/zoom.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Zoom on Deputy Damien English\"\/><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I accept that the Deputy is concerned about satisfying the grant awarding authority in terms of the documents needed, but we do not need amending legislation to address that issue.  It can be addressed by the Minister who has said previously that she will look at it to see if further clarification is needed.  We do not need to do it by way of the amendment proposed.  <\/p><p> This provision allows the awarding authority to assess dependent students in genuine estrangement cases without reference to income or the address of their parents or guardians.  The provisions, as they stand, in the Student Support Act 2011 are sufficient to allow latitude in specifying additional classes of applicant and the criteria to be applied for such applicants, having regard to the resources available and subject to the consent of the Minister for Finance.  <\/p><p> The Minister for Education and Skills has said previously that she will look at this issue again and will work with the Deputy on it, but she does not believe an amendment is needed.  In effect, the proposed amendment would replicate a provision in section 16(3) of the Student Support Act 2011.  The option is already provided for in legislation.  It is up to the Deputy to decide what to do with his amendment, but we can address the issue without it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015022600002#C01200","speaker":"984","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424944800,"counter":1219,"content":"<p>I disagree with the Minister of State.

I have been asked to speak about EU treaty protocols.  I sent the briefing notes to the clerk of the committee just before lunch.<br\/><br\/>I will briefly outline the most relevant protocols in respect of the relationship between Ireland and the UK.  The reason for doing this in the context of a discussion of BrExit is that they are primarily concerned with control of migration and borders.  Should the United Kingdom chose to leave the EU, the Northern Irish Border would become significant for the EU as it would become an external EU border.  This would then raise considerable challenges for the open borders policy between the United Kingdom and Ireland as articulated in the common travel area.  There are three protocols of note and another I will mention in passing.<br\/><br\/>First, Protocol 19 relates to the Schengen <i>acquis. <\/i>Schengen is an international convention designed to remove internal borders and establish a common external frontier.  This means it also establishes common visa, asylum and immigration policies.  Implementing measures known as the Schengen <i>acquis <\/i>were adopted on these policies and these were incorporated into the EU treaties and into EU law by the Amsterdam treaty, which is now part of EU law.  There are special rules for Ireland and the UK in regard to Schengen as the only two member states that have not signed the convention.  Others such as Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Romania have signed but are not fully incorporated into it.  The relationship between the UK and Ireland and the Schengen provisions is addressed mainly in Protocol 19.<br\/><br\/>Ireland and the United Kingdom - throughout my address I will refer to Ireland but members should read it as Ireland and the United Kingdom - may at any time request to take part in some or all of the Schengen <i>acquis.<\/i>The Council of Ministers decide on this request on the basis of unanimity of the Schengen member states and the requesting state.  The significance of this provision is that Ireland can only participate if the other member states agree to it unanimously.<br\/><br\/>Where Ireland has opted in to part of the Schengen <i>acquis<\/i>and a new proposal in that field is introduced, Ireland can give notice to the Council of Minister that it will opt out but can withdraw that notice at any time up to the adoption of the measure.  This opt-out is tempered by a set of procedures in Article 5 described as &quot;fiendish&quot; by Stephen Peers, a leading authority in the field.  The purpose of the procedures is to protect the coherence of the Schengen <i>acquis. <\/i>The risk for Ireland is that the underlying Schengen <i>acquis<\/i>could be dis-applied to it and Ireland would have to bear any direct financial consequences of this should the decision be that Ireland's opt-out from the amending measure would cause too much incoherence for the system.  Should Ireland chose to opt from an amending measure, having opted into it, the stakes are very high. <br\/><br\/>Protocol 20 recognises the special travel arrangements in place between Ireland and the United Kingdom.  It first recognises that the UK can continue to exercise border controls and then that the United Kingdom and Ireland can have special arrangements for the movement of people between them.  As long as this common travel area exists, then according to the protocol Ireland can also have border controls.<br\/><br\/>There are two consequences to note from this.  First, as Protocol 20 states, the other member states can impose border checks on people coming from Ireland and the United Kingdom.  Members no doubt have experienced this when they travelled to the Schengen area.  Second, the exemption for Ireland to impose border controls only applies as long as the UK and Ireland maintain their common travel area.  This is important should the UK exit the EU.<br\/><br\/>Protocol 21, a protocol on freedom, security and justice, provides an opt-in for the UK and Ireland in regard to measures adopted under an EU court's rulings on Title V Part III of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, that is the measures adopted in regard to the creation of the area of freedom, security and justice, AFSJ, dealing with border checks, asylum, immigration, judicial co-operation in civil and criminal matters and police co-operation.  This is different from the Schengen Protocol, as the UK and Ireland have a right to opt-in.<br\/><br\/>Ireland notifies the President of the Council of Ministers in writing within three months of a proposal going to Council that it wants to take part.  Its participation cannot be vetoed.  Even if Ireland does not participate in the measure, it can subsequently opt-in with the Commission outlining to the Council what arrangements are necessary for Ireland to comply with the measure.  Note, a measure can be adopted after a reasonable time without Ireland or the UK, even if they have notified of their wish to opt in, if in practical terms it is not possible to adopt the measure with them taking part.<br\/><br\/>Where the UK or Ireland opt-out of a measure, then the Council holds a full discussion of the possible effects of such non-participation.  Any member state can ask the Commission to examine the situation on the basis of Article 116 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.  Under this provision if the Commission thinks a member state's laws, administrative practices or procedures are distorting competition in the internal market and that distortion needs to be eliminated then the Commission consults the member state.  If the consultation does not work, then directives or any other appropriate measures can be adopted under the ordinary legislative procedure.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Professor Imelda Maher:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->What this means is that an opt-out decision, in what I believe would be fairly exceptional circumstances, may lead to legislation being adopted if the decision is deemed to distort competition in the internal market.  The reason for this opt-out for Ireland seems to have been driven by concerns about the integrity of the common law system and differences with the civil law traditions dominant in other member states and by the fact the UK was going to opt out.<br\/><br\/>Ireland in, declaration 56, affirms its commitment to the AFSJ and indicates it will participate to the maximum extent.  Ireland can, at any time, notify the Council in writing that it no longer wishes to be covered by this protocol, and if it does so then the normal treaty provisions apply.  This protocol is not applicable to Ireland in regard to Article 75 on the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which sets down rules on freezing funds and financial assets in order to combat and prevent terrorism.<br\/><br\/>What is the relationship between these protocols?  The question of whether a measure is part of Schengen or the AFSJ is significant because, if the Schengen agreement applies, Ireland does not have a right to opt in, which it does have in regard to the AFSJ.  There is a substantive overlap, however, between the Schengen <i>acquis<\/i>and Title V, Part III, and this has been litigated before the European Court of Justice, by the UK in particular.  An example is case C-137\/05 on Frontex.<br\/><br\/>If a measure is covered by the Schengen <i>acquis<\/i>, then it is governed by the Schengen protocol.  What has happened is that the court has interpreted this relatively broadly to include complementary measures, that is, any measure that &ldquo;builds on&rdquo; the <i>acquis<\/i>.  The term &ldquo;builds on&rdquo; is one that would give a lawyer nightmares because it is very fuzzy.  It means the precise nature of the relationship between the two protocols is not entirely clear.<br\/><br\/>Let us consider the UK opt-out protocol in passing.  Under Protocol 36, governing transitional provisions, the UK had the choice to opt out of pre-Treaty of Lisbon measures on police and judicial co-operation within five years.  As members are probably well aware, it did so and now has opted back in to a large number of measures, the most important of which for Ireland is the European arrest warrant.  Ireland did not have this opt-out in the treaty.<br\/><br\/>The next topic is Ireland and the protocols.  Laffan and O'Mahony suggest that Ireland and the UK have opted into measures on civil co-operation, asylum and irregular migration but to a limited extent on visas, border controls and legal migration.  They participate in almost all criminal and policing provisions of Schengen and in respect of irregular migration.  I have three thoughts on this.  First, as the common travel area is significant for relations between the UK and Ireland, it might be worth considering what Mr. Justice Hogan had to say about it in Pachero<i>v<\/i>. the Minister for Justice and Equality in 2011.  At one point, he referred to the &ldquo;legal archaeology&rdquo; required to get to the bottom of the common travel area:<blockquote>While in theory both Irish and British citizens are entitled to arrive here free from immigration control by virtue of the common travel area, increasingly in practice such passengers who arrive by air from the UK are required to produce their passports (or, at least, some other form of acceptable identity document) in order to prove to immigration officers that they are either Irish or British citizens who can avail of the common travel area. Whatever about anyone else, Joseph Heller [who, as members know, wrote <i>Catch-22<\/i>] certainly would have approved.<\/blockquote>This suggests greater clarity on the common travel area would be desirable.<br\/><br\/>Second, if the UK exits the EU, regard has to be given to a three-way dynamic: the relationship between Ireland and the EU, the relationship between Ireland and the UK, and the relationship between the UK and the EU.  It might be useful in this regard to consider the analogy, albeit imperfect, of the Nordic Passport Union and the Nordic Police Cooperation Agreement, whereby free movement is ensured for Norway and Iceland with the other Nordic countries although they are not in the EU.  However, they are in Schengen, which the UK is unlikely to join in an EU exit scenario.<br\/><br\/>Third, these two comments suggest a mini-Schengen may be the best way forward for the UK and Ireland should the UK leave the EU.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015022600002#B00200","speaker":"957","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424944800,"counter":1252,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Maher.<\/p> <p>  I welcome back Mr. Eugene Regan.  He is on familiar territory.  I invite him to address the committee, after which we will bank questions.<\/p><p>I thank the Chairman.  It is very nice to be at the meeting.  It is much more comfortable sitting on the other side of the room, but here goes.<br\/><br\/>I have been asked to address the issue of the co-operation in policing and criminal matters in the context of a UK withdrawal from the EU and the consequences it might have for this area.  I do not believe the UK will withdraw from the EU.  Recent experience in this very area of policing and criminal law matters might serve as a guide to how the debate on UK withdrawal will crystallise.  The reality is that there was a furore in the UK regarding the European arrest warrant, other matters concerning policing and EU criminal law matters.  It centred on the European arrest warrant and the frailties in the framework decision adopted in 2002.  There was criticism of other aspects of that area.  When the UK Government chose to exercise the blackout option, provided in the Lisbon treaty and to which Professor Maher has referred, and thus withdrew from approximately 130 measures, it recognised the reality of the matter and the importance of the measures to policing and internal security in the UK.  It chose to opt back in to 35 of the key measures.  This demonstrates that, notwithstanding the reservations in the UK about the EU, it has the capacity and pragmatism to recognise that it is in its own interest to work within the EU framework.<br\/><br\/>Let me give a little historical background on the policing and criminal law area.  Historically, Ireland and the UK were on opposing sides.  The great debates of the early years of membership were mainly on the Common Agricultural Policy and disputes about green pounds and devaluations.  However, in the area of policing and criminal law matters, the two countries followed the same path, as we did in regard to asylum and immigration.  There is no area in which the two countries have co-operated as closely as in this area.  This co-operation dates back to 1972, the year of the Munich Olympics outrage.  The TREVI group was formed, and the UK and Ireland were involved in that when it was set up at the European Council meeting in Rome in 1975.  The European arrest warrant was introduced after the events of 11 September 2001.  The British Home Secretary suggested the idea of mutual recognition.<br\/><br\/>The UK contribution in this area has been very important.  We have worked alongside the UK because of the common law tradition and concerns about how development in this area would affect the common law system.  Bearing in mind the process involving the Maastricht, Amsterdam and Lisbon treaties, one notes it is only at the time of the production of the Lisbon treaty that this area was brought into the first pillar of the EU and made subject to the full involvement of all the institutions, that is, the Commission proposing legislation, parliamentary co-decision and, of course, the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.  There was a delay in respect of the latter.  It was five years after the introduction of the Lisbon treaty that the European Court of Justice was to have full jurisdiction in this area.  Hence the move to qualified majority voting and the European Court of Justice jurisdiction.  This is why the UK chose to extend the Protocol 21 opt-out to the criminal law area.  Ireland followed suit.  Members will remember there was a debate in the Seanad and D&aacute;il on this when Ireland decided to follow the UK on this.  It was opposed by the Opposition but there was a compromise, which was that the opt-out would be reviewed after five years.  That review has taken place.<br\/><br\/>The UK opt-out is entirely different, however.  Protocol 36, a decision to opt out <i>en bloc<\/i>from all new measures, was exercised by the UK Government in 2013.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Mr. Eugene Regan:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That was announced by the UK Government on 24 July 2013.  At the same time, it identified a number of key measures it wished to opt back into.  That was adopted last November and passed by the House of Commons.  However, what is fundamentally important in this is the Irish influence in that debate and the fact that it was highlighted by the Irish Government that the consequences of the UK exercising this opt-out and not opting back into the European arrest warrant, in particular, and into other measures would create fundamental difficulties for co-operation between the two countries, not only in the area fighting crime but, especially, the area of terrorism and in the context of Northern Ireland.  That had a very persuasive effect in ensuring that the House of Commons voted through the measures to opt back into the 35 measures, including the European arrest warrant.<br\/><br\/>There has always been a concern in Ireland - Professor Imelda Maher identified it - in regard to our common law system and this is why Ireland chose to apply protocol 21 to policing and criminal matters.  The reality is that since that extension, Ireland has opted into the vast majority of measures.  In terms of those into which we have not opted, it is not for reasons that go to our criminal law system, or our particular common law system, but it has more to do with organisation and administration.  After five years, it has become apparent that protocol 21 is not really necessary in terms of protecting the features of our criminal law system, which were initially of concern.<br\/><br\/>When I say that the United Kingdom has recognised the importance of the measures in policing and criminal law, there was a House of Lords report on the issue of the opt-out in 2004.  Many representations were made to the House of Lords, in particular in regard to the European arrest warrant but also on the whole range of measures.  The conclusion of that report was that opting out of policing and criminal justice measures would have significant adverse negative repercussions for the internal security of, and the administration of criminal justice in, the UK.There was a recognition in the UK of the importance of these measures and of the <i>acquis<\/i>, as it were, in all of this, and that it was important to the UK itself.<br\/><br\/>Professor John Spencer, who is an expert in this whole area, considered that if the opt-out and opting back in were to go ahead, which is the case, that would essentially be a purely paper exercise.  He suggested the opt-out would make no difference whatsoever because the key measures were included in the measures to which the United Kingdom was opting back into.  After 40 years of progress and treaty changes, which reflect the common concerns of member states in the area of organised crime, terrorism and the importance, at a European level, of co-operation in the detection, investigation and prosecution of crime, the UK recognised that for it to exit out of these areas was a leap in the dark and was not in its interests.  <br\/><br\/>In the event of a UK exit, which is theoretical question, and whether it is a real question will depend on the May general election, a void will not be created.  The fact is that Article 50 of the Treaty of European Union provides specifically for a mechanism for withdrawal of any member state.  It specifically states that the Union shall  negotiate and conclude an agreement with that state, setting out the arrangements for its withdrawal and taking account of the framework for its future relationship with the European Union.  In addition,  the treaty shall cease to apply to that state in question from the date of entry into force of the withdrawal, so even in the extreme situation of a withdrawal, it would have to be an orderly one.  The UK is bound by the treaties until such time as such an exit would happen and to enter into an agreement providing for that procedure for withdrawal.<br\/><br\/>If there was a UK withdrawal it would not just affect the criminal law areas but it would also affect the civil law area, in particular there are specific regulations, for example, on the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters.  There are also the European accounts preservation orders.  All of these are very important measures in the civil law field but they fall into this rubric and chapter in regard to criminal law.<br\/><br\/>If there was not an orderly withdrawal, the question of the arrangements would arise.  Would individual member states, like Ireland, have to enter into bilateral treaties with the UK?  One would have to have serious doubts that would be possible because the EU now has a competence in this area of policing and criminal law matters and I do not think member states would be at liberty to enter into bilateral arrangements.  It would be a recipe for disaster if there were no orderly procedures for an exit in that unlikely event.<br\/><br\/>Prime Minister David Cameron is reported recently as saying that people would rather have a choice between staying in a reformed Europe or getting out rather than the false choice of today which is to stay in Europe with which they are not satisfied or to leave.  The issue and the agenda is more reform and renegotiation of certain terms of the existing treaties.  In terms of terms of the criminal law area, even though the EU arrest warrant has been a topical political potato in the United Kingdom, it is more to do with immigration and welfare tourism.  That is where the focus of any re-negotiation seems to be moving.  <br\/><br\/>Ireland's position has been made clear by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Taoiseach that Ireland's interests lie in the UK remaining within the EU.  In the area of policing and criminal law matters, as common law countries, there is no doubt about the common interest we have in shaping EU policies in this area and working within the framework which has been created by the EU over the past 40 years.<br\/><br\/>In terms of reform, the criticisms of the European arrest warrant by the UK and in the political debates which have occurred are not entirely unjustified.  It was an instrument adopted rather hurriedly after 9\/11.  It is not perfect legislation and it has created considerable problems in terms of excessive usage and the protection of persons who are extradited.  Even though it has worked effectively and efficiently, there is scope for revising and improvement of that instrument.  Those types of reforms might resolve many of the issues that might arise, and have arisen, in regard to the issue of UK withdrawal from the EU.  <br\/><br\/>I will leave it at that.  I hope I have not exceeded my time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015022600002#C00200","speaker":"957","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424944800,"counter":1255,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Regan.

We have been examining whether it is possible.  The politicians in Northern Ireland will have a role, particularly the Unionists, given that Sinn F&eacute;in, as eurosceptics, will presumably opt out of the debate.  Maybe Sinn F&eacute;in might opt in, for the first time, in addressing a very serious issue in the European context.  There is also a potential role for Scotland.  It is very difficult to address the implications of England opting out of Europe.  Is it possible to bring the UK out of Europe?  What, precisely, are the reforms?<\/p> <p>  The process would take years.  First, Mr. Cameron would have to win an overall majority in the election, after which some sort of negotiations could start.  Presumably, it would take years for the British Parliament to debate the exact reforms they are seeking.  Then, there would be a long debate in Europe on whether or not it is possible.  If the EU concedes, the unravelling or opting out would take years.  I do not want to be disrespectful to anybody.  We have regular representation from the British Embassy at these meetings.

It is widely accepted internationally that immigrants are incredibly productive and involved in seeking employment and that they do not come to sponge on the welfare system.

Of all the intellectuals and business people who have come here to discuss this, not one has predicted a positive outcome from what the UK intends to do.

From both presentations, it appears that it covers many of the areas that Schengen covers.  Both Ireland and the UK have a right to opt into it and the UK has opted into a number of the areas.

In regard to protocols, the people who drew them up in the first place did not intend to make it easy to either exit from or opt into them.  Opting out after opting in is obviously a very complicated process.  The area of policing and criminal law is hugely complicated and it could waste a considerable amount of European time.<\/p> <p>  A new European structure will emerge in the event of an exit.  It could change irrevocably the entire European architecture, based as it is on provisions made in the past, the expectations at the foundation of the European Union and, in particular, the expectations of the founding fathers of the European Union.  It would virtually impossible to reconstruct Europe if one country were to opt out, possibly followed by other countries.<\/p> <p>  Several members referred to the existence of euroscepticism.  The committee is examining that issue separately to understand the real reasons for it, and not simply the reasons that happen to be convenient at any particular time.  It remains to be seen how that issue can be addressed but, like other issues, it will have huge implications for the European Union.<\/p> <p>  Taking into account the protocols and the issue of policing and criminal law, the creation of a new border in the event of the UK opting out will have serious implications for trade and travel.  It has been suggested that Ireland could also opt out.  I shudder to think of some of the ideas that have been put forward as reasonable.  They are not reasonable.  Sadly, this debate is taking place against the backdrop of a serious economic downturn across Europe.  The discussions that take place in that sort of environment are not necessarily the best in terms of long-term planning.  Europe has a tragic history in that regard and all of us should do what we can to avoid reaping that whirlwind.<\/p><p>I will begin, and if I miss any points I ask members to come back to me.  On the question of the Six Counties and the implications of having a border with the free trade area, a British exit would require provision to be made for a common travel area, but it might be a difficult task to maintain it in that new context.  In regard to the unified patent court and where its institutions are to be located, the best answer is that the European police training college was supposed to be located in the United Kingdom but I understand that is no longer being proposed.  That may a fallout from the furore that has emerged in the area of justice, policing and criminal law.<\/p><p> In regard to Deputy Byrne's comments on the general election in the UK, of course it is a theoretical question, and the issue will only crystallise after the election.  There is also a Scottish dimension.  There might be another referendum in Scotland should the United Kingdom exit the EU.  There is no clear indication as to what the UK Government wants, but David Cameron has at times indicated that out of the four freedoms, he wants to make changes in regard to the free movement of labour and people.  Other countries have a problem with such changes because the relevant provisions were embedded in the European Union from its outset.  It is also important for Ireland and Irish people living in the UK that there be no impediment to free movement.  The focus has turned to the notion of welfare tourism and the benefits attributed to workers when they move between member states.  Angela Merkel indicated that she was open to considering measures in that regard.  This type of response may help to diffuse many of the issues that have arisen.<\/p><p> Schengen is a tricky area.  It was Tony Blair who decided that the UK should be seen to be more positive towards Europe at a particular point in time and, while not opting into Schengen, the UK opted into the policing and criminal law provisions of Schengen.  We followed suit.  Schengen was brought into the European Union under the Maastricht treaty, but there remains a set of Schengen measures in criminal law and policing - please do not ask me to list them - which we have opted into without also opting into other normal post-Lisbon treaty measures on criminal law.  It is a very complex area.  We have opted into that aspect of the Schengen Agreement but not into the free movement aspects.<\/p><p> In regard to the impact of changing security provisions on the debate about co-operation on criminal law, we have seen that time and again.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Mr. Eugene Regan:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The Olympic Games massacre gave rise to the setting up by the member states of the TREVI group, which attempted to exchange information and have countries work together in this area.

Denmark is looking at the exercise of a protocol similar to Ireland, and the recent terrorist acts in the country may have an impact on that.  That always has an impact.

He also notes the dividend from the peace agreements.  A total of &euro;150 million in grants will be given to Northern Ireland by the EU between 2014 and 2020.  I suspect, given the Deputy's comment about how long all this will take, that this money will be spent before the UK has left the EU, but it is still a sizeable sum.

The free trade agreements with the US and Canada need to be factored into the trade and commercial aspect of this debate.<\/p> <p>  There will be a referendum, but there are two kinds of referendum on Europe in the UK context.  One is the political promise by the current Prime Minister to hold a referendum should he be elected following the next election, and that is what is focusing the mind.  That is the Brexit dimension, with which we are concerned.  However, there is also the EU Act from 2011, which guarantees a referendum in the event of substantial treaty change in the Union.  Mr. Cameron has been doing his best to avoid getting embroiled with that legislation, but that avoidance can only last for so long.  That is not particular to the current government; it would have to be dealt with by any government.  At some point, the UK will have to bite the bullet on that.  That legislation is complicated, with lists of items that have to be included in order to decide, but it will trigger a referendum at some point.  I hope that is clear enough.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the patent court, location can shift.  I hope that is not complicated.  I had not realised they were going to be there.<\/p> <p>  We are cognisant of the idea of the weakening of relations across the UK and the disintegrating union after the Scottish referendum, and this needs to be factored in, especially if Scotland votes \"Yes\".  Professor Sionaidh Douglas-Scott, a Scottish national based in Oxford, has written about this and reflected on it considerably.  It might be necessary to talk to the Scots as well as to the House of Lords.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy's point about this taking years is important, and my advice to the committee would be not to let it take years and years.  Ireland has a particular voice to present in the EU context should the UK vote to exit and one of the statements Ireland will want to make is that Article 50 should not drag on, so that the exit takes too long, because it  will pay a higher price for a delay than any other country.  That is a fair comment to make in this context.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015022600002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Imelda Maher"},{"type":"speech","time":1424944800,"counter":1268,"content":"<p>There was a suggestion, which I ran with, that business needs certainty for investment in England.

We can, therefore, put a framework around the questions we need to address.  Certain preparatory work can be put in place to address that.

The Professor has just touched on the implications for the Good Friday Agreement and another question is on the possibility of dual citizenship<i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>Northern Ireland.<br\/><br\/>A couple of other things come to mind.  I remember being in Brussels at a meeting just before the economic downturn really hit.  Many economic and legal experts were there and there were predictions of doom and gloom all around the place.  As a nation, we were being blamed for a lot of the woes that had befallen the entire EU, though there were other people who blamed the European Union for all the woes that had fallen on Ireland.  Some things do not change.  It was pointed out that the real problem was the inflexibility of the European Central Bank <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>exchange rates in a context where no country could devalue.  There was a theory that the euro was overvalued, which it probably was at the time, but it was also said that each member state had no control.  This was not true because they could have introduced currency controls at any time they wanted.  The theory opposing that was based on the belief that to do so in a particular way would cause an implosion but that did not happen.  We have currency controls now, as well as a reduction in the value of the euro so all those issues should appear resolved.  <br\/><br\/>The fundamental problem for the future of the EU is the degree to which individual member states seem to look at themselves and see that the Union is no longer in accord with their views and ambitions.  The question then arises as to whether their ambitions are in accord with the Union.  The conclusion they come to is that a loose economic arrangement is the ideal scenario for the future.  However, they forget that such a thing existed before the EU and it was deemed not to have worked.<br\/><br\/>No matter which way we look at this situation it is not a good place to be.  There are serious implications for Ireland, for Britain and for the EU.  It behoves all of us to apply ourselves to identify how the issues that are causing the concern can best be resolved.  The founding fathers of the EU had a different vision altogether and they were clear as to what they wanted.  They had history close to their elbow when they made their decisions and that was a very convincing factor for people at the time.  Perhaps Professor Maher would address that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015022600002#H00200","speaker":"957"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424944800,"counter":1276,"content":"<p>That is a significant question.

That does not mean it cannot change and, as the Chairman has said, it has changed radically.<\/p> <p>  I note the Chairman's reference to the founding fathers.  They wanted a European political community but they failed to get it as they could not get it past the French.  Instead they ended up with the European Economic Community.

I will not go into too much detail on this, but some examples include the admissibility of evidence; availability of bail, which is an important matter in connection with the European arrest warrant with the UK; and administrative penalties.  There is an administrative court system in many member states but we generally have criminal penalties instead of administrative penalties.  We also do not have prosecuting judges here.  All of these things were considered fundamental problems but the reality is that where we have not opted into a measure we are likely to opt into after the event.  Such problems can be resolved and the Commission has usually found a way to accommodate the common law system.  That is why I consider the opt-out is not really necessary.<\/p> <p>  Since our entry in 1973, Europe has displayed a remarkable ability to resolve what appear to be intractable problems.  The most obvious one recently, and I accept that it has not yet been fully resolved, is the euro crisis, where progress is being made.  There have been many debates in Europe on a lot of difficult issues but the outcomes have demonstrated that different interests can work together.  The cohesion of the European Union is remarkable and I suspect it will find an imaginative solution to the issue of the threatened UK withdrawal.

Session A today is the public hearing discussion with Mr. David McWilliams on early warnings, divergent and contrarian views.<br\/><br\/>In commencing this morning's proceedings I welcome everyone to the 11th public hearing of the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis.  At our first session this morning we will hear from Mr. David McWilliams on issues related to early warnings, divergent and contrarian views in the context of the banking crisis in Ireland.  David McWilliams is an economist, writer, broadcaster and journalist.  He worked initially as an economist with the Central Bank of Ireland, the Union Bank of Switzerland and Banque Nationale de Paribas.  Since 1999 he has been a broadcaster, writer, economic commentator and documentary maker.  He has written four books, writes two weekly economic columns and he has made various documentaries.  He has brought a one man economic stand-up show to the stage at the Abbey Theatre.  David McWilliams is credited with being one of the first economists to predict a boom in Ireland's economy and for his predictions of an Irish property bubble building from 2000 to 2007 which would ultimately burst.  He was the first to coin the phrase &quot;ghost estates&quot;.  In January 2007, David McWilliams was selected as one of 250 young global leaders by the World Economic Forum and he is a regular speaker on the international circuit.  I welcome Mr. McWilliams.<br\/><br\/>I wish to advise the witness that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If the witness is directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter, and continues to do so, the witness is entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of the evidence.  The witness is directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  The witness has been informed previously that the committee is asking witnesses to refrain from discussing named individuals in this phase of the inquiry.  Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that Members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside of the House or an official by name, or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  Can I invite Mr. McWilliams to make his opening remarks to the inquiry please.<\/p><p>Thank you very much, Chairman.  It is a pleasure to be here.  I just want to make some opening remarks about the period in question, starting with 2000 and going up to 2008 and beyond.  It is my opinion that the Irish banking system, and by extension the rest of the Irish economy, was set up to fail.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Mr. David McWilliams:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I saw this earlier than anybody else and I made this opinion and these ideas available as widely as possibly.  In fact, I probably spent the best part of a decade trying to warn as many people as possible on as many platforms as possible that our property market was going to crash and that when it did, our banking system would be in a situation where money would fly out of the system and lead to a banking crisis.  I did this in hundreds of thousands of words; not thousands, but hundreds of thousands of words, in dozens of articles, two a week in the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>, the biggest selling newspaper in the country, and in <i>The Sunday Business Post<\/i>.  <br\/><br\/>I made documentaries about this.  I had my own TV show on TV3, which was watched by tens of thousands of people.  I warned people at every juncture that our housing market was a credit bubble and credit bubbles bust and it is not a matter of if they bust but when they bust.  The documentaries of <i>The Pope's Children<\/i>book, which I wrote, were watched by 36% of the Irish watching audience; that is a lot of people.  <i>The Pope's Children<\/i>, and I do not say this for any other reason than to make the point, was disseminated extremely widely and was the bestselling non-fiction book, not of the year, but of the decade, and it was published in 2005.  So these ideas were out there, disseminated widely, in the most accessible way.  When I hear the view that nobody saw this coming or that this was in some way a shock or we were taken by surprise, I do not believe that is the case.  I think the Irish property crash and the banking crash were both incredibly predictable and absolutely preventable. <br\/><br\/>This testimony will be a little bit different in the sense that it will not be about what should have or could have happened, and if we had seen that, if we did not see that, and my God I cannot believe we missed that.  This testimony will be taken from contemporaneous articles, pieces of work that show thinking at the time.  This was not isolated thinking.  In fact, I believe, and my experience through the period from 2000 onwards was, that many thousands of ordinary Irish people could see what was happening.  The difference is that I was an economic commentator and an economist and I had the platform of the media to deploy these ideas.  I cannot tell you the number of times I went into bars and pubs and chatted to people and they said, &quot;Hold on a second, this doesn't seem right; what is going on here?&quot;  So it is not as if a significant part of the population was not already worried.  I want to make that point that this was preventable and predictable, and that these views were widely disseminated.  There were not a huge coterie of individuals doing this but it was certainly out there.  <br\/><br\/>One could probably ask oneself why did this guy, who is a former Central Bank economist, an investment bank economist, why did he not just come home to Ireland, keep his mouth shut, play the game and get on with business.  The reason is I felt that if one has a specialty, if one understands something, one has something like a patriotic duty or a moral imperative to say that the policy or numbers of policies that we have together will lead our country into catastrophe.  I think it was a patriotic thing to do.  It certainly was not a worthwhile thing to do and it certainly was not fashionable and it certainly did not make me popular.  The interesting thing is that all through this period I was accused of being unpatriotic when I believe in actual fact it was something that was essential to do if one had the education and the experience to do so.  I remember people saying that I was unpatriotic for talking down the economy.  The committee might remember that expression, &quot;Talking down the economy&quot;.  I think that was maybe a reaction on the part of certain parts of the establishment to somebody saying, &quot;Hold on a second, this thing will not last.&quot;  <br\/><br\/>It seems to me from a political perspective that on every big economic issue, Ireland tends to split between insiders and outsiders.  The insiders are people with &quot;pull&quot;, the old fashioned word, with access to power, and the outsiders are people who are actually on the outside.  In the case of the property market and the associated banking and credit explosion, the insiders were the bankers themselves, estate agents, people who were doing well out of the property market, parts of the professional classes who were doing very well, and senior Government officials who were looking the other way or were not necessarily taking on board what was clear.  These are the people on the inside who were actually doing well.  Then, of course, political parties, because if there is a property boom there will be a tax boom.  If there is a tax boom then there will be lots of goodies to give out, lots of sweeties to give out.  So I think they are the insiders and in the situation of a housing boom where house prices are rising well above what the average person can afford, the outsiders are simply the people on the outside who are forced to play a game in which the dice is loaded against them from the start.  I think that is important; there is a political context in this.  <br\/><br\/>I suppose I devoted such enormous energies to try to warn about this for two main reasons.  The first reason was because I believed that hundreds of thousands of ordinary Irish people would end up in negative equity and would end up in debt and would end up in a situation where their lives would be destroyed by the debt associated with the housing market and they would end up being the people who paid.  That is a social reason.  The second reason, and this is very important for the context of this, is that I had worked both inside the Central Bank in Ireland in a crisis but, more crucially, I had also worked outside in investment banking.  What I see and what I saw were panics in investment banks, panics in financial markets, and I could see that every single day we avoided taking responsibility for this mess.  Every single day we said, &quot;It will be grand,&quot; or, &quot;There will be a soft landing,&quot; or, &quot;Don't worry about it, it is the markets.&quot;  We were therefore condemning ourselves to run out of options when the crisis happened.  The more we ignored, the more desperate we became and therefore the more we ignored the more likely we were to end up, which we did when the crash came, in a situation where our choices were not between good and bad but between bad and worse.<br\/><br\/>The crash was inevitable.  Now why was it inevitable?  This is the key.It was inevitable because of the way in which the banks were financing themselves.  Again I wrote all of this at the time.  I was writing this in 2000 and 2001.  This is not me thinking back and looking with hindsight.  This was obvious to anybody who was trained.  It was obvious.  This is not the sort of thing that anybody who is trained could not see.  This panic did not have to happen.  The panic of September 2008 did not have to happen.  It was not anything that was pre-ordained.  It could have been fixed very early.  The problem is if there is no housing boom there will be no banking boom.  If there is no banking boom there will be no banking crisis.  If there is no banking crisis there will be no interventions, such as the guarantee, and there will be no bailout.  All of these things are the consequence of bad economic policy, not the cause.  They are the consequence.  What happens in banks when they get out of control is that they all end in bank runs.  A bank run is when people take their money out.  A bank run is called a run because it happens quickly; it is not a bank amble or a bank stroll or a bank stroll around the park with a dog.  It is a run because people panic.  That panic will be more extreme if there is what is called hot money, if there is international money financing the banks.  When I saw this in 2004 that was when I realised we had a serious problem.<br\/><br\/>The Irish banking crisis began in 2000, not in 2008 as is sometimes suggested.  It began in 2000.  The great English economist John Stuart Mill, speaking about the railway crash that happened in Ireland during the Famine, said that crashes do not destroy the wealth of a nation, they merely evidence the extent to which wealth has already been destroyed by stupid decisions taken in the boom.  So the destruction of the Irish balance sheet did not happen after 2008; it actually happened before.  That is the nub of the issue, because prevention is always better than cure; we know that.  There is a direct link therefore between not heeding the warnings and vilifying those who warn.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Mr. David McWilliams:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->There is a direct link between this and the subsequent panic which need not have happened and the decisions that were taken. <br\/><br\/>The best way to look at this credit banking panic is through the prism of a forest fire.  Let us imagine a forest fire in a small place; the pyromaniacs start the fire which, in this case, are the banks and the forest is the general economy.  The people who are supposed to be the firemen, the regulators and the monetary authorities, look the other way and say &quot;Don't worry about the fire&quot;.  Some people would have said we have had them before and they have been quite nasty but this one will be different.  The firemen say &quot;Don't worry, we'll be grand, it will blow itself out.&quot;  Then the fire engulfs, not only the forest, but is about to engulf the entire village beside it.  The village leaders, the politicians, are faced with the choice - does one let the thing blow and see what happens because one never knows maybe a house will remain, or does one put it out?  At that stage one has to put out the fire with every single method possible.  Why?  Because it is already engulfing the entire place.  If one looks at the situation in that way one can see the way in which I, who wrote this a long time ago, think about these situations.<br\/><br\/>Who started the fire?  I wrote many years ago that property markets can only increase with credit.  Property markets do not increase as a result of supply and demand.  That was a big canard.  It does not happen that way.  It is credit.  Who gave the credit?  The banks.  Worse, what happened?  When the banks ran out of our deposits - normally the bank would say to itself I have a deposit here that will allow me to lend - they borrowed other people's money to give to us to buy houses that we were buying and selling to each other at expensive prices and calling it a miracle.  Whose money did they borrow?  They borrowed from the Germans, French, British, etc.  There was hot money coming in.  For example, one of the largest banks took 100 years to build up a balance sheet of &euro;60 billion but it doubled that in three years.  Let us think about that.  Why?  Because it had all this money coming in.  <br\/><br\/>What was the regulation called?  It was called light touch regulation.  Light touch regulation means one guarantees, almost makes certain, that the banking system is going to implode because hot money always leaves.  When hot money leaves then the rest of the money leaves too.  We actually set the entire thing up and this is crucial to a fail.<br\/><br\/>The interesting thing is a lot of people said:  &quot;Don't worry.  The free market will discipline the banks.&quot;  That does not happen.  Let me explain what happens in the free markets.  On the way up the free markets do not discipline the banks but do the opposite and allow the banks to do what they want.  As a consequence we have an  extraordinary situation where one joins the EMU, which was an unusual decision we might talk about later but it had a material impact on the economy, most of which in my opinion is negative.  We have light touch regulation, we get this flood of money into the banks which facilitates over-lending and then the over-lending facilitates over-borrowing.  All of this sounds familiar now but back in 2003 nobody was discussing it or those who did were vilified.  I shall play the committee a little 40-second clip of me on &quot;Prime Time&quot; in October 2003 which was watched by 400,000 people.  This is important and I said: <blockquote>The Irish housing market is a scam.  It is an enormous financial swindle that could potentially confine an entire generation of young Irish workers to years of bad debt.  Far from being a reflection of economic vitality and fundamental demand the housing bubble is, in the main, a vacuous financial confidence trick that has been foisted upon us by an alliance of banks and the landowners.<br \/><br \/>Today, in Ireland, the price of the average house is close to ten times the average wage.  This represents an economic failure on a monumental scale.  Behind this nonsense is excessive and irresponsible lending from our financial institutions.  The situation would be laughable if it were not so serious.<\/blockquote>That clip dates from October 2003.  I said: &quot;The Irish housing market is a scam.&quot;  That is what it was and that is what I want to come back to.  It was financed by over-lending not demand.<br\/><br\/>A lot of people have asked me what made me think like that while other economists did not.  I will wrap up but I want to make the following point about what happens when house prices rise.  Economics tells us that when the price rises the demand falls, that is what we teach kids in school.  In Ireland the opposite happens with house prices.  When the price rises the demand rises because people get panicked.  One hears that all the time.  People say: &quot;Jesus, prices are going up by 10%.  I'd better get on the ladder now because if I don't I'll have to pay another 10% next year.&quot;  A very active rise in prices, once it is allowed, creates a dynamic in people's heads to buy more, not less.  This is why economists could do with common sense, which is what I have always felt.  I urge them to talk to people.  I suggest they forget the models, talk to people, ask them what they think and then think about supply.  Economists will say &quot;Oh, when the prices the supply goes up&quot;.  <br\/><br\/>The main houses we have in Ireland is a stock of housing.  The houses are already built.  Someone like my Mum would trade down from a family house, she would move on and some other family would have the home.  Let us think about what happens when house prices rise.  My mother would say, and it is natural, &quot;I won't sell that now if they are going up by 20%.  Wouldn't I be mad to sell so I shall sell next year?&quot;.  That would be a totally rational decision for my mother.  Not only does the price not work, it amplifies the problem.  It ends up that supply eventually adjusts but it adjusts far too late.  We end up building houses in the wrong place for the wrong people at the wrong price.  That is why I coined the expression &quot;ghost estates&quot;.<br\/><br\/>In 2006, I was travelling back from Westport having visited Allergan, a factory which produces Botox, not for my own use.  I visited for a piece of research I was doing about who made Botox.  While I drove back from Mayo to Dublin I saw that every little town had a huge big estate and was reminded of a conversation I had had the night before.  I was thinking, because I had talked to a local guy the night before about the famine in Mayo, about how extraordinary it was and how unbelievably catastrophic it was.  He talked about the famine villages around Delphi and that neck of the woods.  He said they were like ghost villages and were kind of creepy.  When I saw the estates on my drive back home I thought they were exactly the same and that they were ghost estates.  It is funny because when one comes up with a term one does not realise that it will drop into the lexicon so quickly.  Obviously the &quot;breakfast roll man&quot; was building the &quot;ghost estates&quot;.  All these things happened but the ghost estates are indicative of how supply does not respond.<br\/><br\/>One wonders why people behave like this.  I want the committee to understand, at the very beginning, why the economy behaves like this.  People behave like this because we are all impacted by each other.  Economists think we are all rational.  We are not.  We are highly irrational.  Has anyone every met a more irrational animal than us?  We fall in love, we follow stupid football teams - all the things that make no sense.  The reason is that everything we do is impacted by other people.  <br\/><br\/>A couple of months I was in the Aviva stadium with my son.  In Dublin, there are two types of people.  There are those people who buy their own tickets to the Aviva and there those people who get paid to go to the Aviva.  I fall into the former camp.  I remember Ireland scored three tries against Australia in the first 18 minutes.  Even though I had really good seats with my 12-year old I saw none of the tries.  Why?  Every time the Irish team did well everyone seated in front of us stood up.  Then I had to stand up and my kid had to stand up and get on my shoulders.  Then the people behind me had to stand up and that continued for all the people behind them.  That is exactly how the economy works too.  The fellas who stood up first had no idea they were sending a signal to me to stand up because I was behind them.  I had no idea that I was impairing the view of the people behind me.  We had all paid to sit in the Aviva but we ended up standing.  That is how is the economy behaves.  When people see house prices rising in Ireland they buy houses, if they can, not because they want them but because other people are buying them.  That type of herd behaviour is essential to understand why a property boom in a country like ours, if it is not controlled, gets totally and utterly out of hand unless of course one is lending to this property boom in which case one is making money so does not care.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Mr. David McWilliams:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The question is, why did the banks not see this?  Why did they not see that their own balance sheets were being impaired?  I believe it is because banks' balance sheets play tricks on them.  Every time a chunk of money goes into the economy, house prices rise.  That means the banks' collateral rises so they feel safe.  Every time the collateral rises they feel safer and safer and ultimately they lend more and more and more.  Then, if one's bonus is related to one's share price one has a greater interest in lending more because lending more makes one rich and gives one profits.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015022600002#A00100","speaker":"990","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424908800,"counter":1289,"content":"<p>Move towards a conclusion now Mr. McWilliams because we also have to ask you some questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015022600002#D00200","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424908800,"counter":1290,"content":"<p>I am trying to get to the point of why this economy works as it does and why we need to have a set of views of the economy which reflect what actually happens in reality and not in some dream world of academia.  I am saying the banks' balance sheets play tricks on them and they ultimately go bust.  Why is that?  Because they are allowed to borrow yet more.  They keep borrowing and the balance sheets look fine.  Then they realise the more they borrow, the worse the balance sheet is, but they do not see it.<\/p> <p> Why did the interest rate not rise?  It was because we are in the EU.  We have this crazy situation in that we have decided we are Germans.  What is that all about?  Ireland does most of its trade with Britain and the US, yet we have a currency attached to Germany.  Somebody else may elucidate as to why that is.  When German interest rates fall, our interest rates fall too.  When our interest rates fall there is no warning sign from outside.  That is hugely important because it is material to the next ten years, not just the last ten years.  <\/p> <p> We also have an issue with groupthink.  Why did nobody, or very few, speak out?  I believe groupthink is something that happens in many aspects.  I believe that if one has ideas in Ireland which are beyond the mainstream, those ideas go through three phases.  The first phase is open ridicule, the second phase is violent opposition and both of these happened to me.  The third phase is where we are now which is that everybody pretends they were on one's side all the time.  This is what happens.  Groupthink shifts because it is a conventional wisdom.

You based this on the Minsky Kindleberger credit cycle analysis.  Can you please outline to the committee what that theory means?<br\/><br\/>Can you also inform the inquiry if any person in authority contacted you in regard to the concerns you were raising at that time?<\/p><p>It is an interesting question.  The book <i>The Pope's Children<\/i>was so widely read that these ideas were in the ether.  This was not an academic book that nobody read, it was the biggest selling non-fiction book of the decade.  This has all happened before, all over the world.  We can go back to the Romans or even the Bible.  In Deuteronomy and Leviticus, two books in the Old Testament deal with debt forgiveness after booms.  We are not talking about something new, we are talking about something that is deep in our culture.<br\/><br\/>Most mainstream economists in Ireland believe in classical economic theory and I do not.  I never have.  I will give an example of what happens in peoples' heads when prices rise.  There are two stand-out American economists I learned about after I left postgraduate studies and university in Ireland, namely, Charles Kindleberger and Hyman Minsky.  They understood that once credit was put into the mix, it profoundly changes the way people behave.  Members will know this from talking to their constituencies.  Kindleberger outlined the various stages of the cycle.  There are seven stages.<br\/><br\/>One is when something material happens or actually changes.  In our case we joined the European Monetary Union and our interest rates in the long term went from a real interest rate of about 6% down to almost zero.  Our interest rates fell which changed the landscape profoundly.  House prices begin to rise in this first stage of Kindleberg's model.<br\/><br\/>The second stage is euphoria.  People begin to think it is because of themselves that their house price is rising.  They think they are clever.  House prices continue to rise.  The third phase is gearing, which is when the banks get involved with the idea that one can remortgage a house to buy two gaffs in the Algarve.  Gearing means that the whole thing starts to get a little bit crazy.  The fourth phase is the mania phase when people become manic.  People actually flew to Bulgaria to buy houses, financed by their houses in Ireland.  Banks are now pushing the money.<br\/><br\/>The fifth phase is the bubble phase.  We all lived through it and know what it is.  The sixth phase in the Kindleberger cycle is the phase of distress.  This is when people start to dislike the smell of the situation.  Early people get out and start selling.  The seventh phase of the Kindleberger Minsky cycle is called <i>torschlusspanik, <\/i>a German phrase from when it happened in Germany and Austria in the 19th century.  It translates as shut door panic, when everybody jumps and runs for the door and tries to sell.  The whole thing collapses.  This happens in assets all the time and I could see this.  <br\/><br\/>There are three phases which happen next.  The first is the Minsky moment.  This is crucial because our banks had a Minsky moment in September 2008.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Mr. David McWilliams:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->A Minsky moment is when a bank realises it does not have any money and must sell good assets to pay for the losses on bad assets, because those assets are entirely bought on margin.  Once one buys something on margin, one is in the lap of the gods.  So we had Kindleberger's seven stages, then we had a crash and then came the Minsky moment where we had bank collapses.  Again, this is all in the book.  At that stage only massive state intervention can help.  It is described as requiring a hegemon, that is, a big country or large institution, a central bank or the ECB, say, to come in and right the situation.  That is because they, like me, do not believe in classical economics.  The economy will not right itself after this type of boom and there must be an intervention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015022600002#D01000","speaker":"990","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424908800,"counter":1300,"content":"<p>That leads me to my last question.

What I was trying to explain, which had not really been explained before and certainly had not been explained to the Irish people by the policy makers, was that once one joins a monetary union, what one is effectively doing, if there is no regulation of one's banks, is getting the PIN number to the ATM card of the richest person in the room.  Of course, the richest person in the EU's room was Germany.  It was rich and it was in decline.  After reunification in the early 1990s, the united country swallowed up the former East Germany and it cost it a fortune to do so.  Germany's economy then began to stagger under the weight of those repayments and as a result of the cultural and demographic shift.  The country started to go into decline in the period from 1995 to 2005.  For Ireland, this meant our interest rates, which were really set for the Germans, went to levels that were totally inappropriate for the boom we were having.  It meant that the normal way in which one warns people that things are out of kilter, which is by setting higher interest rates, not only did not happen but we actually got lower interest rates.<\/p> <p>  I was trying to explain in the book where the money was coming from.  I remember going to pubs and people asking, \"Where is all this bloody money coming from?\".  I recall a builder friend of mine who worked with me years ago in Boston saying to me that the difference in Ireland at that time, compared with the past, was there was now no problem getting money.  For the 2005 book, I invented a German character whom I named Udo Lindenberg after a German crooner.  This guy was sort of the German version of France's Johnny Hallyday - not a great gig to attend, I suspect.  I invented the character and named him for this singer I had heard of.  Udo represented the old, parsimonious German saver.  Banks hate saving because they do not make any money on them.  In fact, they pay out for saving.  In that situation, they asked themselves who they could give them to in order to make money on Udo's savings, and over here was Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015022600002#E00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. David McWilliams"},{"type":"speech","time":1424908800,"counter":1308,"content":"<p>I will bring Mr. McWilliams forward now to the very early part of September 2008.

If the United States could not let Lehman's go, with the deepest financial market, with the best central bank in terms of ability, with its own currency and with its own monetary policy, we could not do that because it did not work in the States.  The second day after Lehman's failed, the Americans did what would be called the nationalisation route.  They nationalised AIG, the massive insurance company.  Nationalising would not have stopped the bank run in Ireland because the bank run was systemic in the sense that people were taking money out of all the banks, so you nationalise one but it just means that people will say, \"Who is next?\".  That is exactly what happened in America.<\/p><p> The next day Merrill Lynch went bust.  I did mention to the Minister that I found it ironic that his lead advisers were Merrill Lynch, people who could not even keep their own bank solvent, let alone advise others.  At the time, he was aware.  <\/p><p> The third option was that one of the big Irish banks would buy one of the small Irish banks, the idea being if you have a big balance sheet, you can actually take over a smaller balance sheet but I said to him at the time that all the Irish balance sheets were bust because we all knew they were doing the same thing.  So even without the figures, you knew that they were all bust.  I remember saying to him that I thought \"two bad balance sheets does not make a good one\".  <\/p><p> Then he said, \"What about the idea of giving a &euro;100,000 guarantee to depositors?\".  I said, \"That could work but you cannot really be half pregnant, Minister\" and I remember he kind of smiled at this.  I said that if until yesterday you said the banks are well capitalised and then tomorrow morning you say, \"Do you know what, not only are they not well capitalised, they are going to bust but we will protect some people\".  When the hot money is owned by people in trading floors, that does not cut it.

It is only as a last resort and I remember saying to the Minister, \"I don't know; I don't have the facts, but I think we are at the last resort.  What you have got to do [this is very important for the record and it is written down in black and white in all of my documents] is you have got to introduce a holding guarantee which buys you the time to allow your auditors and your civil servants to go in and find out the facts.

In a panic, does it say that people should not worry and that the rest of them are fine, or does it make a depositor wonder what will happen if one bank has been nationalised and is about to go under?  I informed Brian Lenihan that exactly this tactic was taken by the IMF in 1998 in Asia.  There was a crisis in Thailand with the baht, followed by crises in Malaysia and then Indonesia.

That model came about as a result of a big collapse there in the 1980s and 1990s where eventually they realised the cost of bank bailouts was going to be too much.  They decided that what they were going to do was force the bondholders - the debtholders - to take equity which made them shareholders in the banks which, in a way, allied the banks and shareholders in the same place.  That was increasingly my thinking and then the following became so obvious to me after NAMA.  What NAMA did with the guarantee was it ensured that this country would end up selling our assets at a discount and buying our liabilities at a premium.  That is morally wrong but is also a financial disaster.  At that point we had created the ELA or emergency liquidity assistance.  That meant the banks' liquidity was solid so one could have rescinded the guarantee, kept NAMA in place and nothing would have happened because the ECB was back in there and the Central Bank was back in.

In a small country one gets significant vested interested.  When a small country experiences a banking and property boom many people will make a lot of what looks like very easy money.  That cohort of people have a clear incentive to vilify the maverick.<\/p> <p>  With respect to my own profession of economics, it amazed me at the time that so few, in any positions of power, did anything or said anything.  I have found it amazing that people were swanning around with titles like bank expert and international bank expert.  I said \"Well, hold on a second.  You were living in the country that had the most catastrophic bank crisis and you didn't open your beak.\"  People watching this are entitled to ask that question.  <\/p> <p>  There is a thing in Ireland which I refer to as conventional wisdom.  When conventional wisdom sets in it is repeated by serious people.  People say \"He is not a serious person but I am a serious person because the guy beside me is a serious person.\"  Then he repeats the mantra and then mantras replace hard thinking.  Once mantras replace hard thinking then every serious person buys into them.  J.K. Galbraith said something very interesting about changing one's mind.  It is very hard to change one's mind if one is a serious person.  He said that when faced with the choice of changing one's mind or finding the proof that indicates one does not have to, the vast majority gets busy finding the proof.  Let us consider that thought in the context of this country.  People like me were regarded with the view that it could not possibly be right, what this guy is saying, because the vista is too apocalyptic.  One of the views was \"Ah but he spent too much time abroad.\"  <\/p> <p>  I feel, and this is worrying for subsequent future years, that when this society coalesces around what I would call a simple truth, such as there will be a soft landing or the banks are well capitalised, it is an extraordinarily dangerous place to be.  It means that, like lemmings, we all go over the cliff together.  <\/p> <p>  As I have always thought, if one thinks of a quadrant of maverick, consensus, right and wrong, which applies to politics as well, if one is in that consensus and one is wrong then people adopt the view that we are all wrong together and sure that is grand.  People think \"We are all a bit stupid but we are all stupid together\".  If one is in the consensus and one is right people think \"Sure, we are all geniuses, that is great. Jesus, you are smarter than me.  Oh my God, you are outrageously smart.\"  If one is a maverick and one is wrong then one is a maverick that is wrong.

He continued, &quot;A monumental mass of gold and silver crossed the Atlantic between 1540 and 1580 - Gold robbed from Latin America paid for everything&quot;.  He concluded:<blockquote><br \/><br \/>There was hardly any lasting positive effect on the Spanish economy.  How did Spain manage to waste one of the biggest financial windfalls in human history?  And are there any lessons for modern Europe and Ireland in the history of the Spanish gold rush?<\/blockquote>In Ireland, were there any equivalents of the indigenous peoples of Latin America who were robbed?

The interesting thing about human nature is that it never changes.  All these things happen again and again.  At the time, what really struck me as fascinating from an economic historian&rsquo;s perspective was how Spain went from being the richest and most aggressive colonialist country in Europe in the 16th century to the poorest in the 17th century.  How did that happen?  There are many theories but one in particular struck me.  What actually happened was that when they plundered all the gold from Latin America, it became easier not to work.  Huge swathes of the Spanish manufacturing and agricultural sectors stopped because the Spaniards did not bother working.  The people who actually got the most benefit from the Spanish plunder of the Inca gold were not the Spanish but the Dutch and the British who actually made the nails, the hammers, the guns and other products they sold to the Spaniards.  That always struck me as interesting.<\/p> <p>  What the Spaniards had was a massive monetary stimulus, like in the context of Ireland.  They woke up one morning and had all the money in the world.  We woke up one morning and through the banks had all the money in the world.  As had happened in Spain, when one has all the money in the world, prices and inflation rise and one abandons manufacturing.

If the Deputy thinks about it, if one puts money into land in Ireland, how many tax breaks does one get?  Loads.  How much cheap capital does one get?  Loads.  Why does one get cheap capital?  It is because the banks say they know what land smells and feels like.  However, take someone like Apple&rsquo;s founders.  They tell the banks they are going to build the most amazing computers out of a garage and will need X millions of euro to do so but have no guarantees or collateral, just that it is all in their head.  The banks will not give someone like that money.<\/p> <p>  What I was trying to explain in the historical context was that one part of our economy would become bloated with capital while another part would become totally starved.  That is where we have to got to in Ireland.  We have a massively efficient multinational sector but very little domestic industry.  I believe this is because the way which Irish capital was given out in the boom, namely that it always favoured land.  At the very top of the boom, 88% of every single loan given out by an Irish bank in this country was to a property or property-related investment.  When one allows the banks be the sole arbiter of the distribution of capital, one will get endemic short-termism.  Why?  It is because it drives up their share prices and bankers&rsquo; bonuses are paid by share prices.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015022600002#K00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. David McWilliams"},{"type":"speech","time":1424908800,"counter":1424,"content":"<p>The Deputy has one minute left.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015022600002#K00850","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speech","time":1424908800,"counter":1425,"content":"<p>I had better fast forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015022600002#K00875","speaker":"954"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424908800,"counter":1426,"content":"<p>That is the problem with starting with Pizarro.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015022600002#K00887","nonspeaker":"Mr. David McWilliams"},{"type":"speech","time":1424908800,"counter":1427,"content":"<p>In his written statement, Mr. McWilliams stated when one speaks against mainstream views, there are three phases, first, the open ridicule phase, second, the violent opposition phase and, third, everyone pretends they were on your side all the time phase.

Deputy Doherty will know this as someone from Letterkenny.  If the Irish currency is overvalued relative to sterling, the currency of our major trading partner, Irish people go across the Border to buy stuff.  We have a living economic experiment in Dundalk, Letterkenny and Lifford.  During the currency crisis I pointed out to one of our bosses who was claiming there would be no crisis or devaluation that the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>was reporting on these queues of punters, although they were probably driving Ford Escorts rather than Toyota Corollas at the time.

In 2000 I came up with a backward looking house price index whereby the last house price increase was divided by the average of the index and then multiplied by the loan-to-value ratio, which means that the increase in prices reduces the amount of money that can be lent.  It would be a dynamic system which could regulate itself.  That is how one should do it.  It is a simple statistical rule and it would be unbelievably easy to put in place.

If, for example, the regulator saw that a bank had just issued a short-term liquidity instrument of &euro;500 million, which was happening all the time, it could have said, \"Hold on a second, you cannot do that.\"  The regulator would manage the bank's liabilities, which are the source of its delinquency, and as a consequence the bank would not be able to lend for commercial property.

Our objective was similarly to stop a bank run.  Sweden quickly realised it would have to set up a bad bank and it did so extremely quickly.  It wrote down the assets very quickly and minimised the cost.  However, it also devalued its currency by 40%.  Once a country devalues its currency, it is back to life.  What happened in Ireland's banking crisis was that, amazingly, not only did we not devalue our currency, but it actually increased in value between 2008 and 2010.

Over the last five years an amazing number of scenarios have been painted about what could have been done if, could, must, blah blah.  Hindsight is a great luxury.  At the time we had a banking system that had been set up to fail.  It was not a matter of \"if\", it was a matter of \"when\".  The combination of hot money and a bank run is the most vicious and contagious financial episode one can imagine.  It is the financial equivalent of Ebola.  One needs to come in with all possible interventions to reduce the perceived risk in the minds of people that their money will not be there when they go to the bank tomorrow.  That is crucial.  Much of my testimony has been about how, in God's name, did we let it get to that situation.  Once one is in that situation, however, one has to ask whether one knows the facts and, if one does not, whether one should take the risk that not knowing the facts might imperil the banking system.  There is absolutely no way one can do that.  It is in black and white in all my writing that the guarantee needed to be temporary in order to give us time to get into the banks to investigate the situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015022600002#M01900","nonspeaker":"Mr. David McWilliams"},{"type":"speech","time":1424908800,"counter":1513,"content":"<p>Mr. McWilliams referred to a period of two years.<\/p><p>I said: \"Let us say two years.\"  The phrase \"let us say\" is hardly a scientific formula.

People do what people do and this constantly underscores the need for strong, independent, highly vigilant regulators.  The most important point about regulation is that one can have the best regulation in the world but if one does not police it, it is not worth the paper on which it is written.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Mr. David McWilliams:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->As such it is better to have fewer points of regulation which are well policed rather than to have pages and pages of unpoliced regulations.

Therefore, the guarantee would have been rescinded as the liquidity problem was already plugged.  Then one would have lined up all the creditors in a room and had a bank resolution mechanism as that is the system whereby we as a society deal with bad banks.  At the very top, one would have what I call \"trust creditors\".  They are creditors in trust, which is to say depositors.  When my mum goes to put her savings into the bank, she does not realise that technically she is lending money to the bank.  In her head, it is a nest egg, something for grandchildren and what she has put away for a rainy day.  She does not have any realisation that technically in the event of a bankruptcy, she is a lender.  Therefore, my solution, as I wrote at the time, was that as simple depositors trust the system, they should be regarded as trust creditors and encircled.  Under that, one then has the normal hierarchy of creditors which everybody understands.  It happens every single day in this country in receiverships.  That is the system we could still have.  That answers the Deputy's question.

This materialised rapidly in the significant growth of the Swedish economy in the 18 months after their banking crisis.  My feeling was and to a degree still is that the NAMA process was so slow in writing down and it never freed up the banks that had got the stuff off their balance sheets to begin the process of lending.

One values such an asset by estimating the stream of income that will come from it and multiplying it by a multiple.  UBS probably saw that the stream of income coming from Irish commercial property was falling because much of it was empty, similar to the ghost estate situation.  UBS was saying if the stream of income from the commercial property goes to zero, the loan goes bad immediately.  The only way the loan can be made good is if one continues to lend money against it, which is what happened in Ireland.  This is the type of analysis UBS would have come up with and it would have said a chunk of the balance sheet could go bust.  UBS would have asked what the share price of the company was and realised it was very high.

Professor McDonough is professor of economics at NUI Galway and has a PhD in economics from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst.  Before joining NUI Galway in 1995, he held posts at the Institute of Industry Studies at Cornell University, Canisius College, Buffalo, and Dublin City University.  He has published numerous books and academic articles, was on the editorial board of the Review of Radical Political Economics and is currently on the editorial board of the International Journal of Pluralism and Economics Education.  His current interests include globalisation, American and Irish economic history, political economy, the history of economic thought, and economics education for labour and community groups.<br\/><br\/>Before we begin, I advise Professor McDonough that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.

Along with the rest of the nation, I am looking forward to learning about many of the specific events and decisions leading up to the Irish banking crisis.  In contrast, however, I will concentrate on addressing today's brief, which concerns the international, European and Irish policy context of the banking crisis.  In doing so, I will be presenting a macroeconomic analysis of the overall crisis which still faces the world's peoples today, at least seven years after its inauguration.<br\/><br\/>It is important to understand that the situation affecting Ireland at the time of the banking guarantee cannot be characterised only as a financial crisis.  Instead, Ireland at this time was caught up in a perfect storm, one whose great winds have periodically abated only to blow up again.  It is popular in some quarters to refer to Ireland's crisis as homegrown, and it is certainly true that one storm front blew up within the borders of Ireland.  However, 2008 saw the tragic convergence of this front with two other influences, one the global storm of the international crisis of global neoliberalism.  This blew Ireland against the other influence, namely, the unforgiving shores of the euro system.  We do not have to go all the way back to the proverbial butterfly flapping its wings to find the origins of this maelstrom.  The global crisis, the European crisis and the Irish crisis all find their origins in the same basic institutions of the age.  All are rooted in the four institutions of globalisation, neoliberalism, repression of labour and financialisation.<br\/><br\/>What are these institutions?  Globalisation<i><\/i>is the disintegration of production processes into their component parts and the location of each of these components in that area of the world most congenial to making profits.  The production process is then reintegrated through free trade across borders.  This process brings employers and workers face to face across the globe.  Neoliberalism<i><\/i>is a complex phenomenon.  It can perhaps be most succinctly described as market fundamentalism, a belief that important social decisions about production and income distribution are almost always and everywhere best left to be determined in markets.  This idea manifests itself in institutions like the World Trade Organisation, policies like deregulation and privatisation and ideologies like free market economics.  The repression of labour<i><\/i>involves the erosion of the power of labour to defend its organisations, working conditions and standard of living.  It is most dramatically evidenced in the decline in union density.  Financialisation<i>, <\/i>according to the American economist Jerry Epstein, &quot;refers to the increasing importance of financial markets, financial motives, financial institutions, and financial elites in the operation of the economy and its governing institutions, both at the national and international level&quot;.<br\/><br\/>All these institutions date from the early 1980s.  Their beginnings are marked by the political victories of Ronald Reagan in the United States and Margaret Thatcher in the United Kingdom.  These new institutions can be collectively labelled the era of global neoliberalism.  This new stage of capitalism at first led to recovery.  In the 1970s, capitalism was in a period which has come to be known as the Great Stagflation, a condition of simultaneous high unemployment and high inflation which was unpredicted by the Keynesian economics of the time.  Together, globalisation, financialisation, neoliberalism and the loss of labour influence led to a period known in some quarters as the Great Moderation.  Profit rates, which had been falling from the late 1960s, bottomed out in the early 1980s and over time returned to their previous levels.  Growth recovered, although it did not reach the standards of the earlier post-Second World War period.  Employment rose and inflation fell and remained low.<br\/><br\/>However, this economic recovery is only one side of the story.  The same set of institutions which led to the global neoliberal recovery from stagflation would eventually create the most serious economic crisis since the Great Depression.  Problems became evident almost immediately.  Globalisation led to the unification of previously separate national markets for goods and services.  Competition within this new larger market led to the emergence of excess capacity in many industries.  Labour's loss of bargaining power led to the stagnation of real median family income in the United States.  This wage stagnation occurred despite the continual increase in the productive capacity of labour.  These two factors, excess capacity and stagnant wages, led to a rate of investment which, while positive, was relatively sluggish by historical standards.  This relatively sluggish investment was accompanied by restored profitability.  If the restored profits were not being invested in productive plant and equipment, where could they go?  Financialisation made it increasingly easy to fund the purchase of various categories of assets, driving up their prices and creating capital gains, which could only encourage further speculation in asset prices.  Borrowing on the basis of rising asset prices temporarily sustained demand in the face of sluggish investment and stagnant wages.  When the asset bubble burst, however, the full force of listless investment and low wages was felt in the emergence of what was, in Keynesian terms, a crisis of inadequate demand.  For the ordinary household, it was a crisis of unemployment.<br\/><br\/>That is the global context and, naturally, we are much more concerned with the specific situation of Ireland.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Professor Terence McDonough:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->A close look at the origins of the Celtic tiger, however, reveals that it was a creature of these same four institutions of global neoliberalism, namely, globalisation, neoliberalism, the repression of labour and financialisation.  As is often the case in Ireland, we had to wait a few years for the advent of global neoliberalism - Irish style.  For Ireland, the key date is 1987.  A neoliberal approach to government in Ireland began when a minority Fianna F&aacute;il Government came to power in 1987.  Minority status led to seeking a consensus economic strategy which could attract the support of other parties.  It was supported by Fine Gael&rsquo;s adoption of the Tallaght strategy under the leadership of Alan Dukes.  Two years later the neoliberal Progressive Democrats entered coalition with Fianna F&aacute;il.  O&rsquo;Riain and O&rsquo;Connell summarise the turnaround in public spending:<blockquote><br \/><br \/>Restoring order to the public finances was achieved by severe cutbacks in public expenditure in 1987-1990.  Total current spending fell by over ten percentage points in real terms between 1987 and 1989.  Total current spending fell from 57% of gross national product in 1985 to 42% in 1990.<\/blockquote>The fall in expenditure created room for tax cuts.  The top rate of income tax fell from 60% to 48% over five years.  Basic corporate income tax rates also fell.<br\/><br\/>In addition to embarking on a new macroeconomic strategy, the new Fianna F&aacute;il Government also convened the first of a series of tripartite industrial negotiations leading to a national partnership agreement, the Programme for National Recovery, PNR.  For the unions&rsquo; part, they could sense a rightward shift in the political system and feared the Government might be capable of importing the Thatcherite strategy of a massive attack on the unions aimed at negating their economic, social and political influence.  The PNR established a neoliberal pattern of achieving wage moderation through the promise of future tax cuts.  Frank Barry calculates these tax cuts accounted for about one third of the increases in take-home pay to 2004.  Such moderation under social partnership led to a falling wage share.  The wage share was 71 % of gross domestic product in 1986 and fell to 54% in 2001.  Days lost through industrial disputes dropped off drastically beginning in 1987.  Accordingly, the repression of labour in Ireland led not to wage stagnation, as in the United States, but to wage moderation under social partnership.<br\/><br\/>The social partnership process was careful not to jeopardise Ireland&rsquo;s traditional internationalisation strategy.  Teague and Donaghey conclude that social partnership operated &ldquo;hand-in-glove with the wider policy of economic openness&rdquo;.  The Single European Act came into effect in 1987 and was approved by referendum in the same year.  The implementation of the Single Market coincides with a boom in foreign employment in Ireland, with such jobs growing by 50% between 1987 and 2000.  The Single European Act was accompanied by plans to expand Structural Funds spending.  Structural Funds were doubled in 1988 and again in 1993.  A new Industrial Development Agency, IDA, strategic plan was unveiled in 1983.  The new strategy would concentrate on technologically advanced firms with high potential for market growth.  These developments copperfastened globalisation as an essential element of Ireland&rsquo;s growth strategy.<br\/><br\/>The year 1987 also saw the investment hunting capacity of the IDA applied in a new realm.  It was decided by the incoming Government to target investment in international financial services through the establishment of the International Financial Services Centre, IFSC.  By 1999, attracted by light touch regulation, 66% of all FDI, foreign direct investment, inflows were accounted for by the IFSC.  It was the source of 24% of all services exports.  The IFSC would be an important conduit for foreign capital flows and was central to Ireland&rsquo;s participation in transnational financialisation.<br\/><br\/>Irish participation in the global neoliberal social order was no longer in doubt and this institutional framework underpinned the advent of the famous Celtic tiger.  Of course, the tiger is also now infamous because, as was the case at the global level, the elements of global neoliberalism would not only set the conditions for Ireland&rsquo;s rise but also its spectacular fall from grace.  Under Ireland&rsquo;s peculiar labour institutions, wages rose but the level of inequality rose much faster.  The fear of Thatcherism had fed into the formation of social partnership.  As noted before, wage moderation was traded for tax cuts.  This tendency was strongly reinforced by the perceived need to compete globally through low taxes and a neoliberal policy preference for minimising the capacity of the State.<br\/><br\/>The economic momentum of the Celtic tiger eventually fed into blowing up the real estate market.  Financialisation provided the wind beneath the wings of the Irish asset bubble.  Rising levels of inequality created an aspiration for levels of consumption which for many could not be supported from current income.  Rising house prices provided an expensive asset of expanding value for those in the housing market and collateral for borrowing by those who already owned their own homes.  Household debt rose from less than 120% of disposable income in 2003 to 220% in 2009.  The bubble in the property market provided an alternative source of government income through stamp duty and construction-related VAT, compensating to some extent for the overall low tax regime.<br\/><br\/>Ireland was now poised for crisis.  We had a property bubble which could be traced back to financialisation.  We had high levels of household debt which could be traced to the property bubble and rising inequality.  We had a low tax regime which could be traced back to the repression of labour, globalisation and neoliberalism.  The property bubble burst in 2007, endangering the banking system.  The global crisis hit in 2008, intensifying Irish problems.  The collapse of banking, construction and the tax regime produced a fiscal crisis.  The financial crisis, the fiscal crisis and unsustainable household debt then created an unemployment crisis.  It was at this point that the global storm front and the Irish turbulence combined ran up against the sea cliffs of the inflexible euro system.  This euro system was also rooted in global neoliberalism, a global neoliberalism - euro style.  The drive for globalisation led to the Single European Market.  Globalisation linked with financialisation to create the euro currency.  The Single European Market and the euro led to trade surpluses in some countries that were recycled into blowing up asset bubbles and trade deficits in other countries which weakened their fiscal positions.  Financialisation, linked with a strong dose of neoliberal ideology, led to a fiercely independent European Central Bank aggressively limiting its responsibility to inflation control.  Neoliberal ideas of small government and limited intervention in private markets, with the declining influence of labour, led to a monetary union without any fiscal capacity to address problems through increased government spending at European level.  Together the Single European Market, the euro, the European Central Bank and limited fiscal capacity can be said to constitute the euro system.<br\/><br\/>When the turbulence hit, the euro system made sure Ireland could find no haven through devaluing its currency, conducting an independent monetary policy or receive help through fiscal stimulus.  The euro rules have forced Ireland to cut spending and raise taxes in the teeth of a depression.  Instead of a port in the storm, the backwash from the euro cliff intensified the maelstrom.  On 29 September 2008, in the dead of night, Ireland desperately tried to signal for help, but the cannon broke loose and holed the ship of State below the waterline.<br\/><br\/>How could this catastrophe have been avoided?  The only path was to have seen the storm coming and been prepared for it.  This is not a question, as some have recommended, of hiring more economists in the Department of Finance.  In fact, professional politicians and professional economists in the lead up to these events all saw the world in much the same way.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Professor Terrence McDonough:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->In fact, professional politicians and professional economists in the lead up to these events all saw the world in much the same way.  To avoid the storm, both would have had to see the world differently.  I have lived for 20 years in Galway.  It is said of the weather in Galway that it is either raining or about to rain.  Similarly, in the mainstream economic view, the economy is either calm or rapidly becoming calmer.  This theory may barely pass muster in good times, but to prepare for a storm you have to see the economy as potentially tempestuous and riven with conflict and contradictions.  A view of the capitalist economy which ignores its historical dynamics, which sees it as a haven of harmonious give and take, a peaceful equilibrium of supply and demand, which works best when interfered with least, will inevitably lead to foundering on hidden shoals amidst unexpected turbulence.  This is where Ireland still finds itself today. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015022600002#V00200","speaker":"990","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424908800,"counter":1717,"content":"<p>Thank you Professor McDonough.

These factors contributed to the inauguration of the crisis in 2008, but also seriously contributed to the failure to address that crisis in subsequent years.  These factors particularly relate to stagnant wages; the falling power of labour to defend its working conditions; low levels of investment closely related to high levels of excess capacity associated with globalisation on international markets; the inability of governments at local Irish level, at larger European level and at the global level to find a way to intervene to compensate for the financial chaos we faced; very low levels of private investment and the increasing inability of the ordinary person to prop up consumption in the economy because of falling wages and falling standards of living.<\/p> <p>  The crisis is broad but at the same time much deeper.

The total lack of regulation of that economic activity, especially in light of its financial character, turned out to be not such a good thing and the impact of that on the remaining portion of that neighbourhood in the docklands now is substantially negative.<\/p><p> As regards the tax question, I think that we can do with higher tax rates on upper income levels; we can do with taxing wealth in addition to income; we can do with a policy which raises the incomes of people at the lower end of the economic scale and which then provides an opportunity to increase taxation there as well.<\/p><p> I am not a supporter of this process whereby more and more people are taken completely out of the tax net and are then no longer seen as contributing to the collective services which the society should be providing, primarily for people at the lower end of the scale.  I think we need to collect more taxes in general.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015022600002#Y01200","speaker":"1160","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424908800,"counter":1751,"content":"<p>You are very welcome, Professor McDonough.

In general, I would have been quite sympathetic to a process of political unification across Europe but I would have always been supportive of basing that process of political unification, at the very minimum, on traditional European social democratic values.  I think that in the current period, especially in terms of the negotiations which have taken place between the Greek Government and the European Union institutions over the past two weeks, a line has been drawn under the traditional social Europe model.  What has developed in the era of monetary union is very difficult to defend not only philosophically, but also economically.<\/p> <p>  Basically taking exchange rate policy out of the hands of local governments has proven to be extraordinarily damaging.  The separation of local governments from the ability to conduct their own monitoring policy has been extraordinarily damaging.  Setting governments in competition with one another within the EU around the questions of tax policy and expenditure, without creating a more federal capacity to spend and address problems when they arise, has been extraordinarily problematic.  I think a militantly independent central bank, insulated from democratic control, is not defensible.  <\/p> <p>  Beyond that, the European Union has unfortunately participated in a general tendency to separate economic decision-making from democratic and representative bodies and rest that decision-making in what were initially faceless bureaucracies but they have now, more or less, acquired a bit of a face.  We can now talk about these personalities.  People know who Wolfgang Sch&auml;uble and Mario Draghi are but that is problematic in itself.

On the other hand, if one looks at labour's share of national income, labour's share of national income around 1980 was about 71%, that is, of everything produced in Ireland, 71% of it went to the working class or those represented by the labour movement.

Use of the description is restricted to outside the State and for the following purposes: to market programmes of education and training provided by the authorised provider or research services of the authorised provider; and to enter into an arrangement with any person outside the State for the purpose of participating in a collaborative project relating to the provision of programmes of education, training or research services.<br\/><br\/>Section 3 provides for the review of the authorisation for use of the description by the Higher Education Authority, HEA, while section 4 provides for the withdrawal of the authorisation by the Minister on the grounds that it is not being used for its specified purposes or that the provider no longer fulfils the qualifying criteria for the application.

Amendment No. 4 provides that a review carried out by an t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s under section 3 of the Bill will include a review of the provider's compliance with any condition imposed by the Minister and provides that the Minister can direct a provider to comply with the conditions imposed by him or her.

There are no accounting procedures for schools that take voluntary contributions.

I understand what the Deputy is trying to achieve with his amendments, but we have concerns about how they would operate administratively as drafted.  With 4,000 schools in the system, a centralised analysis of the accounts of each school could become a large administrative burden for everyone involved.<\/p> <p>  While I do not propose to accept amendments Nos. 5 and 6, I assure the Deputies that information for parents, including on the collection and use of voluntary contributions, is an issue that the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, will examine in the context of the Department's work on developing plans for a parents and students charter.  The way the amendments are worded means that they would not be workable.  The aim in developing the charter is to strengthen the position of parents generally within our school system.  The charter is the appropriate place for such issues to be addressed rather than seeking to amend the Education Acts through this Bill.<\/p> <p>  In addition, the Deputies may be aware that the Government gave approval last March to the drafting of the education (admission to school) Bill.  The Bill is at an advanced stage of drafting and will be before the House shortly.  The aim in introducing proposals on school admissions is to improve admission policies and to ensure that the way schools decide on applications is structured, fair and transparent.  It is a concern that fees might be a factor in this regard.  The proposed legislation would prohibit the charging of any fee or contribution as part of a school's admissions process, which should go some way towards alleviating the Deputy's concerns.

When drafting legislation to give some structure to the situation, having it ruled out of order because it would be a cost to the Exchequer is frustrating.  By their nature, voluntary contributions are essential for many schools if they are to keep operating, given the cuts in capitation grants and elsewhere.  Many schools are struggling to meet their targets and balance the books.  However, there is significant pressure on parents to try to match those voluntary contributions.  In some schools I know, one has no access to a locker if a voluntary contribution is not paid.  I am sure this is replicated in many other schools outside my constituency.  While the contributions may be voluntary in theory, in practice many schools give the impression that they must be paid if a student is to receive the same level of service that others receive.  It is frustrating that we do not know how much schools are taking in in voluntary contributions or how that money is being spent.  There is no record-keeping in that regard.  I am sure that the money is somewhere in the overall financial records, but if parents are being asked to pay voluntary contributions towards the running of a school, safeguards need to be put in place in order that they can be assured that their contributions are being used for what they were intended.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015022600002#C00500","speaker":"984"},{"type":"speech","time":1424908800,"counter":1930,"content":"<p>The Minister has spoken on this matter a few times and is aware of it.

It relates to the evidence of estrangement needed to access Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, grants.  SUSI has done a great deal of work since its first year when it took over the processing of grants.  To be honest, that was a disaster.  Our committee discussed the Accenture report yesterday.  Many improvements have been made, but estrangement is probably the most common issue in respect of which people visit our offices.  It is difficult for students to prove that they are estranged from their parents.  The level of documentation required by SUSI goes above and beyond what many students are able to provide adequately.  We know of cases in which students who have proof from the Department of Social Protection that they are in receipt of payments at addresses that are not their parents' are still being asked for further information.  It seems that there is only a limited number of documents that SUSI will accept.  The amendment tries to expand the options available to students to prove that they are estranged by including information that is provided by advocacy workers, student unions, general practitioners and welfare officers.<\/p><p>I appreciate the concerns informing the Deputy's amendment.  We have discussed this issue in the D&aacute;il a couple of times during Question Time and so on.  The amendment relates mainly to cases in which students may need to be assessed independently of their parents' income.  The Minister has spoken on this issue once or twice and I have taken a debate on it on her behalf.  She has stated that she is taking a strong interest in examining this matter.<br\/><br\/>The Deputy stated that he has encountered quite a number of genuine cases of estrangement, but they are relatively rare.  Although they have a significant impact on individual students, each student has unique circumstances.  In that context and having carefully considered the amendment, I do not propose to accept it for a number of reasons.<br\/><br\/>Subsections 16(3)(<i>a<\/i>) to (<i>g<\/i>), inclusive, of the Student Support Act 2011 provide for the Minister to specify a class of applicant or criterion that may be considered in determining whether an applicant is a student of a particular class.  For example, the student grant scheme under SI 201 of 2014 provides in Article 21(3) for a dependent student to be exempted from having parents' income taken into account where it is established to the satisfaction of the relevant awarding authority that he or she is irreconcilably estranged from both parents and neither parent furnishes financial support to him or her.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Damien English:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=1781\"><img src=\"..\/images\/info.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Information on Deputy Damien English\"\/><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=committees&amp;amp;code=ED1&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=26\"><img src=\"..\/images\/zoom.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Zoom on Deputy Damien English\"\/><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I accept that the Deputy is concerned about satisfying the grant awarding authority in terms of the documents needed, but we do not need amending legislation to address that issue.  It can be addressed by the Minister who has said previously that she will look at it to see if further clarification is needed.  We do not need to do it by way of the amendment proposed.  <\/p><p> This provision allows the awarding authority to assess dependent students in genuine estrangement cases without reference to income or the address of their parents or guardians.  The provisions, as they stand, in the Student Support Act 2011 are sufficient to allow latitude in specifying additional classes of applicant and the criteria to be applied for such applicants, having regard to the resources available and subject to the consent of the Minister for Finance.  <\/p><p> The Minister for Education and Skills has said previously that she will look at this issue again and will work with the Deputy on it, but she does not believe an amendment is needed.  In effect, the proposed amendment would replicate a provision in section 16(3) of the Student Support Act 2011.  The option is already provided for in legislation.  It is up to the Deputy to decide what to do with his amendment, but we can address the issue without it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015022600002#C01200","speaker":"984","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424908800,"counter":1939,"content":"<p>I disagree with the Minister of State.  With all due respect, while the Minister may have discretion to specify the criteria to be applied, she has failed to do so to date.  The criteria are very strict.  I do not accept the Minister of State's view that the amendment is unnecessary.  It would specify the criteria and list the groups or bodies which could provide independent verification of estrangement.  We consider the Minister has no intention of listing such bodies or expanding the criteria.

The Prime Minister, Mr. David Cameron has promised a referendum on this question if he is returned to power following a general election.  The committee decided to examine this issue now in view of the potential impact on this country and on the many Irish citizens living in the United Kingdom.  Our discussion will focus on the Lisbon treaty protocols and the future of Irish opt-outs in the context of a UK exit from the EU and also on criminal justice issues such as EU policing and judicial co-operation.  Today we will hear from Professor Imelda Maher and Mr. Eugene Regan, SC.

I have been asked to speak about EU treaty protocols.  I sent the briefing notes to the clerk of the committee just before lunch.<br\/><br\/>I will briefly outline the most relevant protocols in respect of the relationship between Ireland and the UK.  The reason for doing this in the context of a discussion of BrExit is that they are primarily concerned with control of migration and borders.  Should the United Kingdom chose to leave the EU, the Northern Irish Border would become significant for the EU as it would become an external EU border.  This would then raise considerable challenges for the open borders policy between the United Kingdom and Ireland as articulated in the common travel area.  There are three protocols of note and another I will mention in passing.<br\/><br\/>First, Protocol 19 relates to the Schengen <i>acquis. <\/i>Schengen is an international convention designed to remove internal borders and establish a common external frontier.  This means it also establishes common visa, asylum and immigration policies.  Implementing measures known as the Schengen <i>acquis <\/i>were adopted on these policies and these were incorporated into the EU treaties and into EU law by the Amsterdam treaty, which is now part of EU law.  There are special rules for Ireland and the UK in regard to Schengen as the only two member states that have not signed the convention.  Others such as Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Romania have signed but are not fully incorporated into it.  The relationship between the UK and Ireland and the Schengen provisions is addressed mainly in Protocol 19.<br\/><br\/>Ireland and the United Kingdom - throughout my address I will refer to Ireland but members should read it as Ireland and the United Kingdom - may at any time request to take part in some or all of the Schengen <i>acquis.<\/i>The Council of Ministers decide on this request on the basis of unanimity of the Schengen member states and the requesting state.  The significance of this provision is that Ireland can only participate if the other member states agree to it unanimously.<br\/><br\/>Where Ireland has opted in to part of the Schengen <i>acquis<\/i>and a new proposal in that field is introduced, Ireland can give notice to the Council of Minister that it will opt out but can withdraw that notice at any time up to the adoption of the measure.  This opt-out is tempered by a set of procedures in Article 5 described as &quot;fiendish&quot; by Stephen Peers, a leading authority in the field.  The purpose of the procedures is to protect the coherence of the Schengen <i>acquis. <\/i>The risk for Ireland is that the underlying Schengen <i>acquis<\/i>could be dis-applied to it and Ireland would have to bear any direct financial consequences of this should the decision be that Ireland's opt-out from the amending measure would cause too much incoherence for the system.  Should Ireland chose to opt from an amending measure, having opted into it, the stakes are very high. <br\/><br\/>Protocol 20 recognises the special travel arrangements in place between Ireland and the United Kingdom.  It first recognises that the UK can continue to exercise border controls and then that the United Kingdom and Ireland can have special arrangements for the movement of people between them.  As long as this common travel area exists, then according to the protocol Ireland can also have border controls.<br\/><br\/>There are two consequences to note from this.  First, as Protocol 20 states, the other member states can impose border checks on people coming from Ireland and the United Kingdom.  Members no doubt have experienced this when they travelled to the Schengen area.  Second, the exemption for Ireland to impose border controls only applies as long as the UK and Ireland maintain their common travel area.  This is important should the UK exit the EU.<br\/><br\/>Protocol 21, a protocol on freedom, security and justice, provides an opt-in for the UK and Ireland in regard to measures adopted under an EU court's rulings on Title V Part III of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, that is the measures adopted in regard to the creation of the area of freedom, security and justice, AFSJ, dealing with border checks, asylum, immigration, judicial co-operation in civil and criminal matters and police co-operation.  This is different from the Schengen Protocol, as the UK and Ireland have a right to opt-in.<br\/><br\/>Ireland notifies the President of the Council of Ministers in writing within three months of a proposal going to Council that it wants to take part.  Its participation cannot be vetoed.  Even if Ireland does not participate in the measure, it can subsequently opt-in with the Commission outlining to the Council what arrangements are necessary for Ireland to comply with the measure.  Note, a measure can be adopted after a reasonable time without Ireland or the UK, even if they have notified of their wish to opt in, if in practical terms it is not possible to adopt the measure with them taking part.<br\/><br\/>Where the UK or Ireland opt-out of a measure, then the Council holds a full discussion of the possible effects of such non-participation.  Any member state can ask the Commission to examine the situation on the basis of Article 116 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.  Under this provision if the Commission thinks a member state's laws, administrative practices or procedures are distorting competition in the internal market and that distortion needs to be eliminated then the Commission consults the member state.  If the consultation does not work, then directives or any other appropriate measures can be adopted under the ordinary legislative procedure.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Professor Imelda Maher:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->What this means is that an opt-out decision, in what I believe would be fairly exceptional circumstances, may lead to legislation being adopted if the decision is deemed to distort competition in the internal market.  The reason for this opt-out for Ireland seems to have been driven by concerns about the integrity of the common law system and differences with the civil law traditions dominant in other member states and by the fact the UK was going to opt out.<br\/><br\/>Ireland in, declaration 56, affirms its commitment to the AFSJ and indicates it will participate to the maximum extent.  Ireland can, at any time, notify the Council in writing that it no longer wishes to be covered by this protocol, and if it does so then the normal treaty provisions apply.  This protocol is not applicable to Ireland in regard to Article 75 on the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which sets down rules on freezing funds and financial assets in order to combat and prevent terrorism.<br\/><br\/>What is the relationship between these protocols?  The question of whether a measure is part of Schengen or the AFSJ is significant because, if the Schengen agreement applies, Ireland does not have a right to opt in, which it does have in regard to the AFSJ.  There is a substantive overlap, however, between the Schengen <i>acquis<\/i>and Title V, Part III, and this has been litigated before the European Court of Justice, by the UK in particular.  An example is case C-137\/05 on Frontex.<br\/><br\/>If a measure is covered by the Schengen <i>acquis<\/i>, then it is governed by the Schengen protocol.  What has happened is that the court has interpreted this relatively broadly to include complementary measures, that is, any measure that &ldquo;builds on&rdquo; the <i>acquis<\/i>.  The term &ldquo;builds on&rdquo; is one that would give a lawyer nightmares because it is very fuzzy.  It means the precise nature of the relationship between the two protocols is not entirely clear.<br\/><br\/>Let us consider the UK opt-out protocol in passing.  Under Protocol 36, governing transitional provisions, the UK had the choice to opt out of pre-Treaty of Lisbon measures on police and judicial co-operation within five years.  As members are probably well aware, it did so and now has opted back in to a large number of measures, the most important of which for Ireland is the European arrest warrant.  Ireland did not have this opt-out in the treaty.<br\/><br\/>The next topic is Ireland and the protocols.  Laffan and O'Mahony suggest that Ireland and the UK have opted into measures on civil co-operation, asylum and irregular migration but to a limited extent on visas, border controls and legal migration.  They participate in almost all criminal and policing provisions of Schengen and in respect of irregular migration.  I have three thoughts on this.  First, as the common travel area is significant for relations between the UK and Ireland, it might be worth considering what Mr. Justice Hogan had to say about it in Pachero<i>v<\/i>. the Minister for Justice and Equality in 2011.  At one point, he referred to the &ldquo;legal archaeology&rdquo; required to get to the bottom of the common travel area:<blockquote>While in theory both Irish and British citizens are entitled to arrive here free from immigration control by virtue of the common travel area, increasingly in practice such passengers who arrive by air from the UK are required to produce their passports (or, at least, some other form of acceptable identity document) in order to prove to immigration officers that they are either Irish or British citizens who can avail of the common travel area. Whatever about anyone else, Joseph Heller [who, as members know, wrote <i>Catch-22<\/i>] certainly would have approved.<\/blockquote>This suggests greater clarity on the common travel area would be desirable.<br\/><br\/>Second, if the UK exits the EU, regard has to be given to a three-way dynamic: the relationship between Ireland and the EU, the relationship between Ireland and the UK, and the relationship between the UK and the EU.  It might be useful in this regard to consider the analogy, albeit imperfect, of the Nordic Passport Union and the Nordic Police Cooperation Agreement, whereby free movement is ensured for Norway and Iceland with the other Nordic countries although they are not in the EU.  However, they are in Schengen, which the UK is unlikely to join in an EU exit scenario.<br\/><br\/>Third, these two comments suggest a mini-Schengen may be the best way forward for the UK and Ireland should the UK leave the EU.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015022600002#B00200","speaker":"957","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424908800,"counter":1972,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Maher.<\/p> <p>  I welcome back Mr. Eugene Regan.  He is on familiar territory.  I invite him to address the committee, after which we will bank questions.<\/p><p>I thank the Chairman.  It is very nice to be at the meeting.  It is much more comfortable sitting on the other side of the room, but here goes.<br\/><br\/>I have been asked to address the issue of the co-operation in policing and criminal matters in the context of a UK withdrawal from the EU and the consequences it might have for this area.  I do not believe the UK will withdraw from the EU.  Recent experience in this very area of policing and criminal law matters might serve as a guide to how the debate on UK withdrawal will crystallise.  The reality is that there was a furore in the UK regarding the European arrest warrant, other matters concerning policing and EU criminal law matters.  It centred on the European arrest warrant and the frailties in the framework decision adopted in 2002.  There was criticism of other aspects of that area.  When the UK Government chose to exercise the blackout option, provided in the Lisbon treaty and to which Professor Maher has referred, and thus withdrew from approximately 130 measures, it recognised the reality of the matter and the importance of the measures to policing and internal security in the UK.  It chose to opt back in to 35 of the key measures.  This demonstrates that, notwithstanding the reservations in the UK about the EU, it has the capacity and pragmatism to recognise that it is in its own interest to work within the EU framework.<br\/><br\/>Let me give a little historical background on the policing and criminal law area.  Historically, Ireland and the UK were on opposing sides.  The great debates of the early years of membership were mainly on the Common Agricultural Policy and disputes about green pounds and devaluations.  However, in the area of policing and criminal law matters, the two countries followed the same path, as we did in regard to asylum and immigration.  There is no area in which the two countries have co-operated as closely as in this area.  This co-operation dates back to 1972, the year of the Munich Olympics outrage.  The TREVI group was formed, and the UK and Ireland were involved in that when it was set up at the European Council meeting in Rome in 1975.  The European arrest warrant was introduced after the events of 11 September 2001.  The British Home Secretary suggested the idea of mutual recognition.<br\/><br\/>The UK contribution in this area has been very important.  We have worked alongside the UK because of the common law tradition and concerns about how development in this area would affect the common law system.  Bearing in mind the process involving the Maastricht, Amsterdam and Lisbon treaties, one notes it is only at the time of the production of the Lisbon treaty that this area was brought into the first pillar of the EU and made subject to the full involvement of all the institutions, that is, the Commission proposing legislation, parliamentary co-decision and, of course, the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.  There was a delay in respect of the latter.  It was five years after the introduction of the Lisbon treaty that the European Court of Justice was to have full jurisdiction in this area.  Hence the move to qualified majority voting and the European Court of Justice jurisdiction.  This is why the UK chose to extend the Protocol 21 opt-out to the criminal law area.  Ireland followed suit.  Members will remember there was a debate in the Seanad and D&aacute;il on this when Ireland decided to follow the UK on this.  It was opposed by the Opposition but there was a compromise, which was that the opt-out would be reviewed after five years.  That review has taken place.<br\/><br\/>The UK opt-out is entirely different, however.  Protocol 36, a decision to opt out <i>en bloc<\/i>from all new measures, was exercised by the UK Government in 2013.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Mr. Eugene Regan:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That was announced by the UK Government on 24 July 2013.  At the same time, it identified a number of key measures it wished to opt back into.  That was adopted last November and passed by the House of Commons.  However, what is fundamentally important in this is the Irish influence in that debate and the fact that it was highlighted by the Irish Government that the consequences of the UK exercising this opt-out and not opting back into the European arrest warrant, in particular, and into other measures would create fundamental difficulties for co-operation between the two countries, not only in the area fighting crime but, especially, the area of terrorism and in the context of Northern Ireland.  That had a very persuasive effect in ensuring that the House of Commons voted through the measures to opt back into the 35 measures, including the European arrest warrant.<br\/><br\/>There has always been a concern in Ireland - Professor Imelda Maher identified it - in regard to our common law system and this is why Ireland chose to apply protocol 21 to policing and criminal matters.  The reality is that since that extension, Ireland has opted into the vast majority of measures.  In terms of those into which we have not opted, it is not for reasons that go to our criminal law system, or our particular common law system, but it has more to do with organisation and administration.  After five years, it has become apparent that protocol 21 is not really necessary in terms of protecting the features of our criminal law system, which were initially of concern.<br\/><br\/>When I say that the United Kingdom has recognised the importance of the measures in policing and criminal law, there was a House of Lords report on the issue of the opt-out in 2004.  Many representations were made to the House of Lords, in particular in regard to the European arrest warrant but also on the whole range of measures.  The conclusion of that report was that opting out of policing and criminal justice measures would have significant adverse negative repercussions for the internal security of, and the administration of criminal justice in, the UK.There was a recognition in the UK of the importance of these measures and of the <i>acquis<\/i>, as it were, in all of this, and that it was important to the UK itself.<br\/><br\/>Professor John Spencer, who is an expert in this whole area, considered that if the opt-out and opting back in were to go ahead, which is the case, that would essentially be a purely paper exercise.  He suggested the opt-out would make no difference whatsoever because the key measures were included in the measures to which the United Kingdom was opting back into.  After 40 years of progress and treaty changes, which reflect the common concerns of member states in the area of organised crime, terrorism and the importance, at a European level, of co-operation in the detection, investigation and prosecution of crime, the UK recognised that for it to exit out of these areas was a leap in the dark and was not in its interests.  <br\/><br\/>In the event of a UK exit, which is theoretical question, and whether it is a real question will depend on the May general election, a void will not be created.  The fact is that Article 50 of the Treaty of European Union provides specifically for a mechanism for withdrawal of any member state.  It specifically states that the Union shall  negotiate and conclude an agreement with that state, setting out the arrangements for its withdrawal and taking account of the framework for its future relationship with the European Union.  In addition,  the treaty shall cease to apply to that state in question from the date of entry into force of the withdrawal, so even in the extreme situation of a withdrawal, it would have to be an orderly one.  The UK is bound by the treaties until such time as such an exit would happen and to enter into an agreement providing for that procedure for withdrawal.<br\/><br\/>If there was a UK withdrawal it would not just affect the criminal law areas but it would also affect the civil law area, in particular there are specific regulations, for example, on the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters.  There are also the European accounts preservation orders.  All of these are very important measures in the civil law field but they fall into this rubric and chapter in regard to criminal law.<br\/><br\/>If there was not an orderly withdrawal, the question of the arrangements would arise.  Would individual member states, like Ireland, have to enter into bilateral treaties with the UK?  One would have to have serious doubts that would be possible because the EU now has a competence in this area of policing and criminal law matters and I do not think member states would be at liberty to enter into bilateral arrangements.  It would be a recipe for disaster if there were no orderly procedures for an exit in that unlikely event.<br\/><br\/>Prime Minister David Cameron is reported recently as saying that people would rather have a choice between staying in a reformed Europe or getting out rather than the false choice of today which is to stay in Europe with which they are not satisfied or to leave.  The issue and the agenda is more reform and renegotiation of certain terms of the existing treaties.  In terms of terms of the criminal law area, even though the EU arrest warrant has been a topical political potato in the United Kingdom, it is more to do with immigration and welfare tourism.  That is where the focus of any re-negotiation seems to be moving.  <br\/><br\/>Ireland's position has been made clear by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Taoiseach that Ireland's interests lie in the UK remaining within the EU.  In the area of policing and criminal law matters, as common law countries, there is no doubt about the common interest we have in shaping EU policies in this area and working within the framework which has been created by the EU over the past 40 years.<br\/><br\/>In terms of reform, the criticisms of the European arrest warrant by the UK and in the political debates which have occurred are not entirely unjustified.  It was an instrument adopted rather hurriedly after 9\/11.  It is not perfect legislation and it has created considerable problems in terms of excessive usage and the protection of persons who are extradited.  Even though it has worked effectively and efficiently, there is scope for revising and improvement of that instrument.  Those types of reforms might resolve many of the issues that might arise, and have arisen, in regard to the issue of UK withdrawal from the EU.  <br\/><br\/>I will leave it at that.  I hope I have not exceeded my time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015022600002#C00200","speaker":"957","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424908800,"counter":1975,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Regan.

It is almost a fog, an if-and-but situation being repeated constantly.  Although some people have told us there will definitely be a referendum, we do not know if there will be because the Prime Minister, David Cameron, must get an overall majority.  We have been examining whether it is possible.  The politicians in Northern Ireland will have a role, particularly the Unionists, given that Sinn F&eacute;in, as eurosceptics, will presumably opt out of the debate.  Maybe Sinn F&eacute;in might opt in, for the first time, in addressing a very serious issue in the European context.  There is also a potential role for Scotland.  It is very difficult to address the implications of England opting out of Europe.  Is it possible to bring the UK out of Europe?  What, precisely, are the reforms?<\/p> <p>  The process would take years.  First, Mr. Cameron would have to win an overall majority in the election, after which some sort of negotiations could start.  Presumably, it would take years for the British Parliament to debate the exact reforms they are seeking.  Then, there would be a long debate in Europe on whether or not it is possible.  If the EU concedes, the unravelling or opting out would take years.  I do not want to be disrespectful to anybody.  We have regular representation from the British Embassy at these meetings.  The British ambassador might convey to Mr. Cameron that the committee had deliberated on the issue and that speaker after speaker after speaker had pointed out that the negative effects for Great Britain and Ireland would be so damning that Mr. Cameron should review his position.<\/p> <p>  Situations have evolved recently.  Ireland was way ahead of the British when we extended employment rights to citizens of Romania and Bulgaria, and the British went ballistic about these so-called \"welfare tourists\".  We saw what happened at the airports when they were all coming for work.  The Irish Government has just created 70,000 new Irish from 160 countries in the world.  It is widely accepted internationally that immigrants are incredibly productive and involved in seeking employment and that they do not come to sponge on the welfare system.  Switzerland recently held a referendum on immigration and passed a law to restrict immigration using quotas.  Since then, they have realised it is not operable.  Would it be worth reminding the British of this?<\/p> <p>  The Acting Chairman mentioned the House of Lords, for which I have great respect, and this provoked me into thinking that it does an extremely good job of analysing the EU process.  Maybe, at the end of the whole set of debates, we should engage with the House of Lords on the issue.  Of all the intellectuals and business people who have come here to discuss this, not one has predicted a positive outcome from what the UK intends to do.  I would like us to compile all our documentation and go to the House of Lords and engage with them, or invite them here to engage with us.  We must engage with them in order to achieve clarity at the end of this debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015022600002#E00200","speaker":"1030"},{"type":"speech","time":1424908800,"counter":1978,"content":"<p>I will go back to basics.

The reason the UK would not consider entering Schengen was the immigration aspect of it.  Given that I am not an expert in European law, protocol 21 is new to me.  From both presentations, it appears that it covers many of the areas that Schengen covers.  Both Ireland and the UK have a right to opt into it and the UK has opted into a number of the areas.

Anybody listening to this on television would wonder what Professor Maher meant by it.  Both witnesses mentioned the issue of civil and common law jurisdictions and suggested that, given that both Ireland and the UK are common law countries, we should remain together in a common law bloc.

In regard to protocols, the people who drew them up in the first place did not intend to make it easy to either exit from or opt into them.  Opting out after opting in is obviously a very complicated process.  The area of policing and criminal law is hugely complicated and it could waste a considerable amount of European time.<\/p> <p>  A new European structure will emerge in the event of an exit.  It could change irrevocably the entire European architecture, based as it is on provisions made in the past, the expectations at the foundation of the European Union and, in particular, the expectations of the founding fathers of the European Union.  It would virtually impossible to reconstruct Europe if one country were to opt out, possibly followed by other countries.<\/p> <p>  Several members referred to the existence of euroscepticism.  The committee is examining that issue separately to understand the real reasons for it, and not simply the reasons that happen to be convenient at any particular time.  It remains to be seen how that issue can be addressed but, like other issues, it will have huge implications for the European Union.<\/p> <p>  Taking into account the protocols and the issue of policing and criminal law, the creation of a new border in the event of the UK opting out will have serious implications for trade and travel.  It has been suggested that Ireland could also opt out.  I shudder to think of some of the ideas that have been put forward as reasonable.  They are not reasonable.  Sadly, this debate is taking place against the backdrop of a serious economic downturn across Europe.  The discussions that take place in that sort of environment are not necessarily the best in terms of long-term planning.  Europe has a tragic history in that regard and all of us should do what we can to avoid reaping that whirlwind.<\/p><p>I will begin, and if I miss any points I ask members to come back to me.  On the question of the Six Counties and the implications of having a border with the free trade area, a British exit would require provision to be made for a common travel area, but it might be a difficult task to maintain it in that new context.  In regard to the unified patent court and where its institutions are to be located, the best answer is that the European police training college was supposed to be located in the United Kingdom but I understand that is no longer being proposed.  That may a fallout from the furore that has emerged in the area of justice, policing and criminal law.<\/p><p> In regard to Deputy Byrne's comments on the general election in the UK, of course it is a theoretical question, and the issue will only crystallise after the election.  There is also a Scottish dimension.  There might be another referendum in Scotland should the United Kingdom exit the EU.  There is no clear indication as to what the UK Government wants, but David Cameron has at times indicated that out of the four freedoms, he wants to make changes in regard to the free movement of labour and people.  Other countries have a problem with such changes because the relevant provisions were embedded in the European Union from its outset.  It is also important for Ireland and Irish people living in the UK that there be no impediment to free movement.  The focus has turned to the notion of welfare tourism and the benefits attributed to workers when they move between member states.  Angela Merkel indicated that she was open to considering measures in that regard.  This type of response may help to diffuse many of the issues that have arisen.<\/p><p> Schengen is a tricky area.  It was Tony Blair who decided that the UK should be seen to be more positive towards Europe at a particular point in time and, while not opting into Schengen, the UK opted into the policing and criminal law provisions of Schengen.  We followed suit.  Schengen was brought into the European Union under the Maastricht treaty, but there remains a set of Schengen measures in criminal law and policing - please do not ask me to list them - which we have opted into without also opting into other normal post-Lisbon treaty measures on criminal law.  It is a very complex area.  We have opted into that aspect of the Schengen Agreement but not into the free movement aspects.<\/p><p> In regard to the impact of changing security provisions on the debate about co-operation on criminal law, we have seen that time and again.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Mr. Eugene Regan:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The Olympic Games massacre gave rise to the setting up by the member states of the TREVI group, which attempted to exchange information and have countries work together in this area. The 9-11 attacks resulted in the adoption of the European Arrest Warrant.  The warrant worked effectively in the more recent London bombings to extradite the responsible parties from Italy, and they were convicted in the UK.  Those types of thing do change.  Denmark is looking at the exercise of a protocol similar to Ireland, and the recent terrorist acts in the country may have an impact on that.  That always has an impact.  The criminal justice area and the EAW are not the real concern about the Union in the UK.  Some changes are needed and those concerns could be assuaged.  Free movement, immigration and what is termed \"welfare tourism\" are the kernel of the concern.<\/p><p> There was a question about the European Court of Human Rights.

He points out that 25% of Northern Ireland's non-UK trade is with Ireland.  We have been talking a great deal about people, but the customs question is also important.  He also notes the dividend from the peace agreements.  A total of &euro;150 million in grants will be given to Northern Ireland by the EU between 2014 and 2020.  I suspect, given the Deputy's comment about how long all this will take, that this money will be spent before the UK has left the EU, but it is still a sizeable sum.  There is also the issue of cross-Border workers.  Many people move between North and South and there is significant commercial activity around the Border.  Professor Phinnemore's concern is that there is not enough discussion about the Northern Irish dimension in the Great Britain debate because it is so small relative to the rest of the UK.  Nonetheless, that raises issues, particularly in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  The other context that ties into that is the negotiations around TTIP and CETA.  The free trade agreements with the US and Canada need to be factored into the trade and commercial aspect of this debate.<\/p> <p>  There will be a referendum, but there are two kinds of referendum on Europe in the UK context.  One is the political promise by the current Prime Minister to hold a referendum should he be elected following the next election, and that is what is focusing the mind.  That is the Brexit dimension, with which we are concerned.  However, there is also the EU Act from 2011, which guarantees a referendum in the event of substantial treaty change in the Union.  Mr. Cameron has been doing his best to avoid getting embroiled with that legislation, but that avoidance can only last for so long.  That is not particular to the current government; it would have to be dealt with by any government.  At some point, the UK will have to bite the bullet on that.  That legislation is complicated, with lists of items that have to be included in order to decide, but it will trigger a referendum at some point.  I hope that is clear enough.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the patent court, location can shift.  I hope that is not complicated.  I had not realised they were going to be there.<\/p> <p>  We are cognisant of the idea of the weakening of relations across the UK and the disintegrating union after the Scottish referendum, and this needs to be factored in, especially if Scotland votes \"Yes\".  Professor Sionaidh Douglas-Scott, a Scottish national based in Oxford, has written about this and reflected on it considerably.  It might be necessary to talk to the Scots as well as to the House of Lords.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy's point about this taking years is important, and my advice to the committee would be not to let it take years and years.  Ireland has a particular voice to present in the EU context should the UK vote to exit and one of the statements Ireland will want to make is that Article 50 should not drag on, so that the exit takes too long, because it  will pay a higher price for a delay than any other country.  That is a fair comment to make in this context.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015022600002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Imelda Maher"},{"type":"speech","time":1424908800,"counter":1988,"content":"<p>There was a suggestion, which I ran with, that business needs certainty for investment in England.

I remember being in Brussels at a meeting just before the economic downturn really hit.  Many economic and legal experts were there and there were predictions of doom and gloom all around the place.  As a nation, we were being blamed for a lot of the woes that had befallen the entire EU, though there were other people who blamed the European Union for all the woes that had fallen on Ireland.  Some things do not change.  It was pointed out that the real problem was the inflexibility of the European Central Bank <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>exchange rates in a context where no country could devalue.  There was a theory that the euro was overvalued, which it probably was at the time, but it was also said that each member state had no control.  This was not true because they could have introduced currency controls at any time they wanted.  The theory opposing that was based on the belief that to do so in a particular way would cause an implosion but that did not happen.  We have currency controls now, as well as a reduction in the value of the euro so all those issues should appear resolved.  <br\/><br\/>The fundamental problem for the future of the EU is the degree to which individual member states seem to look at themselves and see that the Union is no longer in accord with their views and ambitions.  The question then arises as to whether their ambitions are in accord with the Union.  The conclusion they come to is that a loose economic arrangement is the ideal scenario for the future.  However, they forget that such a thing existed before the EU and it was deemed not to have worked.<br\/><br\/>No matter which way we look at this situation it is not a good place to be.  There are serious implications for Ireland, for Britain and for the EU.  It behoves all of us to apply ourselves to identify how the issues that are causing the concern can best be resolved.  The founding fathers of the EU had a different vision altogether and they were clear as to what they wanted.  They had history close to their elbow when they made their decisions and that was a very convincing factor for people at the time.

The use of the description is restricted in its geographical application and the purpose for which it can be used.  Use of the description is restricted to outside the State and for the following purposes: to market programmes of education and training provided by the authorised provider or research services of the authorised provider; and to enter into an arrangement with any person outside the State for the purpose of participating in a collaborative project relating to the provision of programmes of education, training or research services.<br\/><br\/>Section 3 provides for the review of the authorisation for use of the description by the Higher Education Authority, HEA, while section 4 provides for the withdrawal of the authorisation by the Minister on the grounds that it is not being used for its specified purposes or that the provider no longer fulfils the qualifying criteria for the application.  Section 5 provides for an appeals board to hear appeals relating to the Minister's decision to refuse a grant of authorisation or to withdraw an authorisation.<br\/><br\/>Following on from the discussion in the Seanad, amendments Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, are being introduced to allow the Minister, when granting a university authorisation, to impose such additional conditions on the provider concerned as the Minister believes appropriate.  The provider will be required to comply with these conditions, although amendment No. 3 provides that the provider can appeal against the imposition of these conditions to the appeals board provided for under section 5.  Amendment No. 4 provides that a review carried out by an t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s under section 3 of the Bill will include a review of the provider's compliance with any condition imposed by the Minister and provides that the Minister can direct a provider to comply with the conditions imposed by him or her.  Therefore, the amendments will allow the Minister to put in place additional safeguards to ensure any provider that receives university authorisation is operating to the highest standards.

They find it difficult to match voluntary contributions.  By their nature, the contributions are meant to be voluntary, but the reality is that the impression given by schools is that there is an onus on parents to pay them.  There are no accounting procedures for schools that take voluntary contributions.  Some schools in my constituency have 500 pupils, all of whose parents pay in excess of &euro;100, but no one knows whether the money is being used to pay bills, buy equipment or so on.  My amendments are meant to give some structure to the situation.  I know that the Minister of State will not accept them, but the Government must examine the issue.

I understand what the Deputy is trying to achieve with his amendments, but we have concerns about how they would operate administratively as drafted.  With 4,000 schools in the system, a centralised analysis of the accounts of each school could become a large administrative burden for everyone involved.<\/p> <p>  While I do not propose to accept amendments Nos. 5 and 6, I assure the Deputies that information for parents, including on the collection and use of voluntary contributions, is an issue that the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, will examine in the context of the Department's work on developing plans for a parents and students charter.  The way the amendments are worded means that they would not be workable.  The aim in developing the charter is to strengthen the position of parents generally within our school system.  The charter is the appropriate place for such issues to be addressed rather than seeking to amend the Education Acts through this Bill.<\/p> <p>  In addition, the Deputies may be aware that the Government gave approval last March to the drafting of the education (admission to school) Bill.  The Bill is at an advanced stage of drafting and will be before the House shortly.  The aim in introducing proposals on school admissions is to improve admission policies and to ensure that the way schools decide on applications is structured, fair and transparent.  It is a concern that fees might be a factor in this regard.  The proposed legislation would prohibit the charging of any fee or contribution as part of a school's admissions process, which should go some way towards alleviating the Deputy's concerns.  Other issues will be dealt with in the charter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED12015022600002#C00400","speaker":"1078"},{"type":"speech","time":1424946600,"counter":2025,"content":"<p>I appreciate that this Bill is not the place to do that, but it is an opportunity for us to put the matter on the agenda again.  When drafting legislation to give some structure to the situation, having it ruled out of order because it would be a cost to the Exchequer is frustrating.  By their nature, voluntary contributions are essential for many schools if they are to keep operating, given the cuts in capitation grants and elsewhere.  Many schools are struggling to meet their targets and balance the books.  However, there is significant pressure on parents to try to match those voluntary contributions.  In some schools I know, one has no access to a locker if a voluntary contribution is not paid.  I am sure this is replicated in many other schools outside my constituency.  While the contributions may be voluntary in theory, in practice many schools give the impression that they must be paid if a student is to receive the same level of service that others receive.  It is frustrating that we do not know how much schools are taking in in voluntary contributions or how that money is being spent.  There is no record-keeping in that regard.  I am sure that the money is somewhere in the overall financial records, but if parents are being asked to pay voluntary contributions towards the running of a school, safeguards need to be put in place in order that they can be assured that their contributions are being used for what they were intended.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED12015022600002#C00500","speaker":"984"},{"type":"speech","time":1424946600,"counter":2026,"content":"<p>The Minister has spoken on this matter a few times and is aware of it.

It relates to the evidence of estrangement needed to access Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, grants.  SUSI has done a great deal of work since its first year when it took over the processing of grants.  To be honest, that was a disaster.  Our committee discussed the Accenture report yesterday.  Many improvements have been made, but estrangement is probably the most common issue in respect of which people visit our offices.  It is difficult for students to prove that they are estranged from their parents.  The level of documentation required by SUSI goes above and beyond what many students are able to provide adequately.  We know of cases in which students who have proof from the Department of Social Protection that they are in receipt of payments at addresses that are not their parents' are still being asked for further information.  It seems that there is only a limited number of documents that SUSI will accept.  The amendment tries to expand the options available to students to prove that they are estranged by including information that is provided by advocacy workers, student unions, general practitioners and welfare officers.<\/p><p>I appreciate the concerns informing the Deputy's amendment.  We have discussed this issue in the D&aacute;il a couple of times during Question Time and so on.  The amendment relates mainly to cases in which students may need to be assessed independently of their parents' income.  The Minister has spoken on this issue once or twice and I have taken a debate on it on her behalf.  She has stated that she is taking a strong interest in examining this matter.<br\/><br\/>The Deputy stated that he has encountered quite a number of genuine cases of estrangement, but they are relatively rare.  Although they have a significant impact on individual students, each student has unique circumstances.  In that context and having carefully considered the amendment, I do not propose to accept it for a number of reasons.<br\/><br\/>Subsections 16(3)(<i>a<\/i>) to (<i>g<\/i>), inclusive, of the Student Support Act 2011 provide for the Minister to specify a class of applicant or criterion that may be considered in determining whether an applicant is a student of a particular class.  For example, the student grant scheme under SI 201 of 2014 provides in Article 21(3) for a dependent student to be exempted from having parents' income taken into account where it is established to the satisfaction of the relevant awarding authority that he or she is irreconcilably estranged from both parents and neither parent furnishes financial support to him or her.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Damien English:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=1781\"><img src=\"..\/images\/info.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Information on Deputy Damien English\"\/><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=committees&amp;amp;code=ED1&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=26\"><img src=\"..\/images\/zoom.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Zoom on Deputy Damien English\"\/><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I accept that the Deputy is concerned about satisfying the grant awarding authority in terms of the documents needed, but we do not need amending legislation to address that issue.  It can be addressed by the Minister who has said previously that she will look at it to see if further clarification is needed.  We do not need to do it by way of the amendment proposed.  <\/p><p> This provision allows the awarding authority to assess dependent students in genuine estrangement cases without reference to income or the address of their parents or guardians.  The provisions, as they stand, in the Student Support Act 2011 are sufficient to allow latitude in specifying additional classes of applicant and the criteria to be applied for such applicants, having regard to the resources available and subject to the consent of the Minister for Finance.  <\/p><p> The Minister for Education and Skills has said previously that she will look at this issue again and will work with the Deputy on it, but she does not believe an amendment is needed.  In effect, the proposed amendment would replicate a provision in section 16(3) of the Student Support Act 2011.  The option is already provided for in legislation.  It is up to the Deputy to decide what to do with his amendment, but we can address the issue without it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED12015022600002#C01200","speaker":"984","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424946600,"counter":2035,"content":"<p>I disagree with the Minister of State.

The Prime Minister, Mr. David Cameron has promised a referendum on this question if he is returned to power following a general election.  The committee decided to examine this issue now in view of the potential impact on this country and on the many Irish citizens living in the United Kingdom.  Our discussion will focus on the Lisbon treaty protocols and the future of Irish opt-outs in the context of a UK exit from the EU and also on criminal justice issues such as EU policing and judicial co-operation.  Today we will hear from Professor Imelda Maher and Mr. Eugene Regan, SC.

I have been asked to speak about EU treaty protocols.  I sent the briefing notes to the clerk of the committee just before lunch.<br\/><br\/>I will briefly outline the most relevant protocols in respect of the relationship between Ireland and the UK.  The reason for doing this in the context of a discussion of BrExit is that they are primarily concerned with control of migration and borders.  Should the United Kingdom chose to leave the EU, the Northern Irish Border would become significant for the EU as it would become an external EU border.  This would then raise considerable challenges for the open borders policy between the United Kingdom and Ireland as articulated in the common travel area.  There are three protocols of note and another I will mention in passing.<br\/><br\/>First, Protocol 19 relates to the Schengen <i>acquis. <\/i>Schengen is an international convention designed to remove internal borders and establish a common external frontier.  This means it also establishes common visa, asylum and immigration policies.  Implementing measures known as the Schengen <i>acquis <\/i>were adopted on these policies and these were incorporated into the EU treaties and into EU law by the Amsterdam treaty, which is now part of EU law.  There are special rules for Ireland and the UK in regard to Schengen as the only two member states that have not signed the convention.  Others such as Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Romania have signed but are not fully incorporated into it.  The relationship between the UK and Ireland and the Schengen provisions is addressed mainly in Protocol 19.<br\/><br\/>Ireland and the United Kingdom - throughout my address I will refer to Ireland but members should read it as Ireland and the United Kingdom - may at any time request to take part in some or all of the Schengen <i>acquis.<\/i>The Council of Ministers decide on this request on the basis of unanimity of the Schengen member states and the requesting state.  The significance of this provision is that Ireland can only participate if the other member states agree to it unanimously.<br\/><br\/>Where Ireland has opted in to part of the Schengen <i>acquis<\/i>and a new proposal in that field is introduced, Ireland can give notice to the Council of Minister that it will opt out but can withdraw that notice at any time up to the adoption of the measure.  This opt-out is tempered by a set of procedures in Article 5 described as &quot;fiendish&quot; by Stephen Peers, a leading authority in the field.  The purpose of the procedures is to protect the coherence of the Schengen <i>acquis. <\/i>The risk for Ireland is that the underlying Schengen <i>acquis<\/i>could be dis-applied to it and Ireland would have to bear any direct financial consequences of this should the decision be that Ireland's opt-out from the amending measure would cause too much incoherence for the system.  Should Ireland chose to opt from an amending measure, having opted into it, the stakes are very high. <br\/><br\/>Protocol 20 recognises the special travel arrangements in place between Ireland and the United Kingdom.  It first recognises that the UK can continue to exercise border controls and then that the United Kingdom and Ireland can have special arrangements for the movement of people between them.  As long as this common travel area exists, then according to the protocol Ireland can also have border controls.<br\/><br\/>There are two consequences to note from this.  First, as Protocol 20 states, the other member states can impose border checks on people coming from Ireland and the United Kingdom.  Members no doubt have experienced this when they travelled to the Schengen area.  Second, the exemption for Ireland to impose border controls only applies as long as the UK and Ireland maintain their common travel area.  This is important should the UK exit the EU.<br\/><br\/>Protocol 21, a protocol on freedom, security and justice, provides an opt-in for the UK and Ireland in regard to measures adopted under an EU court's rulings on Title V Part III of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, that is the measures adopted in regard to the creation of the area of freedom, security and justice, AFSJ, dealing with border checks, asylum, immigration, judicial co-operation in civil and criminal matters and police co-operation.  This is different from the Schengen Protocol, as the UK and Ireland have a right to opt-in.<br\/><br\/>Ireland notifies the President of the Council of Ministers in writing within three months of a proposal going to Council that it wants to take part.  Its participation cannot be vetoed.  Even if Ireland does not participate in the measure, it can subsequently opt-in with the Commission outlining to the Council what arrangements are necessary for Ireland to comply with the measure.  Note, a measure can be adopted after a reasonable time without Ireland or the UK, even if they have notified of their wish to opt in, if in practical terms it is not possible to adopt the measure with them taking part.<br\/><br\/>Where the UK or Ireland opt-out of a measure, then the Council holds a full discussion of the possible effects of such non-participation.  Any member state can ask the Commission to examine the situation on the basis of Article 116 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.  Under this provision if the Commission thinks a member state's laws, administrative practices or procedures are distorting competition in the internal market and that distortion needs to be eliminated then the Commission consults the member state.  If the consultation does not work, then directives or any other appropriate measures can be adopted under the ordinary legislative procedure.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Professor Imelda Maher:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->What this means is that an opt-out decision, in what I believe would be fairly exceptional circumstances, may lead to legislation being adopted if the decision is deemed to distort competition in the internal market.  The reason for this opt-out for Ireland seems to have been driven by concerns about the integrity of the common law system and differences with the civil law traditions dominant in other member states and by the fact the UK was going to opt out.<br\/><br\/>Ireland in, declaration 56, affirms its commitment to the AFSJ and indicates it will participate to the maximum extent.  Ireland can, at any time, notify the Council in writing that it no longer wishes to be covered by this protocol, and if it does so then the normal treaty provisions apply.  This protocol is not applicable to Ireland in regard to Article 75 on the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which sets down rules on freezing funds and financial assets in order to combat and prevent terrorism.<br\/><br\/>What is the relationship between these protocols?  The question of whether a measure is part of Schengen or the AFSJ is significant because, if the Schengen agreement applies, Ireland does not have a right to opt in, which it does have in regard to the AFSJ.  There is a substantive overlap, however, between the Schengen <i>acquis<\/i>and Title V, Part III, and this has been litigated before the European Court of Justice, by the UK in particular.  An example is case C-137\/05 on Frontex.<br\/><br\/>If a measure is covered by the Schengen <i>acquis<\/i>, then it is governed by the Schengen protocol.  What has happened is that the court has interpreted this relatively broadly to include complementary measures, that is, any measure that &ldquo;builds on&rdquo; the <i>acquis<\/i>.  The term &ldquo;builds on&rdquo; is one that would give a lawyer nightmares because it is very fuzzy.  It means the precise nature of the relationship between the two protocols is not entirely clear.<br\/><br\/>Let us consider the UK opt-out protocol in passing.  Under Protocol 36, governing transitional provisions, the UK had the choice to opt out of pre-Treaty of Lisbon measures on police and judicial co-operation within five years.  As members are probably well aware, it did so and now has opted back in to a large number of measures, the most important of which for Ireland is the European arrest warrant.  Ireland did not have this opt-out in the treaty.<br\/><br\/>The next topic is Ireland and the protocols.  Laffan and O'Mahony suggest that Ireland and the UK have opted into measures on civil co-operation, asylum and irregular migration but to a limited extent on visas, border controls and legal migration.  They participate in almost all criminal and policing provisions of Schengen and in respect of irregular migration.  I have three thoughts on this.  First, as the common travel area is significant for relations between the UK and Ireland, it might be worth considering what Mr. Justice Hogan had to say about it in Pachero<i>v<\/i>. the Minister for Justice and Equality in 2011.  At one point, he referred to the &ldquo;legal archaeology&rdquo; required to get to the bottom of the common travel area:<blockquote>While in theory both Irish and British citizens are entitled to arrive here free from immigration control by virtue of the common travel area, increasingly in practice such passengers who arrive by air from the UK are required to produce their passports (or, at least, some other form of acceptable identity document) in order to prove to immigration officers that they are either Irish or British citizens who can avail of the common travel area. Whatever about anyone else, Joseph Heller [who, as members know, wrote <i>Catch-22<\/i>] certainly would have approved.<\/blockquote>This suggests greater clarity on the common travel area would be desirable.<br\/><br\/>Second, if the UK exits the EU, regard has to be given to a three-way dynamic: the relationship between Ireland and the EU, the relationship between Ireland and the UK, and the relationship between the UK and the EU.  It might be useful in this regard to consider the analogy, albeit imperfect, of the Nordic Passport Union and the Nordic Police Cooperation Agreement, whereby free movement is ensured for Norway and Iceland with the other Nordic countries although they are not in the EU.  However, they are in Schengen, which the UK is unlikely to join in an EU exit scenario.<br\/><br\/>Third, these two comments suggest a mini-Schengen may be the best way forward for the UK and Ireland should the UK leave the EU.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED12015022600002#B00200","speaker":"957","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424946600,"counter":2068,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Maher.<\/p> <p>  I welcome back Mr. Eugene Regan.  He is on familiar territory.  I invite him to address the committee, after which we will bank questions.<\/p><p>I thank the Chairman.  It is very nice to be at the meeting.  It is much more comfortable sitting on the other side of the room, but here goes.<br\/><br\/>I have been asked to address the issue of the co-operation in policing and criminal matters in the context of a UK withdrawal from the EU and the consequences it might have for this area.  I do not believe the UK will withdraw from the EU.  Recent experience in this very area of policing and criminal law matters might serve as a guide to how the debate on UK withdrawal will crystallise.  The reality is that there was a furore in the UK regarding the European arrest warrant, other matters concerning policing and EU criminal law matters.  It centred on the European arrest warrant and the frailties in the framework decision adopted in 2002.  There was criticism of other aspects of that area.  When the UK Government chose to exercise the blackout option, provided in the Lisbon treaty and to which Professor Maher has referred, and thus withdrew from approximately 130 measures, it recognised the reality of the matter and the importance of the measures to policing and internal security in the UK.  It chose to opt back in to 35 of the key measures.  This demonstrates that, notwithstanding the reservations in the UK about the EU, it has the capacity and pragmatism to recognise that it is in its own interest to work within the EU framework.<br\/><br\/>Let me give a little historical background on the policing and criminal law area.  Historically, Ireland and the UK were on opposing sides.  The great debates of the early years of membership were mainly on the Common Agricultural Policy and disputes about green pounds and devaluations.  However, in the area of policing and criminal law matters, the two countries followed the same path, as we did in regard to asylum and immigration.  There is no area in which the two countries have co-operated as closely as in this area.  This co-operation dates back to 1972, the year of the Munich Olympics outrage.  The TREVI group was formed, and the UK and Ireland were involved in that when it was set up at the European Council meeting in Rome in 1975.  The European arrest warrant was introduced after the events of 11 September 2001.  The British Home Secretary suggested the idea of mutual recognition.<br\/><br\/>The UK contribution in this area has been very important.  We have worked alongside the UK because of the common law tradition and concerns about how development in this area would affect the common law system.  Bearing in mind the process involving the Maastricht, Amsterdam and Lisbon treaties, one notes it is only at the time of the production of the Lisbon treaty that this area was brought into the first pillar of the EU and made subject to the full involvement of all the institutions, that is, the Commission proposing legislation, parliamentary co-decision and, of course, the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.  There was a delay in respect of the latter.  It was five years after the introduction of the Lisbon treaty that the European Court of Justice was to have full jurisdiction in this area.  Hence the move to qualified majority voting and the European Court of Justice jurisdiction.  This is why the UK chose to extend the Protocol 21 opt-out to the criminal law area.  Ireland followed suit.  Members will remember there was a debate in the Seanad and D&aacute;il on this when Ireland decided to follow the UK on this.  It was opposed by the Opposition but there was a compromise, which was that the opt-out would be reviewed after five years.  That review has taken place.<br\/><br\/>The UK opt-out is entirely different, however.  Protocol 36, a decision to opt out <i>en bloc<\/i>from all new measures, was exercised by the UK Government in 2013.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Mr. Eugene Regan:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That was announced by the UK Government on 24 July 2013.  At the same time, it identified a number of key measures it wished to opt back into.  That was adopted last November and passed by the House of Commons.  However, what is fundamentally important in this is the Irish influence in that debate and the fact that it was highlighted by the Irish Government that the consequences of the UK exercising this opt-out and not opting back into the European arrest warrant, in particular, and into other measures would create fundamental difficulties for co-operation between the two countries, not only in the area fighting crime but, especially, the area of terrorism and in the context of Northern Ireland.  That had a very persuasive effect in ensuring that the House of Commons voted through the measures to opt back into the 35 measures, including the European arrest warrant.<br\/><br\/>There has always been a concern in Ireland - Professor Imelda Maher identified it - in regard to our common law system and this is why Ireland chose to apply protocol 21 to policing and criminal matters.  The reality is that since that extension, Ireland has opted into the vast majority of measures.  In terms of those into which we have not opted, it is not for reasons that go to our criminal law system, or our particular common law system, but it has more to do with organisation and administration.  After five years, it has become apparent that protocol 21 is not really necessary in terms of protecting the features of our criminal law system, which were initially of concern.<br\/><br\/>When I say that the United Kingdom has recognised the importance of the measures in policing and criminal law, there was a House of Lords report on the issue of the opt-out in 2004.  Many representations were made to the House of Lords, in particular in regard to the European arrest warrant but also on the whole range of measures.  The conclusion of that report was that opting out of policing and criminal justice measures would have significant adverse negative repercussions for the internal security of, and the administration of criminal justice in, the UK.There was a recognition in the UK of the importance of these measures and of the <i>acquis<\/i>, as it were, in all of this, and that it was important to the UK itself.<br\/><br\/>Professor John Spencer, who is an expert in this whole area, considered that if the opt-out and opting back in were to go ahead, which is the case, that would essentially be a purely paper exercise.  He suggested the opt-out would make no difference whatsoever because the key measures were included in the measures to which the United Kingdom was opting back into.  After 40 years of progress and treaty changes, which reflect the common concerns of member states in the area of organised crime, terrorism and the importance, at a European level, of co-operation in the detection, investigation and prosecution of crime, the UK recognised that for it to exit out of these areas was a leap in the dark and was not in its interests.  <br\/><br\/>In the event of a UK exit, which is theoretical question, and whether it is a real question will depend on the May general election, a void will not be created.  The fact is that Article 50 of the Treaty of European Union provides specifically for a mechanism for withdrawal of any member state.  It specifically states that the Union shall  negotiate and conclude an agreement with that state, setting out the arrangements for its withdrawal and taking account of the framework for its future relationship with the European Union.  In addition,  the treaty shall cease to apply to that state in question from the date of entry into force of the withdrawal, so even in the extreme situation of a withdrawal, it would have to be an orderly one.  The UK is bound by the treaties until such time as such an exit would happen and to enter into an agreement providing for that procedure for withdrawal.<br\/><br\/>If there was a UK withdrawal it would not just affect the criminal law areas but it would also affect the civil law area, in particular there are specific regulations, for example, on the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters.  There are also the European accounts preservation orders.  All of these are very important measures in the civil law field but they fall into this rubric and chapter in regard to criminal law.<br\/><br\/>If there was not an orderly withdrawal, the question of the arrangements would arise.  Would individual member states, like Ireland, have to enter into bilateral treaties with the UK?  One would have to have serious doubts that would be possible because the EU now has a competence in this area of policing and criminal law matters and I do not think member states would be at liberty to enter into bilateral arrangements.  It would be a recipe for disaster if there were no orderly procedures for an exit in that unlikely event.<br\/><br\/>Prime Minister David Cameron is reported recently as saying that people would rather have a choice between staying in a reformed Europe or getting out rather than the false choice of today which is to stay in Europe with which they are not satisfied or to leave.  The issue and the agenda is more reform and renegotiation of certain terms of the existing treaties.  In terms of terms of the criminal law area, even though the EU arrest warrant has been a topical political potato in the United Kingdom, it is more to do with immigration and welfare tourism.  That is where the focus of any re-negotiation seems to be moving.  <br\/><br\/>Ireland's position has been made clear by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Taoiseach that Ireland's interests lie in the UK remaining within the EU.  In the area of policing and criminal law matters, as common law countries, there is no doubt about the common interest we have in shaping EU policies in this area and working within the framework which has been created by the EU over the past 40 years.<br\/><br\/>In terms of reform, the criticisms of the European arrest warrant by the UK and in the political debates which have occurred are not entirely unjustified.  It was an instrument adopted rather hurriedly after 9\/11.  It is not perfect legislation and it has created considerable problems in terms of excessive usage and the protection of persons who are extradited.  Even though it has worked effectively and efficiently, there is scope for revising and improvement of that instrument.  Those types of reforms might resolve many of the issues that might arise, and have arisen, in regard to the issue of UK withdrawal from the EU.  <br\/><br\/>I will leave it at that.

It is almost a fog, an if-and-but situation being repeated constantly.  Although some people have told us there will definitely be a referendum, we do not know if there will be because the Prime Minister, David Cameron, must get an overall majority.  We have been examining whether it is possible.  The politicians in Northern Ireland will have a role, particularly the Unionists, given that Sinn F&eacute;in, as eurosceptics, will presumably opt out of the debate.  Maybe Sinn F&eacute;in might opt in, for the first time, in addressing a very serious issue in the European context.  There is also a potential role for Scotland.  It is very difficult to address the implications of England opting out of Europe.  Is it possible to bring the UK out of Europe?  What, precisely, are the reforms?<\/p> <p>  The process would take years.  First, Mr. Cameron would have to win an overall majority in the election, after which some sort of negotiations could start.  Presumably, it would take years for the British Parliament to debate the exact reforms they are seeking.  Then, there would be a long debate in Europe on whether or not it is possible.  If the EU concedes, the unravelling or opting out would take years.  I do not want to be disrespectful to anybody.  We have regular representation from the British Embassy at these meetings.  The British ambassador might convey to Mr. Cameron that the committee had deliberated on the issue and that speaker after speaker after speaker had pointed out that the negative effects for Great Britain and Ireland would be so damning that Mr. Cameron should review his position.<\/p> <p>  Situations have evolved recently.  Ireland was way ahead of the British when we extended employment rights to citizens of Romania and Bulgaria, and the British went ballistic about these so-called \"welfare tourists\".  We saw what happened at the airports when they were all coming for work.  The Irish Government has just created 70,000 new Irish from 160 countries in the world.  It is widely accepted internationally that immigrants are incredibly productive and involved in seeking employment and that they do not come to sponge on the welfare system.  Switzerland recently held a referendum on immigration and passed a law to restrict immigration using quotas.  Since then, they have realised it is not operable.  Would it be worth reminding the British of this?<\/p> <p>  The Acting Chairman mentioned the House of Lords, for which I have great respect, and this provoked me into thinking that it does an extremely good job of analysing the EU process.  Maybe, at the end of the whole set of debates, we should engage with the House of Lords on the issue.  Of all the intellectuals and business people who have come here to discuss this, not one has predicted a positive outcome from what the UK intends to do.  I would like us to compile all our documentation and go to the House of Lords and engage with them, or invite them here to engage with us.  We must engage with them in order to achieve clarity at the end of this debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED12015022600002#E00200","speaker":"1030"},{"type":"speech","time":1424946600,"counter":2074,"content":"<p>I will go back to basics.

The reason the UK would not consider entering Schengen was the immigration aspect of it.  Given that I am not an expert in European law, protocol 21 is new to me.

Anybody listening to this on television would wonder what Professor Maher meant by it.  Both witnesses mentioned the issue of civil and common law jurisdictions and suggested that, given that both Ireland and the UK are common law countries, we should remain together in a common law bloc.

In regard to protocols, the people who drew them up in the first place did not intend to make it easy to either exit from or opt into them.  Opting out after opting in is obviously a very complicated process.  The area of policing and criminal law is hugely complicated and it could waste a considerable amount of European time.<\/p> <p>  A new European structure will emerge in the event of an exit.  It could change irrevocably the entire European architecture, based as it is on provisions made in the past, the expectations at the foundation of the European Union and, in particular, the expectations of the founding fathers of the European Union.  It would virtually impossible to reconstruct Europe if one country were to opt out, possibly followed by other countries.<\/p> <p>  Several members referred to the existence of euroscepticism.  The committee is examining that issue separately to understand the real reasons for it, and not simply the reasons that happen to be convenient at any particular time.  It remains to be seen how that issue can be addressed but, like other issues, it will have huge implications for the European Union.<\/p> <p>  Taking into account the protocols and the issue of policing and criminal law, the creation of a new border in the event of the UK opting out will have serious implications for trade and travel.  It has been suggested that Ireland could also opt out.  I shudder to think of some of the ideas that have been put forward as reasonable.  They are not reasonable.  Sadly, this debate is taking place against the backdrop of a serious economic downturn across Europe.  The discussions that take place in that sort of environment are not necessarily the best in terms of long-term planning.  Europe has a tragic history in that regard and all of us should do what we can to avoid reaping that whirlwind.<\/p><p>I will begin, and if I miss any points I ask members to come back to me.  On the question of the Six Counties and the implications of having a border with the free trade area, a British exit would require provision to be made for a common travel area, but it might be a difficult task to maintain it in that new context.  In regard to the unified patent court and where its institutions are to be located, the best answer is that the European police training college was supposed to be located in the United Kingdom but I understand that is no longer being proposed.  That may a fallout from the furore that has emerged in the area of justice, policing and criminal law.<\/p><p> In regard to Deputy Byrne's comments on the general election in the UK, of course it is a theoretical question, and the issue will only crystallise after the election.  There is also a Scottish dimension.  There might be another referendum in Scotland should the United Kingdom exit the EU.  There is no clear indication as to what the UK Government wants, but David Cameron has at times indicated that out of the four freedoms, he wants to make changes in regard to the free movement of labour and people.  Other countries have a problem with such changes because the relevant provisions were embedded in the European Union from its outset.  It is also important for Ireland and Irish people living in the UK that there be no impediment to free movement.  The focus has turned to the notion of welfare tourism and the benefits attributed to workers when they move between member states.  Angela Merkel indicated that she was open to considering measures in that regard.  This type of response may help to diffuse many of the issues that have arisen.<\/p><p> Schengen is a tricky area.  It was Tony Blair who decided that the UK should be seen to be more positive towards Europe at a particular point in time and, while not opting into Schengen, the UK opted into the policing and criminal law provisions of Schengen.  We followed suit.  Schengen was brought into the European Union under the Maastricht treaty, but there remains a set of Schengen measures in criminal law and policing - please do not ask me to list them - which we have opted into without also opting into other normal post-Lisbon treaty measures on criminal law.  It is a very complex area.  We have opted into that aspect of the Schengen Agreement but not into the free movement aspects.<\/p><p> In regard to the impact of changing security provisions on the debate about co-operation on criminal law, we have seen that time and again.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Mr. Eugene Regan:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The Olympic Games massacre gave rise to the setting up by the member states of the TREVI group, which attempted to exchange information and have countries work together in this area. The 9-11 attacks resulted in the adoption of the European Arrest Warrant.  The warrant worked effectively in the more recent London bombings to extradite the responsible parties from Italy, and they were convicted in the UK.  Those types of thing do change.  Denmark is looking at the exercise of a protocol similar to Ireland, and the recent terrorist acts in the country may have an impact on that.  That always has an impact.  The criminal justice area and the EAW are not the real concern about the Union in the UK.  Some changes are needed and those concerns could be assuaged.  Free movement, immigration and what is termed \"welfare tourism\" are the kernel of the concern.<\/p><p> There was a question about the European Court of Human Rights.

He points out that 25% of Northern Ireland's non-UK trade is with Ireland.  We have been talking a great deal about people, but the customs question is also important.  He also notes the dividend from the peace agreements.  A total of &euro;150 million in grants will be given to Northern Ireland by the EU between 2014 and 2020.  I suspect, given the Deputy's comment about how long all this will take, that this money will be spent before the UK has left the EU, but it is still a sizeable sum.  There is also the issue of cross-Border workers.  Many people move between North and South and there is significant commercial activity around the Border.  Professor Phinnemore's concern is that there is not enough discussion about the Northern Irish dimension in the Great Britain debate because it is so small relative to the rest of the UK.  Nonetheless, that raises issues, particularly in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  The other context that ties into that is the negotiations around TTIP and CETA.  The free trade agreements with the US and Canada need to be factored into the trade and commercial aspect of this debate.<\/p> <p>  There will be a referendum, but there are two kinds of referendum on Europe in the UK context.  One is the political promise by the current Prime Minister to hold a referendum should he be elected following the next election, and that is what is focusing the mind.  That is the Brexit dimension, with which we are concerned.  However, there is also the EU Act from 2011, which guarantees a referendum in the event of substantial treaty change in the Union.  Mr. Cameron has been doing his best to avoid getting embroiled with that legislation, but that avoidance can only last for so long.  That is not particular to the current government; it would have to be dealt with by any government.  At some point, the UK will have to bite the bullet on that.  That legislation is complicated, with lists of items that have to be included in order to decide, but it will trigger a referendum at some point.  I hope that is clear enough.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the patent court, location can shift.  I hope that is not complicated.  I had not realised they were going to be there.<\/p> <p>  We are cognisant of the idea of the weakening of relations across the UK and the disintegrating union after the Scottish referendum, and this needs to be factored in, especially if Scotland votes \"Yes\".  Professor Sionaidh Douglas-Scott, a Scottish national based in Oxford, has written about this and reflected on it considerably.  It might be necessary to talk to the Scots as well as to the House of Lords.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy's point about this taking years is important, and my advice to the committee would be not to let it take years and years.  Ireland has a particular voice to present in the EU context should the UK vote to exit and one of the statements Ireland will want to make is that Article 50 should not drag on, so that the exit takes too long, because it  will pay a higher price for a delay than any other country.  That is a fair comment to make in this context.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED12015022600002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Imelda Maher"},{"type":"speech","time":1424946600,"counter":2084,"content":"<p>There was a suggestion, which I ran with, that business needs certainty for investment in England.

The Prime Minister, Mr. David Cameron has promised a referendum on this question if he is returned to power following a general election.  The committee decided to examine this issue now in view of the potential impact on this country and on the many Irish citizens living in the United Kingdom.  Our discussion will focus on the Lisbon treaty protocols and the future of Irish opt-outs in the context of a UK exit from the EU and also on criminal justice issues such as EU policing and judicial co-operation.

I have been asked to speak about EU treaty protocols.  I sent the briefing notes to the clerk of the committee just before lunch.<br\/><br\/>I will briefly outline the most relevant protocols in respect of the relationship between Ireland and the UK.  The reason for doing this in the context of a discussion of BrExit is that they are primarily concerned with control of migration and borders.  Should the United Kingdom chose to leave the EU, the Northern Irish Border would become significant for the EU as it would become an external EU border.  This would then raise considerable challenges for the open borders policy between the United Kingdom and Ireland as articulated in the common travel area.  There are three protocols of note and another I will mention in passing.<br\/><br\/>First, Protocol 19 relates to the Schengen <i>acquis. <\/i>Schengen is an international convention designed to remove internal borders and establish a common external frontier.  This means it also establishes common visa, asylum and immigration policies.  Implementing measures known as the Schengen <i>acquis <\/i>were adopted on these policies and these were incorporated into the EU treaties and into EU law by the Amsterdam treaty, which is now part of EU law.  There are special rules for Ireland and the UK in regard to Schengen as the only two member states that have not signed the convention.  Others such as Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Romania have signed but are not fully incorporated into it.  The relationship between the UK and Ireland and the Schengen provisions is addressed mainly in Protocol 19.<br\/><br\/>Ireland and the United Kingdom - throughout my address I will refer to Ireland but members should read it as Ireland and the United Kingdom - may at any time request to take part in some or all of the Schengen <i>acquis.<\/i>The Council of Ministers decide on this request on the basis of unanimity of the Schengen member states and the requesting state.  The significance of this provision is that Ireland can only participate if the other member states agree to it unanimously.<br\/><br\/>Where Ireland has opted in to part of the Schengen <i>acquis<\/i>and a new proposal in that field is introduced, Ireland can give notice to the Council of Minister that it will opt out but can withdraw that notice at any time up to the adoption of the measure.  This opt-out is tempered by a set of procedures in Article 5 described as &quot;fiendish&quot; by Stephen Peers, a leading authority in the field.  The purpose of the procedures is to protect the coherence of the Schengen <i>acquis. <\/i>The risk for Ireland is that the underlying Schengen <i>acquis<\/i>could be dis-applied to it and Ireland would have to bear any direct financial consequences of this should the decision be that Ireland's opt-out from the amending measure would cause too much incoherence for the system.  Should Ireland chose to opt from an amending measure, having opted into it, the stakes are very high. <br\/><br\/>Protocol 20 recognises the special travel arrangements in place between Ireland and the United Kingdom.  It first recognises that the UK can continue to exercise border controls and then that the United Kingdom and Ireland can have special arrangements for the movement of people between them.  As long as this common travel area exists, then according to the protocol Ireland can also have border controls.<br\/><br\/>There are two consequences to note from this.  First, as Protocol 20 states, the other member states can impose border checks on people coming from Ireland and the United Kingdom.  Members no doubt have experienced this when they travelled to the Schengen area.  Second, the exemption for Ireland to impose border controls only applies as long as the UK and Ireland maintain their common travel area.  This is important should the UK exit the EU.<br\/><br\/>Protocol 21, a protocol on freedom, security and justice, provides an opt-in for the UK and Ireland in regard to measures adopted under an EU court's rulings on Title V Part III of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, that is the measures adopted in regard to the creation of the area of freedom, security and justice, AFSJ, dealing with border checks, asylum, immigration, judicial co-operation in civil and criminal matters and police co-operation.  This is different from the Schengen Protocol, as the UK and Ireland have a right to opt-in.<br\/><br\/>Ireland notifies the President of the Council of Ministers in writing within three months of a proposal going to Council that it wants to take part.  Its participation cannot be vetoed.  Even if Ireland does not participate in the measure, it can subsequently opt-in with the Commission outlining to the Council what arrangements are necessary for Ireland to comply with the measure.  Note, a measure can be adopted after a reasonable time without Ireland or the UK, even if they have notified of their wish to opt in, if in practical terms it is not possible to adopt the measure with them taking part.<br\/><br\/>Where the UK or Ireland opt-out of a measure, then the Council holds a full discussion of the possible effects of such non-participation.  Any member state can ask the Commission to examine the situation on the basis of Article 116 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.  Under this provision if the Commission thinks a member state's laws, administrative practices or procedures are distorting competition in the internal market and that distortion needs to be eliminated then the Commission consults the member state.  If the consultation does not work, then directives or any other appropriate measures can be adopted under the ordinary legislative procedure.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Professor Imelda Maher:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->What this means is that an opt-out decision, in what I believe would be fairly exceptional circumstances, may lead to legislation being adopted if the decision is deemed to distort competition in the internal market.  The reason for this opt-out for Ireland seems to have been driven by concerns about the integrity of the common law system and differences with the civil law traditions dominant in other member states and by the fact the UK was going to opt out.<br\/><br\/>Ireland in, declaration 56, affirms its commitment to the AFSJ and indicates it will participate to the maximum extent.  Ireland can, at any time, notify the Council in writing that it no longer wishes to be covered by this protocol, and if it does so then the normal treaty provisions apply.  This protocol is not applicable to Ireland in regard to Article 75 on the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which sets down rules on freezing funds and financial assets in order to combat and prevent terrorism.<br\/><br\/>What is the relationship between these protocols?  The question of whether a measure is part of Schengen or the AFSJ is significant because, if the Schengen agreement applies, Ireland does not have a right to opt in, which it does have in regard to the AFSJ.  There is a substantive overlap, however, between the Schengen <i>acquis<\/i>and Title V, Part III, and this has been litigated before the European Court of Justice, by the UK in particular.  An example is case C-137\/05 on Frontex.<br\/><br\/>If a measure is covered by the Schengen <i>acquis<\/i>, then it is governed by the Schengen protocol.  What has happened is that the court has interpreted this relatively broadly to include complementary measures, that is, any measure that &ldquo;builds on&rdquo; the <i>acquis<\/i>.  The term &ldquo;builds on&rdquo; is one that would give a lawyer nightmares because it is very fuzzy.  It means the precise nature of the relationship between the two protocols is not entirely clear.<br\/><br\/>Let us consider the UK opt-out protocol in passing.  Under Protocol 36, governing transitional provisions, the UK had the choice to opt out of pre-Treaty of Lisbon measures on police and judicial co-operation within five years.  As members are probably well aware, it did so and now has opted back in to a large number of measures, the most important of which for Ireland is the European arrest warrant.  Ireland did not have this opt-out in the treaty.<br\/><br\/>The next topic is Ireland and the protocols.  Laffan and O'Mahony suggest that Ireland and the UK have opted into measures on civil co-operation, asylum and irregular migration but to a limited extent on visas, border controls and legal migration.  They participate in almost all criminal and policing provisions of Schengen and in respect of irregular migration.  I have three thoughts on this.  First, as the common travel area is significant for relations between the UK and Ireland, it might be worth considering what Mr. Justice Hogan had to say about it in Pachero<i>v<\/i>. the Minister for Justice and Equality in 2011.  At one point, he referred to the &ldquo;legal archaeology&rdquo; required to get to the bottom of the common travel area:<blockquote>While in theory both Irish and British citizens are entitled to arrive here free from immigration control by virtue of the common travel area, increasingly in practice such passengers who arrive by air from the UK are required to produce their passports (or, at least, some other form of acceptable identity document) in order to prove to immigration officers that they are either Irish or British citizens who can avail of the common travel area. Whatever about anyone else, Joseph Heller [who, as members know, wrote <i>Catch-22<\/i>] certainly would have approved.<\/blockquote>This suggests greater clarity on the common travel area would be desirable.<br\/><br\/>Second, if the UK exits the EU, regard has to be given to a three-way dynamic: the relationship between Ireland and the EU, the relationship between Ireland and the UK, and the relationship between the UK and the EU.  It might be useful in this regard to consider the analogy, albeit imperfect, of the Nordic Passport Union and the Nordic Police Cooperation Agreement, whereby free movement is ensured for Norway and Iceland with the other Nordic countries although they are not in the EU.  However, they are in Schengen, which the UK is unlikely to join in an EU exit scenario.<br\/><br\/>Third, these two comments suggest a mini-Schengen may be the best way forward for the UK and Ireland should the UK leave the EU.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015022600002#B00200","speaker":"957","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424959200,"counter":2099,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Maher.<\/p> <p>  I welcome back Mr. Eugene Regan.  He is on familiar territory.  I invite him to address the committee, after which we will bank questions.<\/p><p>I thank the Chairman.  It is very nice to be at the meeting.  It is much more comfortable sitting on the other side of the room, but here goes.<br\/><br\/>I have been asked to address the issue of the co-operation in policing and criminal matters in the context of a UK withdrawal from the EU and the consequences it might have for this area.  I do not believe the UK will withdraw from the EU.  Recent experience in this very area of policing and criminal law matters might serve as a guide to how the debate on UK withdrawal will crystallise.  The reality is that there was a furore in the UK regarding the European arrest warrant, other matters concerning policing and EU criminal law matters.  It centred on the European arrest warrant and the frailties in the framework decision adopted in 2002.  There was criticism of other aspects of that area.  When the UK Government chose to exercise the blackout option, provided in the Lisbon treaty and to which Professor Maher has referred, and thus withdrew from approximately 130 measures, it recognised the reality of the matter and the importance of the measures to policing and internal security in the UK.  It chose to opt back in to 35 of the key measures.  This demonstrates that, notwithstanding the reservations in the UK about the EU, it has the capacity and pragmatism to recognise that it is in its own interest to work within the EU framework.<br\/><br\/>Let me give a little historical background on the policing and criminal law area.  Historically, Ireland and the UK were on opposing sides.  The great debates of the early years of membership were mainly on the Common Agricultural Policy and disputes about green pounds and devaluations.  However, in the area of policing and criminal law matters, the two countries followed the same path, as we did in regard to asylum and immigration.  There is no area in which the two countries have co-operated as closely as in this area.  This co-operation dates back to 1972, the year of the Munich Olympics outrage.  The TREVI group was formed, and the UK and Ireland were involved in that when it was set up at the European Council meeting in Rome in 1975.  The European arrest warrant was introduced after the events of 11 September 2001.  The British Home Secretary suggested the idea of mutual recognition.<br\/><br\/>The UK contribution in this area has been very important.  We have worked alongside the UK because of the common law tradition and concerns about how development in this area would affect the common law system.  Bearing in mind the process involving the Maastricht, Amsterdam and Lisbon treaties, one notes it is only at the time of the production of the Lisbon treaty that this area was brought into the first pillar of the EU and made subject to the full involvement of all the institutions, that is, the Commission proposing legislation, parliamentary co-decision and, of course, the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.  There was a delay in respect of the latter.  It was five years after the introduction of the Lisbon treaty that the European Court of Justice was to have full jurisdiction in this area.  Hence the move to qualified majority voting and the European Court of Justice jurisdiction.  This is why the UK chose to extend the Protocol 21 opt-out to the criminal law area.  Ireland followed suit.  Members will remember there was a debate in the Seanad and D&aacute;il on this when Ireland decided to follow the UK on this.  It was opposed by the Opposition but there was a compromise, which was that the opt-out would be reviewed after five years.  That review has taken place.<br\/><br\/>The UK opt-out is entirely different, however.  Protocol 36, a decision to opt out <i>en bloc<\/i>from all new measures, was exercised by the UK Government in 2013.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Mr. Eugene Regan:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That was announced by the UK Government on 24 July 2013.  At the same time, it identified a number of key measures it wished to opt back into.  That was adopted last November and passed by the House of Commons.  However, what is fundamentally important in this is the Irish influence in that debate and the fact that it was highlighted by the Irish Government that the consequences of the UK exercising this opt-out and not opting back into the European arrest warrant, in particular, and into other measures would create fundamental difficulties for co-operation between the two countries, not only in the area fighting crime but, especially, the area of terrorism and in the context of Northern Ireland.  That had a very persuasive effect in ensuring that the House of Commons voted through the measures to opt back into the 35 measures, including the European arrest warrant.<br\/><br\/>There has always been a concern in Ireland - Professor Imelda Maher identified it - in regard to our common law system and this is why Ireland chose to apply protocol 21 to policing and criminal matters.  The reality is that since that extension, Ireland has opted into the vast majority of measures.  In terms of those into which we have not opted, it is not for reasons that go to our criminal law system, or our particular common law system, but it has more to do with organisation and administration.  After five years, it has become apparent that protocol 21 is not really necessary in terms of protecting the features of our criminal law system, which were initially of concern.<br\/><br\/>When I say that the United Kingdom has recognised the importance of the measures in policing and criminal law, there was a House of Lords report on the issue of the opt-out in 2004.  Many representations were made to the House of Lords, in particular in regard to the European arrest warrant but also on the whole range of measures.  The conclusion of that report was that opting out of policing and criminal justice measures would have significant adverse negative repercussions for the internal security of, and the administration of criminal justice in, the UK.There was a recognition in the UK of the importance of these measures and of the <i>acquis<\/i>, as it were, in all of this, and that it was important to the UK itself.<br\/><br\/>Professor John Spencer, who is an expert in this whole area, considered that if the opt-out and opting back in were to go ahead, which is the case, that would essentially be a purely paper exercise.  He suggested the opt-out would make no difference whatsoever because the key measures were included in the measures to which the United Kingdom was opting back into.  After 40 years of progress and treaty changes, which reflect the common concerns of member states in the area of organised crime, terrorism and the importance, at a European level, of co-operation in the detection, investigation and prosecution of crime, the UK recognised that for it to exit out of these areas was a leap in the dark and was not in its interests.  <br\/><br\/>In the event of a UK exit, which is theoretical question, and whether it is a real question will depend on the May general election, a void will not be created.  The fact is that Article 50 of the Treaty of European Union provides specifically for a mechanism for withdrawal of any member state.  It specifically states that the Union shall  negotiate and conclude an agreement with that state, setting out the arrangements for its withdrawal and taking account of the framework for its future relationship with the European Union.  In addition,  the treaty shall cease to apply to that state in question from the date of entry into force of the withdrawal, so even in the extreme situation of a withdrawal, it would have to be an orderly one.  The UK is bound by the treaties until such time as such an exit would happen and to enter into an agreement providing for that procedure for withdrawal.<br\/><br\/>If there was a UK withdrawal it would not just affect the criminal law areas but it would also affect the civil law area, in particular there are specific regulations, for example, on the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters.  There are also the European accounts preservation orders.  All of these are very important measures in the civil law field but they fall into this rubric and chapter in regard to criminal law.<br\/><br\/>If there was not an orderly withdrawal, the question of the arrangements would arise.  Would individual member states, like Ireland, have to enter into bilateral treaties with the UK?  One would have to have serious doubts that would be possible because the EU now has a competence in this area of policing and criminal law matters and I do not think member states would be at liberty to enter into bilateral arrangements.  It would be a recipe for disaster if there were no orderly procedures for an exit in that unlikely event.<br\/><br\/>Prime Minister David Cameron is reported recently as saying that people would rather have a choice between staying in a reformed Europe or getting out rather than the false choice of today which is to stay in Europe with which they are not satisfied or to leave.  The issue and the agenda is more reform and renegotiation of certain terms of the existing treaties.  In terms of terms of the criminal law area, even though the EU arrest warrant has been a topical political potato in the United Kingdom, it is more to do with immigration and welfare tourism.  That is where the focus of any re-negotiation seems to be moving.  <br\/><br\/>Ireland's position has been made clear by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Taoiseach that Ireland's interests lie in the UK remaining within the EU.  In the area of policing and criminal law matters, as common law countries, there is no doubt about the common interest we have in shaping EU policies in this area and working within the framework which has been created by the EU over the past 40 years.<br\/><br\/>In terms of reform, the criticisms of the European arrest warrant by the UK and in the political debates which have occurred are not entirely unjustified.  It was an instrument adopted rather hurriedly after 9\/11.  It is not perfect legislation and it has created considerable problems in terms of excessive usage and the protection of persons who are extradited.  Even though it has worked effectively and efficiently, there is scope for revising and improvement of that instrument.  Those types of reforms might resolve many of the issues that might arise, and have arisen, in regard to the issue of UK withdrawal from the EU.  <br\/><br\/>I will leave it at that.  I hope I have not exceeded my time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015022600002#C00200","speaker":"957","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424959200,"counter":2102,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Regan.

We have been examining whether it is possible.  The politicians in Northern Ireland will have a role, particularly the Unionists, given that Sinn F&eacute;in, as eurosceptics, will presumably opt out of the debate.  Maybe Sinn F&eacute;in might opt in, for the first time, in addressing a very serious issue in the European context.  There is also a potential role for Scotland.  It is very difficult to address the implications of England opting out of Europe.  Is it possible to bring the UK out of Europe?

First, Mr. Cameron would have to win an overall majority in the election, after which some sort of negotiations could start.  Presumably, it would take years for the British Parliament to debate the exact reforms they are seeking.  Then, there would be a long debate in Europe on whether or not it is possible.  If the EU concedes, the unravelling or opting out would take years.  I do not want to be disrespectful to anybody.  We have regular representation from the British Embassy at these meetings.

It is widely accepted internationally that immigrants are incredibly productive and involved in seeking employment and that they do not come to sponge on the welfare system.

The reason the UK would not consider entering Schengen was the immigration aspect of it.  Given that I am not an expert in European law, protocol 21 is new to me.  From both presentations, it appears that it covers many of the areas that Schengen covers.  Both Ireland and the UK have a right to opt into it and the UK has opted into a number of the areas.

In regard to protocols, the people who drew them up in the first place did not intend to make it easy to either exit from or opt into them.  Opting out after opting in is obviously a very complicated process.  The area of policing and criminal law is hugely complicated and it could waste a considerable amount of European time.<\/p> <p>  A new European structure will emerge in the event of an exit.  It could change irrevocably the entire European architecture, based as it is on provisions made in the past, the expectations at the foundation of the European Union and, in particular, the expectations of the founding fathers of the European Union.  It would virtually impossible to reconstruct Europe if one country were to opt out, possibly followed by other countries.<\/p> <p>  Several members referred to the existence of euroscepticism.  The committee is examining that issue separately to understand the real reasons for it, and not simply the reasons that happen to be convenient at any particular time.  It remains to be seen how that issue can be addressed but, like other issues, it will have huge implications for the European Union.<\/p> <p>  Taking into account the protocols and the issue of policing and criminal law, the creation of a new border in the event of the UK opting out will have serious implications for trade and travel.  It has been suggested that Ireland could also opt out.  I shudder to think of some of the ideas that have been put forward as reasonable.  They are not reasonable.  Sadly, this debate is taking place against the backdrop of a serious economic downturn across Europe.  The discussions that take place in that sort of environment are not necessarily the best in terms of long-term planning.  Europe has a tragic history in that regard and all of us should do what we can to avoid reaping that whirlwind.<\/p><p>I will begin, and if I miss any points I ask members to come back to me.  On the question of the Six Counties and the implications of having a border with the free trade area, a British exit would require provision to be made for a common travel area, but it might be a difficult task to maintain it in that new context.  In regard to the unified patent court and where its institutions are to be located, the best answer is that the European police training college was supposed to be located in the United Kingdom but I understand that is no longer being proposed.  That may a fallout from the furore that has emerged in the area of justice, policing and criminal law.<\/p><p> In regard to Deputy Byrne's comments on the general election in the UK, of course it is a theoretical question, and the issue will only crystallise after the election.  There is also a Scottish dimension.  There might be another referendum in Scotland should the United Kingdom exit the EU.  There is no clear indication as to what the UK Government wants, but David Cameron has at times indicated that out of the four freedoms, he wants to make changes in regard to the free movement of labour and people.  Other countries have a problem with such changes because the relevant provisions were embedded in the European Union from its outset.  It is also important for Ireland and Irish people living in the UK that there be no impediment to free movement.  The focus has turned to the notion of welfare tourism and the benefits attributed to workers when they move between member states.  Angela Merkel indicated that she was open to considering measures in that regard.  This type of response may help to diffuse many of the issues that have arisen.<\/p><p> Schengen is a tricky area.  It was Tony Blair who decided that the UK should be seen to be more positive towards Europe at a particular point in time and, while not opting into Schengen, the UK opted into the policing and criminal law provisions of Schengen.  We followed suit.  Schengen was brought into the European Union under the Maastricht treaty, but there remains a set of Schengen measures in criminal law and policing - please do not ask me to list them - which we have opted into without also opting into other normal post-Lisbon treaty measures on criminal law.  It is a very complex area.  We have opted into that aspect of the Schengen Agreement but not into the free movement aspects.<\/p><p> In regard to the impact of changing security provisions on the debate about co-operation on criminal law, we have seen that time and again.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Mr. Eugene Regan:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The Olympic Games massacre gave rise to the setting up by the member states of the TREVI group, which attempted to exchange information and have countries work together in this area.

One is the political promise by the current Prime Minister to hold a referendum should he be elected following the next election, and that is what is focusing the mind.  That is the Brexit dimension, with which we are concerned.  However, there is also the EU Act from 2011, which guarantees a referendum in the event of substantial treaty change in the Union.  Mr. Cameron has been doing his best to avoid getting embroiled with that legislation, but that avoidance can only last for so long.  That is not particular to the current government; it would have to be dealt with by any government.  At some point, the UK will have to bite the bullet on that.  That legislation is complicated, with lists of items that have to be included in order to decide, but it will trigger a referendum at some point.  I hope that is clear enough.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the patent court, location can shift.  I hope that is not complicated.  I had not realised they were going to be there.<\/p> <p>  We are cognisant of the idea of the weakening of relations across the UK and the disintegrating union after the Scottish referendum, and this needs to be factored in, especially if Scotland votes \"Yes\".  Professor Sionaidh Douglas-Scott, a Scottish national based in Oxford, has written about this and reflected on it considerably.  It might be necessary to talk to the Scots as well as to the House of Lords.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy's point about this taking years is important, and my advice to the committee would be not to let it take years and years.  Ireland has a particular voice to present in the EU context should the UK vote to exit and one of the statements Ireland will want to make is that Article 50 should not drag on, so that the exit takes too long, because it  will pay a higher price for a delay than any other country.  That is a fair comment to make in this context.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015022600002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Imelda Maher"},{"type":"speech","time":1424959200,"counter":2115,"content":"<p>There was a suggestion, which I ran with, that business needs certainty for investment in England.
