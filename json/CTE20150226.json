Session A today is the public hearing discussion with Mr. David McWilliams on early warnings, divergent and contrarian views.<br\/><br\/>In commencing this morning's proceedings I welcome everyone to the 11th public hearing of the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis.  At our first session this morning we will hear from Mr. David McWilliams on issues related to early warnings, divergent and contrarian views in the context of the banking crisis in Ireland.  David McWilliams is an economist, writer, broadcaster and journalist.  He worked initially as an economist with the Central Bank of Ireland, the Union Bank of Switzerland and Banque Nationale de Paribas.  Since 1999 he has been a broadcaster, writer, economic commentator and documentary maker.  He has written four books, writes two weekly economic columns and he has made various documentaries.  He has brought a one man economic stand-up show to the stage at the Abbey Theatre.  David McWilliams is credited with being one of the first economists to predict a boom in Ireland's economy and for his predictions of an Irish property bubble building from 2000 to 2007 which would ultimately burst.  He was the first to coin the phrase &quot;ghost estates&quot;.  In January 2007, David McWilliams was selected as one of 250 young global leaders by the World Economic Forum and he is a regular speaker on the international circuit.  I welcome Mr. McWilliams.<br\/><br\/>I wish to advise the witness that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If the witness is directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter, and continues to do so, the witness is entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of the evidence.  The witness is directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  The witness has been informed previously that the committee is asking witnesses to refrain from discussing named individuals in this phase of the inquiry.  Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that Members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside of the House or an official by name, or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  Can I invite Mr. McWilliams to make his opening remarks to the inquiry please.<\/p><p>Thank you very much, Chairman.  It is a pleasure to be here.  I just want to make some opening remarks about the period in question, starting with 2000 and going up to 2008 and beyond.  It is my opinion that the Irish banking system, and by extension the rest of the Irish economy, was set up to fail.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Mr. David McWilliams:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I saw this earlier than anybody else and I made this opinion and these ideas available as widely as possibly.  In fact, I probably spent the best part of a decade trying to warn as many people as possible on as many platforms as possible that our property market was going to crash and that when it did, our banking system would be in a situation where money would fly out of the system and lead to a banking crisis.  I did this in hundreds of thousands of words; not thousands, but hundreds of thousands of words, in dozens of articles, two a week in the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>, the biggest selling newspaper in the country, and in <i>The Sunday Business Post<\/i>.  <br\/><br\/>I made documentaries about this.  I had my own TV show on TV3, which was watched by tens of thousands of people.  I warned people at every juncture that our housing market was a credit bubble and credit bubbles bust and it is not a matter of if they bust but when they bust.  The documentaries of <i>The Pope's Children<\/i>book, which I wrote, were watched by 36% of the Irish watching audience; that is a lot of people.  <i>The Pope's Children<\/i>, and I do not say this for any other reason than to make the point, was disseminated extremely widely and was the bestselling non-fiction book, not of the year, but of the decade, and it was published in 2005.  So these ideas were out there, disseminated widely, in the most accessible way.  When I hear the view that nobody saw this coming or that this was in some way a shock or we were taken by surprise, I do not believe that is the case.  I think the Irish property crash and the banking crash were both incredibly predictable and absolutely preventable. <br\/><br\/>This testimony will be a little bit different in the sense that it will not be about what should have or could have happened, and if we had seen that, if we did not see that, and my God I cannot believe we missed that.  This testimony will be taken from contemporaneous articles, pieces of work that show thinking at the time.  This was not isolated thinking.  In fact, I believe, and my experience through the period from 2000 onwards was, that many thousands of ordinary Irish people could see what was happening.  The difference is that I was an economic commentator and an economist and I had the platform of the media to deploy these ideas.  I cannot tell you the number of times I went into bars and pubs and chatted to people and they said, &quot;Hold on a second, this doesn't seem right; what is going on here?&quot;  So it is not as if a significant part of the population was not already worried.  I want to make that point that this was preventable and predictable, and that these views were widely disseminated.  There were not a huge coterie of individuals doing this but it was certainly out there.  <br\/><br\/>One could probably ask oneself why did this guy, who is a former Central Bank economist, an investment bank economist, why did he not just come home to Ireland, keep his mouth shut, play the game and get on with business.  The reason is I felt that if one has a specialty, if one understands something, one has something like a patriotic duty or a moral imperative to say that the policy or numbers of policies that we have together will lead our country into catastrophe.  I think it was a patriotic thing to do.  It certainly was not a worthwhile thing to do and it certainly was not fashionable and it certainly did not make me popular.  The interesting thing is that all through this period I was accused of being unpatriotic when I believe in actual fact it was something that was essential to do if one had the education and the experience to do so.  I remember people saying that I was unpatriotic for talking down the economy.  The committee might remember that expression, &quot;Talking down the economy&quot;.  I think that was maybe a reaction on the part of certain parts of the establishment to somebody saying, &quot;Hold on a second, this thing will not last.&quot;  <br\/><br\/>It seems to me from a political perspective that on every big economic issue, Ireland tends to split between insiders and outsiders.  The insiders are people with &quot;pull&quot;, the old fashioned word, with access to power, and the outsiders are people who are actually on the outside.  In the case of the property market and the associated banking and credit explosion, the insiders were the bankers themselves, estate agents, people who were doing well out of the property market, parts of the professional classes who were doing very well, and senior Government officials who were looking the other way or were not necessarily taking on board what was clear.  These are the people on the inside who were actually doing well.  Then, of course, political parties, because if there is a property boom there will be a tax boom.  If there is a tax boom then there will be lots of goodies to give out, lots of sweeties to give out.  So I think they are the insiders and in the situation of a housing boom where house prices are rising well above what the average person can afford, the outsiders are simply the people on the outside who are forced to play a game in which the dice is loaded against them from the start.  I think that is important; there is a political context in this.  <br\/><br\/>I suppose I devoted such enormous energies to try to warn about this for two main reasons.  The first reason was because I believed that hundreds of thousands of ordinary Irish people would end up in negative equity and would end up in debt and would end up in a situation where their lives would be destroyed by the debt associated with the housing market and they would end up being the people who paid.  That is a social reason.  The second reason, and this is very important for the context of this, is that I had worked both inside the Central Bank in Ireland in a crisis but, more crucially, I had also worked outside in investment banking.  What I see and what I saw were panics in investment banks, panics in financial markets, and I could see that every single day we avoided taking responsibility for this mess.  Every single day we said, &quot;It will be grand,&quot; or, &quot;There will be a soft landing,&quot; or, &quot;Don't worry about it, it is the markets.&quot;  We were therefore condemning ourselves to run out of options when the crisis happened.  The more we ignored, the more desperate we became and therefore the more we ignored the more likely we were to end up, which we did when the crash came, in a situation where our choices were not between good and bad but between bad and worse.<br\/><br\/>The crash was inevitable.  Now why was it inevitable?  This is the key.It was inevitable because of the way in which the banks were financing themselves.  Again I wrote all of this at the time.  I was writing this in 2000 and 2001.  This is not me thinking back and looking with hindsight.  This was obvious to anybody who was trained.  It was obvious.  This is not the sort of thing that anybody who is trained could not see.  This panic did not have to happen.  The panic of September 2008 did not have to happen.  It was not anything that was pre-ordained.  It could have been fixed very early.  The problem is if there is no housing boom there will be no banking boom.  If there is no banking boom there will be no banking crisis.  If there is no banking crisis there will be no interventions, such as the guarantee, and there will be no bailout.  All of these things are the consequence of bad economic policy, not the cause.  They are the consequence.  What happens in banks when they get out of control is that they all end in bank runs.  A bank run is when people take their money out.  A bank run is called a run because it happens quickly; it is not a bank amble or a bank stroll or a bank stroll around the park with a dog.  It is a run because people panic.  That panic will be more extreme if there is what is called hot money, if there is international money financing the banks.  When I saw this in 2004 that was when I realised we had a serious problem.<br\/><br\/>The Irish banking crisis began in 2000, not in 2008 as is sometimes suggested.  It began in 2000.  The great English economist John Stuart Mill, speaking about the railway crash that happened in Ireland during the Famine, said that crashes do not destroy the wealth of a nation, they merely evidence the extent to which wealth has already been destroyed by stupid decisions taken in the boom.  So the destruction of the Irish balance sheet did not happen after 2008; it actually happened before.  That is the nub of the issue, because prevention is always better than cure; we know that.  There is a direct link therefore between not heeding the warnings and vilifying those who warn.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Mr. David McWilliams:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->There is a direct link between this and the subsequent panic which need not have happened and the decisions that were taken. <br\/><br\/>The best way to look at this credit banking panic is through the prism of a forest fire.  Let us imagine a forest fire in a small place; the pyromaniacs start the fire which, in this case, are the banks and the forest is the general economy.  The people who are supposed to be the firemen, the regulators and the monetary authorities, look the other way and say &quot;Don't worry about the fire&quot;.  Some people would have said we have had them before and they have been quite nasty but this one will be different.  The firemen say &quot;Don't worry, we'll be grand, it will blow itself out.&quot;  Then the fire engulfs, not only the forest, but is about to engulf the entire village beside it.  The village leaders, the politicians, are faced with the choice - does one let the thing blow and see what happens because one never knows maybe a house will remain, or does one put it out?  At that stage one has to put out the fire with every single method possible.  Why?  Because it is already engulfing the entire place.  If one looks at the situation in that way one can see the way in which I, who wrote this a long time ago, think about these situations.<br\/><br\/>Who started the fire?  I wrote many years ago that property markets can only increase with credit.  Property markets do not increase as a result of supply and demand.  That was a big canard.  It does not happen that way.  It is credit.  Who gave the credit?  The banks.  Worse, what happened?  When the banks ran out of our deposits - normally the bank would say to itself I have a deposit here that will allow me to lend - they borrowed other people's money to give to us to buy houses that we were buying and selling to each other at expensive prices and calling it a miracle.  Whose money did they borrow?  They borrowed from the Germans, French, British, etc.  There was hot money coming in.  For example, one of the largest banks took 100 years to build up a balance sheet of &euro;60 billion but it doubled that in three years.  Let us think about that.  Why?  Because it had all this money coming in.  <br\/><br\/>What was the regulation called?  It was called light touch regulation.  Light touch regulation means one guarantees, almost makes certain, that the banking system is going to implode because hot money always leaves.  When hot money leaves then the rest of the money leaves too.  We actually set the entire thing up and this is crucial to a fail.<br\/><br\/>The interesting thing is a lot of people said:  &quot;Don't worry.  The free market will discipline the banks.&quot;  That does not happen.  Let me explain what happens in the free markets.  On the way up the free markets do not discipline the banks but do the opposite and allow the banks to do what they want.  As a consequence we have an  extraordinary situation where one joins the EMU, which was an unusual decision we might talk about later but it had a material impact on the economy, most of which in my opinion is negative.  We have light touch regulation, we get this flood of money into the banks which facilitates over-lending and then the over-lending facilitates over-borrowing.  All of this sounds familiar now but back in 2003 nobody was discussing it or those who did were vilified.  I shall play the committee a little 40-second clip of me on &quot;Prime Time&quot; in October 2003 which was watched by 400,000 people.  This is important and I said: <blockquote>The Irish housing market is a scam.  It is an enormous financial swindle that could potentially confine an entire generation of young Irish workers to years of bad debt.  Far from being a reflection of economic vitality and fundamental demand the housing bubble is, in the main, a vacuous financial confidence trick that has been foisted upon us by an alliance of banks and the landowners.<br \/><br \/>Today, in Ireland, the price of the average house is close to ten times the average wage.  This represents an economic failure on a monumental scale.  Behind this nonsense is excessive and irresponsible lending from our financial institutions.  The situation would be laughable if it were not so serious.<\/blockquote>That clip dates from October 2003.  I said: &quot;The Irish housing market is a scam.&quot;  That is what it was and that is what I want to come back to.  It was financed by over-lending not demand.<br\/><br\/>A lot of people have asked me what made me think like that while other economists did not.  I will wrap up but I want to make the following point about what happens when house prices rise.  Economics tells us that when the price rises the demand falls, that is what we teach kids in school.  In Ireland the opposite happens with house prices.  When the price rises the demand rises because people get panicked.  One hears that all the time.  People say: &quot;Jesus, prices are going up by 10%.  I'd better get on the ladder now because if I don't I'll have to pay another 10% next year.&quot;  A very active rise in prices, once it is allowed, creates a dynamic in people's heads to buy more, not less.  This is why economists could do with common sense, which is what I have always felt.  I urge them to talk to people.  I suggest they forget the models, talk to people, ask them what they think and then think about supply.  Economists will say &quot;Oh, when the prices the supply goes up&quot;.  <br\/><br\/>The main houses we have in Ireland is a stock of housing.  The houses are already built.  Someone like my Mum would trade down from a family house, she would move on and some other family would have the home.  Let us think about what happens when house prices rise.  My mother would say, and it is natural, &quot;I won't sell that now if they are going up by 20%.  Wouldn't I be mad to sell so I shall sell next year?&quot;.  That would be a totally rational decision for my mother.  Not only does the price not work, it amplifies the problem.  It ends up that supply eventually adjusts but it adjusts far too late.  We end up building houses in the wrong place for the wrong people at the wrong price.  That is why I coined the expression &quot;ghost estates&quot;.<br\/><br\/>In 2006, I was travelling back from Westport having visited Allergan, a factory which produces Botox, not for my own use.  I visited for a piece of research I was doing about who made Botox.  While I drove back from Mayo to Dublin I saw that every little town had a huge big estate and was reminded of a conversation I had had the night before.  I was thinking, because I had talked to a local guy the night before about the famine in Mayo, about how extraordinary it was and how unbelievably catastrophic it was.  He talked about the famine villages around Delphi and that neck of the woods.  He said they were like ghost villages and were kind of creepy.  When I saw the estates on my drive back home I thought they were exactly the same and that they were ghost estates.  It is funny because when one comes up with a term one does not realise that it will drop into the lexicon so quickly.  Obviously the &quot;breakfast roll man&quot; was building the &quot;ghost estates&quot;.  All these things happened but the ghost estates are indicative of how supply does not respond.<br\/><br\/>One wonders why people behave like this.  I want the committee to understand, at the very beginning, why the economy behaves like this.  People behave like this because we are all impacted by each other.  Economists think we are all rational.  We are not.  We are highly irrational.  Has anyone every met a more irrational animal than us?  We fall in love, we follow stupid football teams - all the things that make no sense.  The reason is that everything we do is impacted by other people.  <br\/><br\/>A couple of months I was in the Aviva stadium with my son.  In Dublin, there are two types of people.  There are those people who buy their own tickets to the Aviva and there those people who get paid to go to the Aviva.  I fall into the former camp.  I remember Ireland scored three tries against Australia in the first 18 minutes.  Even though I had really good seats with my 12-year old I saw none of the tries.  Why?  Every time the Irish team did well everyone seated in front of us stood up.  Then I had to stand up and my kid had to stand up and get on my shoulders.  Then the people behind me had to stand up and that continued for all the people behind them.  That is exactly how the economy works too.  The fellas who stood up first had no idea they were sending a signal to me to stand up because I was behind them.  I had no idea that I was impairing the view of the people behind me.  We had all paid to sit in the Aviva but we ended up standing.  That is how is the economy behaves.  When people see house prices rising in Ireland they buy houses, if they can, not because they want them but because other people are buying them.  That type of herd behaviour is essential to understand why a property boom in a country like ours, if it is not controlled, gets totally and utterly out of hand unless of course one is lending to this property boom in which case one is making money so does not care.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Mr. David McWilliams:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The question is, why did the banks not see this?  Why did they not see that their own balance sheets were being impaired?  I believe it is because banks' balance sheets play tricks on them.  Every time a chunk of money goes into the economy, house prices rise.  That means the banks' collateral rises so they feel safe.  Every time the collateral rises they feel safer and safer and ultimately they lend more and more and more.  Then, if one's bonus is related to one's share price one has a greater interest in lending more because lending more makes one rich and gives one profits.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015022600002#A00100","speaker":"990","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424908800,"counter":11,"content":"<p>Move towards a conclusion now Mr. McWilliams because we also have to ask you some questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015022600002#D00200","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424908800,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I am trying to get to the point of why this economy works as it does and why we need to have a set of views of the economy which reflect what actually happens in reality and not in some dream world of academia.  I am saying the banks' balance sheets play tricks on them and they ultimately go bust.  Why is that?  Because they are allowed to borrow yet more.  They keep borrowing and the balance sheets look fine.  Then they realise the more they borrow, the worse the balance sheet is, but they do not see it.<\/p> <p> Why did the interest rate not rise?  It was because we are in the EU.  We have this crazy situation in that we have decided we are Germans.  What is that all about?  Ireland does most of its trade with Britain and the US, yet we have a currency attached to Germany.  Somebody else may elucidate as to why that is.  When German interest rates fall, our interest rates fall too.  When our interest rates fall there is no warning sign from outside.  That is hugely important because it is material to the next ten years, not just the last ten years.  <\/p> <p> We also have an issue with groupthink.  Why did nobody, or very few, speak out?  I believe groupthink is something that happens in many aspects.  I believe that if one has ideas in Ireland which are beyond the mainstream, those ideas go through three phases.  The first phase is open ridicule, the second phase is violent opposition and both of these happened to me.  The third phase is where we are now which is that everybody pretends they were on one's side all the time.  This is what happens.  Groupthink shifts because it is a conventional wisdom.  We can talk about this during the questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015022600002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. David McWilliams"},{"type":"speech","time":1424908800,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I will ask that you wrap up please Mr. McWilliams.

They understood that once credit was put into the mix, it profoundly changes the way people behave.  Members will know this from talking to their constituencies.  Kindleberger outlined the various stages of the cycle.  There are seven stages.<br\/><br\/>One is when something material happens or actually changes.  In our case we joined the European Monetary Union and our interest rates in the long term went from a real interest rate of about 6% down to almost zero.  Our interest rates fell which changed the landscape profoundly.  House prices begin to rise in this first stage of Kindleberg's model.<br\/><br\/>The second stage is euphoria.  People begin to think it is because of themselves that their house price is rising.  They think they are clever.  House prices continue to rise.  The third phase is gearing, which is when the banks get involved with the idea that one can remortgage a house to buy two gaffs in the Algarve.  Gearing means that the whole thing starts to get a little bit crazy.  The fourth phase is the mania phase when people become manic.  People actually flew to Bulgaria to buy houses, financed by their houses in Ireland.  Banks are now pushing the money.<br\/><br\/>The fifth phase is the bubble phase.  We all lived through it and know what it is.  The sixth phase in the Kindleberger cycle is the phase of distress.  This is when people start to dislike the smell of the situation.  Early people get out and start selling.  The seventh phase of the Kindleberger Minsky cycle is called <i>torschlusspanik, <\/i>a German phrase from when it happened in Germany and Austria in the 19th century.  It translates as shut door panic, when everybody jumps and runs for the door and tries to sell.  The whole thing collapses.  This happens in assets all the time and I could see this.  <br\/><br\/>There are three phases which happen next.  The first is the Minsky moment.  This is crucial because our banks had a Minsky moment in September 2008.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Mr. David McWilliams:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->A Minsky moment is when a bank realises it does not have any money and must sell good assets to pay for the losses on bad assets, because those assets are entirely bought on margin.  Once one buys something on margin, one is in the lap of the gods.  So we had Kindleberger's seven stages, then we had a crash and then came the Minsky moment where we had bank collapses.  Again, this is all in the book.  At that stage only massive state intervention can help.  It is described as requiring a hegemon, that is, a big country or large institution, a central bank or the ECB, say, to come in and right the situation.  That is because they, like me, do not believe in classical economics.  The economy will not right itself after this type of boom and there must be an intervention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015022600002#D01000","speaker":"990","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424908800,"counter":22,"content":"<p>That leads me to my last question.

What I was trying to explain, which had not really been explained before and certainly had not been explained to the Irish people by the policy makers, was that once one joins a monetary union, what one is effectively doing, if there is no regulation of one's banks, is getting the PIN number to the ATM card of the richest person in the room.  Of course, the richest person in the EU's room was Germany.  It was rich and it was in decline.  After reunification in the early 1990s, the united country swallowed up the former East Germany and it cost it a fortune to do so.  Germany's economy then began to stagger under the weight of those repayments and as a result of the cultural and demographic shift.  The country started to go into decline in the period from 1995 to 2005.  For Ireland, this meant our interest rates, which were really set for the Germans, went to levels that were totally inappropriate for the boom we were having.  It meant that the normal way in which one warns people that things are out of kilter, which is by setting higher interest rates, not only did not happen but we actually got lower interest rates.<\/p> <p>  I was trying to explain in the book where the money was coming from.  I remember going to pubs and people asking, \"Where is all this bloody money coming from?\".  I recall a builder friend of mine who worked with me years ago in Boston saying to me that the difference in Ireland at that time, compared with the past, was there was now no problem getting money.  For the 2005 book, I invented a German character whom I named Udo Lindenberg after a German crooner.  This guy was sort of the German version of France's Johnny Hallyday - not a great gig to attend, I suspect.  I invented the character and named him for this singer I had heard of.  Udo represented the old, parsimonious German saver.  Banks hate saving because they do not make any money on them.  In fact, they pay out for saving.  In that situation, they asked themselves who they could give them to in order to make money on Udo's savings, and over here was Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015022600002#E00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. David McWilliams"},{"type":"speech","time":1424908800,"counter":30,"content":"<p>I will bring Mr. McWilliams forward now to the very early part of September 2008.

Once one has defined that reality and got the facts, then one can do something about it.  Once something has been done about it, one can then face into the crisis.

If the United States could not let Lehman's go, with the deepest financial market, with the best central bank in terms of ability, with its own currency and with its own monetary policy, we could not do that because it did not work in the States.  The second day after Lehman's failed, the Americans did what would be called the nationalisation route.  They nationalised AIG, the massive insurance company.  Nationalising would not have stopped the bank run in Ireland because the bank run was systemic in the sense that people were taking money out of all the banks, so you nationalise one but it just means that people will say, \"Who is next?\".  That is exactly what happened in America.<\/p><p> The next day Merrill Lynch went bust.  I did mention to the Minister that I found it ironic that his lead advisers were Merrill Lynch, people who could not even keep their own bank solvent, let alone advise others.  At the time, he was aware.  <\/p><p> The third option was that one of the big Irish banks would buy one of the small Irish banks, the idea being if you have a big balance sheet, you can actually take over a smaller balance sheet but I said to him at the time that all the Irish balance sheets were bust because we all knew they were doing the same thing.  So even without the figures, you knew that they were all bust.  I remember saying to him that I thought \"two bad balance sheets does not make a good one\".  <\/p><p> Then he said, \"What about the idea of giving a &euro;100,000 guarantee to depositors?\".  I said, \"That could work but you cannot really be half pregnant, Minister\" and I remember he kind of smiled at this.  I said that if until yesterday you said the banks are well capitalised and then tomorrow morning you say, \"Do you know what, not only are they not well capitalised, they are going to bust but we will protect some people\".  When the hot money is owned by people in trading floors, that does not cut it.  In fact, that proved to be the case.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Mr. David McWilliams:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->A limited &euro;100,000 guarantee was introduced on the Friday after that and it did not work as money continued to flow out.

It is only as a last resort and I remember saying to the Minister, \"I don't know; I don't have the facts, but I think we are at the last resort.  What you have got to do [this is very important for the record and it is written down in black and white in all of my documents] is you have got to introduce a holding guarantee which buys you the time to allow your auditors and your civil servants to go in and find out the facts.

However, in all cases, there is a distinction between debt and equity for corporate finance receiverships.  Equity like instruments are never included and subordinated or junior debt is subordinate to or underneath and at no stage did I ever imagine that such debt would be included and the reason is that it is known that in all corporate finance receiverships subordinated debt is an equity like instrument.  It comes at the very, very last and has many more of the characteristics of a share than a bond.  You get paid more to hold the subordinated debt, so you are being paid for the risk.

That model came about as a result of a big collapse there in the 1980s and 1990s where eventually they realised the cost of bank bailouts was going to be too much.  They decided that what they were going to do was force the bondholders - the debtholders - to take equity which made them shareholders in the banks which, in a way, allied the banks and shareholders in the same place.  That was increasingly my thinking and then the following became so obvious to me after NAMA.  What NAMA did with the guarantee was it ensured that this country would end up selling our assets at a discount and buying our liabilities at a premium.  That is morally wrong but is also a financial disaster.  At that point we had created the ELA or emergency liquidity assistance.  That meant the banks' liquidity was solid so one could have rescinded the guarantee, kept NAMA in place and nothing would have happened because the ECB was back in there and the Central Bank was back in.

In a small country one gets significant vested interested.  When a small country experiences a banking and property boom many people will make a lot of what looks like very easy money.  That cohort of people have a clear incentive to vilify the maverick.<\/p> <p>  With respect to my own profession of economics, it amazed me at the time that so few, in any positions of power, did anything or said anything.  I have found it amazing that people were swanning around with titles like bank expert and international bank expert.  I said \"Well, hold on a second.  You were living in the country that had the most catastrophic bank crisis and you didn't open your beak.\"  People watching this are entitled to ask that question.  <\/p> <p>  There is a thing in Ireland which I refer to as conventional wisdom.  When conventional wisdom sets in it is repeated by serious people.  People say \"He is not a serious person but I am a serious person because the guy beside me is a serious person.\"  Then he repeats the mantra and then mantras replace hard thinking.  Once mantras replace hard thinking then every serious person buys into them.  J.K. Galbraith said something very interesting about changing one's mind.  It is very hard to change one's mind if one is a serious person.  He said that when faced with the choice of changing one's mind or finding the proof that indicates one does not have to, the vast majority gets busy finding the proof.  Let us consider that thought in the context of this country.  People like me were regarded with the view that it could not possibly be right, what this guy is saying, because the vista is too apocalyptic.  One of the views was \"Ah but he spent too much time abroad.\"  <\/p> <p>  I feel, and this is worrying for subsequent future years, that when this society coalesces around what I would call a simple truth, such as there will be a soft landing or the banks are well capitalised, it is an extraordinarily dangerous place to be.  It means that, like lemmings, we all go over the cliff together.  <\/p> <p>  As I have always thought, if one thinks of a quadrant of maverick, consensus, right and wrong, which applies to politics as well, if one is in that consensus and one is wrong then people adopt the view that we are all wrong together and sure that is grand.  People think \"We are all a bit stupid but we are all stupid together\".  If one is in the consensus and one is right people think \"Sure, we are all geniuses, that is great. Jesus, you are smarter than me.  Oh my God, you are outrageously smart.\"  If one is a maverick and one is wrong then one is a maverick that is wrong.

How did that happen?  There are many theories but one in particular struck me.  What actually happened was that when they plundered all the gold from Latin America, it became easier not to work.  Huge swathes of the Spanish manufacturing and agricultural sectors stopped because the Spaniards did not bother working.

If the Deputy thinks about it, if one puts money into land in Ireland, how many tax breaks does one get?  Loads.  How much cheap capital does one get?  Loads.  Why does one get cheap capital?  It is because the banks say they know what land smells and feels like.  However, take someone like Apple&rsquo;s founders.  They tell the banks they are going to build the most amazing computers out of a garage and will need X millions of euro to do so but have no guarantees or collateral, just that it is all in their head.  The banks will not give someone like that money.<\/p> <p>  What I was trying to explain in the historical context was that one part of our economy would become bloated with capital while another part would become totally starved.  That is where we have to got to in Ireland.  We have a massively efficient multinational sector but very little domestic industry.  I believe this is because the way which Irish capital was given out in the boom, namely that it always favoured land.  At the very top of the boom, 88% of every single loan given out by an Irish bank in this country was to a property or property-related investment.  When one allows the banks be the sole arbiter of the distribution of capital, one will get endemic short-termism.  Why?

Deputy Doherty will know this as someone from Letterkenny.  If the Irish currency is overvalued relative to sterling, the currency of our major trading partner, Irish people go across the Border to buy stuff.  We have a living economic experiment in Dundalk, Letterkenny and Lifford.  During the currency crisis I pointed out to one of our bosses who was claiming there would be no crisis or devaluation that the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>was reporting on these queues of punters, although they were probably driving Ford Escorts rather than Toyota Corollas at the time.  I got the impression that sometimes when one was inside, one was being dictated to by the tyranny of one's own peer group.

In 2000 I came up with a backward looking house price index whereby the last house price increase was divided by the average of the index and then multiplied by the loan-to-value ratio, which means that the increase in prices reduces the amount of money that can be lent.  It would be a dynamic system which could regulate itself.  That is how one should do it.  It is a simple statistical rule and it would be unbelievably easy to put in place.

If, for example, the regulator saw that a bank had just issued a short-term liquidity instrument of &euro;500 million, which was happening all the time, it could have said, \"Hold on a second, you cannot do that.\"  The regulator would manage the bank's liabilities, which are the source of its delinquency, and as a consequence the bank would not be able to lend for commercial property.

Our objective was similarly to stop a bank run.  Sweden quickly realised it would have to set up a bad bank and it did so extremely quickly.  It wrote down the assets very quickly and minimised the cost.  However, it also devalued its currency by 40%.  Once a country devalues its currency, it is back to life.  What happened in Ireland's banking crisis was that, amazingly, not only did we not devalue our currency, but it actually increased in value between 2008 and 2010.

At the time we had a banking system that had been set up to fail.  It was not a matter of \"if\", it was a matter of \"when\".  The combination of hot money and a bank run is the most vicious and contagious financial episode one can imagine.  It is the financial equivalent of Ebola.  One needs to come in with all possible interventions to reduce the perceived risk in the minds of people that their money will not be there when they go to the bank tomorrow.  That is crucial.  Much of my testimony has been about how, in God's name, did we let it get to that situation.  Once one is in that situation, however, one has to ask whether one knows the facts and, if one does not, whether one should take the risk that not knowing the facts might imperil the banking system.

There had to be negotiations with the ECB to say the Government needed emergency liquidity.

People do what people do and this constantly underscores the need for strong, independent, highly vigilant regulators.  The most important point about regulation is that one can have the best regulation in the world but if one does not police it, it is not worth the paper on which it is written.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Mr. David McWilliams:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->As such it is better to have fewer points of regulation which are well policed rather than to have pages and pages of unpoliced regulations.

I would have thought - and I said it in all my writings - that the normal rules of corporate finance should apply in the case of insolvency.

Then one would have lined up all the creditors in a room and had a bank resolution mechanism as that is the system whereby we as a society deal with bad banks.  At the very top, one would have what I call \"trust creditors\".  They are creditors in trust, which is to say depositors.  When my mum goes to put her savings into the bank, she does not realise that technically she is lending money to the bank.  In her head, it is a nest egg, something for grandchildren and what she has put away for a rainy day.  She does not have any realisation that technically in the event of a bankruptcy, she is a lender.  Therefore, my solution, as I wrote at the time, was that as simple depositors trust the system, they should be regarded as trust creditors and encircled.  Under that, one then has the normal hierarchy of creditors which everybody understands.  It happens every single day in this country in receiverships.  That is the system we could still have.  That answers the Deputy's question.

This materialised rapidly in the significant growth of the Swedish economy in the 18 months after their banking crisis.  My feeling was and to a degree still is that the NAMA process was so slow in writing down and it never freed up the banks that had got the stuff off their balance sheets to begin the process of lending.

UBS was saying if the stream of income from the commercial property goes to zero, the loan goes bad immediately.  The only way the loan can be made good is if one continues to lend money against it, which is what happened in Ireland.  This is the type of analysis UBS would have come up with and it would have said a chunk of the balance sheet could go bust.

Along with the rest of the nation, I am looking forward to learning about many of the specific events and decisions leading up to the Irish banking crisis.  In contrast, however, I will concentrate on addressing today's brief, which concerns the international, European and Irish policy context of the banking crisis.  In doing so, I will be presenting a macroeconomic analysis of the overall crisis which still faces the world's peoples today, at least seven years after its inauguration.<br\/><br\/>It is important to understand that the situation affecting Ireland at the time of the banking guarantee cannot be characterised only as a financial crisis.  Instead, Ireland at this time was caught up in a perfect storm, one whose great winds have periodically abated only to blow up again.  It is popular in some quarters to refer to Ireland's crisis as homegrown, and it is certainly true that one storm front blew up within the borders of Ireland.  However, 2008 saw the tragic convergence of this front with two other influences, one the global storm of the international crisis of global neoliberalism.  This blew Ireland against the other influence, namely, the unforgiving shores of the euro system.  We do not have to go all the way back to the proverbial butterfly flapping its wings to find the origins of this maelstrom.  The global crisis, the European crisis and the Irish crisis all find their origins in the same basic institutions of the age.  All are rooted in the four institutions of globalisation, neoliberalism, repression of labour and financialisation.<br\/><br\/>What are these institutions?  Globalisation<i><\/i>is the disintegration of production processes into their component parts and the location of each of these components in that area of the world most congenial to making profits.  The production process is then reintegrated through free trade across borders.  This process brings employers and workers face to face across the globe.  Neoliberalism<i><\/i>is a complex phenomenon.  It can perhaps be most succinctly described as market fundamentalism, a belief that important social decisions about production and income distribution are almost always and everywhere best left to be determined in markets.  This idea manifests itself in institutions like the World Trade Organisation, policies like deregulation and privatisation and ideologies like free market economics.  The repression of labour<i><\/i>involves the erosion of the power of labour to defend its organisations, working conditions and standard of living.  It is most dramatically evidenced in the decline in union density.  Financialisation<i>, <\/i>according to the American economist Jerry Epstein, &quot;refers to the increasing importance of financial markets, financial motives, financial institutions, and financial elites in the operation of the economy and its governing institutions, both at the national and international level&quot;.<br\/><br\/>All these institutions date from the early 1980s.  Their beginnings are marked by the political victories of Ronald Reagan in the United States and Margaret Thatcher in the United Kingdom.  These new institutions can be collectively labelled the era of global neoliberalism.  This new stage of capitalism at first led to recovery.  In the 1970s, capitalism was in a period which has come to be known as the Great Stagflation, a condition of simultaneous high unemployment and high inflation which was unpredicted by the Keynesian economics of the time.  Together, globalisation, financialisation, neoliberalism and the loss of labour influence led to a period known in some quarters as the Great Moderation.  Profit rates, which had been falling from the late 1960s, bottomed out in the early 1980s and over time returned to their previous levels.  Growth recovered, although it did not reach the standards of the earlier post-Second World War period.  Employment rose and inflation fell and remained low.<br\/><br\/>However, this economic recovery is only one side of the story.  The same set of institutions which led to the global neoliberal recovery from stagflation would eventually create the most serious economic crisis since the Great Depression.  Problems became evident almost immediately.  Globalisation led to the unification of previously separate national markets for goods and services.  Competition within this new larger market led to the emergence of excess capacity in many industries.  Labour's loss of bargaining power led to the stagnation of real median family income in the United States.  This wage stagnation occurred despite the continual increase in the productive capacity of labour.  These two factors, excess capacity and stagnant wages, led to a rate of investment which, while positive, was relatively sluggish by historical standards.  This relatively sluggish investment was accompanied by restored profitability.  If the restored profits were not being invested in productive plant and equipment, where could they go?  Financialisation made it increasingly easy to fund the purchase of various categories of assets, driving up their prices and creating capital gains, which could only encourage further speculation in asset prices.  Borrowing on the basis of rising asset prices temporarily sustained demand in the face of sluggish investment and stagnant wages.  When the asset bubble burst, however, the full force of listless investment and low wages was felt in the emergence of what was, in Keynesian terms, a crisis of inadequate demand.  For the ordinary household, it was a crisis of unemployment.<br\/><br\/>That is the global context and, naturally, we are much more concerned with the specific situation of Ireland.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Professor Terence McDonough:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->A close look at the origins of the Celtic tiger, however, reveals that it was a creature of these same four institutions of global neoliberalism, namely, globalisation, neoliberalism, the repression of labour and financialisation.  As is often the case in Ireland, we had to wait a few years for the advent of global neoliberalism - Irish style.  For Ireland, the key date is 1987.  A neoliberal approach to government in Ireland began when a minority Fianna F&aacute;il Government came to power in 1987.  Minority status led to seeking a consensus economic strategy which could attract the support of other parties.  It was supported by Fine Gael&rsquo;s adoption of the Tallaght strategy under the leadership of Alan Dukes.  Two years later the neoliberal Progressive Democrats entered coalition with Fianna F&aacute;il.  O&rsquo;Riain and O&rsquo;Connell summarise the turnaround in public spending:<blockquote><br \/><br \/>Restoring order to the public finances was achieved by severe cutbacks in public expenditure in 1987-1990.  Total current spending fell by over ten percentage points in real terms between 1987 and 1989.  Total current spending fell from 57% of gross national product in 1985 to 42% in 1990.<\/blockquote>The fall in expenditure created room for tax cuts.  The top rate of income tax fell from 60% to 48% over five years.  Basic corporate income tax rates also fell.<br\/><br\/>In addition to embarking on a new macroeconomic strategy, the new Fianna F&aacute;il Government also convened the first of a series of tripartite industrial negotiations leading to a national partnership agreement, the Programme for National Recovery, PNR.  For the unions&rsquo; part, they could sense a rightward shift in the political system and feared the Government might be capable of importing the Thatcherite strategy of a massive attack on the unions aimed at negating their economic, social and political influence.  The PNR established a neoliberal pattern of achieving wage moderation through the promise of future tax cuts.  Frank Barry calculates these tax cuts accounted for about one third of the increases in take-home pay to 2004.  Such moderation under social partnership led to a falling wage share.  The wage share was 71 % of gross domestic product in 1986 and fell to 54% in 2001.  Days lost through industrial disputes dropped off drastically beginning in 1987.  Accordingly, the repression of labour in Ireland led not to wage stagnation, as in the United States, but to wage moderation under social partnership.<br\/><br\/>The social partnership process was careful not to jeopardise Ireland&rsquo;s traditional internationalisation strategy.  Teague and Donaghey conclude that social partnership operated &ldquo;hand-in-glove with the wider policy of economic openness&rdquo;.  The Single European Act came into effect in 1987 and was approved by referendum in the same year.  The implementation of the Single Market coincides with a boom in foreign employment in Ireland, with such jobs growing by 50% between 1987 and 2000.  The Single European Act was accompanied by plans to expand Structural Funds spending.  Structural Funds were doubled in 1988 and again in 1993.  A new Industrial Development Agency, IDA, strategic plan was unveiled in 1983.  The new strategy would concentrate on technologically advanced firms with high potential for market growth.  These developments copperfastened globalisation as an essential element of Ireland&rsquo;s growth strategy.<br\/><br\/>The year 1987 also saw the investment hunting capacity of the IDA applied in a new realm.  It was decided by the incoming Government to target investment in international financial services through the establishment of the International Financial Services Centre, IFSC.  By 1999, attracted by light touch regulation, 66% of all FDI, foreign direct investment, inflows were accounted for by the IFSC.  It was the source of 24% of all services exports.  The IFSC would be an important conduit for foreign capital flows and was central to Ireland&rsquo;s participation in transnational financialisation.<br\/><br\/>Irish participation in the global neoliberal social order was no longer in doubt and this institutional framework underpinned the advent of the famous Celtic tiger.  Of course, the tiger is also now infamous because, as was the case at the global level, the elements of global neoliberalism would not only set the conditions for Ireland&rsquo;s rise but also its spectacular fall from grace.  Under Ireland&rsquo;s peculiar labour institutions, wages rose but the level of inequality rose much faster.  The fear of Thatcherism had fed into the formation of social partnership.  As noted before, wage moderation was traded for tax cuts.  This tendency was strongly reinforced by the perceived need to compete globally through low taxes and a neoliberal policy preference for minimising the capacity of the State.<br\/><br\/>The economic momentum of the Celtic tiger eventually fed into blowing up the real estate market.  Financialisation provided the wind beneath the wings of the Irish asset bubble.  Rising levels of inequality created an aspiration for levels of consumption which for many could not be supported from current income.  Rising house prices provided an expensive asset of expanding value for those in the housing market and collateral for borrowing by those who already owned their own homes.  Household debt rose from less than 120% of disposable income in 2003 to 220% in 2009.  The bubble in the property market provided an alternative source of government income through stamp duty and construction-related VAT, compensating to some extent for the overall low tax regime.<br\/><br\/>Ireland was now poised for crisis.  We had a property bubble which could be traced back to financialisation.  We had high levels of household debt which could be traced to the property bubble and rising inequality.  We had a low tax regime which could be traced back to the repression of labour, globalisation and neoliberalism.  The property bubble burst in 2007, endangering the banking system.  The global crisis hit in 2008, intensifying Irish problems.  The collapse of banking, construction and the tax regime produced a fiscal crisis.  The financial crisis, the fiscal crisis and unsustainable household debt then created an unemployment crisis.  It was at this point that the global storm front and the Irish turbulence combined ran up against the sea cliffs of the inflexible euro system.  This euro system was also rooted in global neoliberalism, a global neoliberalism - euro style.  The drive for globalisation led to the Single European Market.  Globalisation linked with financialisation to create the euro currency.  The Single European Market and the euro led to trade surpluses in some countries that were recycled into blowing up asset bubbles and trade deficits in other countries which weakened their fiscal positions.  Financialisation, linked with a strong dose of neoliberal ideology, led to a fiercely independent European Central Bank aggressively limiting its responsibility to inflation control.  Neoliberal ideas of small government and limited intervention in private markets, with the declining influence of labour, led to a monetary union without any fiscal capacity to address problems through increased government spending at European level.  Together the Single European Market, the euro, the European Central Bank and limited fiscal capacity can be said to constitute the euro system.<br\/><br\/>When the turbulence hit, the euro system made sure Ireland could find no haven through devaluing its currency, conducting an independent monetary policy or receive help through fiscal stimulus.  The euro rules have forced Ireland to cut spending and raise taxes in the teeth of a depression.  Instead of a port in the storm, the backwash from the euro cliff intensified the maelstrom.  On 29 September 2008, in the dead of night, Ireland desperately tried to signal for help, but the cannon broke loose and holed the ship of State below the waterline.<br\/><br\/>How could this catastrophe have been avoided?  The only path was to have seen the storm coming and been prepared for it.  This is not a question, as some have recommended, of hiring more economists in the Department of Finance.  In fact, professional politicians and professional economists in the lead up to these events all saw the world in much the same way.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Professor Terrence McDonough:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->In fact, professional politicians and professional economists in the lead up to these events all saw the world in much the same way.  To avoid the storm, both would have had to see the world differently.  I have lived for 20 years in Galway.  It is said of the weather in Galway that it is either raining or about to rain.  Similarly, in the mainstream economic view, the economy is either calm or rapidly becoming calmer.  This theory may barely pass muster in good times, but to prepare for a storm you have to see the economy as potentially tempestuous and riven with conflict and contradictions.  A view of the capitalist economy which ignores its historical dynamics, which sees it as a haven of harmonious give and take, a peaceful equilibrium of supply and demand, which works best when interfered with least, will inevitably lead to foundering on hidden shoals amidst unexpected turbulence.  This is where Ireland still finds itself today. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015022600002#V00200","speaker":"990","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424908800,"counter":439,"content":"<p>Thank you Professor McDonough.

While there is much emphasis placed on the financial troubles that faced Ireland, Europe and the larger global capitalist system, this should not blind us to the fact that there were other deeply rooted institutional factors.  These factors contributed to the inauguration of the crisis in 2008, but also seriously contributed to the failure to address that crisis in subsequent years.  These factors particularly relate to stagnant wages; the falling power of labour to defend its working conditions; low levels of investment closely related to high levels of excess capacity associated with globalisation on international markets; the inability of governments at local Irish level, at larger European level and at the global level to find a way to intervene to compensate for the financial chaos we faced; very low levels of private investment and the increasing inability of the ordinary person to prop up consumption in the economy because of falling wages and falling standards of living.<\/p> <p>  The crisis is broad but at the same time much deeper.

The separation of local governments from the ability to conduct their own monitoring policy has been extraordinarily damaging.

We resolved the 1980s crisis in a certain way and the way in which we resolved it formed the basis for continuing social change and continuing social struggle.  The upshot of those very institutions which resolved the crisis was ultimately, many years later, to set the stage for the crisis we face today.  That is one of the contradictions of history.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015022600002#AA00600","nonspeaker":"Professor Terrence McDonough"},{"type":"speech","time":1424908800,"counter":496,"content":"<p>One of the four institutions, the primary drivers of the economic model, Professor McDonough cites is what he terms \"the repression of labour\", which, he states, \"involves the erosion of the power of labour to defend its organizations, its working conditions and its standard of living\".

On the other hand, if one looks at labour's share of national income, labour's share of national income around 1980 was about 71%, that is, of everything produced in Ireland, 71% of it went to the working class or those represented by the labour movement.  By 2002, that figure was down to around 45%.  While labour succeeded in preventing an outright stagnation of wages, labour's relative weight in the economy, especially in terms of its income, declined quite drastically.
