The draft minutes of the meetings of 22 and 23 November have been circulated.  Are they agreed?  Agreed.  Are there any matters arising?  No.<\/p> <p>  We have received six items of correspondence, all of which are noted.  As the correspondence from Both Lives Matter only arrived this morning, we will come back to it next week as it contains the methodology used to back up its claim of lives saved by the unavailability of abortion in the North of Ireland.  The follow-up from Leah Hoctor about the calculation of gestation limits can be considered in the context of our report.  The other items of correspondence are listed.<\/p> <p>  Today we will conclude module 2 and we will finish our public meetings on module 3 tomorrow evening.  We must now start to complete the decision-making process that will allow us to report to the Oireachtas by 20 December, which is the three-month deadline imposed on us by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I suggest, therefore, that we commence the process next week as to when we can make decisions on modules 1 and 2, and the following week, on Wednesday, 13 December, we will consider the draft report which arises from the decisions made by the committee.  I think it unavoidable and necessary that we start the process next week, and early in the week if we have to, as otherwise we will be under pressure to meet the deadline and nobody wants that coming up to Christmas.  I have asked the secretariat to prepare a roadmap for modules 1 and 2.  The one for module 1 was circulated some weeks ago.<\/p><p>We can circulate that today and then discuss it at the commencement of our public business tomorrow.  I just wanted to give people a bit of notice of that in advance.<\/p><p> The clerk will have a briefing note highlighting the main issues we discussed with our experts in respect of each of the 13 reasons recommended by the Citizens' Assembly.

I apologise but this is longstanding commitment.  I hope that the committee might facilitate my request to have the votes, if any, taken in a block on Tuesday or Wednesday of the following week.

At this stage, I have more than two folders of information relating to module 2 so I think that it would be prudent that we have an opportunity next week to debate this information.  We need to look at every recommendation from the Citizens' Assembly.  We also need to examine the information we have received and tie it up with those recommendations.  It will probably take two or possibly three days next week to digest all of this information and establish what exactly it means for each particular recommendation.  If we could do this next week, that would clear the way for having a series of votes on Tuesday week so as to finalise what the committee is recommending.  We will then be looking at a draft report immediately after that.  From my point of view, I would certainly like some conversation next week regarding the information we have received and how it affects the recommendations, one way or the other.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017112900002#B00800","speaker":"1280"},{"type":"speech","time":1511962200,"counter":14,"content":"<p>Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith proposed voting before next week but that would mean doing so tomorrow.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017112900002#B00900","speaker":"1336"},{"type":"speech","time":1511962200,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I propose voting on just one issue, namely, whether to hold a referendum on repeal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017112900002#B01000","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1511962200,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I have the floor.

I am a consultant in foetal medicine practising in England at Birmingham Women&rsquo;s and Children&rsquo;s Hospital.  My special interests are in the prenatal diagnosis and management of foetal disease, the management of women with congenital heart disease and the management of multiple pregnancies.  Within my management of foetal disease, is included the diagnosis of differences in the foetus by ultrasound scan, preforming invasive prenatal diagnostic techniques such as amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling, CVS, performing invasive prenatal sampling such as drainage of fluid collections within a foetus which may be life threatening and also, where appropriate, counselling with regards to termination of pregnancy.<\/p> <p>  The unit where I work, Birmingham Women&rsquo;s and Children&rsquo;s Hospital is in the West Midlands and delivers approximately 8,000 women each year.<\/p><p>The West Midlands has a population of 5.5 million and my unit is the regional foetal medicine unit.  We perform over 7,000 ultrasound scans, 410 invasive procedures checking the chromosomes of babies, 48 intrauterine blood transfusions and around 40 fetoscopic laser ablations.  We also perform a number of other invasive tests, included selective reductions which I may mention later.  The unit is a supraregional referral centre for the management of feto-fetal transfusion syndrome and its management by fetoscopic laser ablation.<br\/><br\/>I have had an opportunity to present to the Citizens' Assembly and I am happy to discuss with the committee the care pathways of the termination of pregnancy under clause E in England, the experience of some Irish women that we have come into contact using these services and some suggestions regarding the use of the term fatal or lethal abnormality.  I do not intend in my introduction to cover all of the aspects that I covered in my paper.  Having said that, I am happy to expand on that with questioning.  <br\/><br\/>I am sure that all of the members are aware that 40 years ago the Westminster Parliament passed a Private Members' Bill ensuring that doctors who performed abortions, under certain conditions, would not be performing an unlawful act.  This law has never been adopted in Northern Ireland.  The law was subsequently amended by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990.  It is still an offence to perform an abortion unless two independent medical practitioners are of the opinion, formed in good faith, which is an important phrase, that the case meets at least one of the required criteria.<br\/><br\/>I hope to speak to the committee about clause E which states: &quot;there is a substantial risk that if the child were born it would suffer from such physical or mental abnormalities as to be seriously handicapped&quot;.  The British Parliament has never sought to define what is meant by the words &quot;substantial&quot; or &quot;serious&quot;.  The matter has been left to be decided in good faith by the medical profession.<br\/><br\/>It is important to note that clause E of the termination Act is not gestation dependant.  According to the Office for National Statistics in the UK, as many as 190,000 abortions were performed in England and Wales in 2016.  Of these, however, only 3,200 were performed under clause E.  As in the Republic of Ireland, the main foetal anomaly ultrasound scan is performed at approximately 20 weeks gestation in England and Wales.  Despite this only 500 of the 3,200 abortions, that I have mentioned, were performed after 22 weeks of pregnancy.  Also, there were 140 selective terminations of pregnancy, involving multiple pregnancies and over three quarters of these were under clause E.  These can be life-saving procedures for the co-twin and I have described one such case in the case studies that I have submitted.  Over half of these terminations of pregnancy are performed for chromosomal or central nervous system differences in the foetus. <br\/><br\/>In 2016, 3,265 Irish women had a termination of pregnancy in England and Wales.  Of these 140 had a termination under clause E of the Act.  Again, the foetal indications are predominantly chromosomal or central nervous system differences.<br\/><br\/>As explained in previous sessions that I have read, detailed anomaly scans of foetuses are performed at approximately 20 weeks gestation, though the availability appears to be much less in Ireland than it is in the UK.  In England and Wales if a difference is found in a foetus, a pathway is followed that may include a second local scan to confirm the diagnosis by an obstetrician with a special interest in fetal medicine.  The second scan should be performed within five working days.  In some cases local obstetricians will be able to fully counsel women on the outlook for their baby.  In other cases, referral to a recognised foetal medicine unit will take place.<br\/><br\/>We attempt to see women within three working days at my foetal medicine unit and that is the standard that has been set nationally.  When we see these women we scan them, then sit them in a more homely room and counsel them and their families in the presence of a midwife.  All options are discussed with the women including, where appropriate, intrauterine foetal therapy and the termination of pregnancy.  On leaving the woman is given a detailed report that is read through with her prior to her leaving and contact numbers for the fetal medicine centre are given.  A sub-group of women may need additional investigations, both invasive and non-invasive, and some will require counselling by a specialist in another field.  It is important to acknowledge that women will need differing amounts of time to come to terms with this information and make their decisions.<br\/><br\/>If the woman opts to terminate her pregnancy this will be arranged at her local unit where she can get additional family support.  Depending on the gestational age, both surgical and medical termination techniques are discussed with these women.  As there is an increasing chance of foetuses being born alive after 22 weeks of gestation, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists recommends that the foetal heart is stopped by performing feticide prior to the termination of pregnancy for cases after 22 weeks of gestation unless the abnormality is not compatible with life.  <br\/><br\/>If the woman opts for a medical termination of pregnancy then a tablet, an anti-progestagen, is administered and admission arranged for induction of labour with prostaglandins about 36 hours later.  Around 95% of women will deliver on the day they receive their prostaglandins.  A small proportion will require a second course.  An infection, haemorrhage and retained placental tissue are the main short-term complications of the procedure.  For the Irish women that we see in our unit, we complete the termination process in Birmingham but once discharged the women return to Ireland.  While in Birmingham, they often express the difficulties that they have with regard to the limited number of people who they can discuss this scenario with and gain support from.  <br\/><br\/>Finally, I would like to mention the concept of fatal or lethal conditions.  If the law in Ireland is to change and the termination of pregnancy is allowed for foetal differences, I would urge the committee not to make a list as with the ever changing progress in medicine conditions would need to be added and removed from the list on a regular basis.  I would also strongly advise against being prescriptive and using the term lethal or fatal abnormality.  The problem is there is no agreed definition as to what lethal means.  Does it mean that all foetuses with the condition will die before birth?  Does it mean that all foetuses will die either before birth or in the neonatal period despite supportive therapy?  Does it mean that a baby will usually dies in one of these two periods?  Finally, has it just been noted that there is an association between the condition and death?<br\/><br\/>For the information of members, I included two tables from a publication by Wilkinson <i>et al<\/i>in the paper that I submitted to the committee.  The first of these lists the commonest conditions named in the medical literature that is said to be lethal foetal malformations.  The same paper quotes the longest age of survival for these conditions, and since this publication survival until 13 months has been reported in a case of renal agenesis.  Therefore, counselling women whose pregnancies are complicated by a foetus with a severe abnormality is not a binary state of affairs but rather a complex discussion that requires a description of risk and probability.<br\/><br\/>Last year, over 3,000 women travelled from Ireland to England to terminate their pregnancies.  Approximately 140 of them had a termination because their foetus was thought to have &quot;a substantial risk that if the child were born it would suffer from such physical or mental abnormalities as to be seriously handicapped&rdquo;.  The care pathway that is followed by Irish women is sub-optimal, removes them from their support network and is only available to a sub-set of women who are able to initiative their contacts with units in England.  <br\/><br\/>Finally, if legislation is brought in for foetal conditions, particular care must be taken when using the phrase &quot;lethal or fatal&quot;.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017112900002#C02400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Thompson","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511962200,"counter":61,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Thompson for his presentation.

As a result of the history of the law on abortion in Ireland, it will be very difficult for Ireland's obstetricians to decide.  If it is decided in law that a fatal condition is one in which the baby always dies <i>in utero<\/i>, then we must consider that those conditions are exceptionally rare.  As the committee can see in the other table I submitted, even babies with trisomy 18 have been noted to survive following birth, although very rarely.  I worry that if the term &quot;fatal&quot; is used, some would argue that everything is fatal.  The contrary argument is that nothing is fatal because it does not result in a death in every single case.  A baby could live for a short period after birth.  That is my main consideration about the term &quot;fatal&quot;.<br\/><br\/>There was a first part to the question.  Is it impossible to draw up a list?  One could draw up a list of severe conditions if one could decide on one of those four different definitions.  One could draw up a list of severe conditions that would be appropriate for termination of pregnancy in Ireland.  The problem is that more conditions are being diagnosed all the time.  Another condition might then need to be added.  Alternatively, we might find a cure for one of the conditions on the list.  I am concerned that legislators in Ireland would constantly have to revisit the list in a circular fashion trying to tick things off and put things on.  In my experience of legislation, that can take quite a considerable amount of time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017112900002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Thompson"},{"type":"speech","time":1511962200,"counter":66,"content":"<p>Clause C was amended by the UK Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990.

Mr. Thompson is aware of those recommendations.  Some relate to conditions resulting in death before or shortly after birth.  Whether it is a good or bad idea is really a matter for the citizens because that is what has been given to us.  We have to consider that and we have to contemplate what recommendations we will make and how they will translate into the medical community.  I fear that as we are sitting here trying to come up with the report, there are doctors and clinicians watching proceedings at home, tearing their hair out and shouting at the screen that this will not work for them in practice.  We want to be respectful and mindful of the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly but we equally have to come up with something that is fit for purpose and which translates into medical practice for people.

Mr. Thompson is dedicated to saving life and we are having conversations here about term limits, gestational stages, survival rates and all of that.  I am concerned that we are trying to frame our work into a preconceived diagram and, at this stage, there is no need for that.  We should trust experts in their field, such as Mr. Thompson, to progress their education and progress medicine.  I am starting to think we should just let the doctors, the experts, deal with this.<\/p> <p>  Has Mr. Thompson ever encountered a person in the UK who has been compelled or forced against her will to terminate a pregnancy?  There is almost a narrative here - this is obviously non-evidence based from what I can see - that doctors might be encouraging people to terminate.  However, based on Mr. Thompson's evidence, it appears that he does a lot of work to counsel people, advise them on their situation and help them through it.  I ask him to speak to that.<\/p> <p>  I also ask him to speak to the psychological and mental stress on families - mothers, fathers and other children - that can arise from a diagnosis of foetal abnormality, usually fatal.  Does he have any figures for marital breakdown as a result of such a catastrophic diagnosis?  The previous speakers mentioned this and I have spoken about it previously.  With advances in medicine, children are surviving from just over 24 weeks, which would have been unheard of a decade ago.  I support my colleagues in that we have to be very careful about putting in parameters, particularly when medicine is advancing so quickly and when children who would not have survived ten years ago might survive in the future.<\/p> <p>  As Deputy O'Reilly said, the 20-week scan is not available outside of the Dublin hospitals.  Professor Louise Kenny from Cork addressed the Joint Committee on Health on this matter.  Mr. Thompson spoke about diabetic women and other women with congenital defects themselves.  We are missing one per week in Ireland where it is the wild card.  It is the 20-year old who has a child with whatever condition.  Clearly, we have issues in this country with 20-week scans.  I do not want to misquote Professor Kenny, but I think her words were that one child a week is being born in circumstances that are not ideal and that these children should obviously be delivered in our teaching hospitals.  I ask Mr. Thompson to address those points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017112900002#F01000","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1511962200,"counter":90,"content":"<p>I wish to add to the Deputy's final point.  As a junior doctor, I found it was quite difficult to come to terms with risk and why certain people have babies with abnormalities and who are the high-risk people.  The easiest analogy I can see in our practice is that everybody talks about older women being at increased risk of having babies with Down's syndrome.  However, most babies with Down's syndrome are born to younger women.  That is because younger women have more children.  It is just a factor of how many children are born in that cohort.  If only women over a certain age are screened - when I started my career it was those over 37 in the UK - then the majority of babies with Down's syndrome will not be picked up.<\/p> <p>  I am trying to work backwards through some of the questions.  There are figures on marital breakdown.  I think there are well-published figures on marital breakdown in families where a baby has been born with trisomy 21.  I would not like to quote what they are, but they are definitely there.  The psychological and mental stress that people go through when they have a baby with a difference is huge.  I do not want to talk about clauses C and D, because that is not part of my practice any more.  However, the babies in the cohort we are talking about are very different because these are wanted babies where women have gone a significant part of the way through their pregnancies telling their families they are going to have a child and when the child is going to be born.<\/p><p>They then get this devastating news that the baby has some major difference.  We should not be sidelined by the occasional story of babies with talipes or cleft lip or the like, we should be concentrating on the major differences that these babies have.  More than half of them have significant chromosome or central nervous system differences.  This puts the parents under huge stress and makes it difficult for them to make these decisions.  We never give a diagnosis and then agree to a termination on the same appointment unless we are giving a second opinion to another centre.  If people had been given a diagnosis at another centre, decided that they wanted somebody else to check, and had already been given all of the information, then we would agree to terminate at that point.  Otherwise, however, we make parents go away and think about things.  <\/p><p> In response to the question on preconceived parameters and leaving matters to the medical profession, I think that the medical profession in Ireland would want some support from the Legislature.  I come back, however, to the section of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority Act, HFEA, which talks about two independent clinicians coming to an opinion formed in good faith.  I can essentially make a decision that could be wrong but if I have done so in good faith then I would be acting within the law.  This is very important because we as a profession try to keep up to speed with professional development - I would like to think that I certainly do.  Nobody gets everything right all the time, however, and we have to acknowledge that.  None of us in any walk of life would say that we are perfect, but if a doctor makes a decision in good faith then that is what the law needs to protect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017112900002#F01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Thompson","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511962200,"counter":92,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Thompson very much.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017112900002#G00200","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speech","time":1511962200,"counter":93,"content":"<p>The Deputy has another minute or so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017112900002#G00300","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speech","time":1511962200,"counter":94,"content":"<p>God, I never have extra time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017112900002#G00400","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speech","time":1511962200,"counter":95,"content":"<p>We are very impressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017112900002#G00500","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speech","time":1511962200,"counter":96,"content":"<p>Dr. Thompson mentioned foeticide being performed prior to the delivery of a child with complex abnormalities.

Once the foetus is born it becomes a baby and it is important to realise that whereas the foetus has no rights in the United Kingdom, the second it is born it acquires full rights.  In the UK, then, one might end up with the scenario in which a woman undergoes a termination of pregnancy without the performing of foeticide only for the baby to be resuscitated afterwards.  One would then have turned a scenario involving a foetus with an abnormality into one involving a premature baby with an abnormality, thus making the whole situation worse.

Following up on his last point, I think he has touched on something very important with regard to how we define what is fatal.  Dr. Thompson is absolutely correct - once we are born we are all fatal.   To try to put legislative structures on words and definitions can, as Dr. Thompson has recounted from his own experience, take a very long time.  There was a case in Britain some time ago - I cannot remember the name - in which debate and discussion of legislative changes in the High Court resulted in a long period of suffering for a woman and her child.  I would like to say openly to everybody here that we have to be careful about the words we use when we are advising on the kind of legislation we want and we have to be mindful of some of the matters that Dr. Thompson has pointed out.  He has pointed out some very serious issues that we have to grapple with here.  One that struck me was the fact that some women present late with crisis pregnancies involving severe foetal disability because of poorer socioeconomic conditions.  We have to be very mindful of such cases because, in looking at how we structure some kind of legislation, we have to remember that the Citizens' Assembly very passionately wanted it added to the discourse that socioeconomic factors play a major role in forming the outcome of their discussions.<\/p> <p>  I would like to pick up on a number of points, some of them in the same vein as Deputy O'Connell's questions about foeticide.  I understand that an injection goes straight into the heart and stops it beating.  This injection is lethal - it paralyses the foetus and kills it.  Is there evidence, however, that such an injection causes pain?  I ask Dr. Thompson to expand on the discussion of pain because it is often used in a very emotive way to argue against the treatment of pregnancy in this way.  I would also like Dr. Thompson to expand an another important point.  Women often look for options after they have had a scan at 20 weeks and they might need a follow-up scan very quickly within five days.  This is often not available to them in Ireland, however, and that puts them at a big disadvantage.<\/p><p>Although they may go to Britain and have that, they need the follow-up care, discussion and conversation, to have the important emotional, physical and medical understanding of everything they are going through.  Would Mr. Thompson agree that because they are forced out of Ireland and cannot get that care at home, where they are surrounded by family and other supports, they are particularly disadvantaged?  Those who talk about cruelty to a foetus or an unborn child often use the word \"baby\" but we have to also think about the cruelty to the woman who is being denied access to this kind of reproductive health.  I would like Mr. Thompson to comment on those points. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017112900002#G02000","speaker":"1367","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1511962200,"counter":112,"content":"<p>If we talk about late diagnosis, some conditions only present late.  The other case that I described in the papers, microcephaly, whereby the brain is not growing normally, usually only presents after 24 weeks.  Even if a woman has a history of having a previous baby with this, in many cases she has a 1:4 chance of having another baby affected in the same way.  We would have to scan those women all the way through their pregnancy.  Sometimes the head size appears normal until they get as far as 28 or 32 weeks and suddenly it becomes apparent that the baby has microcephaly.  That is important.<\/p> <p>  With regard to foetal awareness and pain, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists has studied the literature on this, and regularly comes out with definitions of it.  Last time it said the evidence that the foetus can and does experience pain is less compelling and accordingly the benefit of administering analgesia is less evident while the risk of the practicalities of so doing remain.  On the basis of first do no harm, prior to the procedure described in this report, analgesia is no longer considered necessary from the perspective of foetal pain or awareness.  The previous report had suggested that we should give analgesia to the foetus in case the foetus felt pain.  After that it suggested that it was not necessary.  I am not an expert on foetal pain but that is the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists' position.  <\/p> <p>  I think Irish women are greatly disadvantaged.  In the UK, not long ago, there was, and there still is, a shortage of sonographers and many units stopped doing 20 week scans.  We have had to train up many of our midwives who perform ultrasound scans to get a new cohort of professionals to do this.  It should be something that is available to everyone.  Ultrasound depends on how large the woman is, in women who are overweight the views are less good.  Women are often brought back for a second look.  We talked about doing it between 18 and 22 weeks but if we do it at 18 weeks we have to bring back a greater proportion of women for a second look and we end up doing more scans overall.  That is why most people settle for around 20 weeks as their best evidence.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017112900002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Thompson"},{"type":"speech","time":1511962200,"counter":113,"content":"<p>I note that a post mortem on the foetus is often recommended for medical information for future pregnancies.

The second point is that if a woman hears this story, and how bad it is, it is quite distressing because she has lost her baby but she wants to know whether it is going to happen again.  We might be able to do the post mortem and say there is a 1:1000 chance this will happen again or we might find other differences in the baby as well.  That means that it would appear the baby has a syndrome and that syndrome has a higher recurrence risk, a 1:4 chance.  People will view those two facts very differently and can make decisions about their future reproductive life in the knowledge of what is there.

My first question, about the dangers of a strict definition of lethal abnormality, has been partly answered but could Mr. Thompson expand a bit on why the flexibility is important in terms of deferring to medical professions and say how that works in practice?  If the legislation is more flexible are there standard guidelines that the medical profession would work from or would it depend on the doctor or consultant a woman is assigned to?<\/p> <p>  Mr. Thompson mentioned in his presentation that when a woman is beyond 24 weeks' gestation a team of hospital managers, two clinicians, a neonatologist and a midwife meet to assess whether to perform the termination after 24 weeks.

I would like him to comment on it but if he does not want to that is fair enough.  It is ground D, when continuance of the pregnancy would have a harmful impact on the other children of the woman.  We have not discussed that very much, apart from the socio-economic grounds.  I do not know whether it would fall under that heading.

In the UK, two people have to fill out a form to say this woman meets the ground of one clause and most people were of the opinion that she must meet one but she can meet the grounds of several clauses.  The figures I have given are for E alone, and with any other clause.<\/p><p>I was not here to discuss clauses C and D.  I no longer do any gynaecology whatsoever, so I do not get involved in cases such as clauses C or D.  Cases such as clause D obviously impact on the family if there is a baby with a significant congenital abnormality.  In reality I believe that in almost every case where I agree to a termination for a significant foetal abnormality, I should probably also circle clause C, and if there are other children already present, I circle clause D.  I do not believe how it cannot have an impact on them.  I believe that more people should have multiple clauses circled but people tend not to do that.  If they hit one hurdle then that is all people tend to be concerned about.  If I scan a patient and the top of the baby's skull is not formed, the baby has anencephaly and the brain is being destroyed.  I would not think about the social scenarios so much with regard to whether I needed to circle that clause.<\/p><p> I will now turn to the dangers of sticking to strict definitions.  With regard to relative guidelines, there is no doubt that people do things differently in different units.  Everybody has to find their own way but in the UK one has to find what one believes to be significant and serious reasons.  Nobody can define what is right, but there has to be a standard deviation within which people fall.  In the UK, if we see a woman who has asked for a termination of pregnancy for a foetal abnormality and if I believed that it did not fulfil clause A, then I am duty bound to find her a second opinion.  The person who finds the second opinion may also say that he or she does not believe it either.  That would be one scenario.  I have come across cases where we have declined after 24 weeks.  Reference was made to the group and the people who refused in those cases were the people who actually do the procedure, the clinicians.  The others in the group had felt that the cases complied with the law and the people who performed the procedure did not.<\/p><p> In one situation, for example, which was a psychiatric case partly, the women said that she would kill herself if something did not happen.  We did not feel that it had been explained enough or that enough detail had been gone into at that stage.  We felt that we were only part way.  One of the interesting things I learned from that case was that we were put under a lot of pressure to do this and then we said, \"Are you going to sign one half of the form?\", but nobody was happy to sign the form.  They expected that we would.  It is very important that it is the relevant specialty person who signs in this regard.  If a doctor believes that a woman has a psychiatric illness and that is the reason she should have a termination of pregnancy, then psychiatrists need to be involved in it.  They should be giving the opinions in those cases.  I am not a psychiatrist.  They should sign half of the form and then I can be involved in meeting the woman and make a decision based on what they say.  If I agree, then I can sign the other half of the form.  Other relevant specialties need to be involved in the process also.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017112900002#H00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Thompson","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511962200,"counter":118,"content":"<p>I want to follow up on that point as it pertains to women in Ireland.

What people cannot do is flip between one decision and the other, and occasionally people do that.  They say they do not want to have a termination but then follow up and say they want one.  They come back and we discuss it and then they say they do not want it.

I am very concerned that we would think it is okay to abort babies because they are going to be disabled.  As Mr. Thompson has said, there is no way for a doctor to know how long these babies will live.  Many families have been in contact with me to say that they have treasured the time that they got to spend with their babies even though it was not for a long period.  Other families have told me that they were told that their babies would not live very long only to discover that the diagnosis was incorrect and the babies were born safely and enjoying life.<\/p> <p>  It is also worrying that in England and Wales something like Down's syndrome is seen as a reason to end a baby's life.  We have all become familiar with the terrible statistics that nine out of every ten babies are aborted in these countries when there is a diagnosis of Down's syndrome.  There is no reason the situation would be any different if abortion was introduced in Ireland.

As one can see, out of the 67 cases that were detected by screening 44 people opted to terminate their pregnancy.  That is not 90%.  That is a specific subgroup of people because between 30% and 40% of women have already opted out of this screening in the first place.

One ends up having a discussion with the woman on which option presents the lower risk.  In a case where there is a baby who is very unlikely to survive and another who seems to be completely normal, and where it is unlikely that either will be born alive if the pregnancy is continued, a selective reduction could decrease the chance of the normal baby dying.

I was fascinated by what Mr. Thompson had to say about seeking to distinguish between those children with Down's syndrome with normal hearts, as he put it, and those with abnormal hearts.  May I tell him something about children with Down's syndrome and their hearts as we experience it in Ireland?  Children with Down's syndrome generally have very big hearts.  There are thousands and thousands of people in Ireland who will tell Mr. Thompson about the love those children have brought into their lives.  They would tell him about how unexpected the outcome was in many cases and about how what seemed like a disaster when receiving the news turned out to be a situation which brought untold love into the house.  They would tell him how, far from causing mental health difficulties, the situation brought out the best in people as they had to discover and develop their caring sides.  I remember a conversation I had with one very senior politician, who is still serving.  He said that the child in his family who had Down's syndrome was the only one who really saw them all as equal and did not care about any of their achievements.  The child did not compare any of them with one other and just loved them all the same.<\/p> <p>  Does Mr. Thompson accept that thousands of people in Ireland, who are listening to these proceedings or who will hear about his words in the coming days, will be chilled to the marrow?  Does he accept that there are people who see that there are two lives to be cherished and protected in these situations?  Does he accept that there are those who would be horrified by the way Mr. Thompson talks about the paralysing of the child, or the foetus to use the clinical term, that he carries out as part of the foeticide procedure, or the way he suggests that the odd story of babies with cleft lips being aborted is something we should disregard, as though abortion on such a trivial ground was just a small thing to be disregarded, a mere medical detail?  Does he accept that he has an entirely different world view on this issue, perhaps from that of thousands of people in his own country but certainly from that of those who see two lives to be protected?  Perhaps the fact that he cannot even estimate the number of abortions he has carried out highlights that point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017112900002#M02000","speaker":"1401"},{"type":"speech","time":1511962200,"counter":182,"content":"<p>We will allow the witness to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017112900002#M02100","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1511962200,"counter":183,"content":"<p>I accept that I have differing opinions on many aspects of life, not just this one, from those of other people.

He has provided answers to many of my questions.  An Irish clinician who has dealt with women who travelled to the United Kingdom for abortions appeared before the committee.  For legal reasons, such doctors cannot refer the medical files of such women to a doctor in the United Kingdom.  That may give rise to difficulty in the case, for example, of a woman who is bipolar or on anti-psychotic medication.  What is Mr. Thompson's professional expert view on the difficulties for a doctor in the United Kingdom in treating an Irish woman whose doctor could not refer the medical file and who may not bring or relay that critical information on her condition to clinicians in the United Kingdom?  I presume such information would have a huge impact on how she would be treated, dealt with and supported in the United Kingdom should she need a termination, such as in the case of a fatal foetal abnormality.  What problems does that pose for doctors in the United Kingdom?

When people are informed of the risk and despite the first risk, some people will actually say they had the test because they just wanted it to be low in order to have some good news and reassure them.  Other people will view the risk they get as actually not very high anyway.  We have a cut-off risk of one in 150 at which we will offer invasive prenatal diagnosis.  Some people might view one in 140, for example, as a low risk and then not go on to have invasive prenatal diagnosis.<\/p> <p>  Those women who go on to have invasive prenatal diagnosis, which carries a risk of miscarriage meaning that for the first time they are doing something that carries a risk of miscarriage, are doing it for three main reasons: it would impact on how the baby would be managed after birth; some people feel that once they have been given this higher risk, they just have to know; and other people do so because they are going to act on the result.

The one thing that is similar is that it is a criminal offence in both countries at the moment if someone does not fulfil the law.

I am standing in this afternoon for my principal officer colleague, Ms Clare McNamara, who cannot be here at short notice due to illness.  The committee has already received the submission of the Department.  This follows on from a letter of response from the Secretary General to the committee in which the ancillary recommendation of the Citizens' Assembly that falls within the remit of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs was addressed.<\/p> <p>  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs administers a range of funding schemes and programmes to support the provision of youth services to young people throughout the country, including those from disadvantaged communities.  There are approximately 1,600 youth groups and clubs across the country, with an estimated membership of 89,000 young people, in receipt of funding from the Department under the local youth club grant scheme.  The majority of these young people are in clubs affiliated to national youth organisations.  Local youth clubs, along with each national youth organisation in receipt of funding from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, are expected to operate in accordance with the national youth strategy, which is a constituent strategy of Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures: the National Policy Framework for Children and Young People, BOBF.<\/p> <p>  The implementation of Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures: the National Policy Framework for Children and Young People has been ongoing across Government since its launch in April 2014.  The national youth strategy, which was subsequently launched in October 2015, includes commitments identified by young people themselves.  It builds on the youth-specific policy commitments outlined in BOBF.  In line with current and emerging policy, the national youth strategy addresses the current socio-economic needs and aspirations of young people aged between ten and 24 years.<\/p> <p>  The implementation structures established by the Department under BOBF are overseeing the roll-out of the national youth strategy.  Youth clubs and services have a significant contribution to make to realise the goals of the national youth strategy, as part of a cross-sectoral whole-of-society approach to supporting young people in their everyday lives.<\/p> <p>  One of the main objectives of the national youth strategy is for young people to enjoy a healthy lifestyle, in particular with regard to their physical, mental and sexual health and well-being.  The Department also provides funding to the national youth health programme.  This is a partnership operated by the National Youth Council of Ireland, NYCI, in conjunction with the youth affairs unit of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the health promotion unit of the Health Service Executive.  In 2017 the Department allocated &euro;86,952 to the NYCI to support the implementation of the national youth health programme.<\/p> <p>  The national youth health programme provides a broad-based and flexible health promotion, education, support and training service to youth organisations and to all those working with young people in out-of-school settings.  Through the national youth health programme, the NYCI has sought to develop the capacity of the youth sector and youth organisations to advocate on issues that affect young people and to develop evidence-based resources to support that work.  The health programme works with practitioners across the youth sector to build knowledge, skills and expertise on a range of health areas, including health promotion, mental health and sexual health.  This work is achieved through the development of a range of training and policy programmes.<\/p> <p>  Specifically with regard to sexual health and relationships, the national youth health programme provides training to youth workers within organisations and aims to strengthen the organisational environment for the delivery of sexual health programmes.  The b4udecide training course is offered in conjunction with the HSE crisis pregnancy programme, and training and accompanying resources explore the concept of delaying early sexual activity among young people.  A follow-on course for youth workers to the b4udecide training, entitled \"Developing a Sexual Health Policy &ndash; Good Practice in Sexual Health Promotion\", aims to strengthen the organisational environment for the delivery of sexual health programmes.<\/p> <p>  The Department is committed to delivering on both the commitments of the Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures policy framework and those of the national youth strategy as they relate to prioritising the sexual health and well-being of children and young people.  The funding provided by the Department, in conjunction with that provided by the Departments of Education and Skills and Health and the Health Service Executive supports young people around relationships and sexuality and provides access to timely and appropriate information. <\/p> <p>  If members have any questions, I can provide more detail or other information they may want.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017112900002#Q00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Olive McGovern"},{"type":"speech","time":1511962200,"counter":266,"content":"<p>Before we take questions, we will take the next speaker.

The Department of Education and Skills welcomes the opportunity to address the ancillary recommendation of the Citizens' Assembly relating to sexual health and relationship education, which states \"Improvements should be made in sexual health and relationship education, including the areas of contraception and consent, in primary and post-primary schools, colleges, youth clubs and other organisations involved in education and interactions with young people.\"<\/p><p>The Department has already provided a written submission to the committee which sets out the current provision of sexual health and relationship education in the primary, post-primary and higher-education sectors.  I propose, therefore, to make a short opening statement, although, along with my colleagues, I will be happy to engage with the committee during the subsequent discussion and address any of the items identified in either the opening statement or in our written submission.  The statement is organised in two parts: first, I will set out what is required of schools in the context of sexual health and relationship education, and how the Department supports schools to meet that requirement; and, second, I will describe briefly our monitoring of compliance, the outcomes of that monitoring and recent initiatives which can help and improve the quality of provision.<\/p><p> I will begin by outlining what we require schools to do.  Access to sexual and health education is an important right for students.  Schools have a responsibility to provide for this, importantly, in consultation with parents and having regard to the ethos of the school.  Social, personal and health education, SPHE, is a mandatory curriculum subject in all primary schools and in post-primary up to the end of the junior cycle.  Relationships and sexuality education, RSE, is required at all levels, from primary to senior cycle.  The Department has set out the content for each of these programmes in SPHE and RSE syllabuses and guidelines, as well as in other support material.<\/p><p> The primary level SPHE curriculum currently used in schools was published in 1999.  Its purpose is to foster the personal development, health and well-being of the individual child, to help him or her create and maintain supportive relationships and to enable children make safe and healthy decisions now and in the future.  At post-primary level, the SPHE curriculum framework for junior cycle was published in 2000.  It provides students with the opportunity to develop the skills and competence to take care of themselves and others and to make informed decisions about their health, personal lives and social development.<\/p><p> RSE is not taught as a distinct programme or subject in primary schools or in junior cycle.  Instead, it forms an integral part of the SPHE curriculum at both levels.  At senior cycle, a school&rsquo;s RSE programme may be taught as a distinct programme or delivered in the context of an SPHE programme or another subject, such as religious education, biology, science or home economics.  Primary schools are also required to fully implement the Stay Safe programme, which addresses physical, emotional and sexual abuse.  It aims to increase resilience by giving children knowledge, skills and strategies in an age-appropriate manner, which is an important precursor to understanding the concept of consent in an adult sexual relationship when they get older.<\/p><p> All schools are required to have an RSE policy that is developed in consultation with the school community, including management, parents, teachers and students, as appropriate.  A school&rsquo;s programme for relationship and sexuality education is developed and taught in the context of its RSE policy.  It is important to note that the ethos of a school should never preclude learners from acquiring the knowledge about the issues, but ethos may influence how that content is treated.<\/p><p> Contraception or issues relating to consent are not explicitly mentioned in the primary SPHE curriculum or in the RSE programme.  The focus is on developing assertive skills, personal self-efficacy and an understanding how one&rsquo;s body works.  This lays the foundation for later discussion of specific issues in a manner appropriate to the developmental stage of the pupils.  At post-primary level, schools are required to teach all aspects of the RSE programme, including family planning, sexually transmitted infections and sexual orientation.  Elements of the programme cannot be omitted on the grounds of school ethos.  However, all aspects of the programme can and should be taught within the ethos and value system of a school as expressed in its written RSE policy.<\/p><p> It should be noted that, under legislation, the higher-education institutions are autonomous bodies and the Department does not prescribe a programme in RSE at this level.  The majority of higher-education institutions provide students with information on sexual health and additional links to further information and support on relationships, sexual education and mental health issues.  Information is provided by both the institutions&rsquo; student&rsquo;s unions and student services medical centres.  Several higher-education institutions also provide classes in sexual consent, giving students the opportunity to talk about positive forms of sexual communication.<\/p><p> I will now discuss the ways in which the Department supports schools in meeting their requirements in respect of RSE and SPHE.  A range of actions have been taken by the Department to support the implementation of SPHE and RSE.  The Department has published policy guidelines for relationships and sexuality education to support schools in developing RSE policy.  These provide clear guidance on engaging with the school community and on sharing the school&rsquo;s policy on RSE, recognising that a partnership approach to RSE helps to ensure that children are provided with a consistent experience and are able to make connections between life at home, in the school and in the community.  This is considered to be a very important requirement.  Sample templates for RSE policies are provided for schools to consider when drafting their own policies.<\/p><p> An RSE support service and a separate SPHE support service are available to schools.  An extensive programme of continuing professional development, CPD, opportunities has been provided to support teachers in the implementation of RSE and SPHE programmes in post-primary schools.  Over several years, the Department and the support services have also developed a wide range of teaching materials, particularly in the area of RSE.  This work has been done in partnership with other Departments and agencies, including the HSE, the Gay and Lesbian Education Network, GLEN, and the crisis pregnancy programme.  It should be noted that schools have discretion regarding the resources that they use to teach SPHE and RSE, and that these are used in accordance with the school&rsquo;s policy.<\/p><p> I will now move on to the second part of the statement, which addresses the ways that the Department monitors compliance in this area.  It is the responsibility of a school's board of management to ensure that RSE is taught in the school.  The inspectorate conducts robust quality assurance of provision in SPHE and RSE through its programme of inspection in schools.  Inspectors ensure: that the school timetable includes time for SPHE and RSE; that the RSE policy has been developed; that broad and balanced coverage of the SPHE and RSE curriculum is evident in school planning; and, in focused evaluations of SPHE and RSE lessons, that students are achieving the intended outcomes of the curriculum.  During all whole-school evaluations, school management is required to confirm that the full Stay Safe programme, SPHE curriculum and RSE are being provided.  Where there is evidence that provision is unsatisfactory, recommendations for improvement are made.  In those cases where there is no or inadequate implementation of the SPHE and RSE curriculum, the inspectorate conducts a range of follow-through actions until such time as the relevant school is regarded as being compliant with the requirements in this area.<\/p><p> Through the monitoring of compliance, we have found that, in general, schools are positively disposed to providing good quality SPHE and RSE, and we have noted the prevalence of a positive classroom and whole-school atmosphere.  Systematic engagement by school managers and teachers with SPHE and RSE continuous development activities has been shown to have a positive impact on the quality of programme delivery.  However, there are some challenges to achieving high quality in that provision which are common across primary and post-primary levels.  In some schools, the development of an RSE policy has not been achieved and there is insufficient engagement with parents on the policy and programme in the school.  However, as was mentioned in the written submission to the committee, our lifeskills survey indicates that almost all schools actually have written RSE policies in place and the remainder are in the process of developing these.  Furthermore, we know that there are issues relating to the competence and confidence of teachers regarding the delivery of RSE.<\/p><p> I will now outline recent initiatives which will support high-quality provision of services in this area.  The Department is developing a policy on well-being which will be published in early 2018.  The policy, which will cover both primary and post-primary schools, will set out a number of actions which will enhance the physical, mental, emotional and social well-being of students and enable them to build life skills.<\/p><p>The policy will include actions to support schools and teachers to deliver high-quality learning experiences so that students acquire an appropriate knowledge and understanding of human relationships and sexuality. <\/p><p> Another important development is the introduction of a new area of learning called Wellbeing, and I apologise for the confusing terminology due to the use of a capital \"W\", which is part of the new framework for junior cycle.  Social, personal and health education, SPHE, and relationships and sexuality education, RSE, are integral parts of the new Wellbeing programme at junior cycle.  They provide opportunities for teaching and learning directly related to well-being, not least the capacity to develop and maintain healthy relationships.  Wellbeing guidelines developed by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, have been published and training has already commenced for school leaders to assist them in developing a well-being programme.  It is important to emphasise that the Wellbeing programme is a whole-of-school programme and is not just for specific individual teachers.<\/p><p> It is envisaged that the SPHE curriculum, including RSE, at primary level will undergo a review by the NCCA in the coming years, as part of its ongoing review of all the curriculum areas, with which the committee members will doubtless be familiar.  A review of the curriculum at senior cycle is also under way, again led by the NCCA.  The SPHE and RSE programmes at that level will be considered.<\/p><p> These reviews will include the views of all the education partners, recent research outcomes, societal and cultural changes and all the relevant polices and teaching materials that have been disseminated to schools since the SPHE and RSE curricula were first introduced, including material produced by entities other than our own Department, including our colleagues in the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, the HSE and other partners that operate in this area.  It is not possible to determine exactly what the review will conclude in terms of curriculum content.  The process will be very comprehensive and all views and suggestions will be considered.<\/p><p> I thank the Chairperson for the opportunity to make an opening statement.  My colleagues and I look forward to our discussions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017112900002#Q00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eamonn Moran","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511962200,"counter":270,"content":"<p>I thank Ms McGovern and Mr. Moran for their presentations.

I wish to refer to a newspaper article that was published in 2014 where it was highlighted that schools used external agencies.  As Mr. Moran mentioned, not all teachers are skilled enough to teach these classes.  Does the Department have oversight in cases where external agencies are used?  Is it left to the board of management to provide oversight?

As regards policy, when the witnesses from the curriculum unit are designing guidelines for education for young people, such as in respect of sex and reproductive health education - the areas of particular interest for the committee - do they consider models from other countries, particularly those in Europe?  Can they comment on evidence presented last week to the committee regarding sexual education recently being made compulsory from the age of ten in the Netherlands?  A corollary of that was a reduction of one third in teenage pregnancies between 2012, when it was made compulsory, and 2016.  I ask the witnesses to comment on that.<\/p> <p>  My other question is similar to that of Deputy O'Reilly regarding the use of outside agencies.  Senator Ruane was feeling unwell and went home.  Her daughter attends a school in Tallaght in which sex education is delivered by an outside agency named Accord, which is affiliated to the Catholic church.  Senator Ruane has removed her daughter from that class because she has serious issues with that agency and its affiliation.  The Department's proposals repeatedly state that the ethos of a school may be taken into consideration.  The ethos of school is very much a framework for how this is delivered.  The ethos of the school has to be managed within the school framework, involving all agencies, including the board of management.  Some 94% of  boards of management of national schools in this country contain leading local members of the Catholic church or are controlled by the Catholic church.  Do the witnesses consider there to be an obstacle to progressing the process of dealing with teenage pregnancy and sex education in order to prevent as many crisis pregnancies and to get on with the business of educating a future generation in a full and wholesome way about reproductive health and helping them to live their lives in a way that prevents the outcomes of crisis pregnancies such as, for example, the increased use of the abortion pill?  Do the witnesses think that it would be of assistance to remove the framework of Catholic ethos from national schools?  I am not suggesting that the church should be moved to Mars or some such place but, rather, that the ethos of Catholicism should be removed from the delivery of sexual health programmes in schools.

There are two elements to the well-being programme.  One is the newly rolled out junior cycle well-being area of learning which covers SPHE, CSPE and PE.  Some other elements could also be included.<\/p><p>This was rolled out to schools from September 2017 and will be reported on in the students' new junior cycle profile of achievement from June 2020.  It is an exciting new area.  Our junior cycle for teachers' continuous professional development, CPD, team has a particular well-being programme going out to schools to assist them in rolling out the programme.  We are committing significant CPD resources to ensuring that the programme is rolled out well.  I will make a point that might address one of the issues Senator Gavan has.  An underlying emphasis of the well-being programme is that well-being is a whole-of-school activity, so it is not the case that when someone goes to a school and asks where he or she can learn about well-being, he or she is told to go to the guidance counsellor or the science teacher.  The idea of the well-being programme is that it is a whole-of-school approach.  All teachers are responsible for well-being in school, so one avoids a situation whereby in a specific well-being or guidance class the student is told about one set of issues regarding well-being and then goes into another class and sees no evidence of those issues in that class.  All teachers are involved in the delivery of well-being.  Well-being with a small W, which is the programme the Minister is seeking to roll out across primary and post-primary, essentially seeks to ensure that across the whole school system well-being is taught in an integrated way.  The junior cycle framework is further down that road, but I think the Minister is keen to ensure that the lessons we have learned from the development of the junior cycle well-being programme can be spread across the whole school system.<\/p><p> Concerns have been expressed that as one goes into senior cycle and the leaving certificate heaves into view, the time spent on such areas decreases.  Junior cycle teachers and those involved in delivering the well-being programme are typically also teachers at senior cycle level.  Pending the delivery of the well-being programme for the whole school system, we know that the roll-out of the well-being programme in junior cycle will also assist in ensuring that well-being is embodied at senior cycle.  Senator Gavan made the point about students saying they never received this education.  I have spoken about this only within the past two days to my own two daughters, who are in their 20s now.  They went to the same school.  One said they never got it and the other said they got it in spades.  I would make two points in this regard.  First, it could be the case that different teachers might choose to deliver the SPHE and RSE programmes in different ways.  In addition, depending on the ages or level of maturity of the individual students, they can receive this learning in different ways.  It might only hit home with them at a later stage.<\/p><p> This brings me to another point I will make before I hand over to my colleague, Ms Egan, for any comments she may have.  I made a point in the opening statement about age-appropriateness.  We are asked why we do not teach primary school children about contraception and why we do not catch this at the very start of the schooling system.  In developing the programmes for SPHE and RSE, the Department is guided by the requirement to ensure that this programme provision is delivered in an age-appropriate manner.  We need to be careful that we do not hit students with something they are too young to understand and that they do not go away more confused about information we try to provide to them than before.  Therefore, while some observers might consider that we should be teaching this in a more direct way at an earlier stage, there is a balance to be found between getting children at a young stage and confusing them with issues.<\/p><p> This brings me to the final point I will make on this issue.  We have made the point very strongly that the provision particularly of SPHE and RSE is a partnership between the school and the parents.  It should be remembered that the schoolteacher is delivering a programme to perhaps 15 or 20 pupils in a class and therefore needs to pitch the delivery of the programme at a certain level.  As a parent of a child, I may have been involved with the school in developing in some cases the RSE policy.  When I go to the school to determine whether I will put my child into the school, I will have been given sight of that school's RSE policy so I can decide whether the approach and the ethos underlying the provision of that policy is consistent with my expectations.  Furthermore, when I see the layout of the programme and how it is proposed to be taught in the school, I can also decide from the home perspective, the parental perspective, to provide the input from the home and parental side of things to ensure that what the child is being taught in school is mirrored and tracked by what is being provided at home.  This ensures consistency of messages between both education forums, and the parent might feel his or her child is at a certain stage at which the parent can perhaps supplement in a more direct way the information being provided in the school.  I would emphasise the partnership approach between both the school and the parents regarding the provision of education in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017112900002#U01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eamonn Moran","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511962200,"counter":300,"content":"<p>Senator Gavan's time is up, unless there is something that the witnesses feel needs to be said in response to his comments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017112900002#V00200","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1511962200,"counter":301,"content":"<p>All I will say is that over the years we have as a Department on a number of occasions articulated to schools their responsibilities in the area of RSE and have continued to develop the curricula.

Yes, there is provision for school ethos to have an influence but most of the RSE programme is about helping children to develop their relationships with others, to get to know themselves and how their bodies work and to develop their self-worth and self-efficacy.

I am very concerned about some of the evidence I have heard today, and many of the previous speakers have spoken well about it.  I am concerned that it is down to the ethos of the school to frame sex education.  Mr. Moran spoke about age-appropriate education.  Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith spoke about the Dutch system.  In Holland this education starts at four, when children discuss their bodies.  It moves on to respect and attraction at seven and same-sex attraction between eight and nine years of age.  Between ten and 11 years of age they speak about changes during puberty, love, dating and men and women in the media.  They deal with this in Holland from four years of age.  It is not standardised across the Netherlands but it is exceptionally comprehensive.  According to the Catholic ethos when it comes to contraception, condoms are still not allowed as a means of birth control under Catholic teaching.  I am concerned that the rhythm method or the withdrawal method or abstinence is being taught to children in this State.  My understanding is that 90% of schools in this country are under the Catholic ethos, so I am not sure how we square that circle.  I think Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith's final question to Ms Egan was whether she was happy with our sex education in this country.  She never actually said she was.  It is very clear to me that we have serious issues here when it comes to sex education under the Catholic ethos.  I know the bishop withdrew his comments but a cleric in this country recently spoke about teenagers engaging in pure and chaste lives.  I am not sure what sort of teenagers he is dealing with but his comments concerned the HPV vaccine and a rather ignorant link between it and sexual activity.<\/p><p>Has the Department done any work on the promotion of the HPV vaccine, which can eradicate cancer?  I am concerned about how all these things feed into educating our children and about this opposing view.  If the Catholic Church does not teach that barrier contraceptives are a good thing, and if HPV vaccination is not promoted very well, I would be very concerned about how we are delivering sex education.  Various states in the US have different approaches to sex education.  The basic statistics show that in states where sex education focuses on abstinence there is a higher rate of teenage pregnancies than in states where there is a more comprehensive approach.  In New Mexico, where abstinence is taught, there are 90 teenage pregnancies per 1,000 teenagers aged 15 to 19, whereas in New Hampshire, where the education regime is not based on abstinence, the rate is 30 per 1,000.  All of this feeds into the question of whether sex education in this country is fit for purpose.  I believe that if it is being influenced by the ethos of the school to this degree, we cannot sit here today and say it is working.  Somebody answered that there had been no complaints.  I am always concerned when there are no complaints or concerns raised about an approach to something.  <\/p><p> I am very concerned about what Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith mentioned about Accord being used as a sort of subcontractor in schools.  I am really concerned about what our young people are being exposed to in terms of the approach to teaching sex education.  One of the key things we learnt from the witnesses from the Netherlands who came before the committee last week was that country had destigmatised and taken a non-moralistic approach to sex education, which ultimately led to a reduction in teenage pregnancies.  It also led to Dutch teenagers tending to have their first sexual experience later in their teenage years than their European counterparts.  They generally report it as having been a positive and fun experience.  This non-moralistic approach has worked in the Netherlands.  I do not want to bring up the sexologists from last week again but this approach seems to deliver better outcomes.  I am really concerned that if we are somehow being caught by this idea of ethos then we will not be serving our young people.  Does Ms Egan think that we should have a standardised approach?  Should we forgot ethos and try to deal with our children and young people in a way which separates the moral from the medical?  Does Ms Egan have any concerns in light of what we have heard about the current system today and in light of everyone's questions and answers in that regard?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017112900002#V00500","speaker":"1297","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511962200,"counter":305,"content":"<p>The Deputy has not allowed a lot of time for answers.

I am conscious of that.  I do have a particular interest in this subject because I have put down numerous parliamentary questions on the subject, as some of our guests will know.  We have had information that children did not seem to have a proper sex education in school.  That is a bland statement that may be right or it may be wrong.  I got an email or text from somebody, and we have to take these things as they are, to the effect that a 14 year old child who had been raped did not do anything about it, did not know what the consequences were and did not have a conversation with her parents.  The parents need to be involved in the programme of sex education in schools as well.  The Well-Being programme is welcome.  It needs to be comprehensive.  It needs to identify all the potential threats to the child.  The child needs to be protected.  We have had enough incidents in this country over the past number of years, and in many other countries, where there is \"trafficking\", for want of a better description.  The grooming of children is quite evident and is a serious threat to their well-being.<\/p> <p>  The next part is how to get the information to children.  I see nothing wrong with the system as the witnesses present it, as long as it gets to children and their parents.  If it does not get to parents as well, then it is a waste of time.  The child will go home from school and ask the parents, who may not be receptive to adding to it.  It should include parents.  We are a multicultural society now so the ethos is not as important as it was.  However, it is important that we get the message across to parents regardless of background and ethos.  We need to put special emphasis on that.<\/p> <p>  I got a shock a couple of years ago when I put down a question in relation to children who were bullied in school and abused through the Internet and social media.  It is horrific.  Particularly horrific is the number of children who self-harmed or attempted self-harm as a result of that kind of activity in their schools.  There were repeated attempts at self-harm which meant that the abuse was still going on.  I remember that the ages were between ten and 14 which is really alarming.  That cohort of children in that age group needs to be concentrated on particularly in order to identify what the threats are, whether via the Internet, social media or predators.  It is a huge issue that needs to be dealt with.  The child needs to know, boys and girls, what the threat is and if there is a threat.  That is not to create suspicion of society but to have a genuine knowledge of what is required in order for them to become balanced citizens.<\/p> <p>  In relation to youth services, if we can talk about this as well, I want to compliment in particular-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017112900002#X00700","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1511962200,"counter":333,"content":"<p>Can the Deputy ask a question please?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017112900002#X00800","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speech","time":1511962200,"counter":334,"content":"<p>It is a question.

In relation to the role of parents and the Deputy's strong view that parents must be involved, that desirability underpins our whole approach to the provision of SPHE and RSE in schools.  It relates to both the development of the RSE statement by the school and the engagement with parents.  It underpins the information provided at all stages of the curriculum regarding how parents can provide additional and complementary material as they see fit to their children.  The RSE policy in school is developed in conjunction with parents.<\/p> <p>  In relation to whether we are sure we are providing sex education in the proper way, the RSE policy for the school needs to set out the rationale for the provision of RSE in the school.  This must refer to the context and ethos of the school, the aims of RSE and, critically, details of how the programme will be delivered in the school.  When the RSE policy is being agreed with parents, they will be able to see how the programme will be delivered and by whom, the particular modules that will be delivered, the role of the principal, the creation of a supportive school climate and culture, the consultation process with parents, parents' associations and students, the resources for RSE, the training for RSE and how the policy will be reviewed.<\/p> <p>  In relation to the review issue, the schools inspectorate, as part of its whole school evaluations, examine the provision of SPHE and RSE in schools.  The inspectors report their findings and make recommendations for improvements in schools.  In schools that do not have an RSE policy in place or where part of the RSE and SPHE curriculum are not being taught, the inspectorate will make recommendations as to how they should be taught.  Follow up visits to the schools will ensure that those recommendations are implemented.<\/p> <p>  On bullying in schools, the Department has developed a number of anti-bullying policies.

The points made today by the witnesses were well made.  Much of the expertise shared with the committee on this issue indicates how important this area is.<\/p> <p>  The Stay Safe Programme was introduced following reports of appalling child abuse.  It came directly out of a religious ethos and a group of people who were trusted but whom it was found could not be trusted.  I accept the point on the need for programmes to be age specific but I do not think we have moved on in so far as that ethos is still getting in the way of delivery of sex education.  Delivery in this regard is very contained.  Sex education should be about not only pregnancy and disease but about inculcating positive attitudes in people.<\/p> <p>  The witnesses have told us that they have studied the research in other countries but that research does not matter if schools do not have the ability to deliver programmes without the interference of an ethos in that delivery.  We have an unusually high rate of religious patronage of schools.  We should be looking to the best outcomes and experiences in other countries in terms of well-rounded individuals who have a good understanding of issues, do not run with the herd and are independent.  We heard earlier that for some people sex education was a great experience and for others it was a terrible experience.  The experience was hit and miss, depending on the teacher delivering the programme.<\/p> <p>  In regard to sex education, a life survey undertaken by the Department of Education and Skills in 2015 found that 48% of primary and 55% of secondary schools indicated that they relied to some extent on external agencies.  The external agencies aspect is incredibly important.  There must be some degree of understanding of who those agencies are in terms of ethos.  Based on the aforementioned figures, there is a very high level of intervention.  The Department is getting very good evidence from other countries, on the basis of which the NCCA sets the curriculum, but it has no control over how this programme is delivered.  How then can the witnesses say that there is good-quality sex education?

The witnesses have outlined how post-primary schools are required to teach all aspects of an RSE programme, including family planning, sexually transmitted infections and sexual orientations.  Schools cannot leave out any part of the programme but can teach the programme within the school's ethos and value system.  How do schools balance what may be a conflict with school ethos with delivering relationships and sexuality education programmes which fully inform young people?  Ms Egan used the word \"recommends\" earlier, and she can understand the question I have asked.  What happens when schools do not fully implement or provide social personal health education and relationship and sexual education?  Are there any repercussions?  Are parents and students made aware of the shortcomings?  Is there a mandatory requirement for teachers to engage in continuous professional development on the SPHE and the RSE or is the training a once off?  <\/p><p> It was mentioned that some third level institutions provide information around sexual communications and consent.  To what degree are the issues of healthy sexual relationships and consent a part of the post-primary curriculum?  It is a challenge for some parents and teachers to discuss relationships and sexual health with their children or students.  They themselves may not have grown up in an environment where those issues were openly discussed.  While the Chair at least had the video, some people did not even have that.

On the development of policy, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, advises the Department and the Minister on curriculum policy in schools.  We get policy advice in the form of draft curriculum specification for all of our curriculums from the NCCA, including science, technology, engineering and mathematics, STEM, SPHE and RSE.  The NCCA represents almost all of the education partners, including parents, school leaders, schools and teachers.  The policy advice that goes to the Minister is agreed by the NCCA council.  The Minister will ultimately decide whether to approve the curriculum specification.  The same policy would apply for SPHE as for STEM subjects.  That is the process.<\/p> <p>  I make the point that the initial NCCA process is representative of all the players involved in this area.  Ultimately, the Minister is the person who approves policy in that area.  <\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked what happens if a school is not providing a particular element of the curriculum.  In this particular case she refers to SPHE and RSE.  My inspector colleagues can speak further on this as they wish, but I mentioned the inspection regime in the schools.  When inspections are performed, the inspectors will seek to ensure that SPHE and RSE curriculum is being delivered in the school as per specification.  Interestingly, the inspectorate reports have noted a number of positives in this area.  Perhaps this harks back to points made earlier by other Deputies and Senators.  There is a positive school and classroom climate for supporting the teaching of SPHE and RSE.  There is recognition now that it is a whole-school responsibility rather than the responsibility of an individual person.  Things have moved on in that area.  The schools where SPHE and RSE are more successfully implemented make more effective use of teaching methodologies and resources provided for SPHE and RSE.  <\/p> <p>  My colleagues from the inspectorate mentioned the curriculum resources that are developed by our professional development services by teachers, PDST, and by a number of other Departments and areas active in this field.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017112900002#Z00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eamonn Moran"},{"type":"speech","time":1511962200,"counter":369,"content":"<p>I ask for quiet in the room.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017112900002#Z00800","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1511962200,"counter":370,"content":"<p>This includes the use of programmes that complement the SPHE and RSE curriculum, such as the Stay Safe, Walk Tall and Busy Bodies programmes.  On the other hand, in schools where an RSE policy is not in place, there is a need for the inspector to ensure that policy is put in place and is informed by the guidelines for developing an RSE policy.  In some cases it is necessary to provide clarity about what is taught at each level of the curriculum and to ensure that there is balanced learning at each level.  There is a need to ensure that in addition to having an RSE policy in place in the school, the school leadership monitors the implementation of that policy.  Having the policy and curriculum in place must be monitored by ensuring that the policy is effectively implemented.  The inspectors will have a role in the schools when they perform their visits, but it is the day-to-day role of the school leadership and the board of management which will ensure that the policy is implemented in the school.<\/p> <p>  The generation of home-school links, particularly when sensitive issues on the curriculum are being taught, is essential.  It is important that parents have close involvement in and are aware of what is taught in the RSE and SPHE curriculum and that they are updated during the year in order that they know at what stage of the year different aspects of that curriculum will be taught.  That is what comes out of the inspectorate regime.  <\/p> <p>  I will ask my colleague, Ms Amanda Geary, to speak about the post-primary area and address some of the queries raised by the Deputy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017112900002#Z00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eamonn Moran"},{"type":"speech","time":1511962200,"counter":371,"content":"<p>How many schools do not have an RSE policy?

There is a requirement, under child protection, that all primary and post-primary schools must have an SPHE and a comprehensive RSE programme in place.  If the inspectorate finds that a school does not have that in place, we will draw the attention of the school to the child protection circular and guidelines and tell it that because the programmes are not in place, it is not fully compliant.<\/p><p>No school wants to find itself in a position where it is deemed in a published report to be non-compliant with child protection procedures and guidelines.  It is rare, as my colleague stated, that we come across a school that is not implementing a relationships and sexuality education, RSE, programme.<\/p><p> To come to the second question on whether the topic of consent is dealt with, we have a comprehensive programme for SPHE and RSE.  By the end of the three years of junior cycle and the two years at senor cycle, it is very clear that there is a Department expectation of where students and schools will be at in terms of the learning outcomes.  However, the school has absolute autonomy to determine when it delivers on each topic and how much time it provides to deliver on each topic.  For instance, if a school believes it is extremely important to deal with the topic of consent mid-way through first year or at the end of first or second year, that decision rests purely with the school.  It determines when and how much time it spends on any particular topic.<\/p><p> It was mentioned earlier that, by their nature, SPHE and RSE lessons are interactive and that the students bring their own needs to the discussion.  Frequently, there will be an SPHE plan in place, developed by the school and which follows the curriculum guidelines but it will be and is frequently adapted to match the needs of the students.  If an issue arises in a particular class group, the SPHE programme will be amended to address that need.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017112900002#Z01300","nonspeaker":"Ms Amanda Geary","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511962200,"counter":376,"content":"<p>The reason I asked that question was because Dr. Geoffrey Shannon came before the Oireachtas children's committee recently.

The total funding for youth sector provision in 2017, to answer Deputy Rabbitte's question partially also, is &euro;57.4 million.  The &euro;600,000 I referred to is just the National Youth Council's budget.<br\/><br\/>In terms of the reach, there are approximately 400 targeted projects in the country along with 1,700 youth clubs.  Broadly, that is the reach.  We recently completed a map of them and they are in every part of the country but it is important to understand that participation in the youth sector is a voluntary piece so there is no mandatory aspect of that for young people.<br\/><br\/>In terms of the curriculum, I do not believe it is at huge variance to what is in the education sector curriculum.  This year the curriculum content has been revised and updated built on the latest evidence base, which is a constantly evolving evidence base.  There are eight components to the curriculum that are part of the resource available to those who are working in either a professional or a voluntary capacity in any of those 400 projects or the 1,600 clubs.<br\/><br\/>In terms of participation in the training, and I got some data in preparation for today from my colleagues, in 2017 alone, 68 people participated in the policy training and 33 organisations.  We have 150 or 180 legal entities involved in this so in this year alone the figures are 68 and 33.  I reviewed last year's data and the figure is in the mid-70s for both training programmes.  They have an additional training programme this year in regard to pornography that they are offering of which there is some uptake.  Individual organisations send their staff or their volunteers through to the training programmes but the training programmes have been in place for a number of years.  I just got the data on the last two years for this input this evening but I could get the data for previous years if members wish.  I am confident in saying that there is provision across the country but the difference is that it is a voluntary provision for young people.<br\/><br\/>I will add to that so the Deputy has the full information.  In this year, for the first time, the Department has included funding for <i>SpunOut.ie<\/i>, which is an online youth information resource.  Through our youth information centre grant fund and our youth services grant fund, in a combination of both funds, <i>SpunOut.ie<\/i>will receive &euro;200,000 per annum for this year and next year in an effort to try to respond to the fact that many young people are now getting their information online.

I want to ask a question specifically to do with qualifications.  Is there a formal accreditation and recognition for SPHE-RSE teachers?  Does every school have a designated SPHE-RSE co-ordinator?

The colleges of education have indicated that the time being allocated to specific training in SPHE-RSE has actually increased across the four-year period because of the overall time increase.  We regard that as good provision at the initial teacher education stage.  We recognise that this is a challenging area.  There is no doubt about that.  Many teachers report that it is challenging.<\/p><p>We are told that some 62% find this area challenging and that 12% find it very challenging and so training does not begin and end at initial teacher education stage.  It is really important that teachers receive good quality continuous professional development, CPD, throughout their careers, and this is provided.  From June 2014 to June 2017, some 3,135 teachers availed of CPD, which is a very high number for us to be able to stand over.  The seminars, which were delivered by the professional development service for teachers, PDST, focused specifically on sex education and other elements of the relationships and sexuality in education, RSE, programme from senior infants to sixth class.  It is important that schools have in place an RSE policy that is clear, implemented and monitored.  The 3,135 teachers mentioned will have benefited from that type of input very recently in their careers.<\/p><p> The seminars also focused on the particular methodologies for teaching RSE that we regard as being important, these being methodologies that allow for discussion with students and allow them to engage with the issues at a level that is relevant to their own lives and also generate a safe classroom environment at primary level.  A lot has happened in this space.  We have referenced a number of times the amount of resources that are available online.

The European Defence Agency was established by a joint action of the Council of the European Union in 2004 &quot;to support the Member States and the Council in their effort to improve European defence capabilities in the field of crisis management and to sustain the European Security and Defence Policy as it stands now and develops in the future&quot;.  On 6 July 2004 the Government approved Ireland's participation in the framework of the agency.<\/p><p>The European Defence Agency is an agency of the European Union and composed of the Defence Ministers of the 27 participating member states and the European Commission.  Ireland participates in the framework of the agency and contributes in the region of &euro;400,000 to the annual cost of running it, including the cost of its annual work programme.  The agency is focused on assisting member states in capability development, obtaining better value for existing spending levels, improving competitiveness and securing greater efficiency, particularly in the areas of research, technology and procurement of defence capabilities.<\/p><p>The primary reason for Ireland's participation in the European Defence Agency is to support the development of Defence Forces capabilities for peacekeeping and international crisis management operations.  The Defence (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 regulates Ireland's participation in the agency's <i>ad hoc<\/i>projects.  It prescribes that participation in category A projects, category B projects or programmes is subject to Government and D&aacute;il approval.  A category A project is where all member states join, unless they specifically opt out, while a category B project is where two or more member states come together to pursue a particular initiative.<\/p><p>I will now give a brief outline of Ireland's involvement in EDA projects to date.  Following Government and D&aacute;il approval, Ireland has participated or is participating in the following areas: a programme on force protection that involved measures to protect military forces engaged in operational activities; a programme related to chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear protection; projects in the area of maritime surveillance and networking; a project focused on counter improvised explosive devices manual neutralisation techniques; and a project concerning co-operation on cyber-ranges in the European Union, the aim of which is to maintain and improve cyber-resilience, in addition to the levels of awareness, insight and expertise of member states' personnel.<\/p><p>The proposal brought forward by me today is to seek approval for Ireland to participate in two EDA projects - one in the area of satellite communications and the other in the area of manual neutralisation capabilities.<\/p><p>With regard to the joint procurement arrangement for the EU SatCom market, the aim is to provide commercially available satellite communications &ndash; fixed and mobile &ndash; in addition to related services through the establishment of one or more framework agreements on behalf of the contributing members, to promote ease of access and improve efficiency.  Access to the SatCom procurement project is open to the European Defence Agency's participating member states, EU entities and certain third parties.<\/p><p>The provision of strategic satellite services is an essential prerequisite for the major deployment of troops overseas and in support of other major operations.  It is vital that the Defence Forces maintain appropriate systems and procedures for the provision of strategic satellite services efficiently and potentially at short notice.  The project represents an opportunity to procure satellite services in an efficient, cost-effective and timely manner through the achievement of potential economies of scale with pooled demand across EU member states and institutions.<\/p><p>Satellite services play a critical role in enabling the Defence Forces to access reliable communications services anywhere and at any time.  When deployed on operations overseas, the Defence Forces utilise strategic satellite services as their primary system for providing communication links both in the field and back to Defence Forces headquarters.  In that regard, I refer to satellite communications supports location and GPS services in battlefield systems; Defence Forces command and control systems; desk to desk dialling; video conferencing; Defence Forces Intranet access; access to strategic applications, including Defence Forces personnel and inventory management systems; and access to welfare support services such as Internet access and home phone facilities for personnel.  The primary communications channel to Naval Service vessels on operational deployments is also via satellite which also supports its maritime surveillance systems.<\/p><p>In addition to the potential cost savings, participation in the project would provide the Defence Forces with security of supply and backup in the event of any failure on the part of the current supplier or an urgent operational requirement that cannot be met under the current contract.<\/p><p>I will now give some detail on the second EDA project.  The ECMAN category B project is a follow-on activity of the European Defence Agency's category B programme on manual neutralisation techniques, MNT, courses and exercise programmes.  Ireland's participation in the programme was approved in 2013 and the project will finish in 2018.  The aim of the follow-on project is to continue to develop manual neutralisation capabilities to the highest standards so as to retain capacity in dealing with improvised explosive devices, IEDs, when it is not possible to destroy or disrupt a device through other means.  The follow-on project will provide personnel with access to a training system designed to continuously update and improve the safety of explosive ordnance disposal personnel operating in an extreme environment.  It also enables those already qualified in manual neutralisation techniques courses and exercise programmes through previous participation to maintain skill levels through an efficient re-licensing arrangement linked with refresher courses.  Officers trained in manual neutralisation techniques enable the ordnance corps to guarantee continuous support for the explosive ordnance disposal and chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear improvised device disposal teams.  Participation in the programme will deliver the essential number of personnel to meet requirements over time.  This capability is highly specialised and unavailable elsewhere owing to its highly sensitive and classified nature and mainly developed as part of multinational framework arrangements.<\/p><p>Manual neutralisation capability is required in situations where the operational environment determines that the risk of causing a device to detonate &ndash; for example, a controlled explosion &ndash; is unacceptable.  In addition, recovering devices intact can have a profound effect on investigations where even the smallest piece of evidence such as DNA on a piece of adhesive tape inside an improvised explosive device or the use of particular components can help to identify the perpetrator or terrorist group involved.  Explosive disruptors are no longer the weapon of choice in such incidents.  Manual neutralisation techniques training is also important when dealing with <font color=\"#2F2F2F\">chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear defence<\/font>type incidents such as those using ricin and other white powder events.<\/p><p>On the financial aspects, there are no costs to the Exchequer arising from participation in the EU SatCom market project.  Costs will arise only if the service is availed of on a pay-per-use basis.<\/p><p> In respect of the second project, the European Centre for Manual Neutralisation Capabilities, ECMAN, the cost to the Exchequer for Ireland's participation is &euro;75,000 per year for each of the six years of the programme - a total of &euro;450,000 over the lifetime of the project.  The costs will be met from within existing resources.<\/p><p> In conclusion, Ireland's participation in the European Defence Agency affords us the opportunity to keep abreast of best practice and new developments in the defence environment, particularly as it impacts on multinational crisis management operations.  The Government's White Paper on Defence published in August 2015 states that Ireland will identify opportunities to participate \"in multi-national capability development projects within the framework of the EDA in support of the Defence Forces' operations, capacity and capability.\"  The two projects discussed today are prime examples of how the Defence Forces can develop their capabilities in satellite communications and in manual neutralisation capabilities.  I commend the motion to the committee.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2017112900002#B00300","speaker":"1365","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511973600,"counter":429,"content":"<p>We all will have new words and phrases in our vocabulary after that statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2017112900002#C00200","speaker":"1270"},{"type":"speech","time":1511973600,"counter":430,"content":"<p>These two measures look relatively benign and in the Minister of State's conclusion, the argument seems to be to ask who would deny our Defence Forces the opportunity to keep abreast of best practice and new developments.  However, the point is that there are considerations and concerns that we are increasingly moving towards being part of a greater EU militarisation policy.  There is no doubt that this will threaten our neutrality and the good standing in which our peacekeeping missions are held.  I will take the example of Operation Sophia.  We were respected because of the humanitarian work being done by the Naval Service on the migration crisis in the Mediterranean.  Suddenly, we agreed to become part of this big EU naval mission, which I believe is totally discredited now because what has happened is those people who were taken in by this navy and brought to these detention centres having been mistreated by some elements of the Libyan coastguard and other boats in the area.  We just had an informal meeting with one of the leading NGOs.  The figures given regarding the rape of women and men in these detention centres were staggering and frightening.  While these two measures look relatively benign, we cannot help but ask whether they are the first steps in a much bigger campaign and movement that will really endanger our neutrality and place us in a very vulnerable situation.

I would like to follow on from what Deputy O'Sullivan has said.  I say this because of my respect for the Defence Forces and the work they have done over the years and as a former Minister for Defence.  We must be extremely careful here.  There is a constant need for attention which worries me that we are not being dragged into something that was never really our remit and that it would affect the great work we do in peacekeeping and conflict prevention.  It is like what Deputy O'Sullivan said.  The humanitarian approach of the Naval Service was excellent and the manner in which it carried out its duties was superb but then the follow-on involved being dragged into something that is now putting a big question mark over it.  We must recognise that we are a neutral country.  We are a member of the EU but we are a neutral country.  As it is the one thing that has helped us in mission after mission in terms of peacekeeping and respect throughout the world, we must be extremely careful that we are not being dragged along with the others.  Let the others play more games but we should really be clear as to where we stand.<\/p><p>I read one of the documents with which we were supplied.

We should not be dragged along because we are in the EU and want to be one of the buddies with the rest.  That is not our role.  Our Defence Forces are small but carry out unbelievable work.  I am sure the Minister of State has, like myself, visited various small involvements in different parts of the world where we had 30 or 40 officers who were key people in a big organisational operation in terms of peacekeeping.  I have been going on about this for a long time because I am deeply nervous that we are being dragged along with the rest of the boys and girls.  This is why I was very anxious that we debate this.  To be truthful, what is annoying me a bit is that this motion was put before the D&aacute;il for approval before it came here.

It is not about being a wimp or being afraid of being with the big boys.  It is important for us, with Defence Forces that are small but which are highly skilled in certain areas.  Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan's comments were about what can happen through being dragged into something having participated in a very worthwhile project involving our Naval Service saving lives.  One can be dragged into things without really expecting it.  Therefore, we should stick very carefully to what these Acts say.  I do not doubt the Minister of State's integrity or of that of his staff for one minute but I am just saying is that it should go out loud and clear that while we are members of the EU, when it comes to matters of defence, we have restrictions because of our neutrality and these are the guidelines.

Participation in the EDA projects is not a form of common defence.  Let me state that it does not impact on Ireland's neutrality.  If anybody looks back at my record at all European meetings, whatever the debate is, they will see that the number one thing I always ask for is that our policy on neutrality is respected.<\/p><p>Irrespective of the nature of the project in which we are participating, I seek legal advice to ensure we are not entering a space that raises questions about neutrality.  As a former Minister for Defence, Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett will have had many opportunities to visit Irish peacekeepers stationed overseas.  Given our involvement in UNIFIL, I have no doubt he visited Lebanon on numerous occasions.  Older soldiers tell me that the threats they face nowadays are much more sophisticated than the threats they faced ten, 20 or 30 years ago.  We must keep pace with the latest technologies and participating in these projects gives us the technical expertise to enable us to carry out peacekeeping duties with the United Nations. <\/p><p> I attended a UN peacekeeping conference in Canada two weeks ago.  The UN demanded from all participants at the conference that they make a greater contribution to UN peacekeeping.  To do so, we must be able to keep up with the best other countries and those countries with which we work alongside in UN duties.  Interoperability was a new word for me when I was appointed Minister of State with responsibility for defence.  I am now fully aware of the importance of achieving interoperability and being able to operate with like-minded countries, neutral or otherwise.<\/p><p> A number of other EU member states are also neutral.  I continually highlight our policy of neutrality at meetings with my counterparts.<\/p><p> Deputy Barrett referred to our participation in Operation Sophia.  The vast majority of the work done by the Naval Service as part of Operation Sophia involves rescuing migrants and bringing them ashore in Italy.  The role is similar to the humanitarian work previously done in the region by the Naval Service.<\/p><p>  I understand that all European Defence Agency projects must be approved by the select committee before going to the D&aacute;il.

At the small number of such meetings I have attended, I have spoken out strongly about our adherence to neutrality, pointing out that we will not deviate from it.<\/p> <p>  The point made by Deputy Barrett is that we all share a concern at the back of our minds that things may be happening that run counter to the thrust of our policy on neutrality, which is firmly adhered to and supported by the overwhelming majority of the population.  In that context, we are proposing, as part of our work programme for 2018, that the Minister of State appear before the committee at least three times each year to update members on developments in the European Union.  We have an arrangement under which the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade reports to the joint committee on Council meetings.  These meetings with the Minister do not take place as often as they should for reasons of scheduling, either on the part of the committee or Minister.  The joint committee cannot meet when it wishes as only certain time slots are available.  In addition, we have a substantial work programme.<\/p> <p>  Apart from appearing before the select committee to present Estimates or legislation, we propose that the Minister of State attend formal meetings of the committee at least three times per annum to update members on developments in the Council of defence Ministers, including proposals, follow-up and so forth.  We will make this proposal in our work programme for 2018 to ensure members are kept abreast of what is happening and, I hope, to allay any fears that may arise among members of the public and Members of the Oireachtas.  I am sure the programme will be agreed by the committee. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2017112900002#D00200","speaker":"1270"},{"type":"speech","time":1511973600,"counter":443,"content":"<p>My experience of attending Council meetings in the past 18 months has been that the same issue appears repeatedly on the agenda and people say the same thing in a different way.

I have argued for some years at the committee against many of the defence motions connected with the European Union that come before the committee and cautioned that we are increasingly creeping into an EU militarised structure.  We will debate this issue in the coming week on a major proposed change to Irish defence strategy involving our participation in PESCO or permanent structured co-operation on defence.  We will deal with that proposal in some detail in the House and members will be aware of my views on that issue and our policy of neutrality.<\/p> <p>  A number of issues are not completely clear with regard to the European Union's SatCom market, to which we are signing up.  France became the 24th member of SatCom in August last, which was very convenient given that the contract for the delivery of SatCom was signed recently with one of France's biggest companies, Airbus Defence and Space.  As the world's second largest space communications company, there is a logic to the decision to award the contract to Airbus but it is also strange that France did not sign up to SatCom until that contract was signed.<\/p> <p>  There appears to be a suggestion that the Defence Forces current contract is insufficient.  According to the Minister of State, the project will provide the Defence Forces with security of supply and back-up.  I was not aware of any problem with the supply of satellite communications for the Defence Forces.  Are we liable to pay the current supplier to exit the contract early?  In the event of any failure on the part of the current supplier to meet urgent operational requirements because it is not sufficiently flexible, that is a problem with whomever negotiated the contract in the first place.  If one is negotiating a contract for the supply of satellite communications, it must be flexible and services must be provided at a moment's notice in the event of troops being deployed and requiring such services. <\/p> <p>  The Minister of State indicated there are no costs to the Exchequer.  While there is no immediate cost evident, is there a cost in terms of ending the contract with the current supplier?  What is the cost per use?  One cannot argue there is no cost if a cost arises each time the system is used.<\/p> <p>  Another issue arises with the SatCom project.<\/p><p>It is probably hosted on the Eurostar or one of the other satellites that Airbus has spinning around the earth, looking down on us all.  Who else would share that satellite?  They are not for a single purpose and there have been embarrassing situations in the past where rival companies who were sharing the same space.  I think there was a case some years ago where Vatican TV was embarrassed because there was something inappropriate also coming out on the same channel.  Can we guarantee that whatever system is used is not also being used by our rivals?  We are a neutral country but if we are buying into a system which is to be shared by the other 23 members so far, and there may be more because France is the latest one to join, will that cause a problem?<\/p><p> I concur with the other members on the explosive ordinance or detonation and the respect that those who are involved in this are held across the world.  I recognise the training which members of the Defence Forces who are attached to the ordinance sections have given in war torn areas and countries which are coming out of wars to ensure that areas of land are safe, and I have no problem with that.  I have several queries, however.  They are talking about using Irish personnel, but the information that I have is that there is a major crisis of personnel in terms of members in the ordinance section in the Defence Forces, with a shortfall in skilled members.  If that is the case, and we are committing eight of the most skilled people to get trained on this manual neutralisation capabilities in the European centre, can we afford to release them?  I think that we should and I am not opposed to it but there is a question of can we afford it if we have international commitments and commitments at home, because one still sees the green trucks regularly moving around the country.  It is provided that the &euro;450,000 that this project will cost will  come out of existing resources.  It was not in the Estimates for next year.  If &euro;450,000 is coming out of other resources, what will lose out?  The Defence Forces, like every section, do not have spare cash lying around.  It is &euro;50,000 short of &euro;0.5 million.  It is money that should be found and it should have been in the Estimates, although perhaps that was not possible because we had not passed it then.  <\/p><p> Like other Deputies, I think these proposals are benign, for the most part, but they are an additional step towards our being subsumed, or more accurately, having our self sufficiency undermined, where before we were self sufficient and were capable of looking after ourselves.  We did not rely on international satellites or training.  In common with other Deputies, I am not opposed to the motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2017112900002#D00400","speaker":"1305","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511973600,"counter":446,"content":"<p>On bomb disposal, there are two personnel annually, so there will not be eight people at any one time.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the charge, we pay a standing charge of &euro;400,000 annually to the EDA.

I am not sure what head that might be under in the Estimates but I will find out and revert to the Deputy with an answer.<\/p> <p>  The goal for the new  SatCom Market project is to provide a cost-effective SatCom service solution for the benefit of EDA participating member states and EU institutions.  The Defence Forces currently have a commercial contract in place for the provision of these services which the Deputy inquired about.  Participation in this project will provide the Defence Forces with security of supply and back up in the event of any failure on the part of our current supplier, with whom we will not be breaking our existing contract.  It will be used only if there is a failure on the part of our current supplier or an urgent operational requirement which cannot be made under the current contract.  It will be beneficial for operations overseas, on maritime patrols and Operation Sophia.  The cost is on a pay-by-use basis, without any standing charge.  The EDA is not there to make money.  I cannot give an exact cost of involvement if we have to avail of the service but the rate would be very keen.

I will continue with this line of thought.  We have signed up to European battle groups, for instance.  The logic with this interoperability is that if Ireland is involved in an EU battle group, all the telecommunications systems would be the same if we are working with armies from other countries.  If they have signed up to the same satellite communications, and the logic is that one would use that when based overseas, not necessarily in Ireland, that means that there is a potential cost to the Exchequer because one still has the existing supplier.  I am not opposed to it, I am merely saying that there is a logic here.  Would there then be a cost of us having to switch some of our equipment or is the equipment sufficiently new that it can switch between satellite providers at a moment's notice if required?  One could have a situation in Mali, for instance, where there is a detachment of Irish troops.  Are they working on their own?  Are they working through their own satellite provider or will they be with the other EU troops there, collectively, working off a different communications system?  That would involve a cost.  It might be minor, and the Minister of State is correct that the European Defence Agency is not there to make profit but it must also pay Airbus for the guaranteed space to be available 24-7, which is what the contract would be.<\/p><p>The space on that satellite would have to be sufficient for all the EU's military missions and operations into the future.  I presume whoever negotiated the contract with Airbus would have done that.  I do not know enough about satellites and how they work to figure out how much would be required, but I understand that if there are two satellites they sometimes go out of range so it is necessary to switch between different satellites.  The advantage of going with Airbus is that it has so many satellites one is never in the dark at any one time.  There is a logic to it but we should not present it as not having any cost.  It has a potential cost in the future.  That might be a better way of presenting it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2017112900002#E00900","speaker":"1305","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511973600,"counter":455,"content":"<p>Let us say the Government decides tomorrow morning that we are to participate in a mission somewhere in Africa or wherever.

If we were to undertake a new mission we would have to renegotiate a package with the existing provider.  If that provider was unable to provide us with a service, the EDA gives us another option in the future.

He said to me, \"You know, Minister, we do not know anything about peacekeeping\".  He said, \"We just train our soldiers on how to use the best equipment in the world and we send them out on peacekeeping missions\".  It brought home to me the difference between what we are about and what the big powers do.  They use force and move in, but we occupy a special little niche.  We are renowned throughout the world for our peacekeeping qualities.  We do not go about armed to our tonsils with bombs, bullets and the like.  We have methods of dealing with people.  I recall visiting Lebanon.  My wife was with me.  One day while I was out visiting outposts she was taken away to visit the homes of various leading local mukhtars and so forth as part of the build-up of goodwill.<\/p> <p>  We are unique.  I believe that is what is so special about our method of peacekeeping.  We need not compete, and I am not saying we do or that the Minister of State is proposing it, with other big powers that are spending a great deal of money.  It is innate in our people that we are very good at peacekeeping.  Sitting down, having a cup of tea and a chat and getting information is every bit as important as having spies on the ground.  It is unique.  The peacekeeping college is something we should put up in lights.  It exists, but very few people know about it.  It uses the skills that we have developed over the years.  Ordinary personnel spend some time in the peacekeeping college sharing their experiences with those who want to learn about our methods.

The peacekeeping school is very important for the Irish Defence Forces.  It is part of the education of both enlisted personnel and cadets, as peacekeeping is one of the topics enshrined in their training.  I am not sure if members are aware of the peace and leadership institute proposed in the programme for Government.  It is a concept the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces are bringing forward with the support of the Government.  It will be an institute specifically based on Ireland's participation in peacekeeping.  We are doing some groundwork on that at present with regard to potential courses and how people could participate in it.  Personnel from European member states participate in the peacekeeping school, as well as personnel from further afield outside Europe, just as we send some of our officers abroad to talk about peacekeeping, peacekeeping operations and so forth.<\/p> <p>  Irish peacekeepers are really well inspected.  One sees that when one goes abroad and sees them in operation and how the local people respect the participation of the Irish.  I extended an invitation to the committee members to visit one of our missions abroad, in Lebanon or wherever, and that invitation still stands.  It is important for the committee members to see how the Irish participate on the ground.  We can arrange that at any time without a problem.<\/p> <p>  To reply to Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan, Operation Sophia is a UN mandated mission.  We signed up to Operation Sophia under a UN mandate.  It is absolutely within our policy of neutrality to participate in Operation Sophia.  We do not go near the Libyan coast.  We train the Libyan coast guard as part of the operation but we do not go near the Libyan coastline.  If we pick up migrants we bring them to the Italian authorities.<\/p> <p>  With regard to humanitarian and Irish Aid agencies, I feel very strongly that if the Irish Defence Forces are on a mission abroad they should link up with the humanitarian and aid agencies to assist them in every way possible.  I spoke about this at a recent event.  It is most important for members of the Defence Forces.  We do a great deal of humanitarian work in Lebanon and elsewhere.<\/p><p>The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade gives us, through the ambassadors' offices, a budget that the Defence Forces spend on humanitarian projects on the ground such as water, schools, education, sports fields or whatever, to help the local community.

I am obliged to remind the committee that I am prevented by law, and specifically by section 851A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, from discussing the tax affairs of any taxpayer.  <\/p> <p>  I welcome this opportunity to speak to the committee about Revenue's ongoing investigations into offshore matters.  I will use the time available to provide a short briefing in the context of the recent media reports and allegations associated with what are known as the Paradise Papers.  <\/p> <p>  Identifying and confronting non-compliance is a core element of Revenue's work.  Tackling tax evasion is always high on our agenda.  Revenue recognises the serious risk to the Exchequer arising from the use of offshore accounts and structures to evade tax.  Among tax authorities worldwide we have been at the forefront in tackling this risk.<\/p> <p>  Over the years, Revenue has carried out a range of investigations targeting various offshore arrangements and structures used to hide undeclared income.<\/p><p>These investigations have encompassed offshore bank accounts and a wide range of financial and investment products, trusts and offshore structures, bogus non-resident accounts and life assurance products.  The aggregate yield from this work is close to &euro;2.9 billion.<br\/><br\/>Revenue's approach to tackling offshore evasion is recognised by the OECD as best practice and has been adopted by other tax authorities.  Revenue was among the first to address offshore evasion in a structured and systematic way.  In 2001, we set up a specific branch, the offshore assets group, that was dedicated to tackling offshore evasion.  In 2003, a major investigation was launched into the use of offshore bank accounts and other financial products to evade tax resulting in the recovery of more than &euro;1 billion.  A separate investigation into the use of trusts and offshore structures is now substantially complete and has yielded more than &euro;100 million.<br\/><br\/>In recent years, the international environment has changed very significantly and tax authorities worldwide now co-operate very closely in targeting those who seek to hide their profits or gains offshore.  We are adapting and refocusing our compliance framework in response to these developments, in particular, the automatic exchange of information between jurisdictions under arrangements such as the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, FATCA, which is an intergovernmental agreement to share financial account information with the United States of America, the DAC, which refers to a number of EU directives on administrative co-operation, and the OECD's common reporting standard, CRS, which provides tax authorities with greater visibility as regards the offshore assets and income of their residents.<br\/><br\/>With more information becoming available to Revenue through the new information exchange mechanisms, and against a background of closer co-operation between tax authorities worldwide, it became clear that it was no longer appropriate to allow tax defaulters whose default related to offshore matters to avail of the benefits of the voluntary disclosure regime.  Significant changes were introduced in the 2016 Finance Act.  Since May 2017, tax defaulters who use offshore facilities to hide undeclared income, accounts or other assets can no longer make a qualifying disclosure.  This means that such defaulters face penalties of up to 100% of the tax evaded, publication in the quarterly list of tax defaulters and, potentially, criminal prosecution.<br\/><br\/>In advance of the May deadline, Revenue received 2,734 disclosures with a value of almost &euro;84 million.  These are now being analysed, cases profiled and interventions conducted, as appropriate.  On 17 November, Revenue confirmed that following the deadline, a new inquiry is under way to identify and pursue taxpayers engaged in offshore tax evasion and avoidance.<br\/><br\/>It is fundamental to Revenue's way of doing business that we make the best use of all the data at our disposal to identify and tackle tax evasion.  In keeping with this approach, we will home in on all of the data now becoming available to us under information exchange agreements to identify and pursue those who have attempted to use offshore accounts, structures or assets to evade or avoid their tax obligations.  Data analytics is key to this work.  We will use proprietary software to match the new data against Revenue's taxpayer records and then cross-check against the taxpayer's prior returns to determine whether all relevant income and assets have been fully and properly declared.  The new data will also be used in Revenue's social network analysis and anomaly detection tools to identify risky cases from a compliance standpoint.  Where issues are identified, they will be followed up with the appropriation Revenue intervention.<br\/><br\/>I can provide the committee with some of the guiding principles of Revenue's approach to tackling tax evasion and tax avoidance.  Revenue will examine and investigate any case of suspected tax evasion.  Where tax evasion is uncovered, Revenue will apply the maximum sanctions and deterrents, including penalties, publication in the quarterly list of tax defaulters and, potentially, criminal prosecution.  Should it emerge that an Irish-based financial institution has facilitated tax evasion, Revenue will investigate whether such an institution has failed to disclose information to Revenue that should have been disclosed.  If there is evidence of aggressive tax avoidance contrary to Irish legislation, Revenue will investigate thoroughly and will seek to recover the tax avoided, together with interest and avoidance surcharges.  Where appropriate, Revenue will share information with other relevant tax administrations under existing legal frameworks.<br\/><br\/>Revenue has responded to previous media releases regarding bank accounts held with the HSBC Swiss and to documents leaked by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, ICIJ, in LuxLeaks and the Panama Papers, by identifying individuals and entities associated with Ireland, profiling cases, and making the appropriate intervention to determine whether there has been any evasion or avoidance of Irish tax.  We will do likewise in terms of information associated with the Paradise Papers and, while our examination is at an early stage, I can confirm that Revenue has taken the following actions to date.<br\/><br\/>On 13 November 2017, Revenue wrote to both the director of the ICIJ and to the editor of <i>The Irish Times<\/i>, asking them to provide information from the leaked documents that may be relevant in Revenue's continuing work to tackle offshore tax evasion.  On 15 November, <i>The Irish Times<\/i>responded.  It advised that its coverage of this issue arises in the context of its involvement with the ICIJ, whose long-standing policy is not to provide material directly to investigating authorities.  We have not, as yet, received a response from the ICIJ.<br\/><br\/>On 20 November 2017, Revenue wrote to a number of financial institutions.  Revenue sought, among other things, disclosure of any information, particulars or records not already disclosed to Revenue on foot of High Court orders, which the institutions had access to or the ability to access, involving either the opening of an account or the depositing of funds by Irish persons in an offshore operation owned or partially owned by the institutions, including entities that have been liquidated.  This request was for voluntary provision and was made in response to the spirit of comments stated to have been made by the institutions concerned in a recent D&aacute;il debate.  The request did not involve the use of any of the powers available to Revenue.<br\/><br\/>In line with the approach taken in dealing with previous such information releases, Revenue has already carried out an initial analysis of the available information.  Our analysis indicated 71 entities that may have an association with Ireland as well as the 603 addresses and 802 individuals that the ICIJ has associated with Ireland.  These entities are mainly incorporated in the Isle of Man, Bermuda and the Cayman Islands.  The identified individuals and entities will be profiled using our own systems and open sources.  In this, Revenue will also continue to collaborate on intelligence with tax authorities around the world and to share information under existing legal frameworks to identify beneficial owners and establish the role of intermediaries and institutions in facilitating offshore tax evasion.<br\/><br\/>The committee's letter of invitation stated that the committee wants to examine how revelations in the Paradise Papers impact on the future administration and collection of corporate tax receipts.  Until Revenue has fully examined the available information, it is not possible to state whether there are any implications for corporation tax receipts having regard to existing legislation or any future legislation implementing the OECD's base erosion and profit sharing, BEPS, recommendations.  In recent years, the issue of international tax avoidance by multinational enterprises has been the subject of considerable scrutiny internationally, particularly in the BEPS project but also in recent EU initiatives.  These initiatives are borne out of a consensus that tackling aggressive tax planning arrangements by multinationals, including those designed to take advantage of mismatches in tax rules between two or more countries, requires international co-operation.<br\/><br\/>Revenue has been an active participant in discussions both at OECD level and EU level, where new initiatives and legislation designed to tackle corporate tax avoidance internationally have been agreed.  Some of the agreed BEPS measures have been, or are in the process of being, reflected in Irish law.  The implementation of the EU anti-tax avoidance directives to timelines set out in the directives will give a co-ordinated effect to specific BEPS actions across the EU.  Mr. Seamus Coffey compiled a paper entitled Review of the Corporation Tax Code.  In his review he made recommendations about the implementation of the remaining OECD recommendations.  In the context of Budget 2018, the Minister for Finance published an update on Ireland's tax strategy and announced a consultation on the Coffey review.  The consultation is open until 30 January 2018.<br\/><br\/>In summary, to the extent that the Paradise Papers identify any individual or entity associated with Ireland with possible Irish tax issues in respect of tax evasion or aggressive tax avoidance, Revenue will examine the cases and intervene as appropriate.  Individuals or entities who have engaged in offshore evasion now face substantial penalties, publication in the quarterly list of tax defaulters and, potentially, criminal prosecution.<\/p><p>Revenue will also work in close co-operation with other tax administrations in the framework of the OECD's joint international task force on shared intelligence and co-operation, JITSIC, to address issues raised by the Paradise Papers.  Revenue will, as appropriate, share information under existing legal frameworks.  Revenue has a proven track record of significant achievement in acting against offshore evasion and avoidance.  We are determined to take effective action to identify and bring to account tax defaulters who seek to hide undeclared accounts, income or assets offshore and to evade or avoid their tax responsibilities.  I will answer any questions raised by the committee on these issues subject, of course, to taxpayer confidentiality constraints.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017112900002#C00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Cody","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511979300,"counter":476,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Cody for his presentation and call Deputy Boyd Barrett.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017112900002#E00200","speaker":"1369"},{"type":"speech","time":1511979300,"counter":477,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Cody for his presentation.

One of the things the Paradise Papers reveal is that in the case of Apple, following the moves to close down the double Irish at the end of 2013, the intangible assets allowance was increased to 100%.  Then it moved some of its subsidiaries based here to Jersey or the Isle of Man.  I cannot remember which but it was one of those tax havens.  It had advice to the effect that this would allow it to avoid tax as the Jersey entity would sell the assets to the Irish-based company which could claim that as a cost against which it would get an allowance and would pay no tax.  That was perfectly fitted.  Apple engineered it in such a way that its tax liability was exactly the same as it had been when it was using the double Irish structure.  It could set the price at whatever it wanted such that its tax liability did not change.  That is clearly tax avoidance and Apple is clearly manipulating the price at which one subsidiary is selling an intellectual asset to another subsidiary to ensure it pays no tax.  Is there anything we can do about that?

Mr. Cody states the arm's length principle applies, but it was explained to me in an email by an anonymous guy working in one of the companies  - I will not mentioned the name - that the company literally stated how much money it had made and turned it into a cost.  That is what they do.  If the profit figure is &euro;500 million, &euro;600 million or &euro;700 million, what is actually a profit becomes a cost at the stroke of a pen.  They use the subsidiary located in the low tax location or the location in which no tax is paid - in the particular case outlined in the Paradise Papers and our intangible assets allowance regime - which allows them to pay no additional tax.  What is becoming apparent with the \"single malt\" is that they are also doing it in places with which we have double taxation agreements.  That is the latest move in the constant innovation of their tax evasion strategy to utilise countries with which Ireland has double taxation agreements to do exactly the same thing - claiming that they are owned and controlled in one of the place in which no tax is paid and with which Ireland has a double taxation agreement, which allows them to achieve the same end.  It is obvious tax evasion.  I think it was Mr. Eddie Hobbs who wrote recently about many of the big consultancy and accountancy firms in the docks that were openly touting that companies moved their money to Malta as it was no problem because of the double taxation regime in place.  A company can pretend it is owned and controlled in Malta and get away with tax avoidance.

We are talking about complex interaction on the taxation of multinationals that are probably responsible for about 80% of global trade.  The Deputy asked me how tax evasion could be tackled.  The only way it can be tackled is internationally in a globally co-ordinated way.  That is what the OECD BEPS, base erosion and profit shifting, project is about.  Let us go back to 2012.  The original process for double taxation agreements was very much about ensuring there would be no double taxation on international transactions.  All through the 1990s and 2000s that was the process in place.  In 2010 and 2011 - it was highlighted around 2012 - there was an increased recognition that some of the strategy used by multinational enterprise led to double non-taxation.  This culminated in the US Senate hearings.  We have spoken before about this issue.  The G20, the G7 and the OECD BEPS project became part of the process in tackling that issue.  The various 15 groups and numerous actions are part of tackling it.  It is not something the Revenue Commissioners can close down across the board.

I come from Gaoth Dobhair in west Donegal where there used to be a turf-burning station to generate electricity.  I know many people who used to cut turf and sell it to the factory which burned it to generate electricity.  To a person, they were advised by a financial institution to put their money in accounts on the Isle of Man.  These are not tax planners but ordinary people who went out with a sle&aacute;n to cut turf.  They did seriously hard work and were put to the pin of their collar as a result of the advice they had received.  They had to pay the very severe penalty, but the bankers walked free.  That is the point about which I talk.  The Revenue Commissioners refer to criminal prosecutions, but it is no wonder that the Isle of Man continued to target Irish residents or AIB and Bank of Ireland.  Those concerned got away scot free.  Nobody is being prosecuted.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Cody refers to evidence.  The Revenue Commissioners have recovered the money extremely efficiently, including through applying penalties, but the deterrents for the future were not dealt with appropriately.  That takes me to the question of how many tax evaders have faced criminal prosecution in recent years.  How many companies have faced criminal prosecution for tax evasion?  How many firms that advised on these structures have faced criminal prosecution?  I say with hand on heart that I have considerable regard for the Revenue Commissioners.  The agency is extremely professional, but there is a serious problem.  If one is caught, one has to pay the penalties, unless there is a scheme that continues for years and years, in which case one can put up one's hands and not face rigorous penalties, but there is no real deterrent afterwards.

We look at those.  There are essentially two approaches to dealing with something which we see as having the hallmarks of avoidance.  The first is to consider whether there is a specific provision in our anti-avoidance legislation under which the scheme can be tackled or we have our general anti-avoidance provision, which was originally section 811 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.

The Minister announced a package of measures in the context of the budget.  One of them was the creation of an offence of strict liability.  Essentially, if one had an offshore account which was party to tax evasion, one would be liable.  This goes back to Deputy Pearse Doherty's question about why we did not prosecute when somebody definitely had an account.  The bar for criminal prosecution is high.  It is a criminal prosecution so one must prove a <i>mens rea<\/i>and one must have evidence.  We put forward a proposal and the Minister announced in the budget that it would be part of the package.  When it came to the Finance Bill and drafting the provision, however, the Parliamentary Counsel and the Office of the Attorney General had a problem with it, essentially because of the Constitution.  The UK had introduced a similar provision, but because of its different legal framework and because of decisions in the C case, it did not proceed here.  It was not a result of the Minister opposing it however.  One of the things we need to look at the end of this process is whether there are other approaches.  The UK made a change recently which made it an offence for someone not to make a correction in a particular year.  We will continue to look at that.  The huge change is around the information we are getting.  We are not dependent on court orders to find out something.  We are now getting a huge exchange of information.<\/p><p>It is very interesting that the matching of the data is better because this is all linked into the anti-money laundering directives and the need to know one's customer.

In September, there were 4,400 tax appeals before it, with the amount of tax in dispute standing at &euro;1.5 billion.  Some 60 appeals have been in the system for more than ten years and some date back 20 years.  I appreciate that a transition was required from the old tax appeals system to the current system.

The reform involved in the Tax Appeals Commission is one of the most positive developments for tax administration in a long time.  The commission has inherited a major legacy of delayed and backlogged cases.  It is a new agency and it is carrying out a public consultation to which we have made a submission, as have the chartered accountants and various other players.  One of the major reforms is that the Tax Appeals Commission now publishes its determinations, having regard to confidentiality.  This is one of the most significant positive developments.  It is now engaged in a process of determining how to manage the legacy while not ignoring the current workload.  I take a positive view as I believe there will be a significant improvement in the administration of tax across the board in the coming years.<\/p> <p>  There is clearly a resource issue and I note that last week the Tax Appeals Commission advertised for case workers to support the process.  It is now engaged in a series of innovative work practices regarding case conferences.  While it will probably take a number of years, I am hopeful about the outcome of the process.  The figure of 4,400 cases gives a false impression because many of these legacy cases are linked to tax avoidance issues.  This means there will be a lead case and a series of follow-on cases.

Deputy Boyd Barrett asked about employment and bogus self-employment.  Members are familiar with our work on the contractors project, which was the subject of a review by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  It is practically impossible to examine limited liability and company status.  A consultation process in which we had a huge support role and which was sponsored by the Departments of Finance and Employment Affairs and Social Protection has been finalised.  The report in that regard is soon to be published.  The challenge in respect of PSC and MSC-type structures is that the employers' PRSI contribution is the primary fiscal incentive.  There are issues in terms of expenses but the 12.5% tax rate and close company surcharge should equalise some of that.  The employers' PRSI contribution is the main fiscal driver.  There are other drivers in terms of employment rights and workers' rights.  There are different motivations and incentives in respect of personal service companies for a person who is well-paid and other operations whereby people are probably being forced into a process.  It is hugely challenging to examine, in particular where people enter into an arrangement with a limited company, which is an entity in its own right.  I usually say such issues are policy matters and I do not have a personal opinion but I think there is a need for a legislative process in regard to the need for the payment of the equivalent of an employer's PRSI contribution by a principal contractor in some yet-to-be-defined circumstances.  I am not solely referring to construction.  It is a complex area and no country has managed to implement such legislation.  Members are familiar with the Taylor report, which considered some such aspects in the United Kingdom.  It is a matter for legislation.<\/p><p>If there is to be legislation and if it is implemented we will then have a process which we will be changing again in a few years.  It is a bit like the tax planning process.  What we do is look at employment of people, employment for people and sole traders, and what is deemed to be bogus self-employment.  For example, last year we did 2,167 visits to construction sites and interviewed 11,700 people.  We reclassified probably only 340 people, but 850 people on the sites were neither on the PAYE system nor on the subcontractor system.  We got them registered.  We registered various people as employers.  We have a highly labour intensive process that we take very seriously.  There is no doubt that there are many sectors, such as software engineering, with personal service companies.  There are also managed service companies, with probably six directors as part of the company structure and often they do not know one other.  These structures are put in place.  When we started looking at the contractors project we saw inflated expense claims, and this is what we have challenged.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017112900002#M02600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Cody","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511979300,"counter":659,"content":"<p>Some organisations are now marketing companies that are aimed at people coming out of an employee relationship.

We have said that we are trying to ensure our ICT framework is in place to facilitate an increase in customs entry, so we can have a process in place.  We must develop our customs ICT systems to implement the Union customs code, which was passed in 2016 and is to be introduced in stages.  We are in a process of ensuring that our ICT framework is fit for purpose because that will be the thing that will prevent all trade facilitation.  It requires scaling up our systems and looking at how to maximise the opportunities provided in the Union customs code, which will be relevant regardless of the outcome of Brexit.  As I said that day, we are not planning customs posts on the land frontier.  We are not going through that process.<\/p> <p>  We are constantly asked what staffing we would need to control a customs process where there was a full hard Brexit, or whatever it is called.  We do not know.  We pay close attention to the UK commentary where people talk about up to 5,000 customs officials.  We received authorisation in the 2016 budget for an additional resource of 40 for preparatory work on Brexit.  A parliamentary question was asked about our current numbers - it was probably answered today.  We probably have fewer than 20 people who are engaged in the process around the Union customs code and scaling up our operations, which will deal with some aspects of Brexit.  Clearly, the idea of a hard border is unthinkable but customs is moving very much towards an audit based system, and we wish to maximise that whatever happens.  There is a sense or idea that we were instructed to stop doing our work, but we have always said that what we are doing is scoping out the Union customs code.  The original draft report was work started by our customs division very early, which we did not finish.  When we looked at aspects, we were not instructed by anybody to stop any of the work we were going, and we have an obligation to carry out our work as the tax and customs administration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017112900002#O00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Cody"},{"type":"speech","time":1511979300,"counter":685,"content":"<p>I have so many questions we could talk all night.

While it states we are okay when it comes to the BEPS, base erosion and profit shifting, project, compliance and tax transparency, we would be blacklisted when it came to fair taxation.  One of the criteria used in judging fair taxation is the relationship between real economic activity and capital flows.  That is the red flag for what we politely call tax avoidance or whatever euphemism we use for the guys who try to pay no tax.<\/p> <p>  According to the Oxfam report, royalties coming out of Ireland are the equivalent of 26% of gross domestic product.  That signals that there is something amiss.  What does Mr. Cody think about this and intellectual property?  I know that he cannot comment on the politics of the issue of intangible assets allowance.  However, when one looks at the massive placing onshore of intellectual property after the change to that measure, whatever the rights and wrongs of the decision, clearly it was tax avoidance activity and should be called as such.  Does Mr. Cody feel able to say placing onshore of intellectual property on such a scale is clearly tax avoidance activity?  It distorts the economy to the extent that it does not bear any relationship to real economic activity which, in turn, should signal that we have got to do something about it.<\/p> <p>  One point construction workers make to me is that if the same criteria were applied to the relationship between real economic activity and tax revenue under the relevant contracts tax, RCT, system, there should be a red flag there too.  The latest figures I received from the Revenue Commissioners showed how the net income from 55,000 workers in the construction sector was &euro;20 million after refunds and offsets.  There was a gross figure of &euro;200 million.  The figure for offsets was &euro;160 million.  The tax revenue from 55,000 PAYE workers would be 100 times that amount.  Should there not be a red flag given the mismatch between real economic activity and, in one case, tax revenue and, in another, the scale of capital flows?  If the European Commission's judgment against Apple on the provision of state aid and a tax liability that flowed from it was applied to other similar firms which used the same tax structures, is it possible the European Union might believe it was owed more money?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017112900002#P00200","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1511979300,"counter":697,"content":"<p>The committee has agreed to invite Oxfam to make a presentation.

The money offset is the money that is paid.  We get the principal contractor to stop RCT at the rate of 20% or 35%.  That money is available to be offset.  The offset is against the subcontractors' income tax liability.  The net amount repaid is actually money that is available from the money that was stopped after they had filed their income tax return and paid.  The offset is in settlement of the subcontractor's tax liability for the year.  RCT works in a way that, if a subcontractor is up-to-date with their returns, there is a zero amount stopped because they have filed their income tax return and paid their tax under the normal system.  RCT is a measure that ensures we impose a 35% rate on a non-compliant subcontractor to make them compliant.

I apologise on behalf of the Taoiseach who is unable to be here.<\/p><p>The net Estimate for Vote 5 - Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions for 2017 is &euro;40,676,000.  The moneys provide for the salaries and expenses of the director and her staff, the cost of the local State solicitor service, fees to counsel engaged by the director to prosecute cases in the various courts and legal costs awarded against the State arising from judicial review and other legal proceedings.<\/p><p>A Supplementary Estimate of &euro;418,000 is being sought for 2017 which represents a 1% increase in the net allocation.  The need for the Supplementary Estimate arises from greater than budgeted expenditure on input A2 administration &ndash; non-pay and input A3 &ndash; fees to counsel, together with receipts in input B &ndash; appropriations-in-aid falling below the level budgeted for.Savings elsewhere in the Vote are insufficient to offset the need for a Supplementary Estimate.<\/p><p>There are a range of factors that give rise to the need for the Supplementary Estimate.  I will address them in the order in which they are listed in the Vote.<\/p><p>In terms of the input A2 administration &ndash; non-pay, two main factors give rise to the projected overspend of &euro;616,000 under the subhead.  The first is a requirement to spend approximately &euro;261,000 on the office's IT case management system to meet costs that arise from a major upgrade of software.  The fact that the costs of this upgrade would fall in the calendar year 2017 only became apparent after the 2017 Estimates had been finalised.<\/p><p>The second aspect of administration &ndash; non-pay expenditure which is projected to run significantly ahead of the amount provided for 2017, has to do with the completion of a range of refurbishment projects that the Office of Public Works has undertaken in the context of moving all staff of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions to one site on the Infirmary Road, Dublin.  After 16 years of being split across different sites, the Office of Public Works completed works during 2017 that enabled all staff of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions to be accommodated on the one site.  Managing expenditure on a significant-sized capital project from annual voted expenditure is inherently difficult because of the uncertainty as to in which year costs will fall to be paid.  The additional spending of approximately &euro;355,000 projected under this heading in 2017 arises from the timing of the expenditure rather than an underestimation of refurbishment costs.<\/p><p>In terms of input A3 &ndash; fees to sounsel, two main<b><\/b>factors give rise to the projected overspend of &euro;1.377 million under this subhead.  The first is a general increase in activity in the courts and, in particular, the Central Criminal Court with the assignment of additional judges leading to an increase in the number of sittings.  The Central Criminal Court is the court that deals with the prosecution of murder and rape cases.  The second factor that gave rise to the overspend under the subhead is the cost of a series of complex financial trials.  Fees to prosecution counsel in excess of &euro;1 million have been paid in these cases in 2017.As the factors that gave rise to the overspend in 2017 are likely to continue into 2018, I inform the committee that to ensure the underlying level of activity on fees to counsel does not give rise to a Supplementary Estimate again in 2018, an additional allocation of &euro;1.54 million has been added to the subhead for 2018.<\/p><p>In terms of input B &ndash; appropriations-in-aid, there is a projected shortfall of &euro;158,000.  This arises from difficulties in estimating the amount of costs that will be awarded by the courts to the director in any one year and also from an over-estimation of the amount that would be realised from pension-related deductions from salaries.  The additional expenditure, of which I have advised the committee, amounts to a total of &euro;2.151 million.  However, a range of savings made elsewhere in the Vote have reduced the amount required by way of Supplementary Estimate to &euro;418,000.  <\/p><p>I recommend the Supplementary Estimate of &euro;418,000 to the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017112900002#B00400","speaker":"1290"},{"type":"speech","time":1511973600,"counter":724,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017112900002#B00500","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speech","time":1511973600,"counter":725,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his presentation.

Since the World Health Organization, WHO, Alma Ata Declaration of 1978, many countries have recognised the need to orientate health care towards GP-led care in the community, based on an extensive body of international research which shows that continuity of care and the patient-centred approach that is specific to the general practice model of care is associated with better health outcomes, equity of access, reduced inequalities in health, more appropriate utilisation of services and long-term cost-effectiveness.<\/p> <p>  Numerous recent studies have reaffirmed the value of general practice.  For example, a 17 year study of more than 1,700 older patients found that continuity of care through attending the same general practitioner was associated with lower mortality.  Continuity of care in general practice has also been linked to reduced probability of patient hospitalisation, an uptake in screening programs and immunisation, improved medicine use and adherence, and lower health care costs.  Elements of high-quality general practice, including robust continuity of care, greater first contact access and use, more person-focused care over time, a greater available range of services provided when needed, and co-ordination of care are strongly linked with superior patient outcomes and lower health care costs.  In particular, areas with greater general practitioner activity have been found to be associated with lower hospital activity, more co-ordinated care and lower health care costs.  The efficiencies and cost savings delivered by investment in general practice were demonstrated by an analysis conducted by Rhode Island&rsquo;s department of health that indicated that higher general practice utilisation rates are associated with decreased per person health care costs and improved patient outcomes.<\/p><p>At the same time the prevalence of chronic disease is expected to increase by between 4% and 5% per annum over the next ten years.  Currently, care for patients with chronic conditions is fragmented, with the majority taking place in hospital settings at significant expense to the taxpayer.  The current model for managing chronic disease is fragmented and is focused on the acute hospital system.  That system is overburdened and underfunded, with emergency department, ED, overcrowding, intolerable waiting times for outpatient appointments and inequity of access.  Acute services are now undertaking an enormous volume of work that could, if resourced properly, be managed in general practice.  Such a move would ensure that care could be delivered to the patient in the community, outcomes would improve and, importantly, capacity in the acute services could be freed up to deal with cases of greater complexity.  The Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, has been consistently calling for a shift in the model of care towards general practice and care in the community, with additional supports including maximising the use of practice nurses and equitable access to allied health care professionals in the community.  The model of care must be GP-led to ensure continuity and a patient-centred approach, and to avoid duplication and further fragmentation of care.<\/p><p> In May 2017, the Oireachtas cross-party Committee on the Future of Healthcare published the Sl&aacute;intecare report, laying out an ambitious ten-year plan for reform of the health care system.  In line with international evidence, the cross-party group reached consensus on the need to reorientate care towards general practice and care in the community.  The IMO has some concerns about the visitation rates, costings and timelines for implementation.<\/p><p> There are currently 666 GPs over the age of 60 who will be retiring in the next five to seven years, of which 244 GPs are over the age of 65 and are likely to retire in the next two years.  With current difficulties in recruiting GPs, rural areas are likely to be most affected.<\/p><p> The HSE Health Service Planning Office estimates that with the introduction of the under-six GP visit card, demand for GP consultations in this population will have increased by 65.7% in 2017 and by 42.4% by 2022.  Based on conservative estimates by the HSE National Doctors Training and Planning Office, by 2025 Ireland will need an additional 1,380 GPs to meet current demand, while an additional 2,055 GPs will be needed to expand free GP care to the entire population.<\/p><p> Cuts to general practice under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts of up to 38% have had a significant impact on GPs' morale and their ability to recruit additional staff.  A recent survey by the Irish College of General Practitioners highlights a number of causes of general practitioners&rsquo; dissatisfaction with their working conditions.  Roughly half of all general practitioners rate their morale as either poor or very poor, three quarters report their stress levels to be either high or very high, and more than half of those who tried to recruit a sessional doctor or assistant during the past year were unable to do so.<\/p><p> Some 17% of newly qualified GPs work abroad, with many more planning to emigrate.  A survey of GP trainees found that more than half are undecided as to whether they will remain in Ireland, one eighth are resolved to leave Ireland, and just a third plan on remaining to practise in Ireland.<\/p><p> There is no infrastructure in place to support multi-disciplinary team working.  Waiting lists apply to allied health and social care services in the community, and many of these services are simply not available to patients outside the General Medical Service, GMS, regardless of their ability to pay.<\/p><p> The most recent national system of health accounts released, those for 2015, demonstrate that just 3.5% of public current expenditure on health is spent in general practice.  By contrast, the United Kingdom&rsquo;s National Health Service spends 8.1% of its budget on general practice, and has committed to increasing this proportion to 11% of its budget.  In Australia this figure sits at approximately 6.4% of public current expenditure.  Ireland is losing its newly qualified GPs to countries where the value of GP care is recognised, and where governments apportion a greater percentage of public spending to GP care.<\/p><p> Experience from other jurisdictions shows that in order to reap the benefits, the development of general practice and care in the community requires significant investment over time.  Even if general practice was to be fully funded tomorrow, there is not enough capacity in general practice to deal with the predicted additional workload.  The under-six contract brought in 240,000 additional patients.  The Sl&aacute;intecare report recommends that free GP care be extended to 500,000 additional patients per annum.  As it is currently constituted, this will lead to waiting lists in general practice as demand will outstrip capacity.  Additional supports for infrastructure and practice staff, specifically additional practice nurses, will be needed to allow GPs build up capacity.  Consideration must also be given to supports for GP principals to hire additional GPs, as well as administrative support.  Many practices will need to physically expand to cope with the additional workload and create capacity.  This may require grants for extensions, additional rooms, etc.  GPs must be able to access diagnostics and allied health and social care professionals on an equitable basis.<\/p><p> Same-day service and continuity of care are part of what makes Irish general practice work well.  By increasing demand through making service available free at the point of use without also increasing capacity we threaten these very principles.  It is important, therefore, that the impact of any measures is fully thought through, with a more detailed examination of the increased workload and capacity that will be required to ensure that care is delivered to the patients that need it.  There is no point in removing one barrier to access in the form of cost if we only create another in the form of time.<\/p><p> In line with the IMO recommendations to the Oireachtas Committee on the Future of Healthcare, the IMO is calling on the Department of Health and the HSE to agree a strategy with the IMO for the development of general practice and GP-led care in the community over the coming decade.  Priority should be given to negotiating a new GP contract with the IMO that is properly resourced and fit for purpose for a 21st century health service.  This contract should focus on investment in evidence-based chronic disease management programmes for which GPs are already trained.  The IMO would be pleased to discuss any aspect of our statement further with the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017112900002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. P&aacute;draig McGarry","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1511946000,"counter":805,"content":"<p>The Irish College of General Practitioners, ICGP, is the professional body for general practice in Ireland.

Every day, thousands of people all over the country get to see their family doctor without a significant wait, getting quality attention and care for urgent and pressing problems.  To ensure that we can continue to provide that cradle-to-grave service to an expanded population with more challenging conditions, and address our retention and manpower crisis in general practice, we urgently need to commit to greater resources and a new contract.  In this submission, we will show the committee what that expansion means, what the challenges are, and what our legislators need to do to ensure that general practitioners and their practice teams can continue to be at the heart of a reformed and improving health service.<\/p> <p>  It is the view of the college that the remainder of primary care, the secondary care sector and the broader health system will never function safely, efficiently or effectively unless adequate capacity is built in GP-led primary care.  In addition to chronic underfunding of GP-led primary care over decades, there are separate intractable difficulties regarding the way that secondary care is delivered in the Irish health system, and it is not the task of GPs or primary care to fix these hospital-related problems.  <\/p> <p>  Protracted and grave difficulties relating to critical bottlenecks in emergency departments, in waiting times for most public hospital services, in sub-optimal health outcomes, in perceived and actual gross inequalities in access, and in well-identified system risks arising from overcrowding and health care-acquired infections will all continue as the inevitable consequences of a hospital-centric system where decades of systematic under-resourcing of GP-led primary care are clearly evident.  This is what we have done badly in the past. <\/p> <p>  Specialist services, referred to as \"consultant-led\", in a hospital-centric model, remain, and will continue to remain, unable to safely or effectively address the present volumes of clinical workload.  Much of this workload is best addressed in the community setting, not in hospitals.  It is best delivered by teams of GPs and practice nurses working in a generalist, not a specialist service, and based in practices that are adequately supported by administrative staff and allied health care professionals, with access to diagnostics, so that more of the health care needs of most people can be addressed in the community, closest to where they live and at the most appropriate levels of cost and complexity.  If we want to do it expensively, we should do it in a hospital.<\/p><p> Strong international evidence from various health systems exists in respect of developing a system based on strong GP-led primary care. Development of universal access to strong GP-led primary care delivers substantial benefits to all citizens and must now be considered as relatively inexpensive in the context of whole-system health care costs.  In our statement, and the accompanying briefing documents, the position of the ICGP regarding the expansion of primary care is set out in detail.<\/p><p> Initial steps towards achieving a health system based on GP-led primary care must involve the immediate reversal of cuts introduced under the FEMPI legislation and the replacement of our 39 year old GMS contract with one that addresses both the needs of people who have an immediate need for ongoing medical care in their communities and those of the general practice teams.  These two issues - FEMPI and contracts - are constantly to the fore in our consultations with our members, with allied organisations - including the GP representative organisations, namely, the IMO and NAGP, and the Irish Practice Nurses Association, IPNA - and in our engagement with other health disciplines within the health care sector.  It is the view of the ICGP that FEMPI legislation has destabilised general practice, most acutely in rural and deprived communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017112900002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Brendan O'Shea","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1511946000,"counter":809,"content":"<p>The next four paragraphs outline what we believe to be stronger primary care.  This will resonate with what the committee will hear from us, the IMO, the NAGP and ICTU this morning and in the context of the reports with which it has been involved during the past year.<\/p> <p>  The first feature relates to capacity, which predominantly relates to persons.  Health care is provided by persons, namely, GPs, nurses and other allied health care professionals.  We spend &euro;1 billion on drugs and another &euro;600 million on high-tech drugs.  Most health care is delivered by people and we need to invest in those people.  The ICGP has played its part in this regard.  Applications for GP training increased from 285 to 421 this year.  We are doing our best to paint a positive picture of general practice.  However, we need all these policies to come into place so that we can retain them into the future.  It is not just GPs.  We need a lot more practice nurses and we will work with the IPNA to develop and train those nurses.  That is a priority.  Capacity is not just persons though, we need better information technology.  When we take on more workload and capacity is increased, we need our premises to be expanded and that needs to be supported.<\/p> <p>  Our second point relates to the independent contractor model.  There is much discussion regarding model to use and how are we going to employ and pay for these services.  Most countries' health services use an independent contractor model, even the NHS.  We have an independent contractor model.  To enable GP-led primary care, we need to bolster and improve the current model.   We need it to be supported with increased numbers of practice nurses and other staff within the GP environment so that we can provide unfragmented comprehensive continuous carer to patients.<\/p> <p>  Our third point is that we need to shift care from hospitals to primary care settings.  What are we talking about?  We are talking about people with multiple chronic conditions.  People who have six to ten chronic conditions who are on ten to 15 medications.  It is the majority of our workload in consultation.  In the final years of their lives, people can be over-medicalised in a hospital-centric system.  If we want them to have the care they deserve, with their preferences and their quality of life maintained, we need to support the generalist approach to health care.   That would allow us and the teams within general  practice to care for those persons and that needs to be reflected in a new contract.<\/p> <p>  We need that capacity to be team-led within general practice.  The GPs, practice nurses and other allied health care  professionals need to be supported.  In particular, practice nurses need better terms and conditions and that needs to be reflected too.  This will develop a stronger primary care system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017112900002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mark Murphy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1511946000,"counter":810,"content":"<p>Over 4,000 of our practitioners identified general practice as the discipline for the purposes of professional competence.  Most are members of ICGP.  We have over 600 GP trainees.  We have consulted widely among ourselves and allied stakeholders.  This committee has a very difficult brief because health is a very complex issue, fraught with risk and cost.  For ease, we have identified action points at the end of our document regarding the expansion of primary care.  We feel that these are the pressing issues.  There is a list of them at the end of our opening statement.<\/p> <p>  Cuts to general practice resulting from FEMPI measures should be reversed.  There should be an effective contract for general practice, delivering adequate flexibility, resources and development.  Adequate numbers of generalist practice staff must be recruited and trained, with planning for a population of 5 million.  That has to be set in train now and we are doing our part in the ICGP to make that possible.  Adequate and accountable capacity in allied health disciplines in communities should also be made available.  That means electronic data that is available to drive and guide development.  There should be active, ongoing, effective collaboration between the ICGP, the  GP representative organisations and the HSE.  Private health insurers should engage with GP stakeholders and State agencies on the challenge of multi-morbidity.  Private health insurance largely does not recognise primary care management of chronic disease.<\/p> <p>  Protected transformation funds for education and research relevant to general practice development are needed.  GP involvement in nursing home care and end-of-life care requires targeted funding.  There should also be targeted funding for GP diagnostics in radiology and for specific clinical workloads.  Expansion of GP training capacity is required, as is the development of practice nurse education to include continuing medical education for practice nurses as a priority.  The use of electronic medical records and administration should be extended beyond general practice, where it is already strong, throughout the remainder of the health system, particularly hospital based services.  It is incredible that most of the rest of the health care system is operating on paper.  The members of the primary care team run by the HSE have no contact email addresses.  That is inexplicable.<\/p> <p>  Overall, key policies relevant to expansion of primary care as a national strategic priority must be implemented urgently and aggressively as a national strategic priority,  in the interest of equity, clinical safety and improving medical care.

I thank the witnesses for coming in and for all the information they have provided.  I was a member of the Committee on the Future of Healthcare and we would have felt the loss of the witnesses' input because it is very helpful to hear from people who are actually delivering the services.  It is all very well for us to imagine what it might look like but it is quite another thing to hear from the experts.<\/p> <p>  I have a number of questions.  The recent resignation of Richard Corbridge, or his moving on, is a huge blow in the context of the development of information technology.  It often struck me when I represented people in the health services that the higher up the chain one reached in terms of management, the farther away one got from the patient and the more one was to encounter the use of BlackBerrys, as was, iPads or some other forms of mobile electronic devices.  It is really sadly lacking.  Perhaps the witnesses could expand on what exactly would be needed in terms of information technology?<\/p> <p>  We do not want to get ahead of ourselves, but just bring us up to what would be considered basic in more advanced information technology.  The people who should have access to this technology are those who are operating within and move about the community.  The witnesses might give us a flavour of how much access there is and what can be done.  Who needs to have access to mobile information technology?  How would that work?  I am thinking in terms of access to near-patient testing and other things that might actually help in the delivery of health care.  It did often strike me that the higher up one went and the farther one got away from the patient, the more likely one was to see technology in use.  It was a kind of a reward as opposed to something to be used in a practical sense.<\/p><p>There are health care professionals who have to use their own electronic devices, which is not acceptable.  What improvements can be made in this area and what would it take to achieve them?<\/p><p> In regard to the breakdown of the fee structure, we see the large sums making the headlines in the newspapers, the Dr. X whose practice received X amount of money.  Will the delegates explain what makes up GP income, which percentage is from fee-per-item income and which percentage is from GMS income?  I appreciate that the ratios will vary from practice to practice but a guideline breakdown would be helpful.  The large sums will always hit the headlines but representative organisations tell us that the income from the State by no means amounts to a bonanza.  Where there is a fee-per-item structure, how much of that work is done directly by the GP, how much by the practice nurse and how is all of that remunerated?<\/p><p> Reference was made to the interaction between GPs and primary care teams, allied health professionals and others delivering services in the community.  In practice, those interactions are not usually managed by the GP.  Are GPs willing to manage that service more closely or is it the witnesses' view that the two arms should function separately?  I am asking about what their preference would be in an ideal world.  Should we have an independent general practitioner model and, ancillary to that, allied health professionals providing additional primary care services?  I understand there is huge frustration among GPs at the difficulties in accessing therapy and other specialist services for patients.  Might that problem be resolved by bringing those services under the remit of GPs or is it more a question of enhancing communication between the GP on the front line and the broader HSE service provision?<\/p><p> I have spoken to people who say we are about to see an influx of multinationals into the provision of GP services.  We could sit here all day and detail all the reasons that the relationship between patient and local GP is a positive thing, where the doctor knows the person's history and family and is himself or herself a member of the community.  People who are cheerleading for an increased input by multinational service providers, of whom I am not one, argue that it will solve the problem of a difficulty in accessing GPs in rural areas and areas of deprivation.  I am not convinced of that but am interested in the delegates' view.<\/p><p> I am sure the witnesses are aware of my view on GP salaries, just as I am familiar with their position.  There was talk in the media in recent months about the prospect of some form of industrial action.  I fully appreciate, as someone who practised in that area, of the challenges involved in advocating for the rights of workers in a particular sector.  What we are hearing is that there is an issue not only in regard to recruitment and retention, which is undeniable, but also in terms of the morale of the GPs providing the services.  Will the delegates comment on that?<\/p><p> On the GP contract, we are not asking our guests to negotiate it here with us or, indeed, to give away any negotiating position they might have adopted.  We often note in this committee that every question we ask of the Department of Health regarding primary care and GP services is met with the response that the outcome of negotiations is awaited, after which every problem will be fixed.  I do not know how good the GP contract will be but it seems unlikely to solve every problem that has ever existed in primary care.  Will the delegates give us an idea of when they see the negotiations coming to some sort of conclusion?  I am not the only person in this committee or in the Oireachtas who is frustrated at the lack of progress, which is not to say that both sides are not working hard to move things along.  It seems, however, that a great deal of stuff has been put on hold pending agreement on GP contracts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017112900002#F00600","speaker":"1302","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511946000,"counter":815,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses and thank them for their contributions.  I acknowledge the fantastic work GPs do and the huge pressures and responsibilities under which they operate.  I represent the rural constituency of Cork South-West where many GP positions are unfilled, presumably because we are so far from cities and the hospitals and other health care facilities located there.  What can be done to make it more inviting for younger doctors, in particular, to apply for rural positions?<\/p> <p>  The Spotlight report on benchmarking the health care system observed that it is rare for GPs to work alongside other health professionals in an integrated way.  Do the delegates agree that a close working relationship between doctors and ancillary service providers is vital for a more effective and progressive primary health care system?<\/p> <p>  My final question concerns a local issue that I have raised several times.  Management at Bantry General Hospital has stated on numerous occasions that it has the capacity to oversee a larger number of procedures if it is granted the endoscopy and rehabilitation unit it has been requesting for years.  If that request were granted, would it alleviate pressures on doctors in the locality?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017112900002#G00200","speaker":"1262"},{"type":"speech","time":1511946000,"counter":816,"content":"<p>I welcome the delegates, with whom we have had discussions on a previous occasion regarding the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  We were very conscious in examining proposals for a ten-year strategy for the health service that primary care must be at the heart of it.  All the experts who came before the committee spoke about the need for an increased and enhanced capacity in primary care.<\/p> <p>  An issue that is critical in this regard is the number of GPs.  That is determined by two factors, the first being a training programmes for the roll-out of new GPs and, second, whether or not there is sufficient remunerative attractiveness to retain GPs in this country.  I do not expect the delegates to divulge where they are in negotiations, but if we are to roll out primary care as the bulwark of health care, then I assume the Sl&aacute;intecare report and all that flows from it is central to those negotiations.  Otherwise, we at risk of developing a strategy that cannot be underpinned by GPs and the primary care service in general.  Will the delegates elaborate on where we are in terms of the recommendations in the Sl&aacute;intecare report and how those recommendations are being mirrored in the discussions on the GP contract and its implementation?  Of course, what is at issue here is not just the contract but the broader picture that encompasses practice nurses, nurse specialists and secondary therapeutic care in a community setting.<\/p> <p>  I am making an observation rather than a criticism in pointing out that the IMO is primarily concerned with representing its members.  The Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, meanwhile, have a view on what should and can be made available in terms of resources.  It seems to me there is a critical component missing from the engagement between the parties.  Does the Irish College of General Practitioners have an oversight view on the contract negotiations?<\/p><p>I assume the patient and clinical outcomes are critically important.  I am not saying the IMO or the Department will not take them into account but, at the same time, we need some independent clinical oversight in terms of outcomes for patients and what people believe is the best for patients as opposed to the best for doctors or the Department of Health.  I ask the witnesses to expand on this a little.<\/p><p> Reference has been made to the increased number of GPs in training programmes.  I know the views of the IMO and others on salaried GPs, but does anybody see a role for salaried GPs, particularly in view of the fact we have huge challenges in socio-economically deprived urban areas and rural peripheral areas where it seems to be impossible to attract GPs?  Even if we unwound all of the FEMPI cuts imposed on GPs in recent years, would that be sufficient to bring doctors into the areas where it is most difficult to recruit?<\/p><p> We speak about dispensing GPs.  Is that role being diminished or undermined?  Is there a need for greater emphasis on dispensing GPs?  I ask the witnesses to elaborate.<\/p><p> With regard to practice nurses and nurse specialists, we speak about chronic care, chronic disease, enhancing capacity and moving patients from our hospital-centric system and out into the community setting.  Realistically, do we have the expertise in terms of GPs and nurse specialists?  How much of an increase in personnel would we need to allow for movement from the hospital system to a primary care setting in a structured phased manner?  Have the witnesses done work on this?  The risk is if we invest and front load primary care and it does not work, we will have a system whereby we have heavily-funded primary care but it does not deliver the savings required.  This is a risk for policy makers.  I know there is international evidence on this, but it has to be done in a way that works.  This is why, in the context of the negotiations, there has to be some independent assessment of what is being negotiated in terms of patient outcomes and outcomes for the health services in general.<\/p><p> We looked at diagnostics in the Sl&aacute;intecare report, and observations were made by the IMO and the National Association of General Practitioners and others in terms of access to diagnostics.  Will the witnesses elaborate as to what they envisage in this regard?  Is it the case there would be diagnostic centres or would they be attached to hospitals?  Would it still be referrals through consultants?  How exactly do the witnesses see this working in terms of diagnostics?  Do they think there should be some form of diagnostic centres separate from the hospital system so people could be referred directly for diagnostics, as opposed to diagnostics been dependent on the emergency departments of hospitals?  I ask the witnesses to elaborate on this.<\/p><p> With regard to prescribing, we seem to have high dependency on antibiotics and benzodiazepines.  Are we out of kilter with other European countries on prescribing?  Are there reasons for this?  Is it the health of the population or the demographics?  Is it our prescribing habits?  There is a lot of evidence now with regard to reducing antibiotics.  There are campaigns and some GPs are very involved in it.  We seem to prescribe benzodiazepines and other medications more than other European countries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017112900002#G00300","speaker":"1229","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511946000,"counter":818,"content":"<p>I will turn to the Irish Medical Organisation first to address some of those questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017112900002#H00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1511946000,"counter":819,"content":"<p>With regard to Deputy O'Reilly's question on IT, general practice has been to the forefront of developing IT independently for years, and we are way ahead of our secondary care colleagues.  Most general practices are now computerised.  There is no interaction, or very little interaction, between secondary care and primary care from an IT perspective other than IT referrals.  It is improving and certainly Richard Corbridge had a vision that it would improve.  Unfortunately, to date, we have not seen a huge appetite for it to happen.  It needs to happen because it is front and centre to all of the other issues on chronic disease management and referrals.  GPs have been to the fore in investing their own funds in this.  Uniquely in the health service it falls on them, and certainly it is an issue which is very much to the forefront in the initial discussions and consultations on the GP contract.  This has been acknowledged by the Department of Health and the HSE.  It is very much an issue that will need to be addressed, or else it just cannot go forward.<\/p> <p>  With regard to primary care teams, Dr. O'Shea mentioned we are very much IT based.  Primary care teams can be all paper-based, and people felt the meetings taking place between allied professionals were not working out terribly well.  They were not structured terribly well and there was very little outcome from them.  This can be developed and needs protected time.  In a lot of cases, the meetings could be done through Zoom or Skype.  IT can help in this.<\/p> <p>  With regard to allied professionals, I work in a primary care team and quite often the allied professions to which we would like to refer patients just do not exist.  If somebody goes away on sick leave or maternity leave there is no replacement and a physiotherapist, dietician or podiatrist just does not happen to be there.  The whole system breaks down.  We start developing what we have never wanted to do in general practice, which is waiting lists.  If we are going to create primary care teams we have to protect whole-time equivalents to make sure that if people do go away on whatever leave they have that there is a back-up and fallback position.  At present this does not exist.<\/p> <p>  A question was asked on the corporatisation of general practice.  There has been a move in this regard and I can understand it.  Many GPs in their mid-50s and coming into their 60s have invested heavily in their practices over the past ten or 15 years with the hope and expectation it would be funded appropriately.  Many GPs have found themselves in dire financial straits and certain corporate entities have provided them with an exit strategy which otherwise just is not there.  If general practice was properly funded the traditional follow-on, if it was financially viable, would be likely to happen.  Unfortunately, trainee GPs and younger GPs do not see this happening so there has not been a natural progression from trainee GPs to younger GPs to principalships because of the uncertainty that exists.  Corporates have come in and offered exit strategies to GPs in that situation.  There is a danger in this.  There is anecdotal evidence that initially when GPs go into corporate practices it looks fine, but they lose their autonomy.<\/p><p>Many GPs who have gone into corporate practices after a while find that this is not what they bought into.  I suppose it is the individual care that GPs give all the time that attracts them to the job.<\/p><p> Corporates will respond to financial imperatives.  There was an example from Scotland where a corporate group bought up 25% of the practices in an area and it went broke.  The government or whoever was left to pick up the pieces.  It is a huge risk.  If one ensures the financial viability of 2,500, 3,500, 4,000 or however many GPs are there, one is much less likely to run the risk of the whole system imploding.  Some, for whatever reasons, perhaps making wrong decisions, may not necessarily survive but, by and large, if one allows appropriately funded practices to flourish, they will remain in place.  By opting for the corporatisation, one runs the risk that the corporates may move on.<\/p><p> The other issue in relation to that is, from a clinical point of view, there is a loss of that continuity of care which is so important to the patient.  It has been well documented that having one's own GP on an ongoing basis leads to much better outcomes in the long run.  There is a huge risk that, if corporatisation comes in, that will be lost and the cost to society in general can be exponential.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017112900002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. P&aacute;draig McGarry","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1511946000,"counter":821,"content":"<p>There is a recent study done by Imperial College in the UK.  The good thing about having our neighbour, the UK, is it has thrown so much money at issues.  They have shown the evidence base there and what has worked and what has not.  A recent study looking at what patients thought was best, found that individual GP principal-led group practice provided more satisfaction, more continuity and fewer referrals.  One must bear in mind that the cost of the health care system is in the hospitals and if one has somebody making a decision that refers everything to the hospital, it is ultimately the State that pays for it.  The evidence is that corporate does not work.<\/p> <p>  Corporate works at scale.  The evidence is that practices of approximately three GPs know their patients and there is continuity of care and as a result, one maintains best practise.  Patients want to know their GPs.  In many corporates, they do not know their GPs.  The evidence base is there to show that it is not effective health care.  The biggest example is America.  American health care is not something one wants to replicate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017112900002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ray Walley"},{"type":"speech","time":1511946000,"counter":822,"content":"<p>Is it Dr. Walley's opinion that it would lead to more additional testing on the basis that if a person's GP knows the patient, he or she will know the family history?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017112900002#J00300","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1511946000,"counter":823,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017112900002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ray Walley"},{"type":"speech","time":1511946000,"counter":824,"content":"<p>Clearly, none of us favours a move towards the corporate but the danger is that one drifts into that without necessarily having the conversation.

There were 19 in total.  I will be very quick.<\/p> <p>  To contextualise it, take a 70 year old woman who has five medical conditions: obstructive pulmonary disease, arthritis, diabetes and high blood pressure.  She would be on 19 medications at five different times in the day.  She would be on 15 non-pharmacological medications.  There are 16 interactions between her conditions and her drugs.  That is the typical model of managing her care in a secondary hospital.  Sure, we can manage single diseases in the 40s, 50s up to 70s, but what we can also do is integrate all that knowledge together.  When one talks about prescribing, over 20% of over 65s are now on ten or more medicines.  We have had an ever increasing rise in prescribing but what we have actually seen is a reduction in potentially inappropriate prescribing - that is from a large paper published in Ireland last year the reference for which I can give to the committee.  GPs are doing a better job of managing all these complex pharmacological interactions.  We can probably do a better job if the members give us the resources for chronic disease management and to be able to manage medicines.<\/p> <p>  Benzodiazepine is an issue.  On quality prescribing, we will always stand over quality and standards.  There is a big issue with legacy prescribing.  It is hard to know what to do with someone who has been on a benzodiazepine for 30 years.  It is a difficult issue.  Certainly, going forward, that is not an issue anymore.  We are doing a very good job.  We would be benchmarked against our peers.<\/p> <p>  On the e-health issue, most of the issues we need to deal with relate to communication.  That is what a telephone call can do.  One does not need novel communications to do that.  We can just pick up a phone.  It is a pity that has been lost in some rural community hospitals.  However, we do need data to have formal and structured and unstructured communication, and the HSE has enabled that.  On the secondary care side, there is still no consultant with an email address.  We have one.<\/p> <p>  We collect so much data.  We need to use that data in research to underpin the quality of care.  It is a shame that is not happening.  We want that to happen.  We need our electronic health record to communicate with secondary care - those are called summary care records.  That needs to happen and we want it to happen.<\/p> <p>  There will not be a big role for IT to help with diagnostics.  In terms of diagnostics, we are really talking about laboratory tests on both bloods and urine, we are talking about radiology including X-rays, ultrasounds, CTs and MRIs, we are talking about cardiac investigations and we are talking about gastrointestinal endoscopy investigations.  In general, laboratory tests are okay.  Some services have a courier a couple of times a week.  It needs to be better and we can do near testing.<\/p> <p>  However, the real shame comes into more complex radiography.  We do not have access to CTs and MRIs.  Those patients end up in outpatient and emergency departments.  They get sicker and it is an absolute disgrace.  Much good work is being done in terms of endoscopy.  Wherever it happens, we just need patients to get those tests.  We are flexible with that.<\/p> <p>  On an issue to do with the salary of GPs, I am not sure that the thesis is correct that there are areas in the south inner city and north inner city that are crying out for GPs because we need a salaried doctor model.  I have looked into this.  I am a 37 year old GP.  I would like to set up.  The business model is not there.  That is because of ten years.  If one fixes the problem which is that the risks are too great and the rewards are too little and if one fixes the business model and comes up with an innovative start-up package in urban areas, that will fix retention in the inner city area.  In rural practice, it is different.  One needs other types of supports to cater for those and that is a particular issue.  There may well be a need for salaried doctors, but my gut instinct and the instinct of our members is that if one fixes the independent contractor model the rest will follow.  There is an issue with premises and set-up costs but that can come on.<\/p> <p>  The last point I will touch upon is the primary care team.  To contextualise it, why do we need to talk to our excellent colleagues.  We are talking about the community pharmacists.  I talk to them over the phone.  When I make an error on a script, they will ring me and we talk, and I will sort it out.  That is the communication.  We do not need any more communication with them.  It is already excellent.  With the physio and the public health nurse, we do not need to be in the same building.  We are talking about complex, perhaps deprived and very difficult social issues or very elderly patients with a lot of complex needs.<\/p><p>We just need to meet once every month.  It is not something for which we need to be in the same building.  Too much emphasis is placed on geographical co-location.  We just need to be able to pick up the phone, know people and have a little bit of time.  We can then sort out all that stuff.  We do not have to be under the same roof to do that.  Although it would help, it is not the big issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017112900002#J00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mark Murphy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1511946000,"counter":829,"content":"<p>In terms of the college's response to the Sl&aacute;intecare report, it is broadly supportive of Sl&aacute;intecare in general and a more recent report, A Future Together - Building a Better GP and Primary Care Service, from the HSE.  We have good reports and policy.  It is a question of implementing them and moving forward.<\/p> <p>  Touching on some additional questions, Deputy Murphy referred to the difficulties of the people of west Cork.  On unfilled positions in rural practice, salaried positions may be part of the answer.  The overwhelming consensus among most GPs is to fix the independent contractor model.  With respect to west Cork, there could be deprivation weightings or geographical incentives.  One of the problems is that there are several different ways to fix this, but anything would be better than the paralysis of the past 39 years.<\/p> <p>  We were asked about closer working relationships with other health care professionals.  The ICGP has conducted its own research on primary care teams.  It is a lovely idea, but it is not working.  Some 70% of ICGP members are positively disposed towards the idea of primary care teams, but only 13% indicated a positive experience for all of the reasons we have elaborated on.<\/p> <p>  I would like to discuss a contentious issue which relates to our experience as GPs with primary care physiotherapy and private physiotherapy.  The primary care physiotherapist works on a paper-based referral system and there is a wait time of anywhere from two to 12 weeks.  Patients come back reporting on it.  Private physiotherapy is available with a mobile phone number, email address and telephone which is answered, and a patient will be seen on the same day.  Patients report more positively on that.  It highlights, in microcosm, some of the important differences between a State service which is managed in the way it is and some of the benefits of the independent contractor model.  Private physiotherapists operate in the private sector.<\/p> <p>  We share the concerns expressed about corporatised general practice.  It seems attractive in certain respects.  They have nicer buildings and a bigger business imperative, but there is an evidence base around continuity of care.  It must be what people want and, most important, continuity saves money for all of the reasons on which we have elaborated.<\/p> <p>  In respect of continuity of care, a problem for us in general practice under the current system is our interaction with secondary care.  The secondary care system is paper-based.  There are 7,000 junior hospital doctors, some of whom are managed and trained excellently well, but the system relies on them.  They, too, repeat tests, bring people back to outpatients departments and feed into bigger waiting lists.  That partly contributes to the difficulties we are experiencing in terms of accessing tests for our patients directly.  A junior hospital doctor, who may or may not be supervised, has better access to important diagnostic tests than GPs.<\/p> <p>  With respect to the preamble to Deputy Kelleher's question, he very properly said that if we fixed the training issue and remuneration issue, things would work well.  There is a third dimension to that which is particularly important to our junior colleagues.  Our doctors coming off our training schemes, who are whipped up everywhere else and are top-quality graduates, will not work in a system where if one patient comes to me as a private patient and another as a public patient, I will worry for weeks about whether the public patient will get a colonoscopy or endoscopy.  They will not make seven phone calls to a hospital to chase up results.  They are leaving for the NHS, Scotland, Canada and Australia where all of these things work smoothly.<\/p> <p>  A big chasm between general practice and touching on one of Deputy O'Reilly's issues relates to information technology.  We cannot emphasise the importance of this enough.  Whatever we collectively decide here will not be perfect, but will almost certainly be an improvement.  The quickest way to know whether something is working is information technology which is real time and data driven.  Everything we in general practice and our nurses and administrators do is incredibly transparent because of electronic data.  One falls off a cliff when one goes to the rest of the primary care team.  The hospitals are a morass.<\/p> <p>  Members made several comments regarding the shift of care to general practice.  There is an assumption that what is going on in hospitals is adequate chronic disease management, but it is not.  We need to build capacity in evidence-based primary care which is data driven and involves integrated teamwork.  The college is happy to revisit primary care teams in a meaningful way with our colleagues, the GP representative organisations and the HSE.  We cannot support what is going on at the moment.  Likewise, we are happy to revisit primary care centres, but for many of us they simply do not work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017112900002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Brendan O'Shea"},{"type":"speech","time":1511946000,"counter":830,"content":"<p>I do not want to interrupt you, but we have a number of other groups coming in .

The rates referred to in the report were based on data which arose from the Trinity College evaluation.  That has been questioned because it was based on patient recall over a year as opposed to actual visitation rates.  Healthy Ireland has done similar work and its visitation rates are much more aligned to actual visits rather than rates.  This issue was raised at the rural practice conference, and an undertaking was given to look at it.  Visitation rates are, on average, about 7.7 visits per annum for general practice, whereas the Sl&aacute;intecare report referred to 40%, which is somewhat less.  That indicates that there is a significant mismatch between actuality and what is going to happen.  That is based on current practice.<\/p> <p>  On top of that, when GP cards for those aged under six years of age were introduced, we projected that the visitation rate would increase, and it has increased by 67.5%.  That was not expected by the HSE.  If the threshold for a visitation is lowered, visits will rise.  It is proposed to include an extra 500,000 patients per annum over the next five years.  That will cripple the capacity and the ability of general practice to develop it unless there are accurate data as to what the proposal will affect.  We need to have clear data on what the actuality will be.<\/p> <p>  What is probably central to the contract is the need to provide chronic disease management in general practice where it is most appropriate to do so.  That will bring about a significant increase in visitation rights.  We need to be clear about what we are dealing with from the outset, rather than creating something only to find it cannot be implemented and waiting times are higher than ever before.  The cost element has been taken away but people are not allowed to have the necessary time.  We should work very closely to make sure that we are working along the same lines rather than working and growing apart.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017112900002#K00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. P&aacute;draig McGarry"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1511946000,"counter":833,"content":"<p>The health care system that wins all the awards is the Dutch system.  When they developed GP and community care, they took 30 years to do it.  The funding of community care in Holland is 10% of the budget and the funding of general practice is also of the order of 10% of the budget.  They did not do it over five years.  Five years is incredibly ambitious in a system whereby the secondary care system is in paralysis.  We are all about ambition but we want reality because ultimately general practice is left with the difficulties.  Let us look at the figures.  Many GPs face impending retirement and there is an ageing workforce.  The average age of a general practitioner is of the order of 43 to 44 years of age.  We have a workload problem.  We need to prioritise things.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Louise O'Reilly inquired about industrial action.  Industrial action is already happening.  The ultimate industrial action is emigration.  Younger GPs are not waiting to see what will happen because we have been listening to this for 12 or 13 years.  Unless general practice and community care are funded now, it will cost even more money, but we have to get away from the peaks and troughs.  We have had troughs of many billions taken out.  Now we are at a peak.  We are spending what we should spend but we are not necessarily replacing the money to ensure that we are dealing with the troughs for many years.<\/p> <p>  Getting back to Deputy Kelleher's question, when that happens, if one does not have appropriate funding, one has increased inappropriate prescribing.  For example, the country with the lowest prescribing of antibiotics is Holland.  One could ask why that is.  It is because they have near-testing for C-reactive protein, CRP.  We have looked for that.  They have excellent daily, repeated access to blood tests.  A person does not need to have it done in the surgery but he or she needs to access it somewhere.  In the same way, it does not matter whether the X-ray is done in a hospital, in a surgery or a community care centre.  As long as the machines are active all the time and being utilised in order that there are economies of scale, it does not matter where their location is.  There is a higher incidence of antibiotic prescribing in some countries where there is not access to those tests.  Ireland is at the lower level of antibiotic prescribing in the OECD but we need to improve on that.  Last night I did a co-op shift.  Three patients came in to me saying the only reason they were there was for an antibiotic.  They were not interested in my opinion or an examination and none of the three satisfied the criteria for giving an antibiotic.  As a result, I could not prescribe it.  General practice and community care have to be funded to ensure we have effective health care going forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017112900002#L00100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ray Walley"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1511946000,"counter":834,"content":"<p>I want to reiterate that a new contract has to be brought in on a phased basis, as the capacity allows within the system.

Looking at what has happened in general practice over the past ten years, it is exactly the opposite.  The financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, cuts have led to a reduction of 38% in funding per patient.

I am quite concerned about the time it is taking to complete the contract negotiations.  From my experience and previously when the Department was dealing with contract negotiations in other areas of health care, they took a number of years.  If the witnesses wanted to fast-track a particular aspect of the contract negotiations which could be implemented, what would they identify?  The witnesses said it would have to be worked on gradually.  Could an agreement be reached at this stage with an element of the contract that could be implemented immediately that would assist GPs with further development?<\/p> <p>  Last night I downloaded the contract produced in Scotland.  It is called the 2008 general medical services contract.  I understand the expectation is that there will be a shortage of 1,000 GPs in Scotland unless they get their act together there.  Have the witnesses looked at the proposal and are there any aspects of it that we could adopt here to fast-track a better contract for GPs here?  One of the issues raised in this document is that GPs should have a minimum income of &pound;80,450 sterling.  Have we looked at that and can we use part of the contract?  We will be competing with Scotland if it has a more attractive contract than the Irish one.  We are competing on a world market for GPs.  Therefore, we must be conscious of what others are offering.<\/p> <p>  The third issue I wish to raise relates to the system in England.  I was in Plymouth recently looking at medical services there.  We were in one practice where the big boast was the fact that they had reduced the waiting times to see patients from 15 days to eight days.  We found another practice where all the GPs had handed back their contracts and walked out the door and left a practice of 20,000 patients.  I hope that will never happen here in Ireland.  What do we need to do to make sure that we fast-track elements of the contract negotiations to put them in place?  Otherwise, we are going to face the same problem with shortages.  We already have a shortage of staff in certain areas.<\/p> <p>  My understanding is that in Cork and Kerry they have introduced electronic communication for maternity services.  I believe there was a problem with that in relation to communication with GPs.  Have the teething problems with electronic communication in maternity services been resolved in order that the system can be fast-tracked around the country?  Are GPs able to work with the HSE on this issue to fast-track the system for the entire country?  It is important that work proceeds in that regard.<\/p> <p>  I sent a question to the Minister yesterday on electronic communications with patients.  A number of companies are offering to set up electronic communications systems for medical practitioners.  Such a system will have to be incorporated at this stage rather than looking at it in ten or 15 years.  We are already behind a country such as Denmark where electronic communication has been used very effectively.  How can we fast-track the system as part of the contract negotiations?  The most important question is what element of the contract we could sign off on in the morning without having to wait for the entire process to be progressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017112900002#L00400","speaker":"1409"},{"type":"speech","time":1511946000,"counter":837,"content":"<p>My apologies, as I was absent for a few minutes.  Needs must.  I welcome the witnesses.  I do not wish to go over the previous questions in too much detail but I am a great believer in having local knowledge on each subject on the basis that it represents a microcosm of the total picture.  From the point of view of both organisations, what do they see as the main points in terms of challenging their ability to deliver what is required in the provision of primary care in both urban and rural settings?<\/p> <p>  Reference has already been made to the GP contract.  I am aware the witnesses have some reservations, but not as many as I have, about primary care centres.  How valuable are they in the system, taking into account the considerable capital investment involved?  They are supposed to cater for a population of approximately 50,000.  Some of them appear to me to be like small hospitals.  Are they effectively intercepting the patient before he or she has to queue up at an accident and emergency department or he or she becomes a day patient?<\/p> <p>  People become ill on a 24-7 basis and on continuity and the pooling of cover, in particular out of hours and at weekends, have we yet achieved the ultimate in terms of providing the required cover for patients or do they have to go to accident and emergency departments, with obvious consequences?<\/p><p> A number of GP practices have received a lot of attention, particularly throughout rural Ireland, over recent years.  To what extent has the negative comment impacted on the attractiveness of the practice to newly qualified doctors, and nurses for that matter?  Do the witnesses see a particular way of dealing with the requirements of rural Ireland, which are distinct and different from those of the rest of the country, without necessarily going overboard spending hard-won money that we do not have?  Good organisation is the key to any business, be it in the public or private sector.  Good organisations means how the job can be done best and most efficiently in terms of the turnover of patients in the respective practice areas.  What are the issues that curtail GPs' ability to deal with those quickly, effectively and in a way that lends itself to enhancing the role of the GP, because everything is critical nowadays?  Everything that everyone in the public sector does is criticised.  Sometimes this is legitimate but there is a tendency in the goldfish bowl to be overly conclusive regarding the issues.<\/p><p> From a delivery perspective, what are the witnesses' experiences as deliverers of service to the community?  What are their experiences in terms of how they see it, apart from the GP contract and other things that need to be dealt with?  What do the witnesses see as coming from the patients?  What is the most common criticism they get from patients?  I know that in our businesses, our patients do not take long in telling us what we should be doing at various times and how we could do better.  This is a good thing.  That is fine.  To what extent do the witnesses get that flow of information from the base in which they work, and how do they respond?<\/p><p> Based on their own experiences in dealing with an individual patient at any time, be it an acute condition or a long-term illness, how do the witnesses see their practices affected by the place to which they refer their patient in the event of the need for referral?  For example, can they be sure of the outcome when they refer a patient to a consultant or hospital accident and emergency department?  What is the outcome?  Is it quick enough?  Is it effective?  Do they see that patient again?  This is the kind of thing we need to know about.  I am saying this with tongue in cheek because we get the same queries ourselves.  We do not deal with them medically but we try to deal with them in the best way we can.  It does not always work either.  The point I want to emphasise is that unless we can find a streamlined system that provides in an uninterrupted way a stream of services to the various types of patients who present themselves, we are wasting our time and money.  If we cannot do that, we are wasting our money and will not solve it by providing more money.  We will just complicate it further.  In particular, we can start at the bottom, provide primary care to the best standard we can and then find out the challenges after that, where we are going, where there is congestion and what happens when a GP refers a patient.<\/p><p> All of us in this business know about my last point.  There are many patients on waiting lists for various treatments, including elective procedures, or to see consultants.  We go through the procedure ourselves.  There is a presumption in some parts that, effectively, we are trying to help a patient jump the list.  I have never wanted any patient to be able to jump the list but I want a patient who is ahead of another patient to get ahead in order that the second patient can be dealt and we have continuity of effective action and service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017112900002#L00500","speaker":"1322","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511946000,"counter":839,"content":"<p>I will bring in representatives of the Irish College of General Practitioners to look at some of those questions and then contextualise it in respect of the Sl&aacute;intecare report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017112900002#M00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1511946000,"counter":840,"content":"<p>The Irish College of General Practitioners supports the Sl&aacute;intecare report.

Obviously, the only show in town is to support the generalist to manage chronic conditions in communities with GP-led primary care, and we support Sl&aacute;intecare's initiative.<\/p> <p>  There is one issue and that is capacity.  It has to be done slowly in a phased way in order that capacity is not over-reached, so to speak.  We want to tackle health care inequalities.  The main danger would be if this was done too quickly.  If we give free GP care to everyone, very soon we will end with a two-tier general practice system where someone working in the newly built primary care centre in Crumlin will be seeing medical card patients with a two-week waiting list while a fee-paying practice next door will see patients that day.  I do not want that to happen and we need to make sure it does not happen, so it needs to be phased.  We fully support Sl&aacute;intecare and its goals of achieving a better health care system for all in a sustainable way.<\/p> <p>  In response to Senator Burke, the ehealth project in Cork exemplifies the core issue about ehealth.  The GP gets the discharge immediately from the maternity hospital so there is no squiggle on a script that I cannot read.  I get the discharge that day, not three weeks later.  It makes sense.  To our knowledge, the results are still coming in.  There were some hiccups with the piloting and involving GPs, but this is exactly the kind of stuff we need and that Richard Corbridge drove through.  It looks very promising.<\/p> <p>  In respect of econsultation, I must say very clearly that there is an issue with demand and supply in health care.  If one keeps increasing supply of the wrong type of health care, it will just keep getting consumed.  I am afraid there is no evidence for electronic communication being more effective than face-to-face communication.  I can consult someone face to face or pick up a phone to communicate a result.  I can send the patient a text message or email them or we can use a nice fancy tablet to look at each face to face.  I am afraid a lot of econsultation is a corporate marketing strategy that overmedicalises things and will deliver care in the wrong way.  It has to be done within the context of the GP team to follow up results and it must be evidence-based.  There is a lot of this going around at the moment and it is a misappropriation of the term \"GP\".  Insurance providers providing GP care through tablets is not GP care and we will not stand over that.<\/p> <p>  A point was made about negativity with regard to recruitment and rural practices.  It is a double-edged sword.  We have done our bit.  We have engaged and tried to communicate what an important job it is and the joy it can bring even though it is very challenging.  We have a campaign called #beagp.  We have tried to put across that spin of the professional rewards that can follow.  We have done our bit and are trying recruit and train more GPs, but we really need that other piece to follow.  We need the funding and the whole system thinking and we commend Sl&aacute;intecare to do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017112900002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mark Murphy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1511946000,"counter":841,"content":"<p>Senator Burke asked how we could fast-track the contract negotiations.

It would be nice for us to do more multidisciplinary work.  We need more bodies if we are to be able to do all of those things.  We can do none of them without more bodies.<\/p> <p>  Electronic communication with patients is a new technology.  We are optimistic that there will be an evidence base to prove its efficacy in due course.  At the moment, the most likely thing that an electronic consultation will do is furnish an anonymous patient with a doctor who does not know him or her and with a prescription for an antibiotic.  That is corporate cherry-picking.  The ICGP is committed to researching this.  Our view at this point is that telemedicine between specialists, advanced nurse practitioners, GPs and practice nurses could add a layer of efficiency if it is properly resourced.  There needs to be a GP in front of the screen.  At the moment, GPs are running everywhere.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Durkan asked a fiendishly cunning question about the negative things that our patients are most likely to say to us.  My patients most commonly greet me by telling me it is very hard to get to see me.  The next difficulty that is most commonly mentioned is cost.  There is ongoing hardship and difficulty, not among the affluent crowd or, arguably, among medical card patients, who enjoy a range of benefits and services, but among the middle people who are squeezed.  They do not attend for regular checks.  They go off their medications for cost reasons.  They agonise.  They have rows at reception about the fees we have to charge.  As employers, we have obligations to our staff.  The negative things we most frequently hear about are time pressures and the out-of-pocket costs that people have to meet.  That would be my view in response to the Deputy's excellent question.<\/p> <p>  On the subject of information technology, reference was made to the national maternity and child electronic medical records scheme in Cork.  We have worked closely with the HSE through the national general practice information technology group, which is a good interface between the ICGP and the Department of Health.  We are confident that electronic medical records can be rolled out if this group is maintained and resourced.  We need to decide to do it.  In this day and age, it is too expensive to deliver health care without such technology in place.  More of it is needed in primary care and a start needs to be made with it in secondary care.  The national maternity and child scheme is a tiny piece of hospital care.  We can have no reassurance that there is huge progress to be made in this regard without strong driving from the clinical and legislative sides.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017112900002#N00100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Brendan O'Shea"},{"type":"speech","time":1511946000,"counter":844,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. O'Shea.

For the past 20 years, 8% of the budget there has gone to general practice and 10% has gone to community care.  It has had chronic care programmes and infrastructure supports in place.  The problem is that Scotland is coming from a different position.  It has a modern-day contract.  The Scottish system is outside the UK system.  This self-management allowed the Scottish authorities to discontinue tasks like quality and outcomes frameworks, QOFs, which were box-ticking exercises that diminished patient care by focusing on spreadsheets.  They changed things.  Scotland is a good example, but I am afraid we are not up there.  I emphasise that it took 30 years to develop GP community care in the Netherlands and in Scotland.  We are in the early throes of that.  We need to move on.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Durkan asked about our priorities.  This country has a GP recruitment and retention problem and a resourcing problem.  Funding is a big issue, given that just 3.5% of the national budget goes into general practice.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy also asked about primary care centres.  Primary care centres do not see patients.  Individuals see patients.  We need to focus on GPs and allied health care personnel.  They will work virtually anywhere.  Shiny new buildings should not be developed unless they are needed.  The need for some of them is questionable.  New buildings need to be constructed in areas of deprivation and some rural areas, but they should not replace existing buildings if those buildings are adequate.<\/p> <p>  I will answer the Deputy's question about what we want from the best health care system by saying it was set out in the primary care strategy 14 years ago.  We want continuity of care, timely access, accountability, equity of care, efficiency and quality.  All of this occurs in general practice, but we can do better.  All of this is not occurring in the hospital system, to some extent, because one cannot get into it.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy also asked about telemedicine, which is being looked at.  We all agree on this without even talking about it.  Telemedicine involves cherry-picking.  In recent weeks, a Cambridge University study showed that telemedicine increases consultation rates because patients' problems are inadequately dealt with.  There are examples of good practice in this area.  In Norway, a patient can email his or her GP on a public contract in the knowledge that the GP will get back to him or her within five days.  That works because it takes the emergency out of it.  One cannot deal with an emergency issue on a telephone only.  GPs need to have the ability to ask their patients to come to them, or to go to see those patients.  That is not what happens under these cherry-picking private set-ups.  My colleague, Dr. McGarry, will speak about the contract issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017112900002#N00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ray Walley"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1511946000,"counter":846,"content":"<p>Senator Colm Burke asked whether any element of the contract could be implemented in the morning.  We have gone a long way towards addressing many of the components that require the first phase of a contract.  The chronic disease programme, which involves chronic disease management by GPs in the community, is probably central to that.  Every time we try to address one issue, another issue comes up and suddenly a whole raft of issues have to run in parallel.  The ability to recruit practice nurses has to be developed.  That, in itself, raises employment and contract issues that need to be addressed if we are to attract practice nurses into the service.  The capacity to have more GPs in the service has to be developed.  That brings resource implications with it.<\/p> <p>  There are other issues in the first phase with palliative care, medical management and special types of services that could be implemented.  We have not yet really seen a recognition of the resources that are required for that.  All of these things can be done if the resources are acquired.  Unfortunately, the budget provides that just &euro;25 million will be made available for primary care in 2018.  If those who are negotiating feel there is no genuine interest in going forward, it knocks the heart out of them.  Realistic resources need to be made available.

I have 47 seconds left in which to speak so I will say this - we need a contract that will actually ensure the recruitment and retention of adequate numbers of general practitioners and practice nurses.  I would like to focus, in my final 30 seconds of speaking time, on practice nurses.  The position of the practice nurse in the Irish primary care system is a major cause of concern.  These nurses are paid a significantly lower rate than their hospital colleagues.  They get no maternity or educational leave, no support and no pensions.  That is Victorian.  We understand that there are approximately 3,700 GPs and 1,700 practice nurses.  We need to move rapidly towards having 5,000 GPs and 5,000 practice nurses.  This brings us to an important metric - the number of GPs per 100,000 of population.  In County Kildare, there are 41 GPs per 100,000 people.  On average, there are 63 GPs per 100,000 people throughout the State.  In Scotland, the figure is close to 90 per 100,000.  We need a contract that would be sufficiently attractive.  I put it to the members that practice nurses are very enfranchised - they have high levels of job satisfaction and their involvement is greatly appreciated.

I am joined by Dr. Ronan Fawsitt, a Kilkenny-based GP, and Dr. Mary Flynn, who is based in Wicklow, who are members of our executive.  I am also joined by Dr. Maiti&uacute; &Oacute; Tuathail who represents GP trainees within our organisation.  Those trainees are effectively the future of our profession.<br\/><br\/>Some time has passed since we last met in February.  At that point, we were addressing capacity and manpower in general practice.  We had a very valuable interaction with the committee in conjunction with the Irish College of General Practitioners, ICGP, and our sister union, the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO.  I wish to acknowledge the committee's work at that time to support the introduction of a new GP contract through its request to the Minister of Health, Deputy Harris, to have parity of process in contract negotiations for all the representative bodies.  There is great synergy to be had in all three organisations working together.  It is the stated position of the NAGP to be inclusive of all bodies in this process.<br\/><br\/>Based on our earlier presentation and the supporting documents we have submitted, particularly the document submitted from the perspective of GP trainees, the committee is pretty well informed now of what the issues in general practice are and what we continue to face.  We need to retain young graduates and restore functionality.  It has become very clear to the committee that functionality needs to be restored in general practice.  We clearly need a solid foundation if we are going to make any transitions in health reform.  This view was confirmed by the HSE-commissioned report, A Future Together, compiled by Trinity College Dublin.  In that report, Professor Tom O'Dowd says: <\/p><blockquote>Providing long-term illness care, improved diagnostic services, increased practice based staff and modern IT requires additional funding.  Primary care and general practice, as now structured, will be unable to cope with additional workload.  Transitional funding spread over a number of years is needed ...<\/blockquote> <p>That is becoming more and more clear as we have these discussions.  Today we really want to focus on what the key enablers for primary care are and also to reflect on the Sl&aacute;intecare report itself.  The NAGP&rsquo;s position at the time of the launch of Sl&aacute;intecare was to support the core principles within the report.  We continue to hold that position.  We can all agree the report is certainly visionary and outlines a paradigm shift in how we deliver health care in this country.  However, until such time as general practice is adequately resourced and has a totally new contract, this will unfortunately remain only a report.  General practice, through the contract, underpins an effective primary care service.<br\/><br\/>The recent report to which I refer places the general practice service as one of the key enablers in the move to a primary care model.  This report and other bodies use the term &ldquo;GP-led primary care&rdquo;, a term which has been one of our core principles over a number of years and which is our message in the conversation on health care reform.  For clarity, the GP-led aspect does not make general practitioners superior to other members of the community team.  It identifies a leadership role in the team with responsibility and accountability for delivering care to the patient.  This is called governance.<br\/><br\/>There are many existing team-based models of care in the world that demonstrate GP-led primary care, leading to better health outcomes for populations and greater return on health care spend.  Examples are the patient-centred home care model seen in the United States, the New Zealand primary care health system, or the rapidly emerging primary care home model in the UK.  The NAGP recently led a delegation to Plymouth to study the principles of such a model.  These models are not directly transferable to Ireland but the core principles certainly are.<br\/><br\/>Data are driving change across the world in health care delivery.  Ireland has recently made good progress through Health Atlas Ireland, which can now map local population demographics and health needs.  This is very important for population health planning.  Similarly, the national quality assurance and improvement system is leading change in the hospitals.  It drives investment and service delivery for local populations, building integration and support through GP-led primary care.<br\/><br\/>This is a lot of change.  With change comes fear of change, and with that the potential for misinformation.  We have experienced that ourselves while discussing these models.<\/p><p>The reality is that GP-led, team-based care, involving personalised care for a defined population, is a culture change that comes from grass-roots level and not by diktat.  It is informed by international experience but does not seek to copy it, merely to learn what works and apply this, if appropriate, to the Irish system in an agreed, resourced and beneficial way.<\/p><p> The Sl&aacute;intecare report has recommended an impact study on the effect of separating private practice from public practice at secondary care level.  It is only logical to have the same approach to considering the implementation of free GP care.  The Minister for Health has acknowledged the GP service is put to the pin of its collar and pointed out there are lessons to be learnt from our experience with the introduction of free care to the population under six.  We have already seen from the under-sixes provision the effects of what we call \"service-induced demand\" on a GP system that lacks capacity for the increased activity that free GP care has brought.<\/p><p> The Government-funded and Government-partnered ESRI study Growing Up in Ireland shows there was a 25% increase in daytime activity with free GP care.  That predates the introduction of the under-sixes initiative.  With free care for the under-sixes, we have seen an increase of up to 40% at peak times in our out-of-hours service.  I am from the mid-west, in Limerick.  The Shannondoc out-of-hours service crashed owing to the volume of calls over the winter.  It is interesting to note that.  The knock-on effect has been increased waiting times for all patients and reduced access for the frail elderly in general practice, with increased attendances at emergency departments.  Therefore, there are consequences.<\/p><p> We suggest that we hit pause on introducing further free GP care based on age cohorts and start to make general practice functional again as a foundation for delivering real health care reform.  We suggest that for primary care to expand into population health, as outlined in Sl&aacute;intecare, general practice must first be stabilised and enhanced through positive State actions in the areas I shall mention.  There is a lot of overlap but I will run through the areas again.<\/p><p> We need to reverse FEMPI.  This must be in line with health care workers.  This must not be delayed until 2019 to seek more return because there is already a stretched service.<\/p><p> I touched on the contract.  It has to be totally new, not one with a bolted-on element.  It should not be delivered in incremental phases.  We need a new contract and a new way of delivering health care.  We need to move from a sickness model to a wellness contract.  That is the big difference here.<\/p><p> We have touched on capacity from a trainee's perspective.  Dr. &Oacute; Tuathail will refer to this later.  We need to increase capacity, including through novel ways to utilise practice nurses and other allied health professionals in the community, with the general practitioners driving the change.<\/p><p> With regard to data and ICT, funding is absolutely necessary.  General practice does have fairly good practice-based systems but we need to have connectivity to bring us together.  Diagnostics was well covered.  We can agree on that.  Funding needs to be front-loaded, ring-fenced transitional funding, underpinned by legislation over a ten-year window to support primary care development.  We must spend if we are to save in the long term.  On implementation, general practice should have a role in the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation body.<\/p><p> All these measures require funding and a strategy.  Most of all, and important to those in this room, we need the political commitment to drive the change.  We suggest all this needs to be underpinned by legislation, facilitated in the Oireachtas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017112900002#P00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Emmet Kerin","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1511946000,"counter":865,"content":"<p>Deputy Michael Harty resumed the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1511946000,"counter":866,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Kerin and apologise for missing the first part of his presentation.

When we hear from people involved in health care delivery in particular, we understand they are taking time out from a very busy schedule to come here to inform us.  That is very much appreciated by us.<\/p> <p>  A couple of issues arise.  We have heard already that the management of chronic diseases within the hospital is expensive and cumbersome.  The approach is probably not the best.<\/p> <p>  There is a recruitment and retention crisis.  Activity that may or may not be described as industrial action has been discussed and aired in the media.  It is an expression of the frustration staff feel at the coalface.  When we ask questions about capacity, recruitment, retention and the manner in which these issues might be addressed, we are told continually they will be addressed once the GP contract is sorted.  We are told it will be very long, broad-ranging and detailed and that it will possibly fix every single problem in the health service.  Perhaps the delegation will talk to us about how we can, even in the short term, address the issue of capacity.<\/p> <p>  My next question is on the fee structure.  What is the breakdown regarding the fee, wages and income of a general practitioner?  How is the income divided between the practice nurse and the general practitioner where the two are working together?  We have already heard the conditions of the practice nurses described as Victorian.  They are working under a very outdated model, with no access to maternity leave and all that goes along with that.  I refer to how the work is divided in respect of GMS and private patients and how the income is split.  The delegates might talk to us a little about that.<\/p> <p>  I am interested in hearing the delegates' views on what constitutes a properly fit-for-purpose primary care team.  What management do they envisage?  Who would be the paymaster and who would schedule the appointments?  Who would manage the allied health professionals in that context?  How many do we need per head of population?  How can we move towards a more fit-for-purpose model?<\/p> <p>  On the GP contract and the capacity issues, there is a problem not too far from my area owing to medical card patients being turned away and advised they cannot be seen on a Saturday.  I am pretty sure that is not an appropriate way to treat patients and that the delegates would not stand over it; nevertheless, it happened.  Is that a manifestation of the capacity problems we are having?  In light of capacity problems of that nature, perhaps the delegates have a view on how limited capacity is to be managed.  If the approach of shutting the doors to certain categories of patients at certain times of the week is the view of even one general practitioner, it is not necessarily appropriate.  In Balbriggan, which is in my constituency, there are general practitioners who say they cannot take any more under-sixes.  This all comes back to the same issue, that of capacity.<\/p> <p>  We might hear from the representative of GP trainees as to the mood among that cohort.  I am conscious that sometimes when we talk in this room, we are sending a message to people in college that the health service is not an ideal place to work.  Clearly, we want general practitioners.  They are the brightest and best and they are wanted all over the globe.  We know that.  They are much sought after.  We want to be able to send out a very positive message.  Perhaps the representative could talk to us about how we could do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017112900002#Q00300","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speech","time":1511946000,"counter":868,"content":"<p>I thank the delegates for taking time out of their busy schedules and for the work they are doing for general practitioners throughout the country and for their own patients.<\/p> <p>  On the contract negotiations, there is always a golden rule that if one wants to delay something, particularly if one is the person writing the cheque, one should create a division between the negotiators.<\/p><p>Is there some level of co-operation between the medical organisations that would help remove the excuses from the Department about trying to exclude these negotiations?  I raised a question earlier about identifying an area that we could fast-track and the reply was that this has to be taken in an overall context.  However, we need to prioritise ensuring that we can retain our current practices while also growing them in areas where we need them.  The lack of support for practice nurses within the current contract arises.  Could that issue be fast-tracked to assist the organisations?  They may have identified other areas but that area arose earlier in the discussion.<\/p><p> Another issue concerns access to diagnostic services.  Given that this is not really part of the contract negotiations, although it is in an overall context, has there been any negotiation with the HSE at local level, whether in Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Dublin or elsewhere, about trying to make information relating to diagnostic services available more speedily?

What issue do they consider most important to improve the service they provide to their patients in the community, whether in urban or rural settings?  Apart from what we heard in the opening statement, what are the most immediate changes needed?  We must recognise, however, that we do not have an open cheque book and have to keep an eye on comparisons with other countries in the OECD.  That is a fact of life.  I know that everyone will say, as we say ourselves, that that is okay but we are in a particular situation now from whence we have to extricate ourselves.  However, we must remain within reasonable comparisons.<\/p> <p>  When a patient cannot get access to a service that a GP refers to, what are the causes of the delay?  We have thousands of people on waiting lists.  I am a former member of one of the health boards and I cannot understand why we have lists at all.  That is the first question.  What is the cause of a waiting list?  If a waiting list is six months long, why not have it three months, two months, three weeks or something like that?  Why can we not identify the extent of the problems?  From the witnesses' perspective, what are the contributory factors to the huge amount of stress to patients all over the country?  I have no doubt they cause a huge amount of distress to the witnesses also.  When we table a parliamentary question asking that someone receives a service after waiting for two or three years, and there have been longer periods, we are told to get a letter from the GP if it is urgent.  Everything becomes urgent after a while.  If the patient waits long enough without receiving treatment, the patient will no longer be a patient.  That is the sad part of it.  To what extent have the witnesses found frustration and annoyance at this kind of thing?<\/p> <p>  Apart from Sl&aacute;intecare, we have done our own research.  We also have anecdotal evidence as to what every branch of the health service, including GPs, consultants and junior hospital doctors, sees as a problem.  There are numerous problems.  If the witnesses were to select the three most important items to improve the service to the patients they serve and to get a reasonable degree of reliance, job satisfaction and improvement in the service delivery to the patient, what would they be?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017112900002#R00200","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1511946000,"counter":871,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses and apologise for missing their opening statements.  We should establish a committee to investigate the development of bi-locatory powers.  It might help many members.  <\/p> <p>  A number of problems arise in that we do not have enough capacity, a shortage of GPs and an ageing profile of GPs.  We can see from the fact that GPs are leaving that it is not remuneratively attractive.  Therefore, we all accept that unwinding FEMPI is critically important.  It is an issue that has caused difficulties for GPs throughout the country.  In that context, even with the unwinding of FEMPI, are the witnesses completely wedded to the independent contractor model or do they see any role for salaried GPs in the delivery of health care for the public health system?<\/p> <p>  Consider the difficulties associated with the hospital-centric model, which are evident.  All the resources are piled into the hospital and the patients follow the resources.  This creates its own difficulties in that there is overcrowding and continual difficulties in trying to get patients seamlessly through the hospital system, either through the emergency departments or scheduled processes.  Is there any relationship between GPs, consultants and hospitals?  I know the St. Luke's model in Kilkenny is held up as a good example.  However, why is there no capability within the health system to have more meaningful relationships between hospitals, consultants and GPs?  Sometimes we forget that a GP is a specialist and we end up with specialists referring patients to be seen by a junior doctor who then has to go through the whole process again, although a specialist has already referred them to that point in the health system.  We could be forever talking about the grand plans but there are also the small things that mean patients end up in waiting rooms, with junior doctors then referring them off elsewhere.  Given a specialist, namely a GP, has already made a referral, there seems to be a consistent delay in moving the patient seamlessly through the process.<\/p> <p>  Given that we have an ageing profile of GPs, do we need to amend our training programmes to deal with the whole issue of chronic disease and illnesses in the community or are the training programmes which are in place good enough but lacking capacity in terms of throughput?  On practice nurses and nurse specialists in the delivery of treatment for chronic disease and illnesses in the primary care centre, how do the witnesses see that involving in the years ahead?<\/p> <p>  Without putting a tooth in it, in the context of the ongoing negotiations on the GP contract, the witnesses are outside looking in the window.  I had and have a view that they should be inside.  We are led to believe that there are some forms of informal discussion but I do not know if that continues.  However, I would much prefer them to be inside given their organisations represent more GPs than those who are inside.  Having said that, will the contract only be finalised when everything is finalised?  I assume this contract should be negotiated on a continuing basis.  There is this idea that we would wait for it to be completed and then park it up for another 20 years.<\/p><p>Does the witness see any flexibility in that area for picking out quick wins for GPs and, more important, for patients and for the health services?  Can those issues which are more difficult to resolve be separated out from it so that we can start the process of implementing Sl&aacute;intecare's recommendations, primarily in terms of primary care and treatment of the patient in the community care setting?  <\/p><p> The witness may have seen the \"Prime Time Investigates\" programme, and the famous letters that GPs write which say \"urgent\" or \"clinically urgent\" which are now deemed meaningless by the system.  Where does that leave the witnesses in terms of their clinical competence being questioned by the administration?  A GP does not put the word \"urgent\" on a letter lightly.  If there are two patients in his surgery and knows that only one CT scan is available he will obviously give it to the person who requires it most.  Have those issues been raised, through the National Association of General Practitioners, NAGP, with the Irish college, to inform the administrative side of the health services that it is questioning clinical and ethical independence?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017112900002#R00300","speaker":"1229","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1511946000,"counter":873,"content":"<p>We support the principles of the Sl&aacute;intecare report, which is a coherent statement by the body politic to say that we need to develop a different health system based on primary care in collaboration with secondary care.  There is no question about that.  The argument has been won, and I congratulate our politicians for that.  Uniting the body politic behind that vision and allowing ten years for it to happen is a very good thing.  However, we cannot wait ten years to deliver the recommendations in the report.  It just will not happen.  In our presentation we provided a graph outlining the reasons why it would not happen.  The reason is demographics.  In the next 30 years our population is going to grow substantially.  In particular, there will be more people in the over 65, over 75 and over 85 categories.  Most of those people are going to get chronic disease.  Some 65% of people over 65 have two or more chronic diseases.  How will they be managed?  Most of them are going to end up in hospital if we continue the current model where chronic disease is managed by hospitals.  That means that the number of bed admissions is going to go up very dramatically in the next five, ten or 15 years, and it is scary that bed usage is going to go up by 120% in the next 25 years.  We do not have the capacity in our hospitals or in the community at present to manage that increase.  It would involve building six 1,000 bed hospitals the size of Croke Park and manning them with doctors, nurses and staff.  It cannot be done.  We have to make a change and start managing chronic disease in the community in a better way.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy rightly asked about the capacity.  I had a conversation with a very senior person in the acute hospital division a year ago, and he said to me that our acute system has two winters left.  We all know what happened last winter.  Flu is coming. <\/p> <p>  Deputy Durkan asked what we can do to reverse things immediately and create a sense of confidence about general practice.  The reversal of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest, FEMPI, legislation would help at this moment, or a commitment to reverse it without precondition.  <\/p> <p>  He also asked about fees.  It is a thorny question.  We have a Victorian system where our nurses, who are our most valued asset in our practice, are not valued financially in the same way because we do not have the resources in general practice to do so.  Some 4.6% of the health budget is allocated to general practice.  In Scotland it is 6.5%.  In England it is close to 8%.  Other systems are way above that.  We do not have the resources and we are chronically under-funded.  <\/p> <p>  Someone asked how many teams we need.  The primary care report recommended 400 to 600.  <\/p> <p>  The question of turning away patients on a Saturday was mentioned.  That is based on the contract, and it is mad.  It should never happen.  Patients should be seen when they need to be seen.  <\/p> <p>  A Deputy asked why we struggle.  I have 40 slots a day to allocate to my patients, and those slots are full.  My practice nurse has 35 slots and they are full.  We have 0.3 nurses per average list.  It cannot be done.  How can we take on chronic disease management within the current budget?  It cannot be done.  We need to front-load funding into primary care, by legislation, and into general practice-led teams.  This is not about putting money into my pocket.  It is about putting money into practice nursing, into the allied health professionals, into administration, IT and everything that is needed to provide a modern health system fit for the 21st century.  <\/p> <p>  Senator Colm Burke asked about building co-operation.  We must build co-operation between the representative bodies.  There is no difference between the NAGP, our sister organisation, the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, or the Irish College of General Practitiioners, ICGP on the way forward, but we need to fast-track this triangular system where we are all in different rooms.  Deputy Kelliher asked me, when I presented on the Sl&aacute;intecare presentation on integrated care, who would do the governance and what is really needed for primary care.  I believe the ICGP is well placed and should be part of the contract negotiations in an advisory capacity.  It is able, has the insights and has the confidence of all GPs.  They need to be involved formally in the process in some way to build confidence going forward.  <\/p> <p>  Deputy Durkan asked what three things are needed immediately.  I like a man who goes to the point.  What do we need immediately?  After a decision to reverse FEMPI, which would create confidence for young GPs to stay here - and Maiti&uacute; will talk about that shortly - we need access to diagnostics.  It is a disgrace that an intern in a hospital can access an MRI or CT scan and I cannot.  I could not even access a brain natriuretic peptide, BNP, test, which is a heart failure blood test, until we negotiated through the local integrated care committee, LICC, in Carlow and Kilkenny and made that happen.  Diagnostics need to be streamlined.  <\/p> <p>  Our practice nurses need to be developed and increased.  The idea of putting 900 community nurses out there into another silo in the community is mad.  They are great people.  Please, give them to general practice.  We will use them well, make them feel good and connect them in an integrated system.  <\/p> <p>  We also need rapid access to consultant advice and treatment when we need it without the hassle involved.  I am a senior decision maker with 30 years experience.  I know when an appendix is an appendix.  I should not have to send a patient into the emergency department to be triaged by a junior nurse or doctor.  It is mad.  We have an integrated service in Carlow-Kilkenny which is called the acute floor.  We have negotiated direct access for GPs to the acute floor so that patients are screened for medicine, surgery, paediatrics, observation, psychiatric care or whatever else they might need.  It is a no-brainer, and it could be developed everywhere.  We need direct access to consultant advice, both in the acute system or in scheduled care.  In Ireland East we have the same vision.  We need to develop services in the community for chronic disease, and one of the things we have worked on in the last year is a virtual clinic for heart failure.  This is being developed in Carlow-Kilkenny and in Ireland East with Mary Day and Ken McDonald.  In the first 270 consultations which were referred 90% were heading for the acute floor or outpatient departments, OPDs, whereas 90% are now managed in primary care without ever having to go near the acute floor or the OPDs.  This involves a culture change, with the GP, the senior decision maker, being involved with the consultants in a process, along with the diagnostics, access to echo and a community nurse who can come in to assist us, and we can build the services from the ground up.  Those three things are what are immediately required.  Most of them are culturally wrong.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017112900002#S00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ronan Fawsitt"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1511946000,"counter":874,"content":"<p>I will start with the contract process as it stands at the moment which Deputy Kelliher asked about.

In the Scottish contract that has just been negotiated, there were senior organisations and representation from the Minister involved.  The Minister can facilitate getting us into a room together and getting the organisations working together.  At individual level there is a huge amount of respect.

Why do we have mad waiting lists?  We have 600,000 people waiting to see a specialist.  Our population is less than 5 million so it is absolutely mad.  A lot of those people on that waiting list could have services delivered in primary care.  They do not need to see a specialist or the specialist needs to come to them.  Of the beds occupied in acute hospitals, 40% are occupied by people with chronic disease; 55% of hospital costs are a result of chronic disease; and 80% of GP consults are for chronic disease.  We are spending the money in the wrong place and in the wrong way and we need to shift a lot of that care for things such as COPD and heart failure.  It needs to come out of the hospital, empires and silos and into general practice-led primary care teams.  Many models around the world have developed the concept of a team.  It is GP-led and includes a practice nurse, a nurse physician assistant and an administration person.  In the US, they have shown that the primary care medical home model - which will not translate here although there are aspects of it that make sense - can reduce referrals, get better outcomes and better care, has lower costs and results in better satisfaction among providers.  The biggest threat to providers is not money, it is about hope and a feeling that one's work as a junior doctor or nurse matters.  We have had a lack of that hope for some time.  The model of team-based care scaled for our practice population is the way forward.  That is the international model that has worked.  In the UK, 11% of GP practices have embraced that medical home model within two years and 14% of the NHS is now covered by a medical home model, which is team-based care involving people working to the top of their licence.  It has reduced referrals to hospital, increased satisfaction among GPs and their staff and led to the retention of GPs in areas where GPS were falling off the cliff.  An example is the Plymouth place we visited.  In that practice, seven GPs were recruited whereas the neighbouring practices had begun to lose their partners.  The concept of a GP-led team is very good for patients, GPs and hospitals.  It would be good to the State as well because it will reduce costs and make health care systems sustainable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017112900002#T00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ronan Fawsitt"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1511946000,"counter":877,"content":"<p>I will address Deputy O'Reilly's question on patients being turned away.

In general practice, we pride ourselves on the fact that GMS patients and private patients are treated 100% the same way.  There are no different investigations or waiting times.  It is completely equitable.  However, GP lists close.  We are a six-doctor practice and there are occasions when we have to say we are not taking new patients because we have reached a safe capacity.  Our college sets superb standards for the treatment of our patients.  If we are going to treat our patients to those standards we cannot take on more than we can safely manage.  If we did, we would leave ourselves and the patients exposed to missing something or to litigation, for example.

What they found is that 20% have emigrated; 20% are seriously considering emigrating and 10% do not see themselves working as GPs in five years.  Theoretically that is 50% of the workforce gone.<\/p> <p>  The report highlighted four reasons GPs leave and the committee has touched on those in various ways so I will be able to answer some questions by going through them one by one.  The first is their own personal professional satisfaction as doctors.  Deputy Kelleher is right that GPs feel helpless.  I studied medicine to help people but the health service I work in makes it really difficult to do that.  I am tired of opening consultations daily by saying \"I am sorry you are waiting two years for the MRI\", or \"I am sorry you are waiting two years for that hip\".  As people are waiting they are deteriorating.  They are not just waiting; they are coming back to the GP again and again.  As Senator Burke said, they are told to tell their GPs to write another urgent letter.  I am writing three or four urgent letters a day.  It does not make a difference because what happens at that stage is that every letter becomes an urgent letter.<\/p><p>It is extremely difficult, demanding and emotionally draining to work in an environment in which there is nothing to do but wait and write more letters.  It makes us, as doctors, feel helpless.  I do not want to have the weekly conversation I have with patients when I tell them that they have two options - wait two years for an MRI or pay &euro;300 and have it done tomorrow.  Many of them are pensioners and cannot afford to pay that amount.  It is a very difficult conversation and, frankly, embarrassing.  It strains our relationship with patients.  I am embarrassed to be part of a health service that cannot provide access to basic investigations for patients.<br\/><br\/>Deputy Billy Kelleher is right - we do not feel valued as doctors.  Many trainees feel they are unable to do what they spent ten years training to do, at tremendous cost to the taxpayer.  We are highly qualified and skilled and assets to the health service, but we will be wasted if we are not utilised.  Once I qualify I cannot access basic tests, as Dr. Fawsitt mentioned.  If I were to order a chest X-ray today for Senator Colm Burke, it would take two weeks to get an appointment and one month to receive the report, a total of six weeks.  I cannot order MRI or CT scans.  I have to refer patients to hospital where they must wait to see a consultant, which might take six months or one year.  The consultant will say the GP was right, that the patients need a CT scan and they will then be put on the waiting list which will take another six months, all to order the scan that I knew was needed in the first place.<br\/><br\/>Sl&aacute;intecare deals with the management of chronic conditions in the community.  As Deputy Billy Kelleher pointed out, GPs are skilled and specialised.  We have the knowledge and skill to do this work and know our patients.  What we do not have is the support and resources of the health service to enable us to do it.  As a GP in 21st century Ireland I cannot access the most basic tests.  Patients must sometimes be referred to emergency departments because where I am the waiting time for an ultrasound is four months.  Sometimes a patient will deteriorate in that time and all we can do is send him or her to the emergency department, which is both very frustrating and embarrassing.  We want to achieve our potential as doctors and do what we are capable of doing, but many GPs and trainees believe the system does not allow us to do that.  The systems in place Canada, Australia and New Zealand do.  They are functioning health services that allow GPs to reach their potential as doctors.  It is very little for which to ask.  <br\/><br\/>As Deputy Louise O'Reilly said, we are very concerned about the future viability of general practice.  When we are training, we work with senior GPs and see them struggling.  They took a 40% reduction in income as a result of the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, legislation.  It was coupled with a genuinely dramatic increase in workload since the introduction of free GP care for those younger than six years and older than 70.  In the out-of-hours service in which I worked over Christmas appointments continued until 5 a.m.  This happens when someone rings the doctor to say his or her child needs to be seen.  The GP will say the next appointment is at 5.30 a.m.  We are coming near to full capacity.  The system is at breaking point. <br\/><br\/>We do not know what the future has in store for us.  The FEMPI legislation due to pass through the Oireachtas this week will allow the Minister for Health to alter the fees paid to general practitioners as he sees fit.  Since the introduction of free GP care for those younger than six years, banks are far less likely to lend newly qualified GPs like me money to buy a premises because they know that our income can be controlled and reduced by the State.  That is a serious problem.  Trainees are not willing to commit to taking on a list in Ireland when they cannot plan for the future, given the uncertainty created.  Much of the talk is about remuneration, but my generation wants quality of life.  An improved work-life balance is something GPs of all ages value, but in order to encourage us to stay, that work-life balance needs to be attained.  I know GPs who have not been able to take time off in 18 months.  They are technically entitled to annual leave, but they cannot find locums to replace them or to cover for someone on sick leave or maternity leave.  In Australia they can.<br\/><br\/>I am from Leitir M&oacute;ir on the west coast.  When I was young, there were five GPs there and the system worked well.  We did not even have an ambulance service when I was growing up.  Last year one GP took early retirement because she had to take a required period of absence and could not find a locum to replace her.  Incredibly, she was replaced by a young, enthusiastic doctor who recently wrote a letter to <i>The Irish Times<\/i>stating one night on call, 72 hours into a shift, he was called to see a man who was unwell.  He waited for an hour on the side of the road for an ambulance to come and nearly ran out of oxygen.  He was genuinely worried that the patient would die.  I do not want to have a conversation like that with a patient telling him or her that there is nothing I can do but wait for an ambulance when he or she could die.  As of 2 August, a second GP had resigned, not retired, because the workload was becoming unmanageable and unsafe.  It sends an incredibly powerful message when someone who for years was the lifeline for the community no longer believes he or she can do his or her job safely because of the incredible demands placed on him or her.  The post remains unfilled.  From December it is likely a third GP will take early retirement too because of the impossible demands placed on him.<br\/><br\/>Doctors are resilient.  We endure six years of struggle in college and work all of the hours God gives to help our patients.  We are not afraid of hard work and it is rare that we give up.  When we do, it should cause serious concern that primary care services are on the verge of collapse.  I studied medicine because I hoped to replace my GP on his retirement.  Last week he worked 120 hours.  He works a one-in-four rota, meaning that every three or four days he will do a 36 hour shift.  He works 48 hours every fourth weekend.  I am not ashamed to say I do not know if I am physically or mentally able to do that job and face the demands it would place on me.  I am in my 20s; he is in his 60s.  No amount of money in the world would attract doctors to these jobs.  It is not a question of money but increasingly the impossible conditions GPs face.  Would any committee member tell his or her son to take up a job in an organisation from which three people have resigned because they believed the workload was unsustainable, unsafe and possibly posed a threat to their health?  They would not.<br\/><br\/>Financial prospects are better abroad.  The United Kingdom is approximately ten years ahead of us in dealing with its general practice crisis.  There is a huge shortage of GPs in the United Kingdom and they will come looking for GP trainees.  We, therefore, need to address this problem now.  General practice has changed in that it is attracting graduates.  These are ones who have taken out massive loans to become doctors and they are in debt to the tune of approximately &euro;150,000 or &euro;200,000.  They need to pay back these loans.  They are not being greedy; they just want to pay off their loans in order that they can start a family and have a life during training.  They took out the loans to become doctors.  That is a complex matter and I acknowledge that Senator Colm Burke is working very hard on the issue of graduate debt.  I am not sure what the answer is, but I know that he is working on it.  It is a huge problem. <br\/><br\/>There are four reasons GPs are leaving: they want to be able to work to their full capabilities; they want to reach their potential as doctors; they need access to basic services and diagnostics and they need to be paid for what they do.  We are not sure if the specialty is viable.  The first step in providing that reassurance would be the reversal of the FEMPI legislation.  If we were to be given a new contract which reflectd the day-to-day workings of 21st century practice in Ireland. it would be a huge step for us.  We do not want much.  We want to be able to take time off.  I want to be able to take one or two weeks off when I need to for my own physical and mental health.  I know that in many posts such as the one in the place I am from there might be a period two years in which I would not be able to take a single day off.  There are not many reasonable people who would be willing to do that.  Some of us are heavily indebted and cannot afford to stay in Ireland and know that we will be able to pay back the loans and have a life in moving abroad.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017112900002#T00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Maiti&uacute; &Oacute; Tuathail","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511946000,"counter":884,"content":"<p>I am sorry to interrupt Dr. &Oacute; Tuathail in mid-stream, but in respect of the Sl&aacute;intecare report, the reason we are here, what is the main issue Dr. Kerin believes needs to be addressed first?

Dr. Fawsitt, rightly, pointed out that we were putting nurses into the wrong area in the community and that there was no relationship with general practice.  If we could have that changed, it would be an immediate win.<\/p> <p>  We have to redefine how general practice is run.  When we studied the GP home care model in Plymouth, we found that they had changed the ethos completely.  They had pooled practices through the use of information and communications technology to create an alliance between GPs and practices and shared resources.  They had drawn on the voluntary and National Health Service structure, particularly on the voluntary side.  In Ireland there are many voluntary groups, including patient advocacy groups, meals on wheels and social care services.<\/p><p> One brings that into one's practice and one then pulls back on the workload.  Much of my workload includes counselling, which is not in my contract, dealing with depression, anxiety and social situations.  I write letters relating to the housing crisis and everything in that range of things, so social work is interplaying with general practice.  If we create that alliance together, we would achieve an immediate win.  We must redefine what our practice nurses do in general practice.  They are a significant asset particularly in chronic disease management.  GPs are senior decision makers and need to be at the level of senior decision making for complex disease polymorbidity.  That is what our role is.  We need to move back from signing forms and writing ever stronger letters to argue that a case is more urgent than the last letter that said it was urgent, and start enabling.<\/p><p> We can do that ahead of implementation and the big bang of a new contract but I strongly believe that we now have a sickness model.  Deputy O'Reilly asked about the fee structure and was interested in the split.  We operate on a capitation model.  The public is not aware of this.  In my consultation, I do not tell my patients that I get paid X amount a year for their care, which is an open ended system and I receive a dead end payment.  That has a huge ramification because the GP is trying to pick up the slack of what is not being done in secondary care and is becoming overwhelmed, which means that inversion happens.  After subsidies, the average payment for a medical card is just in excess of &euro;10 monthly per head coming to the GP.  How can someone run a business like that?  One cannot.  It depends on an individual's outlook.  In my practice, I augment my income by doing work outside general practice, in occupational medicine, procedures, lecturing and research and I put it all in the pot to deliver for my patients.  Many GP practices do that.  If one is only getting the State payment on GMS alone, it is not enough.  It will end in a situation of getting less for less.  We must get down to the issues.  There has to be immediate resourcing and goodwill.  The budget this year was a huge disappointment, no meaningful transformation fund was put in place.  GPs are hanging on by their fingernails and are looking for that support but it is not forthcoming.<\/p><p> Returning to the level of public funding in the country, less than &euro;500 million was put into funding the service.  Some &euro;17.5 billion is spent in the health service with 90% of interactions happening in general practice.  It does not add up.  These are my immediate comments on implementation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017112900002#U00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Emmet Kerin","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1511946000,"counter":887,"content":"<p>I would like to come in on that because it is critical.  Professor Tom O'Dowd's TCD study said that 90% of patients were happy with their last GP consultation.  Imagine if the politicians here were getting a 90% satisfaction rating.  We are coming from a good base.  We are trusted and valued.  That voice needs to be in the implementation team.  We are looking for GP representation and involvement in the implementation team because GPs are entrepreneurs.  We get things done.  We have a powerful impetus to make thing happen.<\/p> <p>  I echo Mr. Tony O'Brien's observation that we need &euro;500 million annually over ten years for primary care development.  We need to front-load transitional funding into primary care.  Politicians have to take a punt that general practice can do this.  We know we can, our patients - 90% of them - trust us to do this but the State has to invest in it.  It has been done in other jurisdictions, such as Vermont and New Zealand where there has been legislation-led change.  The people on this committee do not know how powerful they are.  We cannot deliver the change that is needed without the support of the body politic.  That is why Sl&aacute;intecare, whether right, wrong or indifferent, is brilliant for having brought together the body politic and given us a vision for how to go forward.  The body politic now needs to get people into that team and we are willing to put our hands up and get involved.<\/p> <p>  We need to develop a sense of population health.  My population is my practice.  I want to look after my practice.  I know where my patients are, I know the sick people, the frail people, the COPD patients, the heart failure patients and mental health patients, but I do not yet have the team to manage them.  The State has a population of those over 70 years and it could incentivise better care in the community.  They are already State-funded through the over 70 years medical card.  A start could be made with that population, and develop services around chronic disease in the community and manage them appropriately but the nonsense of the doctor visit card has to be stopped, which turns patients into second-class citizens without access to a public health nurse, occupational therapy or other things, because they have a second-class card.  I would ask that they please be given a full medical card.  Starting now, with a stroke of a pen, full GMS entitlement could be brought in for those over 70 years which would allow them to access whatever supports are already there in the community.  Then GPs can be incentivised to provide more structured care.  I will give one example of where we have made a proposal.  We know that 70% of hospital work is medicine.  Many patients are discharged after medical admission, and 12% of those over 70s are readmitted within 30 days.  There is evidence that if those patients who were discharged after pneumonia, a stroke or whatever are seen by their primary care physician within seven days, the readmission rates are reduced by between 12% and 24%.  That is joined-up care, joined-up thinking and is better for patients and for general practice.  If we were resourced to do that extra care, it would cost very little but the reward is considerable and this is for a population whose care is already covered by the State.  That is the kind of intervention and joined-up care that we need to promote, the idea that we have a population that we are responsible for, and we should put in the structures that can help them to stay well and out of hospital.  International systems have shown that this works.  That is what we should do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017112900002#V00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ronan Fawsitt"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1511946000,"counter":888,"content":"<p>I will reiterate Dr. Fawsitt's comment.  A question was asked about how Sl&aacute;intecare can be implemented.  We only know the primary care part.  We need the Department of Health and the HSE to embrace it and then for the general practice bodies, namely, the ICGP, the NAGP and the IMO to be involved.  This cannot be implemented by HSE managers or anyone else.  This has to be done in partnership with the people on the ground who know they system and how it works.  It is really important for the general practice professional and representative bodies to be involved with the Department of Health and the HSE in making a start on this.  A contract is essential and it must be negotiated with all representative bodies.  If the bulk of GPs are to be brought along with wherever we are going with the contract, the GPs must feel they have been represented in the process.  It must be a contract that has been negotiated by both bodies.  While we cannot have a big bang and something set out in stone on day one, we still need a rough guide as to where it is going in order to keep Dr. &Oacute; Tuathail and his generation here.  The problem is one of uncertainty.  There is massive uncertainty over what is happening.  Will there be free GP care for all?  Will we be nationalised?  There is a total lack of understanding among this generation of newly qualified GPs as to what their life will be like in ten years' time.  We need a contract, or the basis of a contract, that will give some clue about that.<\/p> <p>  The aspiration of Sl&aacute;intecare is free access to primary care and general practice for all patients.  While that is a very admirable end point, perhaps \"free\" is the wrong word, and maybe it should be in some way limited.  We are very far from being anywhere close to being ready for that unless we can get the Department, the HSE and the bodies in the room to get talking about the contract and how that will evolve.  That will get the GPs who are qualifying interested in getting involved and staying.

I believe the solution is to improve the terms and conditions for all so that independent contractors can work throughout the country.  The jobs could be salaried and let in some more, but I do not think anybody would take them.<\/p> <p>  I do not believe the corporate model is a good idea.  We should continue to work as independent practitioners.  The increased popularity of the corporate model is a reflection of the fact that many GPs are struggling and, as the Chairman rightly describes, it provides them with a way out.  While I cannot speak on behalf of all trainees, I personally feel we should continue with the current model of independent practitioners.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Kelleher asked if we thought our training would suffice in allowing us to manage chronic care.  We are very well trained; we spend ten years in college.  We can absolutely manage anything that can be thrown at us.  We can manage all the chronic diseases we are required to manage, but not in its current guise.  We need to be given access to the resources we need first and then the care can be transferred out.  There is no urgency when these patients are being looked after in secondary care as is.  We should focus and try to do it right for once.  We should transfer the resources first and the patients afterwards.

I welcome all the witnesses.  Considering all the negatives and pressures on the sector, let me say that, as a GP, I believe that general practice works, and that is solely down to the professionalism of doctors.  It is important to acknowledge that.  We still have access within 24 hours, unlike our colleagues in the UK.<\/p> <p>  I totally agree with everything Dr. Flynn said about uncertainty in the sector.  There is a perceived dichotomy between the GP seeing patients in his or her surgery and the decision makers, be they politicians or representative bodies.  We need to address that perception.  I frequently speak to young GPs and medical students; my niece will qualify from the University of Limerick this year.  Even though she likes general practice, her main reason for not going into general practice is the uncertainty about funding and the contractual uncertainties.  As I have said previously, I fundamentally believe we will not get a good contract without equal status for all negotiating bodies around the table.  The NAGP needs to have equal status with the IMO.  It is not one organisation against the other; it is about working together.<\/p> <p>  Our colleagues who appeared earlier today spoke about IT.  General practice is so far ahead of the secondary care system in IT.  We get blood and radiology test results online.  We do referrals online.  Much can be learnt from general practice.  There is considerable time wasting in the secondary care system.  Dr. &Oacute; Tuathail hit the nail on the head.  Some outpatient departments are operating with juvenile inexperienced doctors.  While we all have to learn, at the end of the day we have to call a spade a spade.  People are being brought back to outpatient departments every six months because of the indecision and incapability of a young doctor to make a call.  There is a safety net in bringing the patient back six months later.  The doctors will have moved on to another job.  Those looking at the patient can determine things are not too bad and not much has been missed.  That model does not work and will never work.  That is why the funding needs to go into primary care where we have senior decision makers who are not afraid to make a call on things and they know their patients very well.<\/p> <p>  I wish to talk about diagnostics in primary care.  Primary care centres are not about the bricks and mortar, but about the activity within those centres.  There is no funding model for diagnostics in primary care.  I have a DEXA scanner, but the HSE does not pay for medical card patients to have a scan.  I have ultrasound and spirometry equipment.  It is up to the doctor to provide these services.  We need a funding model for diagnostics if we are serious about providing these services for patients in the community.<\/p> <p>  General practice is a small or medium-sized business with many staff members making up the team, including practice nurses.  How would the experts feel about having practice nurses directly employed by the HSE?  What about having a different model of funding, involving phlebotomists, for example?  We are all doing jobs we should not be doing.  Nurses could be doing more productive duties than taking blood.<\/p> <p>  The drugs saving scheme had ceased before my time as a general practitioner.  Would there be any merit in reintroducing that scheme and having a finite spend model whereby the savings incurred would be monitored by the HSE or another overseeing group to prevent it being exploited?  I know that scheme was discontinued some time ago, but I would be interested to hear the witnesses' views on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017112900002#W00400","speaker":"1373"},{"type":"speech","time":1511946000,"counter":894,"content":"<p>I am conscious that another group from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions is scheduled to come in.

She is CEO of trust in Wales which is in the top three of the most deprived areas in the UK.  She had a totally dysfunctional health system with ambulances queuing up at one end of a hospital and trying to get out at the other.  She changed it around and did it through integration.  She made this comment about population health.  We need to embrace this concept which is in Sl&aacute;intecare.  She said:<\/p><blockquote>I have 792 frequent flyers in my hospital.  I know who they are.  I know where they live.  I know their GPs... I don't have 1,000 beds in my trust.  I have 360,000 beds in my trust; they are the patients' homes.  I use their beds... I don't give my GPs money; the state does that.

It is our view that this Sl&aacute;intecare report, which enjoys almost universal political consensus about how our public health services should be structured, funded and maintained, offers a real opportunity for radical reform of the current inequitable two-tiered health system, leading to a properly resourced public health service, which is a fundamental social good in any society.  As an indication of our support for the report, the health committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions is currently meeting with the health spokespersons of all political parties.  We are satisfied that, to date, these engagements have been positive and all political parties have reaffirmed their commitment while recognising the challenges and scale of change involved.<\/p> <p>  Primary care expansion, as detailed within the report, is undoubtedly a cornerstone of the reform programme.  ICTU fully supports, and will actively work towards achieving, the delivery of health care in the community as near as possible to the home of the patient or client.  In that regard, we note that the report identifies all critical areas to be reformed and expanded, including universal access to primary care; universal GP care; expansion of diagnostics; expansion of home care and palliative care; and additional services for citizens with disabilities.<\/p><p>In working towards implementing all of the report&rsquo;s recommendations, we remind the committee of the recent report, from the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, which measured the increasing demand upon the health service between now and 2030.<br\/><br\/>In a further confirmation of the scale of the challenge facing our health system, the report states that demand for home help hours will increase by between 38% and 54%, demand for practice nurse visits is to increase by between 26% and 32% and demand for GP visits to increase by between 20% and 27%.  It should be noted that, in addition to these very significant increases in primary care based services, the report also states that the demand for inpatient bed days will increase by between 32% and 37% for the same period.  We believe this highlights two critical facts in relation to our public health service.  First, the expansion of our primary care services, faced with this level of measured increased demand, is absolutely critical and cannot be ignored.  Second, even with major expansion of our primary care services, the nature of our demographics will still result in a significant increase in demand for inpatient bed days; in other words, the demand for acute care will continue, even while we are expanding primary care services, and this has resource implications which must be accepted by all political parties.<br\/><br\/>Turning to the issue of universal GP and primary care access, it is self-evident that any expansion of primary care, as recommended in the report, requires a seismic shift in the eligibility of citizens to access all services outside the hospital setting.  In that regard, the Sl&aacute;intecare report correctly identifies the need for the expansion of, and universal access to, GP services and primary care services.  From the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, perspective we believe the expansion of these services should, in the context of universal access, be integrated.  In other words, universal access to GP and primary care services should be seamless and delivered by a primary care team of health professionals who can directly receive self-referred patients, refer patients and clients to other health professionals within the team and refer on to other specialist or sub-specialist services as required.  In that context, the GP is an integral member of this team but so, equally, are all other health professionals.  This seamless approach, by fully utilising the skills of all, is the most effective way of dealing with growing demand including the management of chronic disease in a quality assured way.<br\/><br\/>It remains the view of ICTU that the most efficient and effective way of delivering universal access to all primary care services, including GP services, is that they should be provided by directly employed health professionals.  The ongoing discussions, with regard to a revision of the GP contract, should be wholly informed by, and against the background of, a requirement that in future all new GPs should be directly employed by the public service.  They should be rostered, particularly in urban areas, on a seven over seven basis, as should other key health professionals, and all members of the team paid a competitive salary reflecting their role and experience.  This would ensure recruitment and retention.<br\/><br\/>With regard to the steps to implementation and ensuring delivery of the reform programme, ICTU believes that a critical first step is the establishment of an implementation office in the Department of the Taoiseach.  This will ensure a whole of Government approach to implementation.  In the absence of this initial oversight step, ICTU is already very concerned at the failure in budget 2018 to provide earmarked funding to prepare for the reform programme including the absence of a dedicated capital building programme, with regard to primary care centres with comprehensive diagnostic services to deliver the required community based infrastructure.  There has also been no engagement on the necessary funded workforce plan required to deliver universal access, which the report states are 900 general nurses to expand the child health and well-being programmes; 1,917 health care assistants to expand home care and other services; 1,296 allied health professionals to delivery universal access to primary care; and 2,021 nurses of various grades to also deliver universal access.<br\/><br\/>In the context of the current recruitment and retention difficulties, facing grades within the health system, no expansion can take place without these additional staff.  The reality is these additional staff will not be recruited without a properly structured and funded workforce plan covering the numbers of training places, clarity on the autonomy of roles within each team fully utilising all available skills and improved pay and conditions of employment.  The report also recommends expansion of such critical services as the child and family health, community based child, adolescent and adult mental health services, expansion of palliative care services, and expansion of home care and disability services.<br\/><br\/>The report states that in the transition period, lasting up to ten years with many developments delivered within five years, expansion of these services should begin in year one.  The report is correct when its states that all of these service expansions, while taking place on a phased basis, should be developed through an integrated model of care.  This means that we must have simultaneous developments within all these strands of services so that the user, who will often have more than one need, can enjoy the benefits of a seamless expanding service.  Against the background of the foregoing, we are already required to ask when the implementation will start.  Is this year one or ten?  Why was there not greater clarity about the funding in budget 2018?<br\/><br\/>A very broad overview of the additional funding requirement, arising from the expansion of services listed under primary care, identifies a cost of some &euro;1.297 billion.  This is separate from the capital build, essential to develop primary care centres, which will be the hub of the provision of seven over seven services required as part of the reform programme.  Recognising the additional funding required, it is necessary for all political parties in the context of their support for Sl&aacute;intecare to be forthright in saying in their policy statements that reducing overall taxation levels is not compatible with delivering a single tiered, equitable and universally accessible public health service capable of meeting future demand.<br\/><br\/>Regarding health care and social economic good, in 2001 the then Government defined primary care in its primary care strategy as:<\/p><blockquote>...an approach to care that includes a range of services designed to keep people well, from promotion of health and screening for disease to assessment, diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation as well as personal social services.  The services provide first-level contact that is fully accessible by self-referral and have a strong emphasis on working with communities and individuals to improve their health and social well-being.<\/blockquote><p>Almost two decades later, despite the excellence of effort by health service staff and significant expenditure by the Government, it has to be said we have not achieved this goal in the interest of all citizens.  There are many reasons for this, with some related to funding and others related to ideology and an acceptance that a two tiered health system was somehow acceptable.  The Sl&aacute;intecare report provides the opportunity and solid platform for this State as a society to address the glaring inequality that is inevitable when money can ensure faster access to senior clinicians, diagnostics and, ultimately, treatment.  We now have the opportunity by working together at political, organisational and societal level to address this inequality informed by this report and the expansion of primary care services is a cornerstone of this transitional journey.  ICTU fully supports this report and the recommendations detailing how we expand our primary care services.  We commit, on behalf of all of our members and their families, to work with all parties in delivering the transformational change now available to us. <br\/><br\/>I thank the members for their time and attention and we look forward to discussing this submission and the relevant elements of the report with the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017112900002#X00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Doran","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511946000,"counter":905,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Doran.

It is very heartening to hear ICTU's support not just as the representatives of health care professionals, but also as representatives for workers outside the health sector who depend hugely on the public health service.  ICTU's support in this regard is very welcome.  I am hopeful that this support might nudge some of my colleagues into being a little more vocal.  We need the political will to implement Sl&aacute;intecare.<\/p><p>We do not lack research findings and a plan.  Sadly, we do lack the political will to follow through.  <\/p><p> I welcome ICTU's statement on the incompatibility of building decent public services, including health services, with tax cuts.  I am sorry that there are not more of my colleagues present to hear and understand that message.<\/p><p> I want to ask a few questions that I asked earlier today.  The ICGP has described the terms and conditions and pay structure for practice nurses as Victorian and inflexible.  I know that practice nurses are flexible.  How can we ensure we are getting the best value for money?  Before we adopt an expanded primary care model, we need to move forward in achieving good value for money, respecting patients and workers and building the best foundations to broaden the services provided.  I asked the previous delegates to outline how money reached the GP through the operation of the small business model?  How is money passed on to those who work as part of that cohort?  If someone is paid on a fee per item basis, is it always paid on the assumption that it is the GP who will provide the service or are there others who can provide it?  If it is the latter, how are they remunerated?  Is there scope for the use of advanced nurse practitioners to form part of a primary care team?<\/p><p> I am sure we all agree that having primary care teams in the community is a good idea.  Will the delegates outline what they consider to be a fully staffed fit for purpose primary care team?  A general practitioner often leads the primary care team.  What is the working relationship like between the GP and the primary care team?  Do the delegates envisage a GP being the employer in an expanded service?  Do they envisage the entire primary care team being employed by the one person and working together in providing an expanded service?  The small business model of general practice seems to be quite limited.  Such a model will not be expanded without the addition of allied health professionals and others who would form part of a primary care team.<\/p><p> I am a massive fan of home helps and anyone who knows me will not be surprised by my next question.  Will the delegates talk about the expansion of the home help service?  The committee has met representatives of home care providers and the HSE and they painted a picture that it was sometimes difficult to find home helps to work, specifically in the evenings.  As a result, people were forced to access services from the private sector.  I doubt if much has changed since the last time I represented them, but I have always found the home help service to be one of the most flexible and responsive in the HSE.  According to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the average cost of a home help is &euro;24.20 an hour.  Some global multinationals charge up to &euro;42 an hour.  In the context of an expanded service and what constitutes value for money which is always paramount, will the delegates comment on from where the figure of &euro;42 an hour stems.  Is the service capable of being expanded?  I believe it is; therefore, it is unnecessary to source home helps from multinational corporations.  Many of the independent and directly employed home helps are capable of providing the service.  Will the delegates confirm that for us?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017112900002#Y00300","speaker":"1302","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511946000,"counter":908,"content":"<p>In the two earlier sessions we met representatives of the IMO, the ICGP and the NAGP.  They were adamant that the independent contractor model would best serve the health service.  They believed the resourcing of the small business model was broken and that, therefore, general practice was unsustainable.  Are the delegates aware of a model that employs salaried GPs outside the independent contractor model?  If so, where does it happen?  If one were to have salaried GPs working on a roster seven days a week, how many additional GPs would the health service require?  Let us remember that salaried GPs would be subject to the EU working time directive.  Many GPs work in excess of 48 hours a week.  An additional number of GPs would be required to man the service under the EU working time directive.  How would the delegates propose to recruit and retain and maintain capacity and increase the capacity of the health service if we were to move to such a model?<\/p> <p>  Contract negotiations are taking place.  There is a proposal in Sl&aacute;intecare to have salaried GPs in certain areas in which it has been hard to recruit doctors, including rural and deprived urban areas.  <\/p> <p>  Perhaps the delegates might also refer to access to hospital services.  Last week a \"Prime Time\" programme drew attention to the fact that there were many unsavoury practices in hospitals.  It appears that there was a lack of management to ensure hospital doctors worked the full hours in their contracts, which had a knock-on effect on public outpatient and inpatient waiting lists.  <\/p> <p>  Will the delegates refer to the growing trend for corporate entities to enter general practice?  Companies have taken over practices.  Many GPs cannot see a way out of their practice other than by becoming involved with a corporate entity.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Louise O'Reilly referred to practice nurses.  Should they be directly employed or should they be employed using the small business model?  <\/p> <p>  Like the delegates, we believe implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare has been slow.  Will they identify short-term measures that would kickstart it?  <\/p> <p>  I apologise for asking so many questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017112900002#Z00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1511946000,"counter":909,"content":"<p>It is a little like the Chinese proverb: \"If I wanted to go there, then I would not start from here\".  Let me be clear: we cannot and will not deliver Sl&aacute;intecare and a universal accessible primary care system under which all health professions will be utilised if we approach it with the current model.  ICTU's view differs from those of the other contributors that the committee has heard today.  We have a system under which some people are entitled to care paid for by the State, while others pay for it, but we are trying to introduce universal access.  Why would one have independent contractors in a small business model providing a universal accessible primary care system?  What profit would be generated by it?<\/p> <p>  As we stated in our original submissions, it will take more than ten years to implement Sl&aacute;intecare.  A massive political and societal buy-in is required because Sl&aacute;intecare is a completely different way of allowing the health service to touch people when they need help.<\/p><p>I will try to go through the points as best I can but my colleagues will bail me out if I leave some out.  Mr. Paul Bell will address the questions on home helps.<\/p><p> Practice nurses for GP practices have been needed for years and we are fully supportive of their role.  They should be directly employed by the State.  There is no salary scale for practice nurses.  Under the present model, the GP receives a grant to employ a practice nurse, but he or she may not necessarily pay the nurse that amount of money.  They have an individual employment relationship and this can lead to argy-bargy.  On top of that, the practice nurse performs services in the clinical area for which the GP gets another fee, whether for the flu vaccine, the cervical smear test whatever.  The State is paying for the service twice.<\/p><p> A couple of years ago we conducted a survey and in one practice, our members estimated that they generated income from private patients' fees of &euro;112,000, outside of the GMS income for the practice, based on the tasks they did in the previous 12 months.  Our view is that practice nurses should be directly employed by the State and should be entitled to be eligible for superannuation.  We agree that their role should be broad so that they have a seamless connection with the community-based nursing services.  At present, there is this wall behind which the practice nurse stays.  Patient A goes to the public health nurse or the community general nurse.  That is not a seamless service.  If one is intelligent enough to navigate it, one might get out of it but if not, it creates a problem.  The practice nurse should be directly employed by the State, as all people in the system should be.  They should be allowed to expand their practice.  The current model of grant aid to the GP, which is not reflected in the salary paid to the practice nurse or the revenue that the practice nurse generates for the practice from private patients is neither fair, reasonable nor sustainable.<\/p><p> The fundament point about primary care is that one is not always dealing with sick people, one is trying to keep them healthy or trying to continue the model of treatment that is there.  It is not all short-term episodic interventions, rediagnosing and reclassifying, although that is a part of it.  What we are trying to do is manage the care of the individual and keep him or her healthy.  The advanced nursing practice will have to be the bedrock, particularly in chronic disease management.  In general practice in any jurisdiction, the GP will not be intimately involved in the twice or three times a week management of the care of a person with a chronic disease.  That is the team's role and that is where the advanced nursing practitioner comes in.  The community midwife has a similar role, as the does the community intellectual disability nurse, the community pharmacist, the radiographer, the physiotherapist and the dietician.  These health professionals have equal and vital roles to play in a primary care team that is embedded in and serving the community.  No one service is greater than the other and they all should be able to take self referred people.  The advance nursing practice is part of that service.<\/p><p> The primary care team is the key, but it must be fit for purpose and have good working relationships.  Let us fast forward ten years when we will see the impact of the changing demographics on health services.  The ESRI has projected an increase in demand of 20% to 32% for services, but not all for acute interventions.  The ESRI projects that the demand for home help services will increase by 54%.  That is a massive increase.  The primary care team has to be modelled, staffed and resourced to deal with the demand on a seven over seven basis.<\/p><p> The Chairman raised the issue of rostering.  We would have a fairly strong view on this.  The current GP model has the GP providing a service from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday to Friday and after that one goes into the out-of-hours on-call system and so on.  We are very concerned that the development of the out-of-hours on-call system has had a hand in glove impact on the number of people being referred to the emergency departments, who might be treated otherwise in a more collective team-based way.  At weekends, in particular, people are being referred because they are seeing a different GP who is a completely new point of contact and there is no continuity of care.  That applies to public health nursing and community general nursing services as well.  They too are structured on a 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday to Friday service with essential calls only at weekends.  We are saying that they should span the seven days as well.  If one is truly interested in keeping people out of hospitals then one has to provide a service in the community seven days a week.  That is labour intensive but it is the only way.  The GP is an integral part of that transition.  We are saying that with the changing demographics, modes of treatment and increase in chronic disease management that the team must comprise a group of health professionals with no one specialty having supremacy over the other and no one being a gatekeeper of the other, all referring from one to the other in a much more mature and adult way which does not have as its core a medical model of care that is shaped, directed and conducted by a doctor.  That is not the health service of the future.<\/p><p> The health service of the future is different and the team will be central to the care of the individual.  We should model the employment relationship as follows.  There is no chance that many of the current GP cohort would move to be directly employed by the State.  They have their business models, and have mortgages and debts.  The only way we will successfully move to a new model is that new GP contracts should be for directly salaried doctors and over a generation one will build up the critical mass of people who will be employed directly.  It is the same for consultants.  What was disclosed last week in the hospital setting is a direct result of the incentives for practice.  One cannot fault people for following the money trail.  People are all the same.  How long ago did somebody say that people of the same profession never gather without money being discussed.  Consultants are no different.  We will only get to a directly employed universal health care in hospital or primary care by accepting that the current cohort have a certain contract and as people retire and leave, they are replaced by staff who have been offered a direct public only contract so that in 15 years' time, we have a critical mass of people working completely differently with no delineation between the private and public patients.  That is what will be required if we are to deliver Sl&aacute;intecare, whether in primary care or in the hospital.  That is a big ask, but it is the only way this will be done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017112900002#Z00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Doran","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511946000,"counter":911,"content":"<p>I am sorry but I must interrupt Mr. Doran.

Unfortunately, time does not permit me to develop this further, except to say that the WHO has made it clear that by the year 2030, there will be a 40 million shortage of health professionals throughout the globe.  That will obviously affect Ireland on the basis of the demographics.<\/p> <p>  A point I wanted to expand on, but disappointingly it is not possible, is the unsavoury practice to which the Chairman referred whereby there are various issues arising from contracts of public and private provision.

I am delighted to be asked here.  To give some background, as well as being a geriatrician for over 30 years dealing with people at stages of vulnerability enmeshed in networks of care, I have also been involved in the development of heath care ethics in Trinity College and in Ireland setting up the first interdisciplinary course in health care ethics, which is the standpoint I would like to come from rather than from that of the law, the law being anethical and ethics being about what it is to do the right thing through virtuous thought and action.  I am also the co-chair of the medical and health humanities strand in Trinity College, which is about trying to understand what it is to be human, to be ill, to be well and to experience the health services by a broader vision through film, television, literature, ethics, philosophy and theology, this being a very important part of what we call epistemology, which is knowledge.  It is important to have a broader grasp of a broader sense of the knowledge sources we need here.  This is not about quantitative science or empirical studies only showing X number of this or Y number of that.  It is about teasing out what it is to be human, the value we put to life and the meaning of words we use such as \"dignity\".  Dignity is very important here.<\/p><p>We need to look at dignity in places where it has been stress-tested.  For example, the first line of the constitution of the Federal Republic of Germany reads: &quot;Die W&uuml;rde des Menschen ist Unantastbar&quot;, which translates as &quot;human dignity is inviolable&quot;.  It is interesting that the literal translation of &quot;Menschenw&uuml;rde&quot;, the German word for &quot;dignity&quot;, is &quot;the worth of being human&quot;. <br\/><br\/>The importance of health care ethics is that it is a broad reach of knowledge that includes that which is good within tradition and that which is evolving.  People often refer to the phrase of the philosopher Santayana that those who forget history are condemned to repeat it.  However, the first part of that statement which is etched on the library of Congress is that progress, far from depending on change, depends on conservation.  As the German philosopher Hans-Georg Gadamer stated, within traditions very often lies embedded an unarticulated wisdom.  The reason my submission includes a quotation from T. S. Elliot is that this discussion is a new venture for us and &quot;a raid on the inarticulate&quot;.<br\/><br\/>The reason I address this issue from a health care ethics point of view is that we need an articulacy to tease out the complexities of the care of life with disability because prejudice against disability is widespread, occult and overt and perhaps one of the motivators for the wish of some for assisted suicide.  It illuminates the challenge of recognising prejudices such as those based on age, gender, race or disability in public discourse on health care and allows us the challenge of recognising what autonomy is - an issue touched on last week by Dr. Regina McQuillan - because it is being pushed to the forefront and out of equilibrium with other elements of health care virtues that are important, for example, beneficence - doing good to people - and nonmaleficence - not harming people.  It is interesting that one of the earliest statements in this context is from Hippocrates, namely, <i>primum non nocere <\/i>or first do no harm.  To this has been added <i>primum non tacere<\/i>, or do not to be silent, which is of particular relevance if we consider not only the silence but also the collusion of German health care professions with the T4 euthanasia programme and the role of the Swedish medical profession during the long period in which there was enforced sterilisation of people with a disability.  It is welcome that the committee is allowing the professions to address it.  This is by no means an extension of the bad old days of paternalism, but it is related to a broader sense of what it means to be unwell and the importance of care to our moral development, both as a people and a society.  Caring is an intrinsic part of human nature and human development. <br\/><br\/>To return to the issue of assisted suicide, I am very interested in human rights, specifically established rights such as the right to life and the right to the highest attainable level of health care.  Sometimes in the public domain we fret more about phrases such as the right to die than the ethical issue of the right to the highest achievable level of health care.  One of the key issues in this debate is an artificial and inappropriate attempt to divide out two forms of suicide.  The high level of suicide in Ireland is a major concern.  While it has thankfully dipped, more people continue to die by suicide than in road traffic accidents.  Suicide causes extraordinary distress.  Somehow or other, we have come to a point where, within public discourse, we have bad suicide or that about which we feel sad and grievous and wish to do everything we can to prevent it.  As members are aware, there are several hundred charities devoted to addressing the issue of suicide.  When people wish to engage with it as a source of stress and concern, we seem to close our eyes to the fact that it is effectively the same.  There are simplistic tropes that somehow or other the suicides we wish to prevent in our suicide prevention strategies are somehow irrational.  We do not have to go far in the literature to see that it is not the case that people who died by suicide all had a psychiatric illness and were not in their right minds.  When we are looking at strategies to prevent suicide and support and nurture people who feel suicidal or have attempted suicide and to help people to deal with the aftermath of suicide, what we are looking at are the stressors and motives that drove them to it and what can we do to support, help and sustain people.<br\/><br\/>I have been in the public domain with the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.  It has always struck me as interesting how Ireland and England have dealt differently with human rights.  The Irish Human Rights Commission has predominately been headed by lawyers, whereas the human rights commission in England and Wales was headed by a distinguished philosopher.  It always struck me that the discourse at the UK body was significantly different from and more nuanced than that at the Irish commission.  The decriminalisation of suicide was not intended to establish it as a human right but to destigmatise and remove any shame associated with it for the families involved and, in particular, to help those who were feeling suicidal or whose attempt at suicide had not been carried through.  There was no sense of it being a societal desire to extend access to suicide as a human right.  We have to keep this comparator all the way through.  For me this has parallels with my work with older people and is the challenge which arises from people trying to portray negativity in later life, for example, without looking at the denominator, the classic example being loneliness.  In our society loneliness peaks between the ages of 15 and 35 years, but it is constantly portrayed in the media as an attribute of later life.  While we do not want people to be lonely in later life, we must view loneliness as a denominator.  The idea that there are two types of suicide, one which we might consider appropriate and another which we would not, is a serious challenge and contradiction.  Emerson stated an unremitting consistency was the hobgoblin of a small mind.  This is not something, however, about which we are talking with unremitting consistency. <br\/><br\/>The second is issue is that of an idealised vision of unfettered autonomy.  What I find strange in this regard - there are a number of very helpful contributions in this area, including from Ms Onora O'Neill and in a recent paper from University College Dublin - is how much this vision shares with the free market, neoliberal vision of humans as creatures of autonomy, choice and control, rather than being embedded in a framework of care.  As Pellegrino says, all autonomy is exercised in the embrace of others.  Ms O'Neill speaks about the danger of seeing ourselves predominately as consumers.  When I hear this discourse, it immediately makes me think of the type of limited human being Ayn Rand, the darling of the alt-right, demonstrates.  <br\/><br\/>Medicine has advanced to the point where every patient in this country will be asked for consent.  They will not be asked to undergo what they consider to be burdensome treatment.  As I will show, there is evidence from a range of jurisdictions that the vast majority die deaths that are considered to be deaths with dignity.  The vast majority of people in nursing homes are not subject to cardiopulmonary resuscitation and do not die on ventilators.  There is compelling evidence that there is a significant move forward in advance care planning.  We have strongly encouraged this development and been part of developing an advance care planning course to train doctors.  I have written a book entitled, <i>Ageing and Caring: A Guide for Later Life<\/i>, which includes an advance care plan, entitled &quot;A Kinder Future&quot;.  Unlike some advance care plans, A Kinder Future allows people to ask for what they would like, as well as what they would not like.  One of the challenges in some of the advance directive work is that it is exclusively about not having something rather than having something.<\/p><p>As one of my colleagues  in UCD has said, operating solely from a primacy of choice logic negates the interdependencies in care relations and assumes that all patients are independent and autonomous, even at moments of high vulnerability.  There is a danger that end-of-life care is framed as abstracted rational choosers, ignoring that they are relational, emotional, and embodied human beings.  Indeed, if I have illustrated this, I hope the British Medical Journal, BMJ, review of Terry Pratchett visiting Dignitas in Switzerland has been helpful about the enormous strains that this puts on our relational elements.  To refuse care is a challenge and much of this discourse fails to recognise that we sometimes find it much harder to receive than to give.  Choice logic may also lead to the prioritisation of performance and control over compassion and care.  One of my early papers was on how we live in a hypercognitive productive society and how we have allowed ourselves be seduced by some of these tropes.  Very helpfully, one of the fathers of both modern medical humanities and modern ethics is a wonderful man called Ed Pellegrino.  He has talked about our concept, as physicians, as moderate autonomists and moderate welfarists so that we see that broader picture and the experience.  We have certainly moved away from paternalism but autonomy must be seen in a broader context and cannot be given an idealised space.  People are vulnerable and they are hurt.  One of the real worries is around the information they get and also the prejudices they may harbour about future care.  <br\/><br\/>This is most marked in younger older people.  This is a key constituency around assisted suicide in the tiny minority of jurisdictions where it is allowed.  The worry here is not so much that we impact on the disabled and the vulnerable today but we set a matrix and a paradigm where their life is considered to be less worth living.  Recently, I had to do an editorial and write for a paper from Finland which asked older people from 70 upwards who among them wanted to live to be 100.  It was like the old George Burn's joke, which is somebody who is 99.  It showed that people in their 70s were very ambivalent about later life but actually people in their 90s said yes please, give me more.  Indeed, I was at a meeting in Oslo a few years back where Norway's oldest man was present, a Mr. Falck who was 108.  When asked when he thought it was a good time to die Mr. Falck said he used to think 110 but 112 was looking better.  <br\/><br\/>We have many papers showing that people say that they would rather die than have a severe stroke.  I have been dealing with stroke for over 30 years.  We have a positive proactive compassionate appropriate development towards stroke.  In 30 years not one of our patients has chosen this pathway.  Without being a Pollyanna or a sentimentalist, what has been impressive is the resilience of patients and their families and the evolving of care networks that has brought this about.  A turning moment for me was when on the Gay Byrne radio show there was a rather controversialist general practitioner, GP, who proudly boasted of how a friend of his had a severe stroke.  The friend had said that if he ever got a severe stroke that he wanted to be given the big injection.  The day after he got a severe stroke, the GP gave him this injection.  I was horrified because I have seen people with a severe stroke turn around within 48 hours, within four weeks and within six weeks.  This prejudice against disability is enormously powerful.<br\/><br\/>This is where my medical humanities hat comes out.In popular culture, I ask the committee to turn toward &quot;Million Dollar Baby&quot;, the film with Clint Eastwood and Hilary Swank.  One could feel within the media and popular discourse a sympathy towards the euthanasia that he carried out.  However, as a carer I was horrified.  She had pressure sores.  One does not get pressure sores in good care with a paraplegic.  She was clearly clinically depressed.  She was in a horrible environment and Clint Eastwood's character could have put her into a wheelchair and brought her out to a ball game or a concert.  What we saw was mistakenly construed as some kind of a noble deed, when what we actually saw was an ignoble response to dreadful care.  One could say the same thing about Michael Haneke's most recent movie &quot;Amour&quot;.  Again, the intelligentsia very often lauded it as somehow noble.  For those who are interested I can pass on the details.  However, this was very clearly a case of poor care.  The woman had a speech problem.  When in her last moments the woman said &quot;mal&quot; those who French know that might be existential angst or it might be that she had a pain in her leg. <br\/><br\/>Our concern is that portraying certain conditions as worse than death undermines disability.  We have seen this with Joanna Trollope in England saying that she would rather die than go &quot;gaga&quot;, a horrible way of describing life for people with dementia, whose internal quality of life is generally maintained.  Katie Hopkins is somewhat similar.  However, people say that if one quotes Katie Hopkins what can one expect?  The impact of how we frame our care network and our relationship has been beautifully outlined by Susan Sontag in her <i>Illness as Metaphor<\/i>.  This was written in the 1980s when she had breast cancer.  Care for cancer then was poor.  She twigged, as a sensitive commentator on the human condition, that if we have a negative popular discourse about a condition it feeds into how we relate to it and the conditions.  She wrote  <\/p><blockquote>Illness is the night side of life, a more onerous citizenship.  Everyone who is born holds dual citizenship, in the kingdom of the well and in the kingdom of the sick....It is impossible to take up residence unprejudiced by the lurid metaphors with which this it is landscaped.<\/blockquote><p>This is all too current.  Even within the medical profession people may be blind-sided by this.  There was a recent RT&Eacute; documentary by relatively young doctors who went to the Netherlands.  I was quite horrified by one of the cases.  The justification of the assisted suicide was that the patient had a progressive dementia and she would have to be fed with a tube.  Again, I nearly hit the radio.  We know since 1999 that tube feeding in dementia is not associated with maintenance of life, or suffering of pressure sores, but actually may be worse because people reflux.  We would never have considered giving this woman a tube unless she asked for it.  Papers from Belgium and the Netherlands, and Belgium in particular around psychiatry patients, show that the sort of things that bring people towards assisted suicide in this type of set-up are very similar to those that bring them towards suicide, the suicide that we deplore, that we wish would not happen, because it robs us of some of our fellow citizens.<br\/><br\/>I come back to dignity.  It is about realising that people often talk about how undignified it is for a patient but it usually is how undignified the care setting is.  Our role as sentient, aspirational human beings is to improve care.  I was the first medical director of the Alzheimer Society of Ireland.  I have been involved with the promotion of better standards at Leas Cross.  I am very heartened by the current HSE programme about us identifying our common existential vulnerability and a common fate with people with dementia, rather that portraying it as Joanna Trollope does.<br\/><br\/>Much of the impetus for seeking assisted suicide is a complex nexus of fears over loss of locus of control.  Certainly, from the point of view of the health care professions we can reassure people that we will maximise choice and autonomy over fears that one&rsquo;s voice will not be heard, misperceptions of care paradigms, as I have spoken of several times already, occult and overt prejudice against disability and age, denial of the resilience of the human spirit in the face of adversity, and a failure to contextualise autonomy as one component of our relational framework of care and support through life.<\/p><p>Public and private discussion with regard to assisted suicide should be seen to represent concerns over adequacy of treatment and support as well as existential concerns relating to the future: these need to be proactively addressed.  To ask doctors to run counter to this by killing patients short-circuits and undermines our impetus to care, comfort and support and damages our framework of care.  Current and future patients need to be reassured that the response of the healthcare professions to distress and pain is one of compassion and care, addressing the needs at a range of levels - biological, psychological, social and spiritual - while respecting wishes to the greatest extent possible.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017112900002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Desmond O'Neill","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511946000,"counter":934,"content":"<p>I thank Professor O'Neill for a very illuminating address, and for the humour, from time to time.

I referenced Harvey Chochinov's very major study on this.  There are always elements that can be somewhat challenging.  It is very challenging to interpret how death may be.  History is written by the survivors.  One of the most illuminating pieces on the challenges of how this is viewed is by three palliative care physicians in <i>The Lancet <\/i>using Tolstoy's &quot;Death of Ivan Ilyich&quot; to say how the relatives might prioritise pain control over independence whereas the patient with the illness may prefer having some pain with a clearer mind.  They discussed how in the &quot;Death of Ivan Ilyich&quot; what Ilyich wants is for someone to sit with him and be with him.  The answer to the Deputy's question is &quot;Yes&quot;.<br\/><br\/>I have written of how one of the dangers of advocacy is that sometimes, to make our case we may overstate our case.  In the Hospice Foundation surveys, while elements of care can be found that are not satisfactory - we are dealing with human imperfection - death is largely well handled.  I find it challenging when I hear public figures say that the Irish do not talk about death because they do when the time is right.  We are also elliptical people, we often talk in metaphors and euphemisms, but we do talk about death.  I have had two conversations in the past 48 hours with people about how intense their care should be, both of whom died without either crash call or tubes.  One was 90 years, the other 87 years, and in both cases I spoke to the patient not to their relatives.  <br\/><br\/>The problem is that within human rights there are hierarchies and there are new rights which accrue around the peripheries of the core.  The problem of the right to die with dignity is that unfortunately it has been adopted as a slogan by one side on this debate as a synonym for assisted suicide.

There is a very ready recourse to as much as is required or needed.  The vast majority of deaths have been with as much comfort as possible and with dignity.   It would be folly to rule out something 100%.  All the plays of Moliere are about the folly of humans trying to cast futures into concrete, whether it is Tartuffe building up religious credits or the miser building up financial credits.  There will always be degrees of suffering.  Death is a time of grief and people will come away from it with a range of emotions.  Death in Ireland is among the best in the world that is possible.  Palliative care is reaching further in all corners of care as well as in training of medical and nursing students.  There can be an over-emphasis on doctors but there are many others involved in the healthcare system.  When my own father was dying in hospital, the charm and care of the healthcare attendants was hugely important.  During their courses, they are exposed to how we deal with death.

I have been involved in a public debate with it over its stance which I consider to be injudicious.  We talk in health care ethics about legalisms.  I am always very concerned when one puts health care ethics and law together in one course.  Health care ethics is about a broad, complex sense of what the issues may be, whereas, in legal terms, particularly regarding precedent, there tends to be a black and white decision, a dichotomous decision.  One of our concerns about medical students and trainees is that when in doubt, if they do not have enough ethical formation to be comfortable with the degree of uncertainty, they will resort to legalisms, which involves asking what the law states.  We know that the law can be unethical.  One of the simple examples I use is that in all 50 US states the reporting of elder abuse was made mandatory in a misguided attempt to do right.  It actually turned out to be a complete own goal and a negative because, as I know from chairing the Government working group on elder abuse, older people have a right to decide whether they want their cases to be investigated.  If an elderly person had a son with a drug dependency who was taking some of his or her pension and the result of an investigation would be a breaking up of the relationship which older people are smart enough to see, he or she might refuse it.  This may seem like a trivial case, but it points to a really important issue.  Although the Oireachtas is a place where laws are formed, I hope it has a strong sense of looking, in a deeper sense, at where philosophy and ethics fit in and realises the laws will fit with philosophy and ethics rather than the other way around.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017112900002#H01000","nonspeaker":"Professor Desmond O'Neill"},{"type":"speech","time":1511946000,"counter":954,"content":"<p>I thank Professor O'Neill for his excellent and thought-provoking presentation.

To deny a person access, knowingly or unknowingly, to the appropriate type of care, like Clint Eastwood in &quot;Million Dollar Baby&quot; or the husband in &quot;Amour&quot;, is potentially abusive.

We know that if one drinks no alcohol or lots of alcohol, one is more likely to have heart disease.  Should we, therefore, tell those who do not drink alcohol to start doing so?  The answer is \"No\" because we know that in doing so it is almost certain that we would generate alcohol dependency and misery.  The answer to the first question is that the cost of providing such reassurance is effective implementation of assisted suicide.  The question is when does one discuss with someone who has multiple sclerosis what death will be like.  This may prompt a discussion among certain people, a checklist which asks, \"Which of these matters would you like to discuss?\", or a more proactive way of discussing the matter.  I have seen many people with multiple sclerosis die, nearly always comfortably.  There is distress around death, and one cannot separate that out.  The answer is that it would be burning down one's house to save the dog kennel.<\/p> <p>  Palliative care sedation is very well teased out in the literature.  The number one point is that this was presumably discussed with Senator Black's late mother and father and they gave consent to taking morphine.  As part of the package of care, the primary aim is to reduce pain.  There is no strong sense of this unduly hastening death above and beyond the disease processes that carry on otherwise.  It is possible it has a role in it.  However, its aim is not to do that; its aim is to make one comfortable with one's consent.<\/p> <p>  The greatest abuse is the erosion of our sense of humans despite whatever vulnerability we have, of our sense as relational beings who have a relation to one another and care for one another.

The most recent prizes in economics have been awarded in the field of neuro-economics, which shows that although we prize the rational - of course it is important and it is the pinnacle of many of our achievements - many of our decisions are made on the basis of relations and emotions.

I might add a few more comments as we go along.<\/p> <p>  I will state my position at the outset.  I am cautiously in favour of legalisation of medical assistance in dying.  I empathise with many of Professor O'Neill's concerns about vulnerable people, the elderly, the disabled and people feeling coerced, perhaps, by family pressures and economic pressures.  However, I would answer many of the questions that were asked earlier in a different way.  I am a philosopher by trade and I have professional training in clinical ethics.  That is my background.<\/p> <p>  Voluntary euthanasia is a deliberate act undertaken with the intention of ending the life of another person at his or her request.  Assisted suicide is the act of intentionally providing another person with the knowledge or means to end his or her life at his or her request.  The motivation for both is to end the suffering of the individual at his or her request.  The term \"assisted dying\" is the term I will use.  It is generally considered preferable because it avoids negative or stigmatising connotations associated with suicide.  Assisted suicide, as such, is legal in the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Canada, the US states of Oregon, Washington, Vermont, California, Montana and Colorado, and Washington DC.<\/p><p>Euthanasia is legal in Belgium, the Netherlands, Colombia and Canada and a number of other jurisdictions are currently debating the permissibility of legalising medical aid in dying.  Any legislature which concerns itself with this issue should consider the following seven points.<\/p><p> First, the capacity for autonomy or self-determination is a core value in the liberal political tradition and it is regarded as one of unenumerated constitutional rights of citizens in many jurisdictions, including Ireland.  Contemporary clinical practice places increasing emphasis on a patient's right to make and execute decisions based on his or her values and beliefs, including decisions which go against the patient's medical best interests and which may result in death.  Proponents of assisted dying argue that autonomous patients who are suffering intolerably and wish to control the manner and timing of their death should be supported in doing so.  Some argue that the right to request a hastened death is a logical extension of the existing right to refuse life prolonging treatment.  Autonomy should not be reduced to unfettered choice.  Properly defined, autonomy refers to a person's interest in making and acting on choices of momentous significance in that person's life according to that person's most cherished values and beliefs.  It is not just about having a range of choices and choosing between them.  The idea of relational autonomy reinforces that.<\/p><p> Second, legalised assisted dying is premised on a perceived duty to help end the suffering of patients who are experiencing physical or psychological pain which is intolerable for them and which cannot be alleviated.  Some jurisdictions restrict the right to request medical assistance in dying to patients who have a terminal illness or a prognosis of six months or less.  Other jurisdictions take a broader view of the nature of suffering and allow patients with conditions which will not end their lives within a specific period of time to request a hastened death.  This includes patients with serious mental illnesses who have decision making capacity.<\/p><p> Third, for many individual health care professionals and professional organisations deliberately ending a patient's life at that patient's request involves abandoning the core values of medicine - healing, compassion, empathy and preserving life.  Opponents of assisting dying argue that incorporating the prescription or administration of lethal medication into the practice of medicine will irrevocably alter the culture of medicine and destroy public trust in the medical profession.  Palliative care providers, in particular, maintain that timely, effective and accessible palliative care support can reduce or eliminate demand for assisted dying.  There is a genuine concern among palliative care providers and organisations that legalisation of assisted dying has the potential to stunt the development of palliative care provision and undermine the culture of palliative care.<\/p><p> Fourth, against this advocates of assisted dying argue that the suffering of some patients cannot be relieved by even the most effective palliative measures.  Even where high quality palliative services exist, it must be recognised, first, that not all physical suffering can be alleviated by pain medication and, second, that not all suffering can be reduced to physical pain.  In fact, most people who request assistance in dying do not do so because they are motivated by pain.  Existential suffering is distinct from physical pain and may incorporate elements of anxiety, hopelessness and depression as well as fear of what the future holds.  In the 2,300 years since the hippocratic oath was written, the values of medicine have evolved and the relief of suffering is now central to the practice of medicine.  This evolution is reflected in medical practices which generate ongoing controversy.<\/p><p> Doctors are permitted by law to withhold or withdraw non-beneficial life prolonging treatment, thereby allowing patients to die.  Doctors are also permitted by law to administer medications as a last resort to alleviate refractory pain or distress even though the administration of certain medications may foreseeably render the patient unconscious until death occurs or, if inappropriately administered, may have the unintended effect of shortening the patient's life.  These practices are very controversial.  Advocates of assisted dying point to the difficulty of drawing a clear line between these practices, on the one hand, and the deliberate administration of medication to end a patient's life on the other.  This position is vigorously opposed by providers of palliative care, who maintain that a clear line can be drawn.  More clarity and transparency are needed around these practices in all jurisdictions and more guidelines are needed to inform practice.<\/p><p> Fifth, opponents of medical assistance in dying argue that while legalisation may benefit a relatively small number of patients who have the resources and the capacity to advocate for their rights, it poses a threat to those who are less autonomous and more dependent on others, such as the elderly, people living with dementia and mental illness and people with disabilities, among others.  Almost all organisations that advocate for disability rights oppose the legalisation of assisted dying on the grounds that it would have a disproportionate effect on persons with disability and would reinforce existing prejudices about disability.  We heard about this in the earlier presentation.<\/p><p> Sixth, data from the Netherlands, Belgium, Oregon and Washington, the jurisdictions in which there is a longer history of assisted dying, suggest that the practice of assisted dying operates within its intended limits and is not utilised disproportionately by vulnerable persons.  However, critics of the practice raise questions about the adequacy of existing safeguards to protect patients with dementia or mental illness, particularly depression and mood disorders which may compromise capacity for making decisions to end their lives.  Certainly, greater oversight is needed to ensure that the rights of these vulnerable patients are not violated.  Any recourse to data is problematic, as I said in my main submission, because data is always approached from the perspective of the interpreter.  Different people on opposing sides of the debate can look at the same data and choose to emphasise different aspects of it to support their views.  Epistemologically, we cannot simply rely on data.  This is a value laden debate and the values of those on both sides are central to how it evolves.<\/p><p> Finally, the most crucial aspect of this debate, in my view, is that it focuses attention on the need to improve care for people with disabilities, mental health issues and dementia, in particular, to ensure they do not request assistance in dying as a result of a lack of proper community and other supports in jurisdictions in which this process is legal.  This applies to all jurisdictions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017112900002#K01000","nonspeaker":"Dr. Louise Campbell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511946000,"counter":970,"content":"<p>Thank you for that focused opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017112900002#L00200","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1511946000,"counter":971,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Campbell for attending the meeting.

Dr. Campbell indicated at the outset that the origins of the debate by people who propose and promote assisted suicide can be viewed in the context of the development of the liberal tradition and of the autonomous individual.  Obviously the state interfered with individuals' rights for too long.  We have seen that in Ireland and how that has developed.

Persons who commit suicide are very often individuals who have fallen through the net of care, who do not have social supports or who have not tried to access social or clinical supports, whereas persons requesting suicide or assisted dying have made that request as a last resort.  That is one of the conditions in many of the jurisdictions in which assisted suicide is legal.  The person's suffering is intractable and their physical and psychological or existential suffering cannot be relieved.  They have been psychologically assessed for the most part.

They have attempted to access support and that support has not resulted in palliation of their symptoms, so they are requesting a further step as a last resort.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017112900002#N00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Louise Campbell"},{"type":"speech","time":1511946000,"counter":1016,"content":"<p>Dr. Campbell has mentioned that she wants a properly regulated system with genuine oversight and robust safeguards that outweigh the risk of harm to vulnerable persons.

Its most recent report, from 2016, summarises the data from 1997 to 2016, which is 19 years of data.  It maintains that there is no greater threat to vulnerable persons than there is to any other member of society from the legalisation of this regime.  However, the US jurisdictions do not allow anybody diagnosed with a psychiatric illness to avail of this service.<\/p> <p>  I believe we should look not at the North American situation but, rather, at the European situation.  There is a long tradition in Luxembourg of allowing patients who are suffering unbearably, both for physical and psychological reasons, to avail of this practice.  We can look at the documents published, in English, by the regional euthanasia committees in the Netherlands.  The Belgian data is much harder to access.  Much of the Dutch data is accessible, but not all of it is translated.  A report is published every year which looks at examples of several cases.  The cases are discussed in some detail, and if the cases are read carefully it is obvious that due diligence has been done in those situations where they claim that the due care criteria, under the law, have been met.  The description of these cases is actually ethical rather than medico-legal in nature.  Issues such as competence and the patient's values, wishes and prior expressed wishes are discussed, all of which have a fundamental bearing on an ethical discussion of what is right or wrong in these circumstances.  Other cases are described as not meeting the due care criteria.  There are only a few such cases; I believe there were ten in 2016 altogether.  They did not meet the due care criteria largely because procedural requirements were not met, rather than the substantive requirements.<\/p> <p>  If one scrutinises this data and looks at the code of practice for practitioners providing this service, one gets a sense that it is well thought out and that every attempt is made to carry out due diligence.  I am considering the increase in provision of this service to persons with psychiatric illnesses in both Belgium and the Netherlands.  That is a very serious concern.  On the whole, however, the published reports - certainly in the Netherlands - seem to indicate that due diligence is being carried out.  Any system is open to abuse but there seems to be quite a lot of oversight in this system.  The cases are looked at in detail and the five regional euthanasia committees are asked to report back on any concerns.  It is said that 80% of the cases are straightforward; the mandatory notification procedure is met and the documentation is adequate.  However, in 20% of cases the physician is called and questioned to confirm that the due care criteria was met and the code of practice was complied with.  I do not think it is perfect but due diligence is being done.  I would be satisfied that, with continuous tweaks and small improvements, abuse of vulnerable persons could be reduced to a minimum.  I do not think it will ever be eliminated.  There will always be unscrupulous doctors, as there are unscrupulous members of every profession.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017112900002#N01000","nonspeaker":"Dr. Louise Campbell"},{"type":"speech","time":1511946000,"counter":1018,"content":"<p>A concern of our next witness,  who is from Disability Action Northern Ireland, is that the stringent controls that would need to be put in place for the legalisation of assisted suicide would ultimately force the individual to forego his or her choice.

One is disproportionate impact.  I am not sure if that is what the Deputy was referring to in the first part of the statement he cited, namely, that persons with disabilities will be disproportionately impacted upon, not just by legislation or because of their disabilities but as a result of the fact that they often have multiple disadvantages.  They might live in poverty, subject to a feeling that they are a burden to their families, or they might self-stigmatise their disability on the basis of the kind of stigmatisation and negative attitudes about disability that exist in society.  They may feel lonely or isolated.  There is a plethora of reasons why people with disability have multiple vulnerabilities.<\/p> <p>  The other reason that disability rights organisations oppose this legislation is that they conjecture that it will reinforce existing negative attitudes about disability because many of the people who request assisted dying - 97% in Europe and 100% in North America - cite reasons for requesting assisted dying as loss of dignity, mobility and freedom and an inability to carry out personal activities of daily living and daily care.<\/p><p>The people who are requesting assisted suicide services describe these impairments as undignified, humiliating and demeaning.  Disability rights groups are rightly antagonised by such descriptions because they often apply to daily life for those with chronic disabilities.  We have to be very careful about everything we say about disability because there is so much stigma attached to it and so many unconscious negative biases in society towards people with disabilities.  Something must be done to address those negative attitudes.  Just because a person requests assistance in dying, having acquired a disability or a condition which impairs him or her, does not mean that he or she is, at the same time, devaluing or making a judgement about the life of someone with a disability.  Individuals with a disability may be very resilient, having learned to live and cope with their disability.  They may not be very happy all of the time but they may be well able to deal with their disability.  It is not the case that the person who is requesting assistance in dying on the grounds of the same functional impairments is making a value judgment about the life of a person with a disability.  There are two separate ways of enacting autonomy.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017112900002#N01200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Louise Campbell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511946000,"counter":1021,"content":"<p>My final question centres on the contribution by Dr. Regina McQuillan last week.

One can have palliative care provision and legalised assisted dying operating in parallel and sometimes symbiotically within the same jurisdiction.  They share similar goals, despite massive disagreement between the two approaches to intractable suffering at the end of life.  The Belgians increased their funding for palliative care by 108% between 2003 and 2010.  Most of that funding went into home palliative care, at approximately 70%.  The overall health budget, by comparison, only increased by 2.34%.  There was a massive increase in funding.  At the same time as the introduction of the Belgian Act on Euthanasia in 2002, a companion Act was introduced to give every Belgian citizen the right to access quality palliative care.<\/p> <p>  The palliative care discipline is growing in all jurisdictions.

If I remember correctly, the medical team was saying that the machines should be switched off because he was going to die anyway but his family kept saying \"No\".

There is not enough research on this.  It is a really important question because families can influence patients in all sorts of ways in terms of end of life decisions and for all sorts of reasons, not all of which are necessarily benign.  In the situation described by Senator Black, the patient's family was opposing the proposal to discontinue treatment.  The patient was effectively in a coma for many months.  Statistically, the chances of coming out of a situation like that are something like one in a million.  The request of the family was to prolong the treatment in the hope that he would recover and he did, which does not happen in most cases.  This is a slightly different issue in that the treatment is intervening to keep the person alive until he or she putatively recovers but in a lot of cases, there is no chance of recovery.  That is a medical judgment with some values built into it.  The family has a role and can influence treatment.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the available data on assisted dying, a study in Washington State found that approximately 30% of patients did not tell their families that they were going to avail of assisted dying.

If the child is an emancipated minor and judged to have capacity, his or her decision may stand.  However,  it is very difficult with this cohort because they might not have the emotional maturity to appreciate the foreseeable consequences of the decision.  That is the worry with children.  They might have the intellectual capacity but not the emotional maturity.  In the Netherlands, parental agreement has to be secured for minors aged between 12 and 16.  The parents effectively make the decision, but with due attention to the child's wishes, as with other medical treatments.  According to the regional committee report, one minor was assisted to die in 2016.<\/p><p>There are a tiny number of such cases which are very carefully scrutinised.  In Belgium there is no lower age limit which is a cause for concern across jurisdictions.  It is simple for a jurisdiction to state its age limit, for example, is 18 years, as they do in the United States and North American jurisdictions.  There are ethical issues in providing for euthanasia in the case of minors, but it is carefully regulated and not about a child making a decision with which his or her parents are forced to comply.  They are active decision makers in all cases involving minors.  I mean no disrespect to anybody with a disability, but there are some children who will grow up enduring continuing pain, have an inability to interact with anybody in their environment and could require 24-hours-a-day care and it is justifiable to make a judgment on quality of life in such cases.<\/p><p> There is no such thing as a simple example; they are all multifactorial cases.  The regional euthanasia committees publish annual reports which are worth looking at.  They show that approximately 6,081 persons were assisted to die in the Netherlands in 2016, one of whom was a minor.  They give samples of cases that meet the due care criteria.  There is a one-page description of each case and practically all of the cases involve very debilitating physical illnesses.  Between 75% and 77% of requests come from patients with cancer which in some cases has progressed to metastases and the patients have constant dyspnea, nausea, pain and difficulty in breathing.  They might not be able to perform the activities of daily living and become preoccupied with the increasing pain they will face in the future.  They do not only have physical concerns but also concerns about losing all control of bodily functions.  People with ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease or motor neurone disease and neuromuscular diseases can be very concerned about losing all of their physical ability and being entirely dependent on others.  It is for the individual to decide on the quality and value of his or her own life.  Some people like Simon Fitzmaurice can tolerate this level of disability and do amazing things right up until the end of their lives, while others cannot bear the thought of a future of further debilitation and dependency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017112900002#O01100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Louise Campbell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511946000,"counter":1032,"content":"<p>In Dr. Campbell's submission she describes the underlying changes in the societal understanding and appreciation of these issues.

I am not generally a friend of the blunt and bald statement, but I was not implying that the shift included an endorsement of the doctor's role in assisting patients to die.  I should have been a little more circumspect in what I wrote in that section.  However, there undeniably has been a shift in the way we regard the role of medicine at the end of patients' lives.  In 1995-96, in a case involving a ward of court, a family had to take a hospital to court to have ventilatory support for their daughter removed after 22 or 23 years.  The guide to professional conduct and ethics for registered medical practitioners now emphasises that a doctor is under no obligation to provide treatment which is clinically judged to be futile, burdensome or disproportionate.  In the 20 years since the court case there has been an evolution in what a doctor can and cannot do on the issue of allowing a patient to die.  This evolution has taken longer in some jurisdictions than others.  North America is an example.  There was a belief the healing role of a doctor was to keep patients alive.  Since the advent of palliative care we have a different, more nuanced understanding of the role of the doctor and medicine in general.  It is now not just to heal or provide curative treatment but also to promote health and relieve suffering.  Allowing a person to die at his or her request by removing ventilatory support was anathema to medical professionals 50 or 60 years ago and this was the attitude in Ireland even more recently.  It is now an accepted part of the role of a doctor to seek a patient's consent based on his or her understanding of the value of his or her life, whatever the condition or the treatment for it.  <\/p> <p>  Does that answer the question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017112900002#P00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Louise Campbell"},{"type":"speech","time":1511946000,"counter":1034,"content":"<p>It does, but I would like to tease it out more.

I have an awful cough so if I start coughing and sputtering, please excuse me. <br\/><br\/>We know that the matter under discussion is a highly sensitive topic.  We understand that the committee is looking at what is happening in other jurisdictions in relation to the right to die with dignity.  I will tell the committee a little about Disability Action for those who are not familiar with it.  Disability Action is an organisation which has been working with people with disabilities in Northern Ireland for over 30 years.  We are a human rights based organisation and our work is underpinned by our own charter of rights and the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  We are a campaigning organisation and we work to bring about change and influence policy to ensure that disabled people are not disadvantaged in society and can make valuable and valued contributions.  I am not a medical expert, a lawyer or an academic.  I worked with disabled people and our members to produce a position paper on the issue.  It only relates to Northern Ireland and we have not consulted or engaged with disabled people outside the jurisdiction on the issue.<br\/><br\/>There has been significant debate in the UK on the issue of assisted dying.  I will use the terminology of &quot;assisting dying&quot; since that is what we used in our paper.  In 2010, we produced a paper which set out our position on it.  In the years running up to this, the subject of assisted dying and the right to die had been debated significantly in the media.  Legislation had been proposed and individuals had sought clarification on the workings of the current law through appeals to the House of Lords.  A consultation was undertaken by the Public Prosecution Service for new guidance for prosecutors under the current law.  There were key issues that we felt needed to be considered and debated with disabled people and their organisations to take a position on it.  I will go through some of the process and I am happy to take questions.<br\/><br\/>Lord Joffe attempted to bring legislation through the House of Lords in 2004, specifically regarding assisted dying for people who were terminally ill.  That was the language used in the Bill.  A particular concern was the definition of terminal illness in it, including terms such as &quot;is inevitably progressive&quot; and &quot;cannot be reversed through treatment&quot;.  Disabled people strongly felt that could be them even though they did not deem themselves to be terminally ill and that it was based on the medical model and not the social model of disability.  That Bill was defeated in the House of Lords in 2006.  There was a free vote in the House of Lords in 2009 on an amendment to the Coroners and Justice Bill which was defeated.  The amendment would have removed the threat of prosecution from those who go abroad to help an assisted suicide.  The House of Lords judgment in Purdy <i>v.<\/i>Director of Public Prosecutions led to the Director of Public Prosecutions in Northern Ireland preparing an interim policy that went out for consultation.  We responded to that and there were key concerns about proposed changes.<br\/><br\/>I will address the implications of the debate for disabled people.  While it is unlawful in the UK for someone to assist someone to die, there are few if any prosecutions.  People felt that whatever the reason for that, any law that is meant to protect vulnerable people in society is weakened by its lack of application.  There are questions around the terminology &quot;right to die&quot;.  In UK and international human rights law, there is no right to die.  However, there is the right to life, one of the most fundamental rights that we have.  People felt that talking about the right to die erodes the fundamental right to life that can be applied to ensure that all people are able to live with dignity and respect for their choices.  There needs to be a clear distinction between someone wanting to end his or her life because he or she is terminally ill and wanting control over the implementation of that decision and a person who wants to end his or her life because of the effects of disability.  Fundamentally, people thought that, as a society, we must ask ourselves if someone taking his or her own life because he or she has a disability is any different from someone taking his or her own life if he or she is not disabled.  Do we as a society accept it more because it is a person with a disability who has ended his or her own life rather than someone without a disability?  It is an increasingly complex debate but disabled people argue that society's acceptance of disabled people's deaths is a result of the negative and stereotypical attitudes which see disabled people as passive and non-contributing.  If we give this message out to society, are we truly saying that a disabled person has less right to life than a non-disabled person?<br\/><br\/>We asked if legislation needs to change.  People with certain medical conditions have firmly indicated that they want to make the choice and to have control over how they end their lives.  These are often individuals with progressive conditions who fear that they may have to end their lives sooner than they would otherwise choose to ensure that they are in control of the decision and how and when it is implemented.  They want some protection for their loved ones who may want to assist them at a later stage and who may be open to prosecution under the current law.  Disabled people told us and are concerned that, when one looks at the detail, the medical profession makes decisions on treatment based on how it perceives the individual's quality of life.  The overwhelming response from disabled people was to ask how anyone, other than the individual, can make that decision.<br\/><br\/>We took a clear policy position in 2010, which has not changed since, that we are opposed to the legalisation of assisted dying.  While we believe that people should have the right to choice and control in their lives, we believe that changing the law for a small number of people would have much wider repercussions on how society values disabled people.  The stringent controls that would need to be put in place for the legalisation of assisted suicide would ultimately force the individual to forgo his or her choice.  It is not a position on which we have been challenged and it is as applicable today as it was then.  The debate continues and as the committee will probably be aware, there have been other attempts to bring in legislation, mostly through the House of Lords.  Until society values disabled people as fully contributing members of our society then it is unlikely our position will change.  We believe that the risks are just too high.

Many people we are working with who are involved in this are disabled people who are not in a palliative care pathway at all.  The care and support to live independently is key to them because without that care and support to live independently, life can become difficult.  It is not just about palliative care, but the care all around that.<\/p> <p>  What came out of our engagement was the big concern about medical professionals being the decision makers.  If one looks at the different Bills, including Lord Joffe's Bill, they refer to medical professionals.  That is a case of medical professionals again making a judgment on a disabled person's quality of life.  That was quite concerning because people had come up against medical professionals who deemed their quality of life in a different way from how they perceived it as individuals with a disability.  A practical example of that is when we see \"do not resuscitate\" orders.  We as an advocacy organisation have made challenges to \"do not resuscitate\" orders that have been put on a disabled person's file without consultation with that person.<\/p><p>An example comes to mind where the term, \"This person has a learning disability\", was included in the reasoning for putting a DNR on someone's file.  That person had been diagnosed with cancer.  The medical professional had attached a value to that disabled person's life.  The DNR order was not the person's will or preference.  However, the decision was made because he or she was not deemed to have capacity.  We knew from our work with the person beforehand that the person's preference was to continue with treatment.  That is a practical example.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017112900002#Q00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Karen Hall","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511946000,"counter":1043,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Hall.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017112900002#R00200","speaker":"1255"},{"type":"speech","time":1511946000,"counter":1044,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Hall for attending.

First, I apologise for the absence of our president, Mr. Joe Healy, who is in Brussels on important business to do with Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, reform.  Unfortunately, he could not make it, but we will proceed.  I am chairman of the IFA national hill committee.  Padraic Joyce is the Connacht regional chairman and Gerry Gunning is the IFA rural development executive.<\/p> <p>  The IFA welcomes the proposed Heritage Bill put forward by the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Humphreys.  We, as farmers, understand that hedgerows and uplands are an important source of biodiversity.  The IFA has sought the introduction of necessary flexibilities to allow farmers manage hedgerows and uplands properly.<\/p> <p>  An anomaly exists whereby hedge cutting and gorse burning restrictions imposed on farmers in the Republic of Ireland are broadly out of line with restrictions imposed in other similar climatic regions, including Northern Ireland, Scotland, England and Wales.  The gorse burning restrictions in the Republic of Ireland impact on the amount of available grazing land and the general competitiveness of the sector.  In other words, they contribute to make vast areas of upland areas ineligible for single farm payments.<\/p> <p>  The excessive closed period for hedge cutting impacts on road safety for pedestrians and motorists.  This is a point accepted by the Road Safety Authority.  It also leads to farm safety concerns, with hedge cutting works being confined to a time of the year when daylight is declining.  In addition, the timeframe to cut hedgerows on wet land is often limited, as it can be restricted due to soil conditions.  That is particularly the case in certain sections of the country where ground conditions may not allow it to happen during the legal cutting time.  The timeframe available to cut hedgerows on winter tillage farms is severely restricted, as the period of time where fields have no growing crops is limited.<\/p><p>To address the issue of sustainable use and management of our uplands, the IFA supports the Bill on gorse burning for several reasons.<\/p><p> The dates for the burning season must be brought back in line with the UK and Northern Ireland.  This is necessary as the region encompassing Ireland and Britain has the same type of climate and environmental challenges.  Table 1 shows that burning is permitted in all areas in Scotland from 1 October until 15 April, inclusive, and the dates can be extended to 30 April under the authority of the land owner.  In England, burning is allowed from 1 October until 15 April in upland areas and from 1 November to 31 March in lowlands and elsewhere.  In Wales the dates are 1 October until 30 March in the uplands and the dates for lowlands and elsewhere are 1 November to 15 March.  In Northern Ireland, all areas are covered from 1 September to 14 April.  However, the dates for all areas in the Republic are 1 September to 28 or 29 February.  There is a vast difference.  Traditionally, burning was carried out in upland areas in the spring when the old vegetation had died down and was suitable for burning.  We cannot do that now because in upland areas the land and gorse is not dry enough at the specified time of year.  It is only in very exceptional circumstances that it can be burned.<\/p><p> Hill land management is supported through agri-environment schemes such as GLAS, GLAS+ or the locally led agri-environment scheme in the rural development plan for 2014 to 2020.  The commonage management plans, which are an integral part of the GLAS scheme, should involve a burning period much longer than currently exists.  Co-ordinated management practices are essential for good hill land management.  Through the management of hill land, the IFA believes that local burning management groups should be established to ensure that maximum advantage is achieved through a longer burning period.  Farmers need the necessary research to back up their management practices as well as the necessary supports for hill farming.  Burning is a vital management tool to ensure that land is not overgrown and abandoned as a result.  That is becoming a major problem.<\/p><p> There are more and more abandoned upland areas because of the restrictive burning dates currently in place, which were introduced in 2000.  I am a member of the Wicklow uplands council which has campaigned continually since then to try to change the burning dates.  The council encompasses all representative groups, all of which have supported the extension of the burning dates.  We carried out a number of studies two years ago.  Last February, we did a burning workshop which was very successful.  We want to try to show people it can be done very successfully and in a managed way to ensure there are not huge overburns such as happened in parts of the west and north west of Ireland earlier this summer.<\/p><p> In the context of the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, keeping land eligible for EU payments is vital as sustaining farming is a major challenge in marginal land areas.  The Bill is an opportunity to bring the burning dates in Ireland broadly in line with the UK and Northern Ireland.  What is proposed will not be quite as long as is allowed in Northern Ireland, but at least it is one month longer than what we have at the moment.  This will assist efforts to address uncontrolled wildfires which are common and a serious fire risk to forestry plantations, and uncontrolled vegetation, that is, tall heather and gorse which pose a threat to public safety, public and private property, including forestry, as well as impacting on recreational tourism.<\/p><p> Farmers are seeing increasing numbers of wild deer grazing on lowland pastures.  They are coming down from the highlands to lowland pastures because the vegetation has become too scrubby and rough and is no longer palatable.  In my county, Wicklow, it has become a major issue.  Deer are now seen by farmers as a plague rather than what they should be seen as.  I would now like to ask Padraic Joyce to outline to the committee the IFA's position on hedge cutting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22017112900002#E01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Dunne","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1511962200,"counter":1079,"content":"<p>The IFA supports the Bill because nesting now occurs far earlier in the year due to climate change.  August is a busy time for farmers, who exit onto roads and have to deal with hedges which have not been cut and are far out on the roads.  A tractor coming onto such roads is a danger to the people passing and the tractor driver.  Many fields are overgrown and farmers will find it difficult to work in them.<\/p> <p>  August is a month during which we pride ourselves on tourism.  Briars make it difficult for people to walk and cycle on roads.  Tour buses can meet on secondary roads which creates difficulties.  Waterlogged fields affect winter cutting and makes it very difficult.  From 15 August this year, in my area farmers could not enter such fields to do any work, a situation which continues.  Even if they chance entering such fields now, there is a danger to tractor drivers and others more generally.  They cannot get work done at present.  Hilly land is more dangerous, especially when wet.  When machines used for hedge cutting exit onto roads from fields, they bring mud with them which creates another danger on the road.<\/p> <p>  Overgrown hedges are another problem for farmers.  It is easier for people to carry out fly tipping in such hedges.  If people come from urban areas and discard waste, which is very easy to do in cases where hedges have not been cut, farmers are responsible.  I came before the committee some time ago and heard a member refer to manicured hedges.  Farmers want an opportunity to cut hedges and leave them in a good way to grow for the following season.  Nesting is much easier in the following season if the hedges have been cut and properly maintained.  Local authorities and land owners have to identify the dangers which occur due to overgrown hedges.  I again thank the Chairman and members of the committee for inviting us to address them today.

As the national president of the Irish Natura and Hill Farmers Association, and on behalf of the farmers it represents, Mr. Joe Condon and I wish to make a number of observations and recommendations on the decisions taken by the Houses of the Oireachtas to introduce on a pilot basis legislation to extend the Wildlife Act 1976.  The amendments appear in section 3, and refer to controlled burning in March and the maintenance of hedgerows in August.<\/p><p>As custodians of the countryside, we endeavour to farm our lands in an environmentally friendly way and to do that requires an understanding by all stakeholders, including legislators, of ongoing difficulties experienced on the ground particularly the challenges of calendar farming that into the future will no doubt necessitate continued monitoring by everyone.<\/p><p> Amendment 8(1) to extend the burning date to include the month of March is a necessary and practical proposal and brings the burning season closer in line with our nearest neighbours.  In Northern Ireland the burning dates are from 1 September to 14 April; in Scotland they are from 1 October to 15 April; in England they are from 1 October to15 April; and in Wales they are, likewise, from 1 October to 31 March.<\/p><p> In my younger days it was traditional good practice to burn during the month of March, when ground conditions were drying out sufficiently to carry out a controlled burn of areas of mature vegetation earmarked for rejuvenation.  Controlled burning of mature upland vegetation is an accepted agricultural activity in maintaining an agricultural area in a state suitable for grazing or cultivation, in the same way that fallow land is eligible in arable land and lowland that has been burnt off with glysophate.  The guidelines for glysophate is to allow two weeks before cultivation which is about the same length of time it takes for burned land to begin to rejuvenate.<\/p><p> In the introduction, I made reference to the challenges of calendar farming and there is little doubt that the weather pattern of our seasons is changing.  For the last 15 years the only two years that were suitable for a controlled burn within the existing burning dates were 2003 and 2013.  I carried out a successful burn on both occasions having gained permission from the relevant authorities.  If this weather trend were to continue or to worsen, then the reality is that there may not be an opportunity to carry out a controlled burn before 2030.  The inability of landowners to manage these areas on an annual basis has led to uncontrolled wild fires during the closed season which is both an ecological and environmental disaster, destroying the breeding season of ground nesting birds and exposure of innocent landowners to cuts in farm payments.  A number of questions need to be answered during this session.  Have numbers of ground nesting bird populations increased since the Wildlife Act 1976 excluded the month of March for burning or have they declined?  Why have farm payments been withheld from innocent farmers who had lands burned in 2017 beyond their control and without their knowledge?  That is happening as we speak.<\/p><p> While I understand that any further extension to the two-year trial period would need approval by both Houses of the Oireachtas, continued monitoring at farm level needs to be documented.  The INHFA suggest that moving the dates closer to those of our nearest neighbours is sensible.  As a practical solution that would include leaving the month of September closed for burning and including the month of March.  Invariably, the month of September is not suitable for burning.  There is too much green and too much growth in September.  Moving the entire calendar by a month could be a sensible proposal going forward, in line with 1 October to 31 March.  Also, it would be a help if this committee would advise the competent authority, namely, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, DAFM, that no administrative penalty shall be imposed on farmer applicants to schemes where the applicants can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the competent authority, the DAFM, that they are not at fault for the non-compliance or where the competent authority is satisfied that the persons concerned are not at fault in a situation where lands are burned on an applicant without their knowledge or consent.  We received a number of calls to our national office from farmers who have received no payments because their lands were burned without their knowledge.  Something must be done urgently for them.<\/p><p> The inclusion of the month of August for hedge cutting, again needs close monitoring to ensure that both the wildlife contained within our precious hedgerows are preserved while catering for the concerns of the landowner.  Again, changing weather conditions and its effect on our seasons is influencing breeding patterns for occupiers of our hedgerows but also affects the farmers' ability to carry out routine hedgerow maintenance.<\/p><p> In 2017 the month of September proved too wet for many landowners to carry heavy hedge cutting machinery and risked soil erosion and compaction of the soil.  The situation has not improved since with heavy rainfall still the dominant weather pattern.  My experience is that where hedgerows are maintained on an annual basis it can be done without disturbance to the wildlife contained within the heart of the hedge as cutting is a manicure of the annual growth, that is, it only involves cutting the sides and top of the hedge.  Overgrown, badly maintained hedgerows will benefit from August cutting, where it may require three or four runs of the hedge cutter to get it under control.  In such cases ground conditions are more suitable earlier in the autumn.<\/p><p> The INHFA proposes that during future discussion on whether the month of August would be part of an extension to legislation it should look at a compromise solution to ensure all aspects are considered.  Part of that compromise could be to include the dates from 1 August to 15 August as closed season, thus giving the first 15 days of August as a timeframe for any delayed breeding within the hedgerows to fledge.  Opening up the hedge cutting season from the 16 August onwards would allow the landowner the opportunity to carry out remedial works while weather conditions are favourable.  As has been pointed out, once 15 August arrives things start to deteriorate.  Thank you, Chairman.  We look forward to being involved in the discussion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22017112900002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm O'Donnell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511962200,"counter":1083,"content":"<p>Gabhaim mo bhu&iacute;ochas le Mr. O'Donnell.

The Irish Wildlife Trust, IWT, is a non-governmental charitable organisation which was founded in 1979 with the goal of raising awareness of the importance of our natural heritage.  We have approximately 3,000 members.  We have been vocal in our concerns regarding changes to the Wildlife Act, via the Heritage Bill, and in particular with respect to proposed changes to permitted dates for hedge cutting and burning of vegetation.  Both of these initiatives are potentially destructive to wildlife, but for very different reasons, and therefore need to be debated as entirely separate issues.<\/p> <p>  First, I will deal with hedge cutting.  The reasons changes to the permitted hedge cutting dates are needed remain a mystery.  It certainly cannot be for reasons of health and safety since that is already clearly provided for under section 40 of the Wildlife Act.  The IWT has no objections to hedge cutting at any time of the year for genuine reasons of health and safety.  That is paramount to any other consideration.  Most of our partner organisations are in agreement with that.  If health and safety were a genuine concern, surely it would need to be addressed at any date and would not be resolved by extending the hedge cutting season into August only.  The IWT does not believe that health and safety are the motivations behind the proposed change, but we do not have theories as to what are.  Many of the farmers to whom we have spoken in recent years have said that it is perfectly possible to manage hedges within the six months that are allocated at present.  To change the law for unknown motivations cannot be a good idea under any circumstances, but in this instance the consequences would be devastating for wildlife.<\/p> <p>  The importance of hedgerows cannot be overstated as they are the last refuge of wildlife across much of the Irish countryside.  With the ongoing intensification of agriculture, the patchwork of fields in lowland Ireland is no longer home to wild plants, insects or birds.  That means wildlife now depends more than ever on hedgerows, and the shelter, flowers and berries that they provide.  In August, many birds are still nesting while even birds which have successfully reared young at that stage, along with all the other hedgerow wildlife, are stocking up for the winter ahead.  The hedgerows are not only nesting places but larders which are essential in the cycle of survival.  Allowing hedge cutting during this crucial month would therefore make survival more difficult for all the hedge's wildlife.<\/p><p>With our climate changing, and the pressures wildlife is under elsewhere, we should, if anything, be seeking to extend the prohibited hedge-cutting season into September to give flora and fauna an additional boost.  It is for this reason that we are opposed to the proposed changes in the Heritage Bill.  As a footnote, we appreciate that hedgerows need to be maintained and managed because they are man-made and farming habitats.  Surveys that have been carried out show that many of our hedgerows are in poor condition.  This should be addressed.<\/p><p> By contrast with proposals on hedge-cutting, we can see the motivation behind the proposal to allow an extension of the hill burning season.  Upland farmers, who have lived and worked in the affected areas for generations see their livelihoods in decline and understandably feel that urgent action is needed.  For a variety of reasons, however, burning land is not the answer to these issues.  The IWT has monitored what is now an annual season for wild fires across in nearly all counties of Ireland.  In 2017, we recorded 97 illegal fires in 19 counties.  Combined with plantation forestry, these fires have eradicated nature in our uplands.  This is not an exaggeration.  According to the National Parks and Wildlife Service, all of our habitats in upland areas are in bad condition while all of the birds synonymous with hills are threatened with extinction.  They include the curlew, meadow pipit, golden eagle, twite, golden plover, ring ouzel, skylark, nightjar, hen harrier and red grouse.  All the ecological, landscape and tourist value is lost in wildfire circumstances. <\/p><p> Our records from 2017 show that the fire season begins in late March and carries on until the middle of May.  This is entirely due to the prevailing weather so extending the permitted season into March is unlikely to provide suitable conditions for so-called &ldquo;controlled&rdquo; burning.  This type of burning is carried out in the UK to encourage unnatural densities of red grouse for game, and has nothing to do with sheep farming.  Furthermore, studies from the University of Leeds have shown that controlled burning is associated with loss of habitat and biodiversity, pollution of water courses, reduced soil fertility and loss of carbon in a habitat which should be a large storage bank for carbon and therefore helping to mitigate against climate change.  It is a type of land management which is known to exacerbate downstream flooding as water absorption capacity in the peat is lost. <\/p><p> The IWT has proposed solutions to upland restoration that accommodate wildlife and traditional farming but with no requirement for burning land.  These include replacing sheep with cattle, planting upland native woodlands, including conversion of existing Sitka spruce plantations to native forests, agro-forestry, which combines trees with grazing of domestic animals, or paying landowners to allow vegetation to simply go wild.  This makes sense when the land is valued for the common good, for example, in providing drinkable water, alleviating floods, and enhancing tourist and amenity value.  Foremost in our priorities is the removal of the requirement for vegetation to be at \"grazable height\" in order to qualify for the basic payment scheme.  Overnight, this measure would remove a significant driver for wild fires and is something we strongly feel needs to be urgently addressed.  To this end, we have lodged a complaint with the European Commission.  I have copies to hand and have supplied copies to the clerk for those who want one.  The document details all the wildfires we logged this year, the reasons we complained to the Commission and the solutions we would like to see implemented.  If we all want uplands that have people and wildlife that provide a range of benefits to every person in this county, we need to provide these options for farmers.  Extending the burning date to the end of March, we believe, will do nothing for anybody. <\/p><p> The IWT has worked with our partners in BirdWatch Ireland, An Taisce and the Hedge Laying Association of Ireland in highlighting the damaging effects the proposed changes to the heritage legislation will have on our already beleaguered wildlife.  Over 30,000 people have signed a petition opposing the move and we hope the changes I have discussed today are not adopted.  I thank the committee once again for hearing my submission today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22017112900002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. P&aacute;draic Fogarty","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511962200,"counter":1086,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses today.  I thank the representatives of the IFA and Irish Natura &amp;amp; Hill Farmers Association for their comments, fair requests and understanding of the situation on the ground.  I welcome Mr. Fogarty but I certainly do not welcome his comments as they are not helpful to the farming community, wider public or, indeed, the birds or wildlife he says he is trying to protect.<\/p> <p>  It is my view and that of many that roadside hedges should be cut all the year round for the safety of road users.  I seriously mean that.  People are saying this to me.  They are paying their road tax.  They are trying to do a bit of exercise up and down narrow roads but cannot because their eyes would be picked out.  They cannot cycle on our roads.  We are supposed to cycle to keep fit.  Farmers cannot take loads of hay up or down roads because of branches, trees, bushes, briars and every other thing stopping them.  That should not be the way.  We are entitled to the roadway that is tarred but the margins between the edges of the roads and the ditches should be kept clear all year round because people are using both the roads and roadsides all year round.  On a narrow road, one has nowhere to step out of the way, bearing in mind that some roads are only the width of one vehicle.  One is prevented from stepping out of the way if the briars and hedges are not cut. <\/p> <p>  To say that birds are nesting at the side of the road or in trees over the road is absolutely ridiculous because it does not account for the wind of a lorry, tractor or car moving in a lively way down the road.  As I have said many times before, the birds would be left naked in the middle of the road because every feather would be blown off them.  It is ridiculous that the Irish Wildlife Trust wants to say to us that we cannot cut the roadside hedges to ensure the safety of the people. <\/p> <p>  I would go further.  Three people were killed recently by branches.  There is a lot of talk about road safety.  There is a man upstairs suggesting people should not be able to drive a tractor without getting an NCT or that a young fellow cannot drive a car without being accompanied even though he is insured.  These kinds of people want to close down rural Ireland altogether and stop us moving around. <\/p> <p>  I have no problem with hedges being allowed to grow at a certain time inside the ditches.  The whole country is ripe for birds, and we welcome them.  If Mr. Fogarty were really interested in ground-nesting birds, he would tackle the mink, grey crows and magpies.  They are taking the eggs of the ground-nesting birds.  There was no mention of that.  The Irish Wildlife Trust wants to leave everything grow wild.  It is actually damaging the ground-nesting birds by not insisting on the elimination of the creatures I mentioned, in addition to foxes.  As Mr. Dunne stated, deer are a plague.  They are no longer satisfied to graze on the hills and the mountains.  They are spreading rhododendrons and everything else, and they are eating what farmers have.<\/p><p>Farmers have to cut their stock because of deer.  I thank the witness for highlighting that.<\/p><p> It is frightening to think that those in the North of Ireland can cut hedges for a month or six weeks longer than those in the South.  There is only a ditch between us.  We are trying to ensure that there will not be a border between us.  What does that tell us?  Over the years farmers have been the best custodians of the land and do not need to be told how to manage their land by any interrupters.  They want to hand their farms down to those coming after them as their fathers did.<\/p><p> Payments are being held up.  I spoke on the telephone today to a man who overcame cancer.  His payment has been held up because the commonage of which he is a shareholder was burned.  He had nothing to do with it.  The Department promised a month ago that a letter would be issued outlining what the man would and would not get.  To date he still has not received the letter.  We firmly believe he will get no payment for Christmas, which is totally wrong because he had nothing to do with what happened.<\/p><p> We could do things a bit better.  Farmers and landowners should be advised to open a fire belt around their properties should they be likely to be burned.  I spoke about the issue when I was a member of Kerry County Council.  The National Parks and Wildlife Service and other bodies should open fire belts to ensure fires do not spread.  People who want to burn should do so legally and in a controlled fashion.  I ask for a return to the previous position whereby farmers received help from Coillte to carry out burning, something which happened until 15 April.  Since then, the date has been changed to the end of February.  We could do things better in that regard.<\/p><p> I remind Mr. Fogarty-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22017112900002#H00200","speaker":"1320","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511962200,"counter":1088,"content":"<p>Does the Deputy have any questions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22017112900002#J00150","speaker":"1235"},{"type":"speech","time":1511962200,"counter":1089,"content":"<p>If burning was left until 15 April, the green grass growing underneath when the older stuff is burnt off would ensure less harm is done to the ground because it would not be burned.

Green growth helps to ensure less harm is done to the land that is being burned.<\/p> <p>  Why is the law in Ireland different?  Scotland has similar terrain.  We will focus on Ireland.

We want inward hedges to be treated in a similar fashion in line with of good farming practice.  It is a lot easier requirement to work within fields and carry out ploughing or whatever.<\/p> <p>  As I have said, birds have more of a chance to nest in a more compact hedge which has been looked after properly.  Due to the waterlogging of fields and hilly land in my area, it has not been possible to work in fields from 15 August until the present day.

If it could be done in February it would be done.  If the conditions were dry enough to carry out a controlled burn then it would be done in February, but the reality is the days in March are getting longer and the natural drying out comes with the spring in March.  That is the reason we want to carry out the controlled burning then.  The wildfires that happened during the month of May were due to the conditions being too dry.  In March the conditions are just drying out sufficiently to carry out a controlled burn where the farmer or the group of people carrying out the burn are in control.  It is not like using petrol or fuel in the month of May when all the purple moor grass has decayed.<\/p> <p>  Burning is an agricultural activity to maintain the land.  It is similar to reseeding in lowland areas or in an enclosed field.  A germination process starts.  The dormant seeds are in the ground.  The ash helps the germination process.  It is part of tradition.  Heather is a shrub and grass that matures over time.  We are talking about the mature vegetation.  It has a life cycle.  If it is not burned, it will fall over within the 15 year life cycle.  We need to be able to manage it.  The change would prevent the wildfires happening, to which Senator Warfield and other speakers referred.  Even if an uncontrolled fire affects an area that had been managed properly and burned in a controlled fashion, it would fizzle out.

The average wage within farming is about half what it is in the industrial sector.  Currently about a third of farmers in this State are independently economically viable and much more needs to be done to ensure farming is helped to become more economically viable.  I am of the view that it is the price side of the business that needs the most help.  Farmers are not getting the value for the work they are doing as it is being taken by other actors in the market.<\/p> <p>  As Mr. O'Donnell has said, it is disastrous that farmers are being penalised in certain cases where they themselves have no hand, act or part in what has happened on their land.  That needs to change.  We will try to resolve that with the Department if we can.  There is an economic benefit to biodiversity.  It is a key element of the functioning of farming that we have a strong biodiversity in order that pollinators, for example, are able to flourish as well as all the other species.  In fairness, much degradation has been done to the biodiversity of this country in the past 30 to 40 years.  I believe everybody in this room would accept that.  Certain species are at a tipping point of existence currently.  There needs to be a balance in society in terms of the ability of farmers to function and farm and some level of protection for biodiversity.  I accept the point that the fewer restrictions one has the easier it is to function as a farmer.  If the opportunity for action is extended the situation will be better.<\/p> <p>  How big an issue is hedge cutting?  I live in the countryside and most of the hedges around me at the moment have not been cut.  I am trying to gauge the impetus for this.  It seems to me that if this was a massively important issue, the hedges on the roadside would have been cut at the first opportunity, in the first couple of weeks of the current window.  We are fighting for the window to be extended even though the window that exists is not being used by many farmers.<\/p> <p>  How difficult is it to use section 40 the Wildlife Act currently?  Do farmers use it to try to cut hedges?  When we contacted the Road Safety Authority to ask if the Minister discussed the road safety aspects of the Bill with it, the response was there had been no interaction.  That shocked me because if the main thrust of the Bill was road safety, the first people one would go to would be those in the Road Safety Authority.  Can we improve the existing measures in terms of road safety and hedges to make it easier for farmers to use them?  Would a compromise position allowing farmers to cut hedges along the roadside be good enough or would it have to include all hedges on a farm?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22017112900002#K00700","speaker":"1235"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1511962200,"counter":1102,"content":"<p>Reference was made in one of the questions to road safety.

Coillte, the fire brigade and local authority must be notified.  One has to apply to a whole raft of people.  For a long time we have been advocating for the establishment of burning groups, whereby there would be one point of contact for the farmer.  It could be the environmental officer in the local county council.  He or she could be contacted and told one intends to burn on such a day.  That officer would be able to co-ordinate with the various interested bodies.<\/p> <p>  To follow on from what Mr. Colm O'Donnell said, we are not seeking to burn the whole countryside; rather, we want rotational burning, just as any farmer would do when reseeding the land.

Thousands upon thousands of acres were burned.  If burning were carried out in a controlled way and only certain areas were burned annually, it would address this.

Burning is part of the rotational sequence associated with keeping a good farm.  My brother has hedges and stone walls.  The stone walls are not good enough to give shelter so there are hedges along them.  They have to be pruned, thickened and made windproof.  The only way this can be done is by cutting from time to time in such a way as to create a proper hedge.  This helps the wildlife.  Around Galway, from where I come, the farmers are the custodians of nature.  The farmers probably understand nature better than anybody because they understand its importance and why there must be a balance in everything one does.  Therefore, I am happy enough that the Bill reflects what is required.<\/p> <p>  Having been a member of the county council in Galway for 12 or 13 years before I had the honour of being elected to the D&aacute;il, I noted the issue of hedge trimming not being carried out arises all the time.  I remember councillors saying on one occasion that the problem was so bad that one did not need to go to a car wash to wash one's car because one could do it along the side of the road.  All the foliage was coming out on top of one.  It is not really the hedges but the grass and other foliage.  It is just the verges.  The growth is not being back because there is a very confined time in which cutting is allowed.<\/p> <p>  We have a multitude of local roads on which two cars cannot pass if they meet each other.  We have to be able to travel along these roads.  Deputy Danny Healy-Rae mentioned cycling and walking.  These are also issues.  The problem is that one sees verge trimming occurring in the depths of winter, in the shortest days of the year and at a time when there is very little light during the day.  There is a health and safety issue.  There is legislation that stipulates verges can be cut for safety reasons.  If so, we should be cutting the verges all year round.  We should not have legislation preventing it.  It is a health and safety issue.  I do not see foliage along any road being cut every year or twice per year.  Usually the verges are cut every two to three years, by rotation, around the country.<\/p> <p>  I listened to what Mr. Fogarty said.  It is not that I am dismissing anything he said but I believe that the farming community ultimately has a considerable role to play.  Sometimes we take all these matters to a point that is counter-productive.  I saw this with flooding when I was responsible for the OPW.  There are certain things we cannot do to clean channels and rivers, and there are certain things we cannot do to keep water flowing.  What happens is that we create floods that empty septic tanks.  Tanks, including oil tanks, burst and destroy the environment.  Lough Funshinagh in Deputy Michael Fitzmaurice's constituency looks like a nuclear bomb landed on it.  All nature has been stripped out of it; there is no wildlife there because of pollution from flooding.  We have to be very careful when following rules and regulations.<\/p><p>One of the biggest reasons we have so much flooding on the Shannon is that we have never done any kind of channel cleaning or maintenance.  If we continue on that road with everything else in this country, we will end up with a situation where farmers will not be farming, we will not be able to exist in rural areas and we will have to push more and more people into towns and cities.  Farmers are the custodians of nature and rural life.  They are responsible, and I am aware of that from my own experience.  We need to work together to make sure we protect the environment and that we do so in a practical and pragmatic way.  I do not have any questions.  The submissions are very good and informative and I appreciate the fact that the witnesses have taken time out to come before the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22017112900002#L01200","speaker":"1260","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511962200,"counter":1121,"content":"<p>I welcome the IFA, those representing hillside farmers and the Irish Wildlife Trust.

It is hugely important that people cut their verges in a rural community.  We have many instances of people who are on holidays in particular having their rental cars scratched because we have not been able to cut the verges.  I am a member of a community council in Goleen in west Cork.  In fairness to the local authority, verge cutting grants have been made available by Cork County Council.  It is a fabulous idea but, unfortunately, it should be available in May, June or July when people are driving around and getting their cars scratched and in danger of losing their lives, but it is only made available during the cutting season.  I recently brought a number of application forms to a meeting and although there are many good people who are very worried about the environment on the community council, they snapped up the forms so that they could get their verges cut.  The roadsides were in a diabolical state and they got them cut.  The funny thing is that I have been coming up to Dublin for a year and a half and I see what happens on the motorway.  The other day I thought I might not be coming anymore.  The verges on the motorway are cut almost every hour.  All the organisations that oppose verges being cut do not think it is any bother to cut them on the motorway even though they are further back from the roadside, yet when roadside verges are virtually shaking hands with each other in rural areas, there is complete opposition to them being cut.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the changes that are being made.  Unfortunately, the extensions are not long enough.  The cutting periods should be even longer, especially for roadside verges.  I agree with Deputy Danny Healy-Rae that it is a different story inside the farm boundaries.  We would have no issue with more care and attention being given there.  We should be able to cut roadside verges 12 months of the year.<\/p> <p>  My views on burning by farmers are well known.  Unfortunately, west Cork was an inferno this year and it affected a lot of wildlife.  I attribute that to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  I am involved in a committee which is taking the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to court because of the massive fines it applied to farmers for having gorse on the land.  The funny thing is that I heard nothing from the Irish Wildlife Trust or anyone else either about protecting the birds and the bees.  The silence was deafening.  No one was fighting for us when farmers were being fined up to &euro;30,000 for having gorse on their land.  One could not have a nicer thing on one's land.  Some cattle walk around it and eat around it, yet all of a sudden we were deemed to be massive villains.  I met with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine at the time in Portlaoise and said there would be an inferno in rural areas, and that it should wait and see what it would cause.  Nobody gave a damn.  Nobody stood up for us.  We collected &euro;80,000 to bring a case against the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Some farmers are going out of existence because of it and it has inflicted worry on their families.<\/p> <p>  Listening to the debate, it appears people are hoping to get a couple of more weeks out of it and we might get an opportunity to do what is being called a controlled burn.  That is encouraging.  Muintir na T&iacute;re has pressed for that to happen.  It is working with all farm organisations to see whether controlled burns can be carried out at different stages during the year while making sure that wildlife is protected.  There was no voice in support of the ordinary farmer in rural Ireland when he was getting a fine of up to &euro;30,000.  No wildlife group spoke up.  Many farmers are still not sure whether they will face massive fines.  If some of the wildlife groups had their way, it would be a case of putting the gates up at Innishannon and turning it into \"Jurassic Park\".  That is what they want to do.  They want to close us up and simply have a park to visit where people can see beautiful birds and bees but the reality is that we have to live there too from day to day.  If people living in Dublin city, for example, had verges closing in around them or the wildlife groups or the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine were putting them out of business for having a bit of gorse, they would be forced into a corner.  When one is forced into a corner, one has to do something about it.  One cannot just sit down and watch one's livelihood being lost.  Everyone here should have a bit of understanding.  The Minister shows understanding in the Bill.  I do not think the Bill goes far enough but at least it is a move in the right direction.  It still protects the wildlife to a degree and it gives landowners an opportunity to do so without the worry of massive fines hanging over their head and the people travelling on the roads to do so in safety.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22017112900002#M00900","speaker":"1263"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1511962200,"counter":1129,"content":"<p>I will respond to some of those points.

One is dealing with commonage land.  Commonages are sometimes very big and have many shareholders.  Sometimes the farmers may not know one another.  They might be from different sides of a hill, for example.  It is not as simple as with private land.  Private land is different because one is fully in control of it.

We are totally for this in the month of August.  For various reasons, the land is drier.  Cutting in August would not create rutting, which leads to soil erosion, which in turn leads to siltation of rivers, etc.  The soil structure is much more firm at that time of the year.  If there is a heavy hedge that requires cutting, it is done once.  The next cut just involves a maintenance run.  It could be the next year or the one after that.  The nesting birds will not be interfered with on a maintenance run.<\/p> <p>  Another proposal we would like to make is that the National Parks and Wildlife Service should be properly funded to establish a burning scheme for upland areas, including commonages, private Natura land and designated lands.  It should be given the flexibility to burn limited areas of the uplands when possible.  This derogation should be allowed until such time as rotational burning is fully established in upland areas.  Today, no land would burn.  Land that was burned last year will not burn at any time.  Burning is the problem and burning is the solution.  It is a paradox.  A fire needs fuel.  If the fuel is allowed to build up, the fire spreads, as happened in the Cloosh Valley in Connemara, where the special area of conservation extends for miles.  The farmers in the area had no choice.

I asked them what it was about Ireland that they noticed in particular.  They said we are so good at farming and know how to do it.  This is a real compliment to everybody here.  I want to lay the subject of health and safety aside because I am sick of it.  Everything is an excuse for a health and safety argument, which for older people now is a cause to make them fragile.  The phrase \"health and safety, health and safety, health and safety\" is used but it teaches people how to be fragile.  It sometimes obfuscates what is sheer common sense, which is effectively what is being talked about by the delegates, who know their business.  They are trying to make a place for common sense.  I do not know what we are talking about really when we talk of health and safety at the same time that the Pacific Ocean is full of plastic and considering that many of our rivers and streams are full of excrement.  We make up phrases such as \"health and safety\".<\/p> <p>  I will make my third point and then move on to my observation.  When I drive down a motorway or on another major road and look at the foliage on the left, I note it is sometimes hacked to death by what I would call the wrong instrument.  Did anybody ever notice that?  It is as if the branches have been cracked or broken off with brutality as opposed to being cut using what one would call the proper instrument.  This is evident along many of our motorways and many other major roads.  I do not know whose fault that is.<\/p> <p>  The Irish Wildlife Trust has a really good point to make.  I am very much in favour of BirdWatch Ireland and the Irish Wildlife Trust.  If there are 75 illegal fires and only one licence, one must ask what is going on.  Mr. O'Donnell and Mr. Dunne have a really good point in that if there were a central authority, it would be of benefit.  One is delayed by ringing up various individuals and trying to get 15 different permissions.  It is not that it is an excuse but people say they are not waiting for all the permissions and then proceed to burn.  There is a kind of waywardness in certain behaviour.  The delegates made a very good point because there is an impasse here.  As an objective person from the capital, I realise there is massive impasse; one just wants to get it right.  The farmers are completely right and want to do it right.  As Mr. Dunne said, they just need some sort of central, strategic point.  With that, the system can work.<\/p> <p>  The Heritage Bill has resulted in many trials and tribulations because everybody is trying to get it right.  We have seen the destruction of islands all over the place.  One should consider what is happening in Bali.  That is just an observation because I do not come with any expertise.  I bow to the better judgment of the delegates.  I bow to the Irish Wildlife Trust because I know its heart is in the right place, as are the hearts of the farmers.  The farmers are the keepers of the land and do it very well.  I have had the privilege of spending considerable time around the country observing many areas of farming.  A strategic point is needed, however.  The system seems to be all over the place.  It seems to be a case of every man for himself on the way to Mayo after Longford, especially if one is thinking of having tea in Tulsk.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22017112900002#N00300","speaker":"1427"},{"type":"speech","time":1511962200,"counter":1137,"content":"<p>Is that an observation or a question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22017112900002#N00400","speaker":"1235"},{"type":"speech","time":1511962200,"counter":1138,"content":"<p>Would anyone like to respond to it?

When the hedge cutter is used after that period, it is not really suitable.  The branches grow so strong that the flail is not that suitable.  One does not end up with the hedge one is looking for.

They have to talk to the likes of the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, and are often refused at other times of the year.

For example, in Galway the local authority would not cut a hedge this year.<\/p> <p>  I thank the delegates for their presentations and the Chairman for allowing me to contribute.  Do all of the delegates agree that there is a managed landscape?  Do they agree that farmers in rural Ireland are the protectors of the environment when no one else is around?<\/p> <p>  Regarding controlled burning, I will throw out an idea that came to me.  In certain areas, for example, commonages on mountains, it is undoubtedly difficult to make a living.  Should there be rural social scheme, RSS, groups or the like in certain areas or counties to help in controlled burning using a meitheal?  Could people involved in such groups be trained to help farmers?  It would also provide employment in various areas and could be done on a co-op basis.<\/p> <p>  Everyone needs to understand the role of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in this issue and it might be a good idea for the committee to contact that Department.  An inspector comes to an area which is a managed landscape.  If he or she finds a certain percentage of heather that is too long or that there is vegetation somewhere, the entire grant is removed.  Do the farming organisations agree that this or another committee has to sort out that scenario?<\/p> <p>  People are jumping to conclusions on another matter.  From everything I have heard, it is almost being suggested farmers are responsible for the burning.  First things first - no one has been convicted.  People are innocent until found guilty.  Does Mr. Fogarty believe it was wise to have reported to the European Union that there had been 97 wildfires, 40% of which had been in designated areas?  For the record, 80% of the land west of Lough Corrib is in designated areas, as in 35% of County Mayo.  Unfortunately, most of the hilly regions where there have been fires are in designated areas, in which farmers are prevented from working.  As was pointed out correctly, they cannot even put cattle or sheep on land without first obtaining clearance.<\/p> <p>  According to the Irish Wildlife Trust's complaint, hen harriers had been lost to wildfires.  Mr. Fogarty also mentioned the curlew.  I note that he is from Castleknock.  Speaking as one of the committee members from rural Ireland, most of the hen harriers were drowned, which was unfortunate.  When some so-called environmentalists decided that it would be better to let minks loose, they killed curlews.  Rather than being visitor to rural Ireland on a Saturday and a Sunday and thinking we know it all, we should appreciate what farmers are doing.  Working with them is the way forward.  Reporting and trying to ensure their grants will be removed is not.  No one engaged in the activity in question would be welcome in rural Ireland.  For hundreds of years farmers have protected the landscape.  It is not a great idea for a visitor on a Saturday and a Sunday to try to trump them and tell them what to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22017112900002#P00500","speaker":"1341"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1511962200,"counter":1168,"content":"<p>Deputy Michael Fitzmaurice asked whether I believed it had been wise to report to the European Commission.

The entirety of this Supplementary Estimate is taken up with one project, namely Luas cross-city.  Luas cross-city will shortly begin operations and will provide a real benefit to our transport infrastructure.  The Luas network has been a huge success story for Dublin's public transport system and there have already been a number of improvements to the network since the green and red lines began operations in 2004 - for example, the extensions to Cherrywood and the Docklands.  Luas cross-city has been a priority project for the Government and has been delivered on target and within budget.  With testing and training of drivers coming to a conclusion, Luas cross-city will commence passenger services on 9 December.  The project will be a hugely beneficial addition to the public transport network in Dublin, enhancing the overall capacity available.  This will encourage more people to use public transport, which will assist in alleviating congestion in the city.  Alleviating congestion is particularly important at present as the level of economic activity is, thankfully, continuing to grow.  I know that the past few years have been challenging for the city and for businesses, and we all look forward to the works drawing to a close and the start of operations next month.  I take this opportunity to thank the people, particularly the business people, of Dublin for their patience.  I feel they are about to be rewarded.<\/p> <p>  Passenger numbers on the Luas network exceeded 34 million in 2016.  Luas Cross City is forecast to provide for up to 10 million additional passenger journeys per annum.  Under the agreed budgetary profile for the funding of the Luas cross-city project, an element of the costs arising in 2017 will be borne through the release of section 49 levies held in reserve by Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII.  These levies in the amount of &euro;12.5 million were collected by TII under section 49 of the Planning and Development Act 2000.  The levies were collected in respect of the Luas extensions to Cherrywood and the Docklands.  These levies can now be surrendered by TII to my Department for reallocation to the National Transport Authority, NTA, for costs relating to Luas cross-city.  The Supplementary Estimate will facilitate arrangements to reallocate the funds in question to fund Luas cross-city project expenditure which was incurred during 2017.<\/p> <p>  Luas cross-city completes the missing link in the Luas network.  It will help to create an integrated public transport system in Dublin by extending the existing green line at St. Stephen's Green to Broombridge and providing an interchange between the existing red and green lines in the city centre.  It will also serve the new Dublin Institute of Technology campus at Grangegorman.  Luas cross-city will also enhance the image of Dublin as a shopping, tourist and business destination.  This in turn will lead to increases in investment and economic activity.  I have no doubt that Luas cross-city will bring huge benefits to the city, including to the businesses in the city centre and along its route.  I very much look forward to seeing it up and running.  I am happy to address any questions members of the committee may have on this technical Supplementary Estimate to help fund Luas cross-city.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2017112900002#B01300","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1511962200,"counter":1262,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and his officials.

There is an issue outside the Dublin area which we are addressing that I suspect I should not discuss now because it does not regard the Luas cross-city but I will do so to try to be helpful to the Deputy.  Construction has started on the first of the major upgrade schemes, that being the widening of the M7 Naas bypass and an upgrade to the Sallins bypass and Osberstown interchange projects.  Those are being implemented as one project.<\/p> <p>  Additional funding is being provided as part of the capital plan review which will allow for significant enhancements to the programme.  The funding has facilitated a range of national roads initiatives, including M50 safety enhancement works, measures to reduce energy usage for traffic route lighting, the inclusion of some additional major and minor road upgrade schemes in TII's construction programme and the appraisal of a range of projects with a view to developing a pipeline of future projects.  Financial provision is also being made to meet the Government's commitment to contribute to the A5 upgrade.  <\/p> <p>  Quite a lot of money will be spent under the new capital plan in addressing the issue of park and ride facilities.

That is an issue for many people travelling to Dublin.

I am not involved in the issue the Deputy addressed, which is the day-to-day operations of public transport, but I will try to reassure him in that regard.

The Commission for Railway Regulation, CRR, is the independent regulatory agency charged with oversight of the safety of all railway activities in the State.  The regulatory process operates independently of the Minister and the Department.  The CRR as safety regulator ensures that a safety management system is in place for the operation of Luas cross-city.  The role of the CRR is to assess safety management systems to ensure they conform to all requirements prior to awarding safety authorisation or safety certificates and the assessment of new or significantly altered railway infrastructure and rolling stock to ensure safety compliance prior to placing in service.  It has the necessary powers to deal with any risk to safety that may arise.<\/p> <p>  I made inquiries on the issue this morning because it was anticipated that a Deputy would raise it.

As the Deputy knows, there is a levy on developments along Luas lines.  As I outlined in response to Deputy Troy, the money from the levies is collected by the relevant local authority.  The route it takes is somewhat circuitous, the reason for which I do not know but which is required under the Act.  It goes from the local authority to TII, then to the Department, which gives it to the NTA.   The NTA, as the sanctioning body, sanctions the money and sends it to fund works on the Luas cross-city.<\/p><p>It has to be done because of the mismatch between the levies collected one year from a developer and the money being paid out somewhere else.

It is hugely important infrastructure that will help in bringing about a more integrated public transport network in the capital city.  It is a good start and while we have a long way to go, we must acknowledge the work that has been done.  As the Minister said, a lot of people have been inconvenienced by the construction work in the past few years, but I hope they will reap many benefits and rewards when the service is up and running.  Does the Minister know how much of the money raised by way of the development levies went towards meeting the overall cost of the line?  <\/p> <p>  My next question may be a little unfair because the Minister cannot predict how much development will take place along the new line.  However, the Department is aware of how much land has been zoned for development.  On that basis, can the Minister give us a figure for the potential development levies that could be recouped in the next five to ten years by Dublin City Council?<\/p> <p>  I note that &euro;150 million of the cost of the Luas cross city project was met through European funding, which is welcome.  I have said to the Minister on previous occasions that I do not think the Government is availing enough of the funding available to us to invest in infrastructural improvements.  Now that we see the benefits of such investment in this project, will the Minister commit to considering using the Juncker fund to accelerate other projects in the future?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2017112900002#D00400","speaker":"1250"},{"type":"speech","time":1511962200,"counter":1287,"content":"<p>I am happy to take that question.  The Deputy is right that &euro;150 million came from the European Investment Bank.  The funds for the scheme have come from the European Investment Bank by way of a loan of &euro;150 million, the Exchequer and TII reserves, mainly made up of development levies.  <\/p> <p>  On the amount of land zoned, it would be speculative to say how much has been zoned and how much could be raised.  I do not think I could do that.  However, I could ask TII to give us some estimate, but I imagine it is considered to be a steady, ongoing source of revenue.
