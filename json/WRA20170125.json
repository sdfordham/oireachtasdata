In recent weeks, both the Taoiseach and I have had intensified contacts with the parties and the British Government on the political difficulties that were threatening the continuation of the Executive.<\/p>  <p>  It was clear, immediately following the resignation of the deputy First Minister, that the prospect of a resolution ahead of the triggering of an Assembly election was slim.  However both Governments, in their capacity as co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement, made full use of the narrow window available to ensure that any avenues for resolution between the parties prior to an election were fully explored.<\/p>  <p>  In the event, an Assembly election has been triggered and it is important to emphasise that this eventuality is one covered by the legislation governing the devolved institutions in Northern Ireland.  When parties in an administration cannot agree, an election is the consequence and the outcome of that is now for the electorate in Northern Ireland to determine. <\/p>  <p>  The Secretary of State and I have agreed that both Governments should continue to work closely together in the weeks to come, looking ahead to the post-election period, when a new power-sharing Executive will need to be formed.  We have also urged the parties to approach the election campaign in calm and respectful terms, conscious that polarising rhetoric and frayed relationships will damage the prospects of forming an Executive after the votes have been counted. <\/p>  <p>  We must all be mindful that effective devolved Government, underpinned by a genuine spirit of partnership, is what the people of Northern Ireland voted for in 1998 and what they expect their politicians to deliver.<\/p>  <p>  After the election, it will therefore fall to the parties to form a power-sharing Executive and this will require the parties to find a way forward on issues which contributed to the calling of the election.  The Government is of course always ready to support and assist the parties in any way we can. Our commitment as a co-guarantor of the Agreement is a constant one &ndash; in good times and bad.<\/p>  <p>  The Government will continue to work with the British Government and the political parties to support the fulfilment of the full promise of that Agreement and to advance political stability, reconciliation and economic prosperity in Northern Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500068#WRA00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Middle East Peace Process","counter":12,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500068#WRA00950"},{"type":"question","counter":13,"qnumday":56,"qnumall":"[3055\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500068#WRA01000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will report on his recent attendance at the international Middle East peace conference; his views on the position being taken by President Trump in relation to the rights of the Palestinian people and in particular his intention to move the embassy of the United States to Jerusalem; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1308","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":14,"content":"<p>I attended the Conference on the Middle East Peace Process in Paris on 15 January, which was hosted by President Hollande.  Some 70 countries and international organisations participated in the meeting, which was a follow up to the first conference held in Paris in June 2016, which I also attended.  This &ldquo;French Initiative&rdquo; was aimed at reviving a stalled peace process, and reaffirming international support for the two state solution to the conflict between Israel and its Arab and Palestinian neighbours. Contrary to intentions, the meeting did not include the parties themselves, as Israel refused to attend or to engage in any way with the French initiative.  This was regrettable and mistaken.<\/p>  <p>  The conference adopted a Declaration which clearly expressed the view of the broad international community that the two state solution was the only way forward.  This followed on and reinforced the similar message in Security Council Resolution 2334, adopted in December, which I welcomed at the time. <\/p>  <p>  However, there was also great concern among all participants about threats to the viability of that solution, stemming principally from the settlement policy of the Israeli Government. The Middle East Peace Process has been effectively stalled for three years, and there is no clear view on how to renew it.  Uncertainty about the direction which the new US Administration will take was, of course, one factor in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  The Paris Conference, and the initiative taken by France during 2016, can be said therefore to have been partially successful, particularly in maintaining an international focus on the issue at a time when other events in the Middle East have been dominating attention.  France is to be commended for initiating and persevering with this challenging work, despite the many and clearly anticipated difficulties inherent to it. The wider ambition, of helping to restart the peace process, remains to be achieved, and is a task for the whole international community. Ireland will continue to argue for the European Union to play its full part in that.<\/p>  <p>  It is too soon to tell what positions the new US Administration will take in relation to Israeli-Palestinian issues.

It was clear, immediately following the resignation of the deputy First Minister, that the prospect of a resolution ahead of the triggering of an Assembly election was slim.

An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also informed the meeting that it was intended to have a stronger focus on road traffic enforcement in the training provided to new recruits at Templemore.<\/p><p>Following this meeting, my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport announced that his Department will review Section 29 of the Road Traffic 2010 with the intention of ensuring that all drivers, if caught drink driving, will, in future, receive a mandatory disqualification.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500069#WRB03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Policing Co-operation","counter":139,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500069#WRB03950"},{"type":"question","counter":140,"qnumday":102,"qnumall":"[3389\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500069#WRB04000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 150 of 17 January 2017 and in view of the fact that both the German Federal Ministry of the Interior and the Scottish Government have both made formal requests of the British Government to extend the Pitchford inquiry to their respective jurisdictions (details supplied), the reason she is choosing not to make the same request on behalf of the Irish public; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1259","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":141,"content":"<p>The position in respect of this matter remains unchanged and is as set out in my reply to the Deputy's Question No. 150 of 17 January 2017.

Instances of crime and anti-social behaviour are monitored by local Garda management with the assistance of Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Analysis Service, which results in periodic operations aimed at anti-social behaviour on and around public transport routes.  I am further advised that there is effective communication with the respective control centres and that access to good quality CCTV has also been of great assistance in the investigation of complaints.   <\/p>  <p>  Having regard to the above, I have no plans for the development of separate policing arrangements for trains or transport services generally. Instead, investment is being made in enhancing the resources available for policing generally, including a very substantial provision of &euro;88.5 million for Garda overtime in 2017 which will strengthen the capacity to respond to changing crime trends.  Underpinning the Government's approach is the commitment to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  The Government's plan is to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 new Garda&iacute; and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan within in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

The setting-up of the Legal Services Regulatory Authority has in fact been under way since 19 July 2016 when, under S.I. No. 383 of 2016, I commenced those provisions of Part 1 and Part 2 of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015 as necessary to get the new Authority up and running, particularly in terms of its membership and appointment.  On 29 September 2016, I signed the Order appointing 1 October 2016 as the official &ldquo;establishment day&rdquo; of the Regulatory Authority as provided under section 7 of the 2015 Act - S.I. No. 507 of 2016 refers.  In conjunction with these initial steps the nomination, approval and appointment procedures for the members of the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority set out in Part 2 of the 2015 Act were also completed.  This has included the required resolutions approving such appointment having been passed by each House of the Oireachtas.  Dr. Don Thornhill has also been appointed as Chairperson of the Regulatory Authority in accordance with the Act.<\/p>  <p>  The Authority, which has eleven members including a lay majority and lay-Chairperson, held its inaugural meeting on 26 October 2016 and has been meeting monthly since then with its most recent meeting having taken place on 19 January 2017.  Initial office accommodation has been provided for the Authority by my Department along with the secondment of an officer at Assistant Principal level in support of its start-up phase.  Funding support of &euro;1 million has also been provided to the new Authority by my Department in December on a strictly recoupable basis as the new Authority will be self-funding by levy.  In the building up of capacity and resources to become fully operational, the Legal Services Regulatory Authority has recently appointed a person to fulfil the duties of its Chief Executive on a solely interim basis to drive the initial start-up phase.  At the same time this will enable the Authority to prepare the way for the public recruitment of a full-time Chief Executive in the coming months having had the opportunity to more clearly identify its existing and future management needs and capacities in real time.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the commencement of Part 2 of the 2015 Act, the Law Society, the Bar Council and the Honorable Society of the King's Inns have furnished the Legal Services Regulatory Authority with copies of their professional codes as required within one month of the Authority's establishment under section 23(6)(a).  On 5 December 2016, under S.I. No. 630 of 2016, I also commenced sections 118 to 120 of the 2015 Act.  These provisions set statutory delivery deadlines for the completion of public consultations and reports on the specified matters concerned.  These relate to Legal Partnerships, Multi-Disciplinary Practices and certain restrictions on barristers in relation to direct access on contentious matters and the holding of clients' monies.  The working focus right now is on the managed roll-out of the Authority's remaining functions in tandem with the phased commencement during the year of the various remaining Parts and provisions of the 2015 Act. <\/p>  <p>  Against this background, it is intended that the phased commencement of the remaining Parts of the 2015 Act will be implemented in the first half of this year.  The current focus includes the phased commencement of respective sections or Parts of the 2015 Act such as those dealing with the introduction of a more transparent legal cost regime, the establishment of a Roll of Practising Barristers and the separate introduction under the Act of Pre-Action Protocols.  It also includes the transition of the Office of the Taxing-Master to that of the new Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicator which is a substantial structural reform of an office of the High Court and for which I have also introduced and commenced additional supporting measures under the Courts Bill which was enacted on 28 December 2016.  Following these steps the key provisions centred around Part 6 of the Act dealing with the new public complaints and professional conduct and disciplinary procedures, and the appointment of the new Legal Practitioners Disciplinary Tribunal, will be commenced. <\/p>  <p>  These are tasks for which I know the new Authority, with the direct engagement of its interim Chief Executive, is actively building up its working resources in the short term.  My Department and the new Regulatory Authority will, therefore, continue to liaise closely to ensure that we can successfully coordinate the commencement, from my side as Minister, and delivery, by the Authority as the new independent statutory regulator, of the various provisions concerned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500069#WRB04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Courts Service Administration","counter":148,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500069#WRB04550"},{"type":"question","counter":149,"qnumday":105,"qnumall":"[3432\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500069#WRB04600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she can confirm the operation of a digital audio recording system in the justice system; when it commenced; when any refinements occurred; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1259","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":150,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, under the provisions of the Courts Service Act 1998, management of the courts is the responsibility of the Courts Service which is independent in exercising its functions, which include the provision of information on the courts system.<\/p>  <p>  However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has informed me that Digital Audio Recording (DAR) is in operation in courts in all jurisdictions.

The overall objective is to ensure that housing supports are fair and sustainable, prioritise those on lowest incomes and avoid creating social welfare traps that may prevent people from either returning to work or to the private housing market.I expect the review to be completed during Quarter 2 2017.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500071#WRD01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foreshore Licence Applications","counter":242,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500071#WRD01350"},{"type":"question","counter":243,"qnumday":140,"qnumall":"[3350\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500071#WRD01400","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"when his Department will issue the foreshore licence, which he approved in principle in December 2016, to Sligo County Council in respect of the development of the proposed pier and pontoon scheme in Rosses Point, County Sligo; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the council requires the foreshore licence as a matter of urgency in order to allow it make an application for grant aid for the project to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1306","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":244,"content":"<p>The draft foreshore licence concerned issued to the Council&rsquo;s legal services on 12 January 2017.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500071#WRD01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Housing Provision","counter":245,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500071#WRD01550"},{"type":"question","counter":246,"qnumday":141,"qnumall":"[3351\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500071#WRD01600","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the fact that Sligo County Council purchased a house in 2015 to house a family (details supplied); if his attention has been further drawn to the fact that the council sought approval for funding from his Department in October 2015 to construct an extension to the house in compliance with the recommendation of the HSE&rsquo;s occupational therapy service; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the family will not be allowed to move into the house until such time as the extension is constructed; if it normally takes 15 months for his Department to process and approve funding for such extensions, when it is expected that a decision will be made on the council&rsquo;s submission; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1306","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":247,"content":"<p>My Department received a submission from Sligo County Council on 31 March 2016 seeking funding for the proposed extension referred to in the Question.

Within my Ministerial remit, fire services in Ireland are provided by local authorities in accordance with the provisions of the Fire Services Acts, 1981 and 2003. Dublin City Council provides fire services for the city and county of Dublin which are resourced by the four Dublin Local authorities, through Dublin Fire Brigade (DFB).<\/p>  <p>  Dublin City Council through Dublin Fire Brigade also provides an ambulance service on behalf of the HSE.  This service is provided under section 25 of the Fire Services Act 1981 which enables local authority fire services to carry out or assist in any operations of an emergency nature.

The package is also available to some people under the age of 66 who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments.  Therefore anyone aged less than 70 years of age must be in receipt of a qualifying payment from the Department or satisfy a means test in order to qualify for HHB.  <\/p>  <p>  People in receipt of HHB aged under 66 are generally in receipt of payments such as Invalidity Pension, Disability Allowance or Carers.  These payment types mean that the recipients are unable to work full time and earn additional income.

These recipients are of working age and may take up full-time employment, at any level of remuneration, without losing entitlement to their widow&rsquo;s contributory payment.  <\/p>  <p>  In general, widow&rsquo;s pension only becomes a qualifying payment for HHB once the recipient reaches the age of 66 (State pension age) to ensure alignment with secondary benefits that are available to people in receipt of the State pension. <\/p>  <p>  The concession whereby widows aged between 60 and 65 years, whose late spouse\/civil partner received HHB from my Department, may qualify for the package was introduced at a time when State pension age was 65 and this cohort of widows were seen as less likely to be in a position to take up employment than those of a younger age.<\/p>  <p>  Any decision to extend the concession to widows aged less than 60 or to allow recipients of widow&rsquo;s pension of any age to qualify for HHB would have budgetary consequences and would have to be considered in the context of budget negotiations.

To date, over 60 officers in Intreo Centres have received training to enable them to interact effectively with people with disabilities.<\/p>  <p>  The DSP also provides a wide range of work related supports for people with disabilities.  One of the principal supports is the EmployAbility service, which provides job coach support to people with disabilities in accessing jobs in the open labour market.  Other supports include the provision of employment subsidies through the Wage Subsidy Scheme, Workplace Adaptation Grants and specialist training courses that are specially designed for people with disabilities.  Funding is also provided to AHEAD (Association for Higher Education Access and Disability) for the Willing Able Mentoring (WAM) programme, an employment placement programme for graduates with disabilities. <\/p>  <p>  Most recently, Budget 2017 provided funding of &euro;2 million for projects which will deliver pre-activation supports for people with disabilities.

This is Ireland&rsquo;s largest ever response to any humanitarian crisis.  Ireland&rsquo;s support is channelled through UN, Red Cross and NGO partners, who are best placed to respond and ensure that Irish funding goes to those who need it most.  The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in particular has proven capacity and expertise in reaching the most vulnerable communities in conflict situations and gaining access to besieged and hard-to-reach areas, where other organisations cannot operate.  During 2016 alone, Ireland&rsquo;s funding supported the work of the ICRC to carry out 55 cross-frontline operations to bring food, clean water and essential aid to millions of Syrians. <\/p>  <p>  In line with a coordinated, &ldquo;Whole of Syria&rdquo; approach, bringing together international humanitarian efforts inside Syria and those in the neighbouring countries of Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UN OCHA) sets out annually the principal needs and objectives of the humanitarian response, and monitors progress towards these objectives.  These are to save lives and alleviate suffering, enhance the protection of civilians and build their resilience.  Ireland&rsquo;s support to the UN in Syria has been provided through pooled funding managed by OCHA in Syria, Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan.

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their income and assets while the State pays the balance of the cost.  The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.  A financial assessment is carried out by the HSE to determine how much a participant in the Scheme will contribute to the cost of their care.  <\/p>  <p>  Participants in the Scheme contribute up to 80% of their assessable income and a maximum of 7.5% per annum of the value of assets held. In the case of a couple, the applicant&rsquo;s means are assessed as 50% of the couple&rsquo;s combined income and assets.  The first &euro;36,000 of an individual&rsquo;s assets, or &euro;72,000 in the case of a couple, is not counted at all in the financial assessment.  The capital value of an individual&rsquo;s principal private residence is only included in the financial assessment for the first three years of their time in care.  This is known as the three year cap.<\/p>  <p>  The Scheme has a number of important safeguards built into the financial assessment which ensures that:<\/p>  <p>  -  Nobody will pay more than the actual cost of care;<\/p>  <p>  -  An applicant will keep a personal allowance of 20% of his\/her income or 20% of the maximum rate of the State Pension (non-Contributory), whichever is greater.  This is in recognition of the fact that, although the NHSS covers core living expenses, residents can still incur some costs in a nursing home, such as social programmes, newspapers or hairdressing;<\/p>  <p>  -  If an applicant has a spouse\/partner remaining at home, he\/she will be left with 50% of the couple&rsquo;s income or the maximum rate of the State Pension (non-Contributory), whichever is greater;<\/p>  <p>  -  If both members of a couple enter nursing home care, they each retain at least 20% of their income, or 20% of the maximum rate of the State Pension (non-Contributory), whichever is greater;<\/p>  <p>  -  Certain items of expenditure, called allowable deductions, can be taken into account for the financial assessment, including health expenses, payments required by law, rent payments and borrowings in respect of a person&rsquo;s principal private residence;<\/p>  <p>  -  A person&rsquo;s eligibility for other schemes, such as the Medical Card Scheme or the Drug Payment Scheme, is unaffected by participation in the Nursing Homes Support Scheme or residence in a nursing home.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to these safeguards, where an applicant&rsquo;s assets include land and property held in the State, the contribution based on such assets may be deferred and collected from their estate.  This is known as the  Nursing Home Loan (Ancillary State Support), the purpose of which is to ensure that a person does not have to sell their home during their lifetime to pay for long-term nursing home care.  A nursing home resident can apply for this deferral at any stage. <\/p>  <p>  When the Nursing Homes Support Scheme commenced in 2009, a commitment was made that it would be reviewed after three years.  The Report of the Review was published in July 2015.  A number of key issues have been identified for more detailed consideration across Departments and Agencies, including recommendations in relation to improving and simplifying the application process, and recommendations relating to the treatment of business and farm assets for the purposes of the financial assessment element of the Scheme.<\/p>  <p>  An Interdepartmental\/Agency Working Group has been established to progress certain recommendations contained in the Review.  This Group is chaired by the Department of Health and includes representatives from the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the HSE, the Revenue Commissioners, and when required, the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF).  <\/p>  <p>  Significant progress has already been made in relation to the implementation of recommendations relating to the administrative reforms to the Scheme.

The Strategy is a cross cutting area of public policy and service delivery, which requires a coordinated response to tackling the drug problem, involving the statutory, community and voluntary sectors.  The overall objective of the Strategy is to tackle the harm caused to individuals and society by the misuse of drugs through a concerted focus on the five pillars of supply reduction, prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and research.  Prevention programmes constitute a significant part of the Government's response to the drug problem, particularly among young persons.  <\/p>  <p>  As the nature and extent of the drug problem has changed since the commencement of the current Strategy in 2009, Government is committed to putting a new drugs strategy in place this year, when the current policy expires.  A Steering Committee has been established to advise me on a new Strategy, with a view to developing an integrated public health approach to substance misuse, defined as the harmful or hazardous use of psychoactive substances, including alcohol and illegal drugs. <\/p>  <p>  Significant progress has been made in developing the evidence-base for the new Strategy.  This includes a high level review of the current Strategy by an international panel of experts, a review of systematic evidence reviews of interventions to tackle the drug problem and a trends analysis of the drugs situation in the past 10 years.  In addition, multi-stakeholder focus groups have given their views on measures to address gaps in the current response to the drugs problem and a public consultation process has taken place, which has resulted in over 2000 submissions.<\/p>  <p>  It is envisaged that the new Strategy will be based on a health-led approach to the drug problem and build on progress achieved under previous drug strategies.

The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of\u00a0the NBP\u00a0as a matter of priority.\u00a0 This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment by the telecommunications sector and a State intervention in those areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.<\/p><p>A key principle of the NBP is to support and stimulate commercial investment through policy and regulatory measures.  Commercial investment since the publication of the NBP has considerably exceeded expectations.  To date, the commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2.5bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.<\/p><p>Currently, approximately 1.4m premises in Ireland can\u00a0get high speed broadband from commercial service providers and investment by the telecoms sector is continuing to expand this footprint. <\/p><p>The proposed State intervention under the NBP represents a potentially very significant capital investment project for the State and the Government is firmly committed to delivering this investment, as evidenced in the National Broadband Plan itself and in the Programme for Government, the Action Plan for Jobs and the Statement of Government Priorities.<\/p><p>The High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at <i>www.broadband.gov.ie<\/i>shows the current extent of the State Intervention area.  The map shows Ireland with two colours, BLUE and AMBER.  The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or have previously indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services.  The AMBER areas on the map show the target areas for the State intervention which are the subject of the current procurement process.  It is intended that premises within this area will\u00a0have access to services of at least 30 megabits per second when the procurement process is completed and the network\u00a0rolled out.\u00a0 <\/p><p>Under EU State Aid rules, public investment in a commercial market has to be targeted at areas where there is evidence of market failure.  Therefore, the Government's proposed investment under the NBP will apply to those parts of the country that are unlikely to be served commercially. <\/p><p>A formal procurement process is now in train to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area.  The procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years.  Intensive dialogue with bidders is continuing and the three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution.\u00a0 This provides for a future proofed solution for the\u00a0 25 years of the contract and beyond.\u00a0 A fibre-to-the-home\u00a0solution\u00a0means that householders and businesses may\u00a0get speeds not just of 30 Megabits per second but much higher, potentially up to 1000 Megabits per second.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>The timeframe for\u00a0the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders, during the procurement process.  During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated a 3-5 year timeline\u00a0to rollout a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP.  As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and\/or high demand.  This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network rollout plan.  A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  A detailed rollout plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place. <\/p><p>The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the rollout of the network once a contract is awarded.  In this regard, Minister Humphreys is leading on the establishment of two regional action groups, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices and other relevant agencies to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded.<\/p><p>In a further positive initiative, last July,\u00a0I\u00a0established a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce with my colleague\u00a0Minister Humphreys\u00a0to address immediate issues in relation to the quality of mobile phone and broadband coverage.  The Taskforce report which was published in December, is available at the following link:<\/p><p>I recently signed Regulations allowing ComReg to proceed with\u00a0the allocation of\u00a0spectrum in the 3.6GHz band, in early 2017.  This will provide an 86% increase in total\u00a0spectrum available for mobile and fixed wireless services.  I have also secured &euro;8m for RTE which will allow it to free up the 700MHz spectrum band, to\u00a0provide\u00a0enhanced mobile services. \u00a0<\/p><p>These investments should assist in significantly improving the coverage and quality of broadband and mobile voice and data services throughout the country, including Co Kerry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500075#WRH03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","counter":586,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500075#WRH03500"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Coras Iompair &Eacute;ireann","counter":585,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500075#WRH03450"},{"type":"question","counter":586,"qnumday":263,"qnumall":"[3251\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500075#WRH03500","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the surplus or deficit for the year after public service obligation payments and after exceptional items for each of the years 2010 to 2016; and the accumulated deficit or surplus at start and end of the year respectively for each of the CI&Eacute; constituent companies.","asker":"1250","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":587,"content":"<p>The\u00a0information requested\u00a0is publicly available\u00a0through the published accounts of the CI&Eacute; Group and its subsidiary companies.\u00a0\u00a0However in order to assist the Deputy I have forwarded the Deputy's question to CI&Eacute; for direct reply.Please advise my private office\u00a0if you do not receive a response within ten working days.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500075#WRH03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Projects Status","counter":588,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500075#WRH03650"},{"type":"question","counter":589,"qnumday":264,"qnumall":"[3311\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500075#WRH03700","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the status of Transport Infrastructure Ireland's study into the current capacity of the N4 and N7; when this report will be made available; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1298","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":590,"content":"<p>As Minister for Transport, Tourism &amp;amp; Sport, I have responsibility for overall policy and funding in relation to the national roads programme.<\/p>  <p>  The planning, design and implementation of individual road projects\u00a0 is a matter for Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) under the Roads Acts 1993-2015 in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.

This Strategy sets out very ambitious targets to grow the level of exports by &euro;5bn to &euro;26bn per annum with over two-thirds of those outside of the UK.<\/p>  <p>  EI&rsquo;s export strategy is twofold &ndash; it has a specific focus on consolidating exports in the UK and it will remain an important market for Ireland.  EI will be implementing a UK Market Development plan which focusses on sustaining exports in key sectors such as construction, agritech, aerospace and engineering and also identifying new growth opportunities in financial services, infrastructure\/public sector.  EI&rsquo;s trade mission programme, which will be launched in the coming weeks, outlines a number of trade missions to the UK focussing on some of these key sectors.  EI is also working with companies heavily focussed on the UK, at a sector by sector and one to one basis, through its UK office, on improving their competitiveness and innovation capabilities to sustain and grow exports.<\/p>  <p>  The second part of the strategy focuses on increasing exports to markets beyond the UK. EI&rsquo;s plans have a specific emphasis on markets, including the Eurozone, where it plans to increase exports by 50% to 2020, the USA\/Canada, Asia and the Middle East.  EI&rsquo;s international trade &amp;amp; events programme, which will be launched shortly, focusses on trade missions, market study visits and inwards buyer visits from markets with specific sectoral opportunities. <\/p>  <p>  To drive this strategy, 39 posts will be created in a number of Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s overseas offices and in the Irish based team.  On foot of 2015 export figures, there is immediate opportunity and potential for strengthening our foothold in existing established markets and for diversified export growth.\u00a0 In 2015, sales to North American grew by 27%, Northern Europe by 8% and Asia-PAC by 11%. <\/p>  <p>  Extra staff will be placed in EI&rsquo;s overseas offices with sectoral knowledge and expertise such as in engineering, food, life sciences and construction.  This will drive export growth to other international markets where there are known opportunities and reduce reliance on the UK.<\/p>  <p>  Nevertheless, the UK will continue to be a priority market due to Ireland&rsquo;s size, geographic proximity and cultural ties.  EI will focus on increasing international sales with existing buyers while also supporting companies to develop new strategic relationships and avail of emerging opportunities, particularly in the engineering and construction sectors. <\/p>  <p>  In 2017, EI will also rollout the &lsquo;Global Ambition Campaign&rsquo; which is a communications campaign to promote Irish companies and their products and services to international buyers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500076#WRJ01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1247"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Trade Agreements","counter":632,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500076#WRJ01350"},{"type":"question","counter":633,"qnumday":281,"qnumall":"[3527\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012500076#WRJ01400","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the progress in respect of any other transatlantic trade agreements with the EU; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1247"},{"type":"speech","counter":634,"content":"<p>The EU has successfully concluded a number of important trade agreements and is in the process of negotiating or upgrading agreements with many more trading partners.

The targeted element of the scheme will involve a progressive system of income-related subsidies for parents with children between 6 months and 15 years, with eligibility based on net parental income.  The Scheme will be available in childcare providers who are registered with Tusla, including both centre-based childcare providers (e.g. cr&egrave;ches, preschools and daycare centres) and child-minders.<\/p>  <p>  The Scheme is designed to be flexible, with the ability to adjust income-thresholds and subsidy rates over time as additional state investment becomes available.  The policy paper on the Scheme was approved by Government in October 2016.  A report on the national public consultation on the scheme, which was carried out in November 2016 and yielded 4,000 responses, will be completed in February 2017.  The Heads of Bill and General Scheme were approved by Government on 24th  January 2017.
