We should keep a very close eye on the situation there.<\/p><p>The ESB announced that its profits for the first six months of this year have jumped by 165% to \u20ac230 million.  This is the same company that last month announced an increase in the price of electricity of nearly 6% and an increase of over 8% in the price of gas.  A total of 315,000 of its customers had to enter into special payment arrangements because they cannot meet their electricity bills.  This figure of 315,000 people in 2011 is up from 160,000 account holders in 2010.<\/p> <p>We do not know the figure for this year to date.  When the Electric Ireland spokeswoman was asked about this, she said the price increase will not be reviewed.  I do not find that one bit acceptable.  Regular customers are falling behind in their payments and are being hit with price increases.  What is the view of the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural resources, Deputy Rabbitte?  Has he spoken to Electric Ireland about this matter?<\/p><p>Based on projections, Electric Ireland will have a profit this year of over \u20ac500 million, yet it is imposing price increase upon price increase on hard-pressed customers, many of whom are struggling to pay their mortgages and other bills.  There have been no pay cuts in Electric Ireland and there has been no pension levy imposed.  The conditions in the company are exactly as they were prior to the recession, if not better, and pay increases have been made.  How in God's name can we have allowed the company to increase prices - three times in the past six months \u2013 and to have a half-year profit of \u20ac230 million when 315,000 people cannot pay their electricity bills?  What is the view of the Minister on this?  Has he been in touch with the energy regulator and Electric Ireland, or will he just remain silent?  I have no doubt this issue concerns everybody in this House.  How can we allow a company such as this to make a profit of \u20ac500 million at the end of the year while still increasing its prices?<\/p><p>There has been no clarification whatsoever on the home help cuts.  I raised this yesterday and last week.  There have been cuts of 950,000 hours this year to date.  An additional 450,000 hours are to be cut between now and Christmas, representing a figure in the order of \u20ac8 million.  I am glad to hear that Senator Bacik, in her capacity as Deputy Leader, said yesterday that the Labour Party group has made representations to the Minister for Health.  However, will the Minister for Health reverse the cut?  To facilitate his answering that question, I am proposing an amendment to the Order of Business stipulating that he come to this House, for just 30 minutes, to state specifically whether the most recent cut of 450,000 hours represents Government policy and whether it will stand between now and Christmas.  I want clarification on whether the Government will reverse the recent home help cuts on which the Minister signed off.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102500002#A00500","speaker":"1139","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1351157400,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I share the Senator's concerns about Electric Ireland.

Ms Emily O'Reilly has said the Department of Health is acting illegally regarding the scheme.  I do not want to blame the previous Government although this arose on its watch; I will give it a pass today in that regard.  It is totally unacceptable that the physically disabled are denied access to the scheme, not because they are ineligible but because the Department of Health has said the money is not available.  Legally, the Department is obliged to pay.  The Minister should explain the position to the House.  I do not know how many people are affected but they are the most vulnerable.  One person who was refused was 81 and subsequently died.  Nobody should have to experience refusal.  The scheme offers &#8364;280 per month for people who cannot walk or who are otherwise immobile.  It is unacceptable for the HSE to say it cannot afford to pay.  This is not an excuse when it is legally obliged to pay.  If the excuse were upheld, it would set a precedent regarding many other equally worthy schemes.  I ask the Minister to explain his position in the House and to reverse the decision immediately.<\/p><p>  We had a very good debate last night on Alzheimer's disease.  Members from all groups engaged with those who had watched the debate from the Visitors Gallery.  Alzheimer's disease and dementia will be talked about more frequently because the average age of the population is increasing.  Statistics show that the incidence of dementia doubles every ten years.  It is coming down the tracks very quickly.<\/p><p>  Malin Head and Valentia Coast Guard stations were debated with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport yesterday.  This matter needs to be addressed very quickly.  I said at the meeting that there is too much fog around the whole issue and nobody seems to be clear on it.  I wish the Minister made a decision and maintained the <i>status quo <\/i>so the people of Malin Head and Valentia can have some clarity.  I expect the Minister to make that decision soon.<\/p><p>  Public officials are being abused at meetings, which is not acceptable.  I have seen this occur at various meetings.  I would not like to be a public official attending committee meetings at present because there seems to be a carefree attitude in the sense that they are being hammered and subjected to grandstanding.  I do not refer to anybody in particular.  I hope a very good case can be made for Malin Head.  A Northern Ireland delegation made the case, which is very important.<\/p><p>  There should be a debate on promissory notes before March.

While the jobs will be temporary and last for the duration of construction, amounting to approximately 20 months, the tourism potential for the Cooley and Newry-Mourne peninsulas will be significant.  Despite what I hear occasionally in this House, this is the scenic tourism capital of the country.  Narrow Water bridge will be the first iconic international bridge to be built between the North and South.  It will symbolise the much improved relationship between the North and the South.  The project will commence in approximately nine or ten months and construction will take 20 months to complete.  I look forward to the bridge's opening in mid-2015.

That is wrong.  It is also worrying that the same regulator who allowed a seemingly slack regulation of electricity is about to be appointed the water regulator.

One in five people, or 20%, live in the private rented sector.  We have 7% of the population living in social housing which is the lowest proportion in the history of the State.  It represents a complete and total sea change in housing.  Some months ago the Residential Tenancies (Amendment)(No. 2) Bill was published.

That means that one in 25 rented properties are controlled by NAMA which makes it the largest landlord after Dublin City Council.  The appalling behaviour of some receivers towards tenants has been brought to my attention because they take the rent but do not carry out maintenance.  They refuse to take responsibility when essential features break down such as heating and water supply which has led to great difficulties.  The Seanad could have a useful debate on the security of tenure for tenants and the future of the sector and I ask the Leader to consider arranging it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102500004#C00200","speaker":"1172"},{"type":"speech","time":1351158000,"counter":16,"content":"<p>Yesterday, I tabled an Adjournment motion on the need for an enhanced GPS system for fishing vessels and fishermen.  I was pleased with the response given by the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  He stated that the Minister is looking at introducing legislation that would make it mandatory for all fishing vessels to have the new enhanced GPS systems and for all fishermen to carry personal locator beacons.  Such measures would lead to a significant improvement in safety.  We are all aware of the high profile tragedies that took place off the southern coast and elsewhere in recent years.  Boats sank and fishermen were lost but it took a long time to recover their bodies.  The new system, if implemented, will ensure that the rescue services can quickly locate people when their boat gets into trouble and even if they are in the water.  In tragic circumstances, such as when a fisherman drowns, it takes a long time for his or her body to sink.  It sinks for a while, resurfaces and then sinks slowly and it can take three or four days for it to go below the level where GPS systems work.  Obviously personal locator beacons would make it easier for rescue services to locate a body.<\/p><p>I call for a wider debate on marine safety.  The Minister is preparing legislation on the subject.  Anything that improves safety for fishing vessels, commercial fishing vessels and fishermen would help to prevent tragedies at sea.  A debate here would give us an opportunity to have our say in advance of legislation being prepared by the Minister.  I ask the Leader to arrange a debate.

We all wish that was not the case.<\/p><p>The other side of the economic equation is that it should not be impossible for a broad range of services, including electricity, gas and all utility companies, to deliberately force costs down.  We have often discussed costs in terms of health insurance.  The response to every increase in charges for hospital and GP care and the provision of healthcare was to simply accede to requests by the insurance companies to increase their prices.  We urgently need to address the cost of living.  As wages have taken a huge hit and the taxpayer must carry a huge burden, it is unacceptable that companies that provide the necessary utilities of life maintain and increase their profits. <\/p><p>This morning I read the words of welcome for the fact that house prices may be increasing.  It worries me that we want to welcome and cheerlead an increase in house prices.  The future of Irish families has been mortgaged and their current situation almost wrecked because we viewed house prices as a nirvana.  With the current level of house prices we should aspire to have finance made available in order that people and families can buy houses.  We need to be careful not to view an increase in house prices as a panacea and believe that the future is rosy again.<\/p><p>I support what Senator Hayden has said.  Thousands of people depend on the rental market and it is a fair and reasonable way of life in most European countries.  I ask the Leader to arrange a serious debate on housing and its future, including the purchase and rental of houses.  We may not be able to have such a debate before the budget but we do need it in the medium term.

Some 1,500 children are confirmed every year as having been abused and in need of protection.  We want to ensure the awful mistakes of the past are never repeated.  The fact that the referendum is being held on a Saturday, as Senator Leyden said, presents an opportunity for everybody to come out and show their support.  The fact that all parties are supporting it may lead to some complacency among the electorate and possibly the media is not giving the referendum the coverage it would get if groupings were opposing it.  For that reason, we, as public representatives, all need to use some shoe leather in the next few weeks to ensure that we get the message across and encourage young people and students, who are away from home and may be coming home for the weekend, to cast their votes.

He is a frequent visitor who is always welcome.  What is happening at Killarney House is unbelievable and I invite all the Members to see it for themselves.  It is truly an iconic tourism project.  We have this beautiful house both in the town and in Killarney National Park, the home of the former Earls of Kenmare, the Brown family, and John McShane, the man who did so much for horse racing in this country with that great trainer and Coolmore previously.  A commemoration of both those families will be held there, which is something about which all Members will be enthusiastic when it comes to pass.  I compliment the Minister, Deputy Deenihan, again on all he has done and for leading that project.<\/p><p>I note the sad passing of Billy Vincent who spent the first 15 years of his life in Muckross House, that other great house in Killarney.  He has been a wonderful benefactor not just to Killarney, but to this country over the years.  Senator Barrett is aware of that.<\/p><p>I agree with my colleagues in regard to the holding of the children's rights referendum on 10 November.  I share their view that it is wonderful that polling day is on a Saturday.  I believe all elections should be held at weekends.  I hope we will get a good poll but I have yet to meet someone who is arguing against it.  The danger in that is apathy and we would have a low poll.  It behoves us all, therefore, to do our bit next weekend and in the remaining few weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102500005#D01400","speaker":"1151"},{"type":"speech","time":1351159200,"counter":37,"content":"<p>This morning, I read with a sense of disbelief and outrage that the ESB is pressing ahead with price rises of 6% although it has made profits of \u20ac213 million in the first six months of this year.  While it is good news that it is making a profit, it is not good news that the board is pressing ahead with the price hike.  This affects every household in the country.  Some people's bills are as much as \u20ac200 per month and people are broke.  The term, \"semi-State\", must mean something and this type of price hike has an incredible impact on the cost of living.  The presence of the Minister in this House is required to have a full debate on this issue, as soon as he can manage it, because the term, \"semi-State\", must mean something.  This increase indicates clearly there is insufficient competition because if it was sufficient, prices would be keener and more reasonable for householders.  The term, \"semi-State\", means we have a stake in this commercial company and I believe we should use it.  Consequently, I ask the Leader to schedule a debate at the earliest possible opportunity because the cost of living is out of control when one sees such bills coming to family homes every month.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102500006#E00100","speaker":"1131"},{"type":"speech","time":1351159200,"counter":38,"content":"<p>The point raised by the previous speaker was also raised by the Leader of the Opposition and I will deal with it now.  I refer to the question of the ESB and the substantial profits that have been made in the first half of this year.  As Members are aware, the pricing of electricity is a matter for the Commission on Energy Regulation, but I am sure it should be taking cognisance of the large profits that are being made as a result of its decisions in granting such price increases.  Moreover, I hope the Minister, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, will take the opportunity to speak to the regulator on this matter.  It is dreadful when people are falling behind with their ESB bills and so on and it is immoral to see such profits in this semi-State body.  Moreover, as Senator Barrett pointed out, the salary of the chief executive officer of this body is three or four times greater than that of the Taoiseach.  In addition, many of the staff in that body have not been affected in any way by the cuts experienced recently by other members of the public service.  It certainly is an important matter which I will bring to the attention of the Minister who I am sure is dealing with it.  The Commission on Energy Regulation certainly must take cognisance of such substantial profits made by the ESB.<\/p><p>The Leader of the Opposition also raised the question of home helps and I will try to get answers to his questions.  I do not propose to accept his amendment to the Order of Business on that matter.<\/p><p>Senator Harte raised a number of issues on the Order of Business, mainly regarding the Ombudsman's report.  This matter was raised by Senators Hayden and Mullins in respect of the question of mobility allowance.  I believe the Ombudsman's findings should be upheld and, whatever happens, the Government will be obliged to find means to act on the aforementioned findings and to restore these mobility allowances to people who are aged over 65.  It has been proved that it is illegal not to give such allowances to those who are aged over 65 and the Government will be obliged to act on that matter.<\/p><p>Senator Harte also raised the issue of yesterday's debate on Alzheimer's disease.  I compliment the Labour Party group on bringing this matter to the attention of the House because the debate was very informative.<\/p><p>On the question regarding Malin Head and Valentia Coast Guard stations, I understand the decision will be made soon.  Were the Senator to table an Adjournment motion on the matter, he might be able to get the updated position in this regard.<\/p><p>The question of the promissory notes was raised by Senators Harte and Gilroy, among others.  The Minister and his officials are in constant negotiations on this matter and I am sure the Minister will be willing to come to the House and update Members as soon as more progress is made on it.<\/p><p>Senator Brennan referred to Narrow Water bridge, a matter which is close to his heart.  He has done tremendous work on this issue over many years in highlighting the need for this bridge, and the securing of European Union funding for it is to be welcomed.  The Senator highlighted the benefits for tourism in the area, as well as building closer relationships between both communities.  That is what this is all about and it certainly will be very beneficial to the tourism industry on the Cooley Peninsula and the other side of the bridge.<\/p><p>I mentioned Senator Barrett's observation in respect of the chief executive officer of the ESB.  The Senator also referred to the household charge.  The errors being made in this regard are simply not acceptable.  Letters that are being sent by local authorities are based on information from the Property Registration Authority and, in some cases, the information contained within its databases might not have been updated.  While that may deal with the specific point, having letters sent to people who have paid simply should not happen and there must be answers in this regard.  Obviously people should and I am sure will immediately notify the authorities if they have paid, but it should not come to that.<\/p><p>Senator Hayden called for a debate on the private rented sector and a debate on housing, for which Senator Bradford also called.  While the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, has come into the House previously, I am sure she would be quite willing to return to have an overall debate on the housing sector and the private rented sector.  I will try to arrange such a debate in early course.<\/p><p>Senator Cullinane raised the subject of his Adjournment matter yesterday.  I am glad the Minister responded as he did, because there is an obvious need for enhanced GPS systems on all fishing vessels.  There have been accidents in recent years in which many lives have been lost.  I agree with the Senator on the question of personal locator beacons on fishermen in that legislation should be introduced whereby fishermen should be obliged to wear them.  I hope such legislation will be introduced soon because there is a need to improve safety regulations in the fishing or any other sector.  I compliment the Senator on raising the matter.<\/p><p>Senator Bradford mentioned a debate on housing, to which I have referred, as well as keeping down the cost for all utility companies.  He also mentioned the question of house price levels and the euphoria in some sectors as a result of an increase in house prices.  I note the Senator's comments in that regard.<\/p><p>Senators Leyden, Mullins, Wilson and Paul Coghlan raised the issue of the children's rights referendum and pointed to the importance of people voting in the referendum.  It is incumbent on all Members to ensure people are well informed on the issue and that they get out as many people as possible to vote in the referendum.  That it is being held on a Saturday is being welcomed by the majority of the population and there should be no excuses for anyone not to vote on a Saturday.<\/p><p>Senator Gilroy raised the issues of the promissory notes and the fishing fleet, both of which I have dealt with.<\/p><p>Senator Paul Coghlan again extolled the virtues of Killarney, the Minister from County Kerry and anything pertaining to that county.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102500006#E00400","speaker":"1130"},{"type":"speech","time":1351159200,"counter":39,"content":"<p>Senator Darragh O'Brien has proposed an amendment to the Order of Business, \"That a 30 minute debate be held today with the Minister for Health to clarify whether the Government intends to reverse the reduction of 450,000 hours in the home help service.\"  Is the amendment being pressed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102500006#E00700","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1351159200,"counter":40,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102500006#E00800","speaker":"1139"},{"type":"vote","time":1351159800,"counter":41,"content":"<p>Amendment put:<\/p><p>The Seanad divided: T\u00e1, 10; N\u00edl, 28.<\/p><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Senators Ned O'Sullivan and Diarmuid Wilson; N\u00edl, Senators Paul Coghlan and Aideen Hayden..<\/p><p>Amendment declared lost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102500007#F00050","aye":["1133","1159","1140","1128","1146","1115","1139","1142","1145","1164"],"nay":["1148","1157","1121","1138","1150","1165","1151","1124","1147","1130","1117","1144","1172","1131","1119","1152","1161","1162","1167","1132","1174","1134","1118","1153","1125","1163","1143","1176"]},{"type":"unspoken","time":1351159800,"counter":42,"content":"<p>Order of Business agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Address by Professor Christopher A.

I will also update Members on the outcome of last week's European Council meeting.<\/p><p>With 67 days left until 1 January, work is intensifying at all levels.  We are now also getting a much clearer sense of the issues on the agenda of the Council in the first half of next year which we can aim to advance.  At the beginning of the month members of the Government travelled to Brussels for discussions with the College of Commissioners on our Presidency.  We were pleased with the outcome of the meeting which confirmed there is broad agreement between the Government and the European Commission on the main priorities and objectives we have identified.<\/p><p>The Taoiseach also had the opportunity while in Brussels to meet the President of the European Council, Mr. Herman Van Rompuy.  The President of the European Parliament, Mr. Martin Schulz, MEP, also visited Dublin at the beginning of this month for discussions with the Taoiseach and the T\u00e1naiste and was invited to address the D\u00e1il.<\/p><p>I have just returned from my latest visit to the European Parliament in Strasbourg and discussed the main issues that are now emerging as priorities in the Irish Presidency programme.  I also discussed the particularly intensive period of engagement with the European Parliament in the coming weeks which I know will involve Members of this House.  Between now and the end of the year, delegates from five committees from the European Parliament will visit Dublin as well as the three main political groups in the Parliament.  At the end of November the President of the European Parliament, Mr. Martin Schulz, MEP, will return to Dublin with the Conference of Presidents, that is the leaders of the political groups in the European Parliament.  I very much welcome this engagement by the European Parliament in advance of the Presidency and I particularly welcome the involvement of the Oireachtas in this process.<\/p> <p>It is vital, as the European Union takes steps towards closer integration in response to the crisis, that the European Parliament and national parliaments play their respective roles in ensuring democratic accountability for our actions.<\/p><p> Work is continuing on the development of the Irish Presidency programme, which will be published at the end of this year.  This is informed by the discussions that have been taking place at political level.  It will also take into account the Commission's work plan for 2013, which was adopted on Tuesday.  At the same time, the Permanent Representation in Brussels will also draw up, with the Commission and the Council Secretariat, the agendas of the Council meetings that will be held during the first half of next year and which will structure debate at Council during our Presidency.<\/p><p> I am pleased to update the Seanad on work that has been under way on the Presidency since I last addressed this House in May.  I will first highlight some of the main priorities that now look set to dominate Ireland's Presidency programme.  The main overarching focus of the Presidency, across all policy formations, will be identifying and advancing legislation that can contribute to creating the conditions for sustainable economic growth in Europe and job creation.  The agreement at the June European Council on a compact for jobs and growth was important.  We will now work closely with our EU partners to make this commitment a concrete reality.  We have identified policy and legislative issues across several Council formations that we consider can contribute to longer-term growth and job creation.  Many of these issues are linked to the Single Market, which has delivered so many benefits and opportunities for our export sector and consumers in the past 20 years.  <\/p><p> Ireland will seek to make progress on draft legislation outstanding under the current Single Market Act, including the professional qualifications directive.  We also want to ensure that business and consumers reap the benefits of an evolving Single Market and e-commerce.  The Single Market Act II was published on 3 October by the European Commission and Ireland strongly supports the focus in the Act on making progress in areas such as integrated energy, transport networks and the digital economy.  <\/p><p> During our Presidency we will also seek to spur growth in the digital economy and the digital Single Market by working to advance agreement on key issues, including intellectual property rights, cyber security, e-identification, data protection and high-speed broadband roll-out.  In a rapidly changing global economy, we also need to ensure that Ireland and the EU are equipped to play a full role in the research, development and innovation sectors.  For this reason, we are placing a strong emphasis on advancing the Horizon 2020 framework funding programme which can play an important role in supporting research and innovation across the EU and creating smart jobs and sustainable growth.  Completion of the European Research Area, ERA, and the future development of the European Institute for Innovation and Technology will also be priorities for the Irish Presidency given their potential for job creation and sharpening the Union's competitiveness.<\/p><p> Senators will be aware of the value that the Government attaches to new markets for Irish exporters.  In addition, to the work prioritised in the internal Single Market, Ireland also plans to place a strong emphasis on the external trade agenda.  The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, will host a ministerial meeting in Dublin next April which will focus on strengthening EU-US trade relations.  The Presidency will also work on progressing free trade agreement negotiations with other strategic partners, including Japan and India.<\/p><p> Ireland, as Presidency, will also work to strengthen the EU economy in the coming decades by making progress on the entrepreneurship action plan.  To support the next generation of entrepreneurs and to better serve citizens, Europe also needs to invest strategically in its infrastructure to support economic development and maintain its global competitiveness.  The Presidency will prioritise work on the connecting Europe facility to underpin development in the Union's transport, telecoms and energy infrastructures.<\/p><p> As Presidency, Ireland will also work to promote greater equality, social cohesion and inclusion in Europe.  Elements of the Europe 2020 Strategy, including improving training, skills and access to education, will play a critical role in equipping citizens, particularly young people, to find work and in attracting investment into the EU.  The issue of skills is central to fighting unemployment and will<b><\/b>be a focus at the February education Council in the context of discussions on the European Semester and Europe 2020.  Following the publication of the youth transitions package, the Presidency will focus on youth employment and mobility at the February Council, and at an EPSCO informal ministerial chaired by the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, in February with a view to agreeing a Council recommendation on a youth guarantee.  Time does not permit me to go into detail today on all of the dossiers that we are planning to advance to fight the crisis, to reinvigorate Europe's economy and to create jobs.  However, four years into the crisis, our citizens demand and deserve action.  For this reason, jobs and growth will remain our central focus.<\/p><p> To underpin Europe's economic recovery and to ensure coherence in the Union's policies, agreement needs to be reached on the EU budget from 2014 to 2020.  Many of the issues that I have outlined above are dependent on the budget, including issues of critical national importance to Ireland such as Horizon 2020, CAP and CFP reform.  Securing agreement on the EU's future financing is a key priority for the current Cyprus Presidency.  Ireland stands ready to assume whatever tasks remain at the start of its Presidency, including making progress on the approximately 70 pieces of implementing legislation related to the MFF.<br \/>With regard to last week's European Council, I accompanied the Taoiseach to the summit meeting in Brussels on 18 and 19 October.  European leaders had a number of substantive issues on their agenda last Thursday and Friday, including in the economic sphere, a reflection on the possible future shape of Economic and Monetary Union, which underpins our shared currency, and taking stock of implementation of the compact for growth and jobs.  Beyond those economic issues, Heads of State and Government also had a good exchange on our relationship with the Union's strategic partners, most notably with China, and they adopted a comprehensive set of conclusions on the developing situations in Syria, Iran and Mali.<\/p><p> The central focus of deliberations last week was on the means of strengthening Economic and Monetary Union and most particularly on progressing towards so-called banking union.  The framework for these discussions was provided by President Van Rompuy's interim report, Towards a Genuine Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), which he presented to leaders.  The report was well received and leaders agreed a comprehensive set of conclusions based on the four essential building blocks necessary for a strengthened EMU, which President Van Rompuy identified previously.  These are an integrated financial framework or so-called banking union; an integrated budgetary framework; an integrated economic policy framework; and, critically, democratic legitimacy and accountability.  It was agreed that President Van Rompuy will continue his consultations with member states and others before bringing forward his final report to the December European Council.  That report will set out a specific and time-bound roadmap for strengthening EMU, including recommendations for concrete steps to be taken.<\/p><p> Last week, leaders reaffirmed their commitment in June to break the vicious circle between banking and sovereign debt.  Heads of State and Government also clearly reaffirmed the commitment to provide for the recapitalisation of euro area banks by the European Stability Mechanism, ESM.  With regard to the single supervisory mechanism, which is a critical step in the creation of a banking union, leaders have now agreed a clear timeframe for its entry into operation as a matter of priority, with its legislative framework concluded by the end of this year and work on the operational implementation of the single supervisor to happen during the course of 2013.  The European Council has also tasked the Eurogroup of Finance Ministers, including the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, to draw up the exact operational criteria that will guide direct bank recapitalisation by the ESM in full respect of the June decisions.  This, too, is a positive outcome from our perspective.  <\/p><p> As the House will be aware, in the aftermath of last week's meeting, the Taoiseach had a telephone conversation with Chancellor Merkel on Sunday afternoon last and that on foot of that discussion a joint communique was issued by the two leaders.  Chancellor Merkel expressed a genuine appreciation of the steps the Irish people are taking to turn our economic situation around and her full support for our efforts to get back to the markets.  The joint statement makes it clear that the commitments made to Ireland at the end of June stand and that the vital work involved in examining the situation of the Irish financial sector will be taken forward by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan and his colleagues in the Eurogroup of Finance Ministers, with a view to further improving the sustainability of our programme.  Chancellor Merkel also acknowledged that Ireland's case is a special one and that this would be taken into account during the discussions ahead.<\/p> <p>Significantly, President Hollande of France added his voice, when the Taoiseach met him in Paris, in appreciating the special situation which Ireland faces and in acknowledging that these circumstances will need to be taken into account as the Eurogroup now takes this work forward.<\/p><p>These statements are a most welcome reaffirmation by key European leaders that the 29 June agreement to address Ireland's situation will be honoured.  I reassure the House that the Government will continue to work painstakingly to secure the best possible deal for the people of Ireland.  We have had considerable success and I am confident our approach will lead to a positive outcome.  This work will be detailed and technical and may take some time, but the Government has always said it is better to get the best possible deal rather than a quick deal.<\/p><p>Before concluding on last week's European Council meeting, I should note that leaders also adopted a comprehensive set of conclusions on the implementation of various aspects of the compact for growth and jobs.  This was a most welcome return by the Heads of State and Government to assessing implementation of the compact which they adopted as recently as June last.  While progress has been made in beginning to implement the various elements of the compact, what is evident is that more needs to be done.  Just as in the case of EMU and the banking union, implementation is key.  Taking forward the various aspects of the compact at EU level, such as the Single Market, youth unemployment or expanding opportunities for external trade, will form an important aspect of our work in the Presidency next year.<\/p><p>Related to the ongoing work at European Council level, a final key overriding priority for the Irish Presidency will be to ensure stability and restore trust in the euro area for business, investors and consumers.  For this reason, Ireland will work to ensure the effective implementation of governance measures through the EU's new system of economic and budgetary co-ordination.  Trust also needs to be restored urgently in other sectors that are critical to the functioning of a modern economy, and this is why we are placing an emphasis on making progress on the banking union proposals.<\/p><p>I will outline some of the other fundamentals that will guide the Irish Presidency in 2013.  We are committed to maintaining the reputation earned in our six previous Presidencies for acting as a fair and impartial officeholder.  We believe the EU is at its most effective when its members move forward together to deliver results for all Europe's citizens.  Also, as I stressed to the House last May, the Government is committed to delivering a very cost-effective Presidency.<\/p><p>The Presidency is a massive task for any administration, but especially for a smaller state like Ireland.  Since I last spoke to the House in May, I have met many of my counterparts from the European Parliament, other member states and the Oireachtas.  I have also met and briefed non-governmental organisations and civil society on our Presidency and have worked to factor their views and concerns into our Presidency programme.  Next year, 2013, is the European year of citizens and one of my aims during the Presidency will be to promote much stronger levels of direct public discussion and engagement in EU affairs.  Ireland has had a very interesting journey during its first 40 years of EU membership.  The Presidency will demonstrate once again the positive role Ireland can play in Europe.  It can also serve as a useful point of public discussion on how we envisage Ireland's role in an enlarged Union.<\/p><p>I thank the Senators for inviting me to speak here again and for their views and the contributions they will now make on the Presidency programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102500009#H00300","speaker":"1036","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1351161300,"counter":54,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Creighton, to the House.  I express our appreciation for the respect she has shown the House.  She is prepared to come here to brief this House, which has enormous experience.  Putting it in context, in the coming nine months the Minister of State will have responsibility for European affairs during Ireland's Presidency and it will be 15 years before someone else will have that experience.  It is an enormous task but I know the Minister of State is up to it and I commend her for her work to date.  Her statement was very comprehensive and detailed and I do not need to go through all of it.  It was a good exercise for so many members of the Cabinet to go to Brussels.  I do not think it happened previously in the lead-up to a Presidency.  Perhaps I am wrong.  It was quite innovative to meet in Brussels.<\/p><p>The Minister of State has the benefit of having very experienced secretariats and ambassadors in Brussels and Strasbourg and they are very well geared towards the task ahead.  When other countries such as Croatia held the Presidency, Ireland gave them assistance because of the experience we have.  Perhaps in 15 years time the Seanad will not be here; therefore, we are lucky to be here and that the Minister of State is here today to outline the position on the European Union.<\/p><p>I have a question on the College of Commissioners during the Presidency.  The previous arrangement was that the Commission came to a country during the first days of its Presidency.  I am not sure whether this will be implemented.  It was an opportunity for each Commissioner to meet the appropriate Minister to discuss various arrangements.<\/p><p>It is very encouraging to see five committees from the European Parliament as well as three main political groups visiting Dublin prior to the beginning of our Presidency.  The group with which Fianna F\u00e1il is associated, the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party, ELDR, will visit in early November, and Dublin will reap great economic benefit from the number of delegates who will come from throughout Europe.  It is very encouraging.  The programme is quite interesting with regard to energy and other issues.<\/p><p>Departments are focused on the Presidency.  We will not have this opportunity for another 15 years and every Department must aim to maximise the benefits in this regard.  The Minister of State said the priorities for the Presidency will be jobs and growth.  This is very commendable and they must be implemented.  Our influence and the fact we are in a particularly difficult situation will be of great importance in this regard.  Opportunities which arise in future with regard to exports, the Single Market and digital technology are very important.<\/p><p>With regard to the European Institution of Innovation and Technology, we are not making as much progress as we could on wind and wave energy.  Ireland is regarded as the best location for wind energy in Europe.  I appreciate domestic political and planning reasons arise and I hope we will come to terms with them.  We have regions and areas which could be very beneficial to this sector.  The power and energy of the Atlantic Ocean is enormous and technology has been developed in this regard.  I presume the Minister of State and our Commissioner, M\u00e1ire Geoghegan-Quinn, who is from the area, would support this development.<\/p><p>An area that has been examined by many people but not yet conquered is harnessing hydrogen.

I very much welcome the fact that the overarching focus of all Government activity will be on jobs and growth because those are the biggest issues and challenges facing our country and Government.  I also very much welcome the comprehensive update on the outcome of the European Council meeting held in Brussels last week at which considerable progress was made on the future of economic and monetary union.  From an Irish point of view, the meeting was particularly positive as a commitment made in June to break the link between banking and sovereign debt and to provide for the recapitalisation of the banks by ESM was confirmed.<\/p><p>However, there was, as the Minister of State alluded to, some concern in Ireland following remarks made by Chancellor Merkel in a response to a question about Spain that the issue of Ireland's bank debt and recapitalisation by the ESM was not as positive as had been indicated following the June meeting.  Certain politicians and a negative media attempted to paint the worst possible scenario and cause much unnecessary concern among our citizens.  I compliment the Taoiseach on his swift and decisive action in clearing up the confusion with Chancellor Merkel and the issuing of the joint communiqu\u00e9 which reaffirmed the commitment of 29 June that Ireland's bank debt would be looked at, that Ireland was a special case and that the circumstances surrounding the banking crisis were unique.  This will be taken into account by eurozone Finance Ministers as they begin negotiations on how the ESM will work once a banking supervision system is in place.  We are fortunate to have the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, negotiating on our behalf.  The recognition by the Chancellor of our unique situation and the strong support for our difficulties by French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande is highly significant and demonstrates the excellent work being done by the Taoiseach, the T\u00e1naiste, the Minister for Finance and the Minister of State for European Affairs in gaining support for Ireland through diplomatic initiatives.<\/p><p>I do not intend to rehearse the reasons we are in this unique situation but our negotiators need strong political support at home as they work to achieve the best possible outcome in respect of our unsustainable banking debt and make our return to the markets more certain.  Unlike others, I am not too concerned about the timescale for achieving our objectives.  We all know the structures must first be put in place, such as the single supervisory mechanism for banks, but we all want to see an outcome that will give us hope and confidence for the future.  <\/p><p>President Van Rompuy at the opening of the European Council meeting spoke about the need to concentrate on banks, employment and growth while giving a gentle reminder of Europe's purpose and fundamental achievement of bringing peace and reconciliation to the continent.  Referring to the award of the Nobel Peace Prize, he spoke of the honour for our citizens and institutions and the pride that the way we in Europe live together is recognised by the world at large as societies united in diversity sharing democratic values and human rights.  He rightly paid tribute to those who courageously started the work after the Second World War and later worked relentlessly in their own countries to join this common adventure.  He said it is our shared responsibility to carry on their work and that we are facing difficulties today but can draw confidence by remembering much more daunting obstacles Europe had to overcome.  They had to rebuild a Continent wrecked by violence and dictatorships but they succeeded through courage and statesmanship.  The challenge for us all is to maintain Europe as a Continent of peace, progress and prosperity for the future.  <\/p><p>It is to be welcomed that the European Council confirmed its determination to stimulate growth and jobs in the context of the Europe 2020 strategy and identified the areas that require greater effort.  I welcome the significant progress in implementing the \u20ac120 billion financing package of the compact and that in the coming weeks, the European Investment Bank to adopt its \u20ac10 billion capital increase with the aim of strengthening its capital basis as well increasing its overall lending capacity by \u20ac60 billion.  This should lead to additional investment of up \u20ac180 billion in the next three years.  I welcome the fact that \u20ac55 billion in Structural Funds will be mobilised quickly and effectively and that member states will be helped to reprogramme the structural funds to focus on jobs and growth.<\/p><p>The creation of jobs must be our top priority.  It is totally unacceptable and unsustainable that over 450,000 people are unemployed.  However, there are positives.  Our exports are at record levels, up 12% on last year.  Agriculture is performing well and has huge potential for growth as we head to implement Food Harvest 2020.  The Government's job plan is beginning to work.  We have seen very significant investments by major multinational companies as well as by indigenous companies such as the Kerry Group and Paddy Power.  The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation has ensured that all Departments have a job remit and is successfully addressing the roadblocks to job creation.  Our overseas trade missions are particularly successful and our message that Ireland is open for business is being well received worldwide.  <\/p><p>The availability of finance for small business remains a major problem.  While some initiatives have been announced by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, such as the microfinance agency, the fact remains that banks are not lending to viable businesses at the level required, despite all the money that has been pumped into the banks.  I recently outlined in the House some of the difficulties experienced by businesspeople, which I will not discuss today, but I welcome the recent comments by the Taoiseach that the Government is taking this matter seriously and is determined to ensure that our banks start lending more aggressively to the productive and viable sector.  We must continue to work on improving competitiveness and reducing red tape and regulation and review our local authority costs.<\/p><p>As a country we face huge challenges.  We have a difficult budgetary situation and are in a bailout programme we want to exit as quickly as possible.  Our legacy debt is unsustainable and we must get recognition for saving the banking system of Europe.  Unemployment, particularly youth unemployment, is a major challenge.  As we assume the Presidency on 1 January, we will have an opportunity to further enhance our growing reputation among member states and worldwide.  The Minister of State has an enormous workload ahead of her and has put in a lot of work in recent months in preparation for the Presidency.  We wish her well in her endeavours.  This is a critical time for Ireland and Europe and we are confident that the arrangements are in safe hands.  I thank the Minister for State for her progress to date.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102500012#L00200","speaker":"1118"},{"type":"speech","time":1351161900,"counter":64,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I begin by complimenting her on her presentation, particularly in respect of our Presidency and all the ways in which she has been preparing for that.  It is good to hear that information, particularly the ongoing work to promote greater equality, social cohesion and inclusion in Europe, areas in which I am particularly interested.<\/p><p>I also want to compliment the Minister for State on her work in assisting the Taoiseach in the recent European Council meeting.  In particular, I acknowledge the clarity of her communication with the Irish public during those two very stressful days.  It is critical that the public knows exactly what is going on.  These are complex issues, as the Minister of State well knows.  However, she also knows that complexity should not be a cloak for less transparency.  This is why I particularly welcome her support for public discussion and engagement in EU affairs during the Presidency and I will support her in any way possible.  <\/p><p>My comments will focus on that two-day Council meeting.  The Minister of State provided us with some information on that meeting, which was very helpful this morning.  I still want to raise the question of how we should interpret the negotiations that took place during that meeting as well as the various statements that were released.  Even with the Minister of State's presentation this morning, I am still left wondering about Germany's position.  Are Germany's stance and Chancellor Merkel's statements merely a negotiating position?  For example, is it possible that Germany may have accepted that retroactive recapitalisation will happen?  That is, as the Minister of State is aware, the breaking of the link between sovereign and bank debt that could help us with regard to our historic debt.  Is it attempting to improve the terms on which that will happen?  Is it not the case that Germany first demanded that progress be made on the banking union before the ESM could be used for direct recapitalisation and that this was agreed in June, with most states aiming for the single supervisory mechanism to be established by 2013?  It now appears that Germany is arguing that the ESM may be not be ready until 2014, raising the possibility that Germany is simply delaying the establishment of the ESM so that it can continue blocking the commencement of direct recapitalisation.<\/p> <p> I was very struck by recent journalistic observations on collective EU decision making.  Will the Minister of State comment on this?  Collective EU decision making has been characterised by a tendency to make commitments only in moments of crisis.  In this regard, one should consider the context in which the June bank recapitalisation deal occurred.  There is often unwillingness to carry through on such commitments when matters have stabilised, as was a characteristic of the past week.  Hesitancy exists over implementation.  I am sure the Minister of State is frustrated with this also.  It is problematic and can create the conditions for the next moment of crisis in which commitments will be renewed and ignored again.<\/p><p>There were other issues discussed at the meeting and it was great to hear the Minister of State outline some of those.  However, as she knows, they were overshadowed in the Irish media reports by the confusion over the bank recapitalisation deal.<\/p><p>There was some discussion on the preparation for the European Union's next seven-year budget, which will be decided at the special summit next month.  Britain, in particular, has opposed any increase in the EU budget, but the Commission is asking for \u20ac5.9 billion from member states.  While it does not appear that the Government has indicated major opposition to the size of the proposed budget, it is possible that negotiations could stall and carry over into the Irish Presidency.  This is doubtlessly a point of concern for the Government.  Could the Minister of State provide us with information on the Government's stance on the EU budget negotiations?<\/p><p>I listened carefully to the information the Minister of State provided us with on the Council meeting.  It appeared that the meeting ignored many of the social consequences of the crisis.  That is disappointing given that the Council meeting was, for once, not taking place at a moment of acute financial crisis.  We witnessed several events in the preceding weeks that could and should have pushed some of the social issues to the fore.  These include the mass protests, strikes and riots in Spain, the protests in Greece and the growing strength and influence of the far-right political movement in Greece.  There was some hope that moving out of a state of permanent financial crisis would have allowed leaders time to discuss the resulting social crises in peripheral economies.  If the Minister of State has any more information to share in this regard, perhaps she might provide it to us.  Has there been any discussion on the social effects of the crisis?  When might there be a discussion on this?  The European Union is a union of economies and societies.  How can the link between society and the economy be made visible to citizens?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102500012#L00300","speaker":"1176","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1351162500,"counter":66,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Creighton, to the House to discuss this important issue.<\/p><p>Reference was made to the joint communiqu\u00e9 issued by the Taoiseach and Chancellor Merkel at the weekend.  It was the source of much media commentary, including by fellow politicians in both Houses.  In the communiqu\u00e9, the commitment of 29 June by the Eurogroup to examine Irish bank debt with a view to further improving the sustainability of the bailout programme was reaffirmed.  The reality is not in accord with what those in opposition, specifically the leader of Fianna F\u00e1il, said on this matter.  The recent political poll has gone somewhat to the head of the leader of Fianna F\u00e1il because he missed the point entirely.  This matter concerns Chancellor Merkel's statement on the Spanish debt.  I would have believed that an experienced leader such as Deputy Martin, who was a Minister in previous Administrations, would at least have analysed the document issued by Chancellor Merkel before he dived in to make his comments.  However, the chance to engage in political opportunism is never lost on Deputy Martin.  The reality remains that what one leader said at a press conference and what 27 agreed to do at the formal European Council meeting are different.  The joint communication cleared that up.  Ireland is a special case and it is meeting its commitments.  The Eurogroup will take this into account.<\/p><p>While there is concern over the pace of movement on a debt deal, most politicians in the Oireachtas understand that trying to achieve consensus among the member states takes time.  For this reason, I welcome the deadline of 1 January 2013 for the setting up of a framework that will give the ECB power to intervene regarding any of the eurozone's 6,000 banks.  This is a considerable development and should safeguard Europe and its citizens from having to endure again a crisis as difficult as the one we are experiencing.<\/p><p>I offer the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, my sincere best wishes in the negotiations that will take place, especially on legacy debt and the promissory note.  While it is easy for the Opposition to criticise and trivialise the pace of negotiation, it will be well aware that negotiations and agreement, especially an agreement as sensitive as the one in question, take time.<\/p><p>I spent almost seven years as a member of the Committee of the Regions, the local government arm of the European project.  I noted at first hand the difficulties that arose when dealing with such a large body of representatives, now representing 27 states, and the concerns over the slow pace of negotiation on issues pertaining largely to local government.  The fiscal crisis is the most significant issue that the European Union has ever been required to deal with and the people we are sending to negotiate, including the Minister of State, Deputy Creighton, know what they are doing and will do a good job.  They are doing a good job.<\/p><p>I find it very difficult to accept the criticism coming from the main Opposition party given that, just some years ago, that same party landed this country in its current circumstances.  The Taoiseach, the T\u00e1naiste and Ministers are forging very important alliances across Europe with countries and partners who are sympathetic to the Irish cause.  This was evident on Monday in the outcome of the meeting between the Taoiseach and President Hollande.  Just yesterday, the Taoiseach was named European of the year.  The award will be made at an event to be attended by more than 100 political journalists, representing approximately 120 publications.  I hope that, after this kind of development, there will be deeper understanding among the German electorate of Ireland's special position, as referred to in June.<\/p><p>The Minister of State's outline as to what will happen was brief because she did not have time to go through everything.  However, I welcome most sincerely the efforts that will be made by the Government during its Presidency, particularly through the conferences on youth employment and mobility.  I welcome also the efforts to fix, once and for all, the debt problem in the State and across Europe.<\/p><p>On the last occasion on which the Minister of State was in this House, I spoke about the upcoming Presidency, which is now much closer.  I emphasised to her that, during our last Presidency in 2004, there was a disgraceful display of largesse and a waste of money.  Wealth was being flaunted by driving around in fleets of Mercedes cars, for example.  I do not want to see that in the next six months.  I ask the Minister of State to bring this message back to those who are organising the six month Presidency.  Respect should be had for the current circumstances of the country.  Delegates who are brought here should be given an Irish welcome and treated properly, but the noses of the citizens of Ireland should not be stuck into this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102500013#M00200","speaker":"1162"},{"type":"speech","time":1351163100,"counter":67,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State and I am delighted to have her here.  I am particularly pleased to have somebody here who was close to all of the action that took place in recent weeks.  I also have a spy in the area.  As Members will know, my daughter lives in Paris and she met the Taoiseach during the week.  She told him about the high regard that he is held in.  It was evidenced by President Hollande when he spoke highly of the Taoiseach and the possibility of striking a deal.  His words give us confidence.<\/p><p>  There is no such thing as a free lunch in business or politics.  Will a deal - whatever it will be - cost us our freedoms and result in a federalised Europe?  Is there a danger that a federalised Europe will be created?  Can we benefit from a federalised Europe?  What dangers are posed by a two-tier Europe which has us on the lower tier?  I would be glad to hear the Minister of State's views on the subject.  <\/p><p>  I will concentrate on the other big development at the EU Council meeting.  There was a political willingness to ensure that there is a stable banking system in the entire EU.  The creation of a banking union would be a big step towards overcoming the European Union's debt crisis.  The European Union leaders advanced towards establishing a single banking supervisor for the eurozone as the first of three pillars for the banking union.  It was agreed to start phasing it in next year and it would become operational in their words &quot;probably in the course of 2013.&quot;  EU officials said that all 6,000 banks - I am impressed by the number - in the euro area would gradually come under the supervision of the European Central Bank by 2014.  Banks would receive State aid first and then large cross-border institutions.  Most day-to-day oversight would be delegated to national bodies.  For the Germans, the direct supervision by the ECB should apply only to banks that present a systemic risk while other financial institutions should be supervised by national authorities.  However, the ECG should have the right to supervise if an anomaly is detected.  Given the strange happenings in the banking system in recent years I wonder does that include Irish banks as well?<\/p><p>  I am particularly interested in a statement made by the Czech Prime Minister last week.  He said that his country is prepared to block the creation of a single supervisory system for the European Union's banking sector.  Is the Minister of State aware of his statement?  Does she see such a development as a problem?  For example, the Czechs want to ensure that their national bank would be involved if a western European bank decides to transform a Czech subsidiary into a branch.  That would remove a new branch from the supervision of the national bank in the host country.<\/p><p>  There is still uncertainty about when the European Stability Mechanism - the eurozone rescue fund - will be permitted to recapitalise banks directly.  A development that depends on what they call the effective supervisory system being put in place.<\/p><p>  Can I have an update on the &#8364;120 billion compact for growth in jobs that was adopted in June and put forward by France?  It was aimed at breaking the cycle of austerity.  Do Members remember it?  Only a few months ago President Hollande made the proposal and, in a document released before the summit, Commission President Barroso mentioned that the compact would be launched in 2013 at the latest.  The summit mostly focused on banking supervision.  Can the Minister of State give us some idea of when the stimulus package might be implemented? How will it support projects in Ireland?  What projects will benefit?  There have been indications that structural funds have been reallocated to protect bonds and finance transport, telecoms, digital and energy infrastructure but the specifics are vague.  I would be glad to get some more information on the matter from the Government.<\/p><p>  The Minister of State had been helpful today.  Perhaps she will comment on a view provided, on 22 October, by the <i>Financial Times<\/i> which states:<ul>Mr. Kenny faces a conundrum ahead of Ireland&#8217;s scheduled exit from its bailout at the end of 2013.  With gross debt creeping up to 120 per cent of gross domestic product and economic growth stalled, does he tell the EU the country&#8217;s debt is unsustainable and demand early help? Or should he continue to promote the Celtic comeback story and hope Ireland&#8217;s EU partners decide to lessen its debt burden?    <\/ul>Are we playing a risky game?  If we do not get enough relief from our debt are we back to square one?  What are our other options?  These questions will not be answered this week and probably not next month.  We need answers and the sooner the better.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102500014#N00100","speaker":"1145"},{"type":"speech","time":1351163100,"counter":68,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State and congratulate her on her appointment as Vice President of the European People's Party, EPP.<br \/><font color=\"#222222\">  I wish to discuss three issues.

The first target is for 75% of 20 to 64 year olds to be employed by 2020.  The second target aims to have 3% of EU GDP invested in research and development.  The third target deals with climate change.  The fourth target is on education and aims to reduce school dropout rates to below 10%  and to have at least 40% of our 30 to 34 year olds compete third level education.  The Irish drop out rate for students before the leaving certificate is 16%  The fifth target is to have at least 20 million fewer people at risk of poverty and social exclusion across the Union.  How is Ireland doing with those five targets?  Who is monitoring them?  Will there be an annual report produced on each target?  Will the education target come under the remit of the Minister for Education and Skills?  By 2020 Europe will be a better place - and that is the whole point of the EU - if we work together to achieve the targets.  Economic growth would also increase across the Union.  Each country needs to work on those targets and I am keen to hear how Ireland is doing.  <\/font><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102500014#N00500","speaker":"1131"},{"type":"speech","time":1351163100,"counter":71,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.<\/p> <p>In common with contributors on all sides of the House, I commend her, the Taoiseach and the Government for the initiatives that I hope - with fingers and toes crossed - are beginning to bear fruit.<\/p><p>The Minister of State is entering a challenging time, namely, her first Irish Presidency.  As she outlined, one of the main priorities will be to stimulate growth and to address the challenging issue of unemployment.  These issues are foremost in most people's minds, irrespective or despite of the high flowing economic talk about bank debts, sovereign debts, etc.  Most Europeans will be focused on creating jobs and reducing unemployment rates.<\/p><p>Sunday was a good day for the Taoiseach.  It showed that Ireland has traditionally been capable of building alliances despite our small size.  It is obvious that the rapport between the Taoiseach and Chancellor Merkel resulted in Sunday's statement, but it is vague about what will occur next and does not indicate whether the European Stability Mechanism, ESM, will be allowed to take equity stakes in Irish banks or at what value.  The Government should clarify whether the State is seeking to sell its stakes in the banks to the ESM.<\/p><p>I read a speech made at a conference last week by the Secretary General of the Department of Finance, Mr. John Moran.  He stated that, when the previous Government introduced the State guarantee of the banks in 2008, it took on an exposure of \u20ac375 billion and that the amount had decreased to approximately \u20ac90 billion.  It is still too high and is a drag on our finances.  All of us, even economists of diverse views, accept that the bank debt is unsustainable and must be removed from the sovereign.  Positive news is that the banks are close to functioning without the State guarantee of deposits.<\/p><p>What is the Minister of State's interpretation of the events of the past week?  The best way to handle the promissory note is to extend the period at a low interest rate, for example, zero coupon bullet bonds.  This would have a decreasing effect on the annual requirements of fiscal policy.  While this is a statement of the obvious, are these the types of approaches that the Government considered?  What does the communique mean exactly?  As some economists have stated, it is not enough to point to Ireland as a model pupil, the best boy in the class or a special case.  That the statement issued in Ireland was not issued to the German media seems to suggest that a two-handed game is being played - Angela Merkel is looking to domestic considerations while issuing platitudes to Ireland's special case.  These doubts are spreading in people's minds, irrespective or despite of what one would be churlish not to acknowledge has been a positive week overall.<\/p><p>I wish the Minister of State every success in taking on the challenging role of representing Ireland in the EU Presidency.  On the basis of her experience to date, she will rise to the challenge and Ireland will have another successful Presidency.  We have a long tradition in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102500014#N00600","speaker":"1128","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1351163700,"counter":73,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State and congratulate her on the great work she is doing with the Taoiseach on behalf of our country in Europe.

I had the privilege of speaking in Brussels at a large conference on renewable energy.  A Senator mentioned the issue of energy.  Through the auspices of the Seanad and with the help of the Leader, I used that occasion to ensure the conference would be held in Ireland during our Presidency.  The office of the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, has given its approval.  According to the Minister, the event certainly appeared to fall under the category of events that Ireland would be delighted to be associated with during the Presidency and he would be happy to ask the Presidency co-ordination unit to request formal approval from the Taoiseach.  The Taoiseach has given me his verbal approval and I am awaiting formal acknowledgement.  I also thank the Minister of State, who will afford me her help following my mention of the conference last week.  The conference organiser, the European Forum for Renewable Energy Sources, EUFORES, is funded by the EU and will not be seeking funding from Ireland.  I will not go into the detail of how important renewable energy is to Ireland.  Perhaps the Leader, someone from the Minister's office, someone the Minister of State recommends and I could meet those groups to tie everything together.  This is a bottom-up conference from the Seanad, as it were.  I suppose as this is the Upper House, maybe it is from the top down.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102500015#O00200","speaker":"1135"},{"type":"speech","time":1351163700,"counter":74,"content":"<p>It sounds better than \"bottoms up\".<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102500015#O00300","speaker":"1162"},{"type":"speech","time":1351163700,"counter":75,"content":"<p>The conference will number MEPs, MPs and so on from across Europe.

It is a genuine pleasure when she attends the House to discuss the European project.  I applaud her work in that regard.  I welcome the Taoiseach's award as the European Person of the Year.  What distinguishes him from the other Europeans in the competition is that he is not a waffler.  In comparison, Brussels and Frankfurt are filled to the roof with waffle, complacency and non-performance.  I hope that a signature of our Presidency will be to wake up the EU's bureaucracy, which is not serving citizens.  It issues communiques at 3 a.m. while there is a 50% rate of youth unemployment in Spain and Greece.  Shaking the EU out of its slumber, complacency and cliches should be the Irish Presidency's goal.<\/p><p>I agree with Senator Landy, in that we should have less grandstanding.  Commissioner Van Rompuy and his colleagues have failed miserably the Continent that they are supposed to serve.  It needs the breath of fresh air that the Taoiseach has brought to Ireland.  I hope he will bring it to Europe.  Europe is not working.  The currency has been a disaster and restoring confidence in it will be impossible unless its design faults are tackled immediately.<\/p> <p> The indifference of Brussels, in particular, to the amount of misery it has caused up and down this continent is bizarre to behold, and there is a major democratic deficit.  They are all out of touch with reality.  There have been 25 summits, with press releases at 3 a.m. filled with obfuscation.  Some of the people ought to get real and see what has been happening in the real world.  A successful free trade area has been turned into an extra layer of bureaucracy, many air miles and not much else in results.<\/p><p>I will refer to some of the issues mentioned by the Minister of State.  I agree that we need more democratic engagement.  Some of the leaders in Europe would not be elected to a county council because they are so unpopular and out of touch with reality.  We must deliver results for European citizens and restore trust in the euro area, which was designed badly, and very little has been done to repair the damage.  The Minister of State indicated that more needs to be done and I agree absolutely with that point.  She pointed out that there is vital work being done in examining the position of the Irish financial sector, which has been broken for four years because we were not protected against the tsunami of bad debts.  That was because the euro was badly designed.  We should have put those mendicant bankers on the plane back to Frankfurt on 29 September 2008.<\/p><p>We must break the connection between banking and sovereign debt.  There is very little democratic legitimacy and accountability in Brussels, which is one of the problems mentioned by the Minister of State.  She also mentioned 70 pieces of implementing legislation with regard to the multi-annual financial framework but that is part of the problem.  We never seem to get to grips with the issue because we get more bureaucracy and pieces of legislation.  There is 50% youth unemployment in some countries and 25% total unemployment in some others.  I gather Brussels wants a 4.8% increase in its budget but it is very difficult to defend that, given how it has been asleep at the wheel during these crises.<\/p><p>With regard to skills, \u20ac1 billion was put into F\u00c1S annually when there was 4% unemployment, or full employment.  Separately, Portugal got vast amounts of money for its infrastructure.  Brussels needs a council of economic advisers to ensure its policies are more than aspirations.  There should be some measurement of results, and Europe is very bad at doing it.  The Minister of State has indicated we will play a crucial role in developing EU-US trade relations in Dublin in April.  We are strategically placed because of our contacts with the United States and Europe to perform a very important role, and I wish the Minister of State every success in that regard.<\/p><p>We need a different kind of European Union as the current version has failed its citizens.  It is up to us to change it during our Presidency and I hope the Taoiseach and the Minister of State will be the vanguard of that process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102500015#O00500","speaker":"1157","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1351164300,"counter":78,"content":"<p>There are approximately four minutes left for two speakers.

I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  It is now four months since the summit of 29 June, when a statement was published that included a reference to Ireland.  It is important in the context of this debate to remind ourselves of exactly what was stated.  It read:<ul><br \/>The Eurogroup will examine the situation of the Irish financial sector with the view of further improving the sustainability of the well-performing adjustment programme.  Similar cases will be treated equally.<\/ul>Nowhere in the statement is there mention of legacy or banking debt.  In truth, the statement was bland and a good example of constructive ambiguity that seemed to suit everybody, from those in Germany who were clearly hostile to any notion of a banking deal to the people in this country who were able to return home and oversell the statement.  I agree with Government representatives in that we need to put on the Irish jersey and get behind the Government to get a banking deal.  Nevertheless, it must be about ensuring there is a separation of private banking debt from sovereign debt.  We must lift the burden of that debt from the taxpayers and ensure the action is retrospective.<\/p><p>  Nothing in June's statement or the communiqu\u00e9 issued either by President Hollande or Chancellor Merkel makes any reference to legacy debt or having a deal that would ensure the separation of banking debt from sovereign debt.  Why is it so difficult to hear from the lips of Chancellor Merkel in very clear, simple, unambiguous language that this process will deal with legacy debt?  Would that not lift any suspicion that there is no deal and give us the clarity we need?  It would be good for the people and the economy, as there would be a positive reaction in the markets.  When we get that kind of commitment from Europe, we can be more positive.  Nevertheless, I agree that we must get behind our negotiating team, despite the fact it came very late to the party in even wanting a deal on banking debt.  Had the Spanish not taken a very strong stance, we would not even be in our current position.<\/p><p>  The Presidency is an opportunity for all of us to look forward in a positive way to what Europe can do with the real issues in this State and Europe.  Topics were raised relating to energy, etc., which are important, but jobs and dealing with the unemployment crisis is the big issue.  We must consider a change of direction away from the policies that got us into this mess towards policies that will grow the economy in Europe.  I hope that employment, job creation and an emphasis on youth employment, given the high levels in the likes of Ireland, Greece and Spain, will be the central planks of the Presidency.  If that turns out to be the case, the Government will get the full support of my party and, I am sure, others across the House.  That will help to ensure we have proactive policies required by Ireland and Europe to get us out of the very dire economic mess we are experiencing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102500016#P00300","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speech","time":1351164300,"counter":80,"content":"<p>I will mention some technical issues that I hope we will have the chance to address and perhaps direct some oversight on during the Irish Presidency.  There is a data protection directive coming from Europe and I will attend discussions in Brussels next week about possible research implications.  I will mark the card as there are serious concerns it could affect certain types of cancer research which involve accessing stored tumour samples and records of often long-dead patients.  This research could provide clues and insights into improved treatments for living and future patients but it could become difficult or impossible if the directive is not substantially amended.  One of the problems is that consent cannot be gained from people who are deceased to use what may be very valuable research specimens.  I ask that this be put on the agenda at the highest levels.<\/p><p>There was almost a fiasco ten years ago with a clinical trials directive, which nearly killed all non-drug company funded clinical trials in Europe.  If it had been a regulation rather than a directive, such research would have been eliminated; as it was a directive, there was considerable latitude in implementing or ignoring it.  A regulation will come out in the next year or two and it is important that the Government and the Minister for Health exercise some oversight and alert those in Europe.<\/p><p>The next issue is also health-related.  I would like the Government to consider during its Presidency collaborating with an initiative that I am rolling out this week.  It is a call to stamp out all commerce in tobacco within the EU by a fixed and defined future date, either 2025 or 2030.  The basis for this is obvious as people should not be allowed to do commerce in a cancer-causing addictive toxin.  It is just wrong.  We understand there would be a need for divesting of pension plans, retooling factories and reformatting of agriculture.  Addicts would also have to be given great warnings.  This is not something to be done immediately or a ban on smoking.  Although it does not make smoking illegal, it would make it illegal to do commerce for profit in tobacco.<\/p><p>Will the Minister of State indicate if sufficient attention is being paid to the circumstances of the recent unusual resignation of Commissioner Dalli, who was responsible for health matters?  He was known to be campaigning on an anti-tobacco initiative but found himself under a cloud of accusations that he was attempting to be improperly influenced.  He denies this and there is considerable speculation that dirty tricks from elements within the tobacco industry are involved.  Is attention being paid to the issue in the corridors of power?  It could be relevant in the next six months during our Presidency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102500016#P00400","speaker":"1147"},{"type":"speech","time":1351164900,"counter":81,"content":"<p>I am not sure how long I have.

It will be impossible for me to respond to all the issues raised and I am disappointed.  This is not the first time it has happened in the Seanad but I apologise in advance.  It would be useful for me to respond to the points made.  A number of questions were raised and I will try to address them.<\/p><p>  Senator Leyden asked whether the College of Commissioners would visit Dublin in advance of our Presidency.  The College of Commissioners will visit Dublin on 10 January next and all members of the Government will be involved in that.  In addition and quite interestingly, the European press core will come to Dublin between 8 and 10 January next and that will be a very important opportunity for us to sell Ireland, not only our Presidency and the priorities, but also the country and what we have to offer.  It is a good opportunity to sell soft focus pieces in newspapers and different publications all over Europe and not only in Brussels.  They are two key events at the beginning of the Presidency.<\/p><p>  There were questions in regard to the political groups.  The three key political groups will be in Dublin in November and I will meet all of them.  We are in the process of finalising itineraries for each of those groups, ensuring they have access at the highest level to Ministers, the Taoiseach and the T\u00e1naiste.  Again, that will be a good opportunity for us to ensure they are fully up to speed on what we are doing and the opportunities that present.  <\/p><p>  Senator Leyden also raised a valid point in regard wind and wave energy.  It is part of the agenda in the context of sustainable growth and job creation.  There will be a significant event in the Marine Institute in Galway during the Presidency.  We are very much taking that into account.  In regard to his point on the role of the Oireachtas in scrutiny, the Senator know my views on this, which I have repeated in this House many times.  I am very pleased to hear the Leader has taken those comments on board and that we will move forward in the new year.  As it will tie in extremely well with the beginning of our Presidency, I am and will continue to be very supportive of it.<\/p><p>  A number of Senators raised the issue of the joint communiqu\u00e9 between the Taoiseach and Chancellor Merkel and, needless to say, I agree it is a positive step.  Obviously, a lot of work has to be done on the precise details of what an agreement on reducing Ireland's will look like.  This is a process of negotiation and I cannot tell Senators what the outcome of it will be.  It is certainly important that we entertain all options on the table and that we go with an open mind and with a clear idea of what we want to achieve in terms of Ireland's debt sustainability, which we are doing.<\/p><p>  The Eurogroup of Finance Ministers has been mandated to take that process forward.  While one can say that the Council conclusions or the communiqu\u00e9 are not prescriptive in terms of what the format of a deal should look like, it is very clear that responsibility has been delegated, at least for the time being, to the Finance Ministers and they must come froward with proposals.  I expect that, in due course, they will go again to the Heads of State and Government.  That is the way these things work and that is ongoing.<\/p><p>  I think Senator Healy Eames asked if it would be done by Christmas.  I said in my introductory remarks that we want to ensure we get the best possible deal and we cannot be prescriptive in terms of timing because, of course, it is always giving hostages to fortune.  Maybe some Senators might like if I said it had to be done by a particular date and then it is a great big failure if it does not happen by that date.  I will not give hostages to fortune.  All I can tell Senators is that we are working literally day and night.  I am spending an immense amount of time travelling from one capital to another in preparation for our Presidency but using the opportunity to explore with all our colleagues from all members states, big and small, what we want to achieve for Ireland in terms of debt sustainability.  <\/p><p>  In terms of the timing, of course people like clarity and a clear timeline but, on the other hand, the important thing is that there is confidence in the market that we will get a deal.  We have seen that in recent months in that the cost of Irish borrowing has come down quite significantly.  That is a direct result of the agreement that was achieved in June.  There is an expectation that there will be an arrangement for Ireland.  <\/p><p>  Linked to that, in terms of our capacity to get back to the markets, is confidence that the Government is taking the necessary steps.  There is the external factor in terms of the European Union but there is also the domestic factor, which is equally important.  We have built huge credibility in the past 18 months or so in terms of what we are doing domestically.  We all know it is difficult and painful but it sends a very clear signal to our partners at European level and at a broader global level that Ireland is serious about what it is doing and that it is reducing spending and is getting it under control and, ultimately, it is taking responsibility for its own finances, of course with some guidance and some encouragement from the troika.  Those decisions are not being shirked by the people, Parliament or the Government.  That is really important.<\/p><p>  Some tangible evidence of that is that the day before the summit, when it looked like there would not be an agreement on a timeline for bank supervision - in fact, everybody was predicting that the whole process would collapse without any timeframe for that - we still managed to sell &#8364;500 million worth of treasury bills, which shows there was still confidence in Ireland even though there was doubt over the potential outcome of the summit.  We have seen over the course of the past five or six months repeated successful interventions in the markets by Ireland.  <\/p><p>  Senators might recall that, when we were discussing the fiscal treaty in this Chamber and in public debates last spring, we were talking about a funding cliff in 2014 and that we would have to turn over or roll over about &#8364;15 billion worth of debt.  That cliff has now basically disappeared not by magic, but by the fact that the National Treasury Management Agency has been able to go repeatedly to the markets selling treasury bills and, more recently, selling bonds.   <\/p><p>  The process is under way.  This is not just a desperate attempt to get back to the markets next year.  We have already eased that process and made it more manageable.  The prospect of a debt deal also inspires confidence in the markets.  If we deliver on a debt deal, that will reduce the 121% debt to GDP ratio, which Senator Quinn spoke about, next year.  That will make Ireland look like a much safer bet.  All in all, it is going in the right direction, although that is not to at all underestimate how important it is that we get that debt deal ultimately.<\/p><p>  Senator Mullen referred to the Nobel Peace Prize which is something worth reflecting on.  I completely disagree with Senator Barrett in his castigation of the European Union that it is an abject failure, that it is a failed economic entity, etc.  I do not agree with that.  If one looks at Ireland's experience in the European Union, notwithstanding the difficulties we are experiencing, when we joined our GDP <i>per capita<\/i> was less than 70% of the European average but it is now about 120%.  Times are difficult but from the point of view of Ireland's economy, it has been a success story.<\/p><p>  A few weeks ago I was in Serbia, Kosovo, Albania and Macedonia in the Balkans.  These countries can tell one something about poverty and hardship.  I met their Prime Ministers and European Integration Ministers and the first thing they said to me very clearly was that they wanted to join the European Union.  It is their number one priority.  They are even talking about joining the currency union, notwithstanding the difficulties we are experiencing in the eurozone.  <\/p><p>  I fully agree with the point the Senator made about the flawed architecture of the euro currency and the challenges that exist because we did not create a sustainable architecture and did not create an economic union when we created monetary union.  The EU has come on in huge strides over the past two years in terms of putting in place the kind of economic governance, economic management and co-ordination that is needed to underpin our currency.<\/p> <p> I acknowledge we have further to go.  We must create the banking union, which the Government considers to be paramount.  However, we are getting there and while it is easy to simply assert the European Union is some sort of failed experiment, I fundamentally disagree.  I was in Strasbourg yesterday and with a number of MEPs had the honour of attending a war memorial in the Alsace region in the morning.  When one considers a continent that was riven and in which more than 60 million people lost their lives, we have much to be proud of in the European Union.  No one pretends it is flawless or that we do not face difficulties and challenges.  However, the bottom line is we sit around the table with 27 or 28 member states, hopefully soon to be 33 or 34 member states to solve our issues, disputes and difficulties, as well as our differing national positions, through dialogue and consensus rather than by warfare, be it on the field of battle or economic.  I am much more satisfied to be where we are at present than with the alternative and I feel very strongly about this.<\/p><p>Another question that was raised concerned the availability of funds for small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs.  While that is a domestic question for the Government, it also is a question with which we are trying to deal on a European level.  Sometimes we talk about landing fish in terms of the Presidency.  In other words, the dossiers we can complete during the Presidency are the fish we can land and one of these is the programme for the competitiveness of enterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises, COSME, which is an important and exciting programme that will enable SMEs to access funds.  I am confident that under the stewardship of the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, we will conclude that item during our Presidency.  This is just one aspect or dimension at the European level where I believe we can make progress.<\/p><p>Senator Zappone asked a range of questions to some of which I probably already have alluded.  The question of communicating during the Presidency is really important and the forthcoming European Year of Citizens planned for next year presents us with a major opportunity.  A major programme is in planning at present to involve people at grassroots level all over the country in a dialogue on the future of Europe, as well as for all sorts of cultural events that will promote engagement and partnership between Ireland, communities in Ireland and other countries.  While I have more information to hand on it, I do not really have time to get into it now.  However, I will happily send a note to be circulated to Members of the Seanad to explain a little more about that initiative.  As for whether the German position is a negotiating position, of course it is.  The position of each member state is a negotiating position and we have a real difficulty in this regard.  There is an obvious division in approach at European level as the so-called creditor countries are fearful.  However, if we cannot appreciate how fearful they are, there is something fundamentally wrong with us.  Taxpayers in Germany, Finland, the Netherlands and other countries are fearful and we must appreciate this.  Bullying or stamping our way around the table is not the way to assuage their fears or to bring them around to our way of thinking.  We already have managed to bring them around to our way of thinking in many respects.  For example, the banking union was not on the table until last June.  It is something the Taoiseach proposed at a conference I organised in Dublin Castle last April.  He was one of the first Heads of State and Government to talk about it and it now is a very real prospect.  We are not simply talking about it but are taking concrete steps to achieve it.  Consequently, we must appreciate that people must evolve to our way of thinking and we must help them to do that.  Again, the best way to so do is through dialogue and negotiation.  It is the reason the Taoiseach was in Paris this week and the T\u00e1naiste will be in Berlin later this week.  It is the reason the Taoiseach will be in Berlin next week and is the reason I will travel to Stockholm and Tallinn on Monday and Tuesday.  It is the reason I attended the European Parliament, which is an important player in all this, for two days this week.  Moreover, the Government will continue this round of diplomacy, which I believe to be reaping rewards for Ireland.<\/p><p>In response to one specific question about Germany delaying the creation of the bank supervisory mechanism until 2014, I refer to a crucial point from the conclusions of the Council meeting of Thursday and Friday of last week.  First, we have a date to put in place the legislative framework, which is the end of this year.  While this is something everyone speculated could not happen, it is happening.  Second, the operational aspects will be in place in 2013.  I acknowledge it is not specified whether it will be the first three months or the first six months but it will be during 2013, which also is an important statement.  Consequently, I expect the bank supervisory mechanism will be up and running by the end of next year, that is, before 2014.  Realistically, I believe this is as fast as this can happen.  This is a big deal and a major step and putting in place the legal framework first will be difficult.  As for the operational capacity, the simple things such as the building, the people, who will work there and who will run it are questions that take a little time and do not simply happen overnight.  I consider it to be a reasonable expectation that by this time next year, we will be very close to completing the process.  This will then pave the way for the ESM to be used for direct recapitalisation and, crucially from our perspective, for all the other elements of banking union we seek.  I believe we are well on the way.<\/p><p>I note I am way over time but there were a few questions on the multi-annual financial framework, MFF.  I must revert to the other questions at some other point but on the MFF, the Commission proposal is for a budget of \u20ac1.03 trillion, which is a figure we support.  The Irish position is supportive of that figure because the Government knows the alternative is something much lower.  All of the European Union benefits hugely from the budget but Ireland benefits in particular in the area of the Common Agricultural Policy.  As 85% of our receipts come through the CAP, we have a clear national interest in defending the CAP and in defending our share thereof.  However, it is no secret that certain member states - I believe Senator Zappone mentioned the United Kingdom - wish to significantly reduce the budget.  We do not share that view and consequently are supportive of the Commission proposal, if not all aspects of it, certainly the total figure.  Moreover, we are working very hard to ensure there will be a compromise of which we are hopeful, which is much closer to the aforementioned figure than to a figure that might be proposed by the United Kingdom.  This forms part of the discussions we are having with our European partners.  The Taoiseach will discuss it with the Chancellor next week.  I will be discussing it in all my discussions with other member states and it was a key focus of my consultations in the European Parliament this week, as it has been for some time.  An interesting point on the MFF is that since the Lisbon treaty, it requires the consent of the European Parliament, which makes the latter a hugely important player in all of this.  Consequently, I have invested personally much time with the rapporteurs in the European Parliament who are responsible for the MFF.  They attend informal meetings of my Council, that is, the General Affairs Council, have regular contacts with the Presidency and are a very important player in all of this, as are all the member states.<\/p><p>Senator Barrett also raised a question about the MFF in respect of the 70 legislative measures.  There is no way in which one can have policies without a legal framework.  One can brand it as more European bureaucracy or one can describe it as part of a democratic process whereby legislators, directly elected MEPs and representatives of all the governments, including the Irish Government, take decisions on shaping policies that are of vital national interest to each and every one of us.  I do not perceive that as bureaucracy but as a vital part of the legislative process and as a democrat, I support that fully.  During its Presidency, Ireland will be leading those negotiations on the aforementioned 70 dossiers, which include the CAP reform, the fisheries reform and cohesion.  They include Horizon 2020 and all the research and development measures, all of which must be legislated for.  They do not simply appear but must be legislated and it is a process both of democratic accountability and transparency and an opportunity for each and every Minister who will be engaged in that process to represent our national interest, as well as the overall European interest.  There is much more I should get to but I do not have time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102500017#Q00400","speaker":"1036","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1351165500,"counter":85,"content":"<p>On the energy conference being organised under the auspices of the Seanad and the office of the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, can the Minister of State lend her support on the record?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102500018#R00200","speaker":"1135"},{"type":"speech","time":1351165500,"counter":86,"content":"<p>I have stated my support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102500018#R00300","speaker":"1036"},{"type":"speech","time":1351165500,"counter":87,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102500018#R00400","speaker":"1135"},{"type":"speech","time":1351165500,"counter":88,"content":"<p>Unquestionably, we will happy to work with Members in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102500018#R00500","speaker":"1036"},{"type":"speech","time":1351165500,"counter":89,"content":"<p>We are 15 minutes over time and I suspect the Minister of State also is under pressure.
