This Commencement matter relates to the need for a review of the criteria for issuing permits to farm workers from outside the European Union as a matter of urgency due to the shortage of labour supply.  The Minister of State will be aware as a Minister of State who represents rural and urban communities and people that there is a need and a shortage.  What is really critical is that farmers all over the country are voicing major concerns about the shortage of workers.  The State's largest farm-owned dairy co-operative, Dairygold, has just revealed that milk suppliers have signalled that labour supply is a major obstacle for their future plans.  It is really important.  Teagasc and P&aacute;id&iacute; Kelly, a research officer, have recently raised the issue of the demand, particularly in the dairy sector, as a result of the scrapping of milk quotas and the extra work associated with that in terms of dairy herds.<\/p><p>There is a huge shortage of seasonal workers in soft fruit production, horticultural production and organic production, including vegetables and soft foods.  We are hearing reports about it.  There was a piece in today's <i>Irish Farmers' Journal<\/i>about the shortage of people in the pig and poultry sector.  There is a vast array of agricultural and horticultural industries in this country that could be producing more products and creating more business and revenue for growers, suppliers and retailers.  There is genuinely a shortage.  We also have a situation where people who wish to work are waiting to be processed.  They are seasonal workers, short-term workers and long-term workers.  There are people with skills who are willing and able.  We are members of the European Union and we are finding it difficult to source people within the Union now.  There are challenges in how we address the issue of workers coming into this country to do meaningful work to create wealth and sustain communities.  There is a real need to look at how we can relax the regulations to deal with the crisis.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051000002#B00200","speaker":"1379"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Visit of Saudi Delegation","time":1525944600,"counter":10,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051000002#B00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1525944600,"counter":11,"content":"<p>Before I proceed with the business, on my behalf and on behalf of the Members of Seanad &Eacute;ireann I offer a c&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte, a most sincere welcome, to a parliamentary delegation from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia led by His Excellency, Dr. Ahmed Al-Issa, the Minister for Education.

I come from a rural background and agriculture is a very important part of our economy.  It has played a very important part in our economic recovery.  The good thing about agriculture on this island is that all the regions benefit from it.  It is not just focused on one area.<\/p> <p>Ireland's overarching labour market policy is to promote the sourcing of skills and labour needs from within the workforce of Ireland and the European Economic Area.  In recent years, the employment permits system has been oriented towards highly-skilled occupations which are required for the development of the productive economy.  As the economy improves and we approach full employment, labour as well as skills needs are becoming apparent in some sectors with the consequent potential to constrict growth due to labour shortages.<\/p> <p>It is clear that difficulties are emerging in the agri-sector in particular for low-skilled, lower-waged workers in the horticulture, dairy and meat processing areas.  In recognising the changing economy and labour market and the challenges faced by enterprises in attracting sufficient labour, my officials are undertaking a review of the economic migration policies underpinning the current employment permits system.  The purpose of the review is to ensure our current policies are fully supportive of Ireland&rsquo;s emerging labour market needs, be they skills or labour shortages.<\/p> <p>In undertaking any adjustment in the orientation of the system, the interest of the 230,000 people on the live register in Ireland and the 17.5 million unemployed in the EU 28 must be remembered, and a balance must be maintained that does not disadvantage these jobseekers.  The review is overseen by an interdepartmental group, chaired by my Department, and includes a public and stakeholder consultation as well as an EU and international benchmarking exercise.  A report is expected before the end of June.<\/p> <p>I am aware of the particular challenges facing parts of the agrifood sector which employs over 173,000 people across the regions which, as I said earlier, is nearly 8.7% of the workforce of the country.  It contributes almost 8% to gross national income with exports worth almost &euro;13.5 billion.  It is extremely important to us and it is important that we in government ensure that any constraints that are there are recognised and that demands are met.  It is also a very important indigenous sector and its reach in rural Ireland brings jobs and value to every region.  For this reason, I asked that, in advance of completing the full review, the emerging labour shortages in the sector be prioritised in its deliberations.  The review group has been examining this issue and I expect to be a position to make an announcement regarding the agrifood sector very shortly.  We have been in consultation with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051000002#B00700","speaker":"1272"},{"type":"speech","time":1525944600,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for the comprehensive report.

In the context of Brexit, the agrifood sector is extremely important given the fact that nearly 37% of our exports go to the UK.  It is important we are competitive, that we have lean operations and that we have the necessary labour force in place to ensure we are at the top of the class in what has traditionally been a great source of trade for us particularly with our exports.<\/p> <p>We produce enough of food for 35 million people when we have a population of 5 million so we have to export that food.

Public confidence in high level management in the HSE is at an all-time low and we are all distressed at what is unfolding in the agency.  Only last month we had the Garda Commissioner debacle and now the cervical smear story which is harrowing for the women of this island and their families.  I see an opportunity to revolutionise the way that the Department of Health operates.  However, it will take real tenacity.<\/p><p>I concur with the sentiment of the upcoming motion in the D&aacute;il that Tony O'Brien, the director general of the HSE, should step down.  Irreparable damage has been caused to public trust.  The whole situation is drenched in secrecy.  We must look to a positive future for not just women's health but everyone's, as well as for the health services.  <i>The Irish Times<\/i>reported the recruitment process has already been stalled as the HSE is struggling to define the job description.  If this is not indicative of the complete mismanagement and lack of governance in the HSE, then I do not know what is.  It is bizarre and preposterous to imagine that for years the HSE could not describe the director general's role?  How can there be proper checks and balances, as well as accountability for a role if there is no job description?<\/p><p>It is a year since the Sl&aacute;intecare report was published.  Will the Minister of State give the House an update on where we are with the board of the HSE?  The accountability issue is glaring and it is inconceivable it has been left wide open for so long.  According to the World Health Organization, good governance for health must include transparency, accountability, participation, integrity and policy capacity.  It is obvious to everyone that the HSE administration fell far short of these.  These values must be ensured for the next appointee.<\/p><p>How the Minister manages this process is vital, not only for the general public, but for the warriors on the ground in the health service.  They want someone with a true capacity for leadership and who would be inspiring.  Will he ensure a new fresh face for this post?  Will he ensure the successful candidate will not come from the same toxic environment?  According to media commentary, both deputy director generals and the chief strategy officer could be in the running for interim director general, as could the current HSE finance chief.  In terms of culture, I have grave reservations about this.  The process for finding a new director general should be open, accessible and revolutionary.  The successful candidate must be a progressive agent for change.  The chance is coming to change the captain of the ship.  I hope this process is managed well.  It is interesting to note that none of the current names floating around as possible candidates for Mr. O'Brien's replacement is a woman's.

This will be done in accordance with the provisions of the governing legislation, section 16E of the Health Act 2004, as amended by the Health Service (Governance) Act 2013.  This requires that the recruitment process will be undertaken in line with the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act 2004.

The report advocates a reorientation of the health service towards a high-quality integrated system providing care on the basis of need.

The next director general will, therefore, need to deal with a changing governance environment.<\/p> <p>Under the current system, the director general is the chairperson of the directorate.  The directorate is the governing body of the executive with authority to perform the functions of the executive.  Work is ongoing to bring forward a Bill this year to legislate for the establishment of a governing board for the HSE.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, will be bringing a memorandum to the Government next week with the general scheme for a Bill.

This matter on the Commencement is something I hope we can all work towards.  I ask the Minister to sign a statutory instrument that would allow the sharing of information with the Health Service Executive, HSE, of people's intention to be organ donors.  As the Minister is aware, code 115 on the driver licence indicates the person owning the licence has indicated the wish to become an organ donor.  At this time, unfortunately, the information is not available to the medical profession.  There are currently 2.6 million driving licences held by people in the country issued by the Department.  Since the code was introduced through a European directive, over 400,000 licences were issued between 2013 and 2015, and 40% of those, including learner and full licences, indicated a wish to become organ donors.<\/p> <p>I was nominated by the Irish Kidney Association and I am well aware of the trauma that families go through when asked in a hospital setting if they would consider donating the organs of loved ones.  In most cases they never had the conversation because nobody believes the awful day might arrive when they would be asked that question.  It is through huge generosity on the part of a family that so many lives are transformed and saved by those willing to donate their loved one's organs.  Information is very important.  If families could be informed by organ donor co-ordinators or a surgeon that their loved ones indicated they would like to be organ donors when they filled out the driver licence application, it would make a huge difference to the outcome.  It would make the job of the organ donor co-ordinator easier if such information could be given.<\/p> <p>It would be quite simple for the Minister to do this and it is a two-step process.  I have asked the Oireachtas Library and Research Service to look into what is required and there is no requirement for further legislation.  Under the Finance Act 1993, the Minister responsible for transport has the power to make regulations relating to licensing, and the Minister could make regulations stating that the donor information on driving licences relating to organ donations could be recorded on the national vehicle and driver file.  That is the first step.  The second step would come when the national vehicle and driver file would allow the HSE hospitals or doctors - whoever the Minister feels would be appropriate - to access the information.  Currently, the National Transport Authority, the Road Safety Authority, the Courts Service, the Health and Safety Authority and, most recently, eFlow and Applus, which operates the national car testing service, have been given access to that information.  Unfortunately, the HSE and its doctors would not have access to the information held by the national vehicle and driver file.<\/p> <p>In 2015 the Department assigned a statutory instrument that allowed for those bodies, including those operating road tolls, to access the information.  I ask the Minister to simply sign a statutory instrument to allow the health service to access the information currently held by the national vehicle and driver file so as to make it easier for families to come to a decision if asked to donate the organs of loved ones.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051000002#D00100","speaker":"1414"},{"type":"speech","time":1525944600,"counter":25,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Daly for raising the subject.  It is a constructive suggestion and like all suggestions it has obstacles that sometimes may not be anticipated but it has merit.  I will outline the difficulties but this has enough merit to justify me looking at those obstacles and seeing if they could and should be removed.<\/p> <p>Driving licences in Ireland are in a format set at European Union level.  They include information marked in the form of numerical codes.  Some codes are standard across the EU, but some may be created by member states.  Ireland has taken advantage of this facility to allow applicants for a driving licence to opt to have a code 115, which indicates they are willing to be considered as organ donors.  I have not heard the suggestion before that the information in question might be shared with the HSE.  That does not mean it is a bad suggestion and the definition of a conservative is someone who will not do something for the first time.  It is not a reason this should not be done.<\/p> <p>It would raise a number of important questions.  First, and as the Senator mentioned, there is the matter of data sharing.  The Senator is aware that new EU rules on data protection are due to come into effect from 25 May.  Among other protections, we would need the permission of the data subjects to share their data.  In this case, the difficulty is that people have been asked to indicate, as part of their driver licence application, if they wish to be organ donors.  If they do, a code 115 is marked on their licence.  However, they have not been asked if they are willing to have this data shared with a third party such as the HSE, and it would not be possible to share it without their consent.  It may be possible to add a question to the application form as to whether people consent to the sharing of the information.  As a licence is valid for ten years, it would take a decade to work through the system until everyone willing to share their data was covered.<\/p> <p>There is also a risk to be considered, which is that people might be more reluctant to volunteer to have a code 115 if they had concerns about their data being shared.  I do not know if it is true but it must be considered.  What data would be shared?  Are we talking about the names and home addresses of people who chosen to have a code 115?  Would it include their licence details?  We need to think this through.  Given the general sensitivity to data security and data sharing, there must be a real concern that the number of people opting for a code 115 might drop.  We also need to consider what the societal gain might be in this case.  Consequently, there is a significant body of work to be done before this can be answered.  Is it intended that the HSE could look up lists of potential organ donors, for example, where a patient died and the HSE wanted to know quickly if the patient had signed on to be a donor?  If this is what is intended, there may well be benefits, but I certainly want to hear the HSE&rsquo;s views on this, as well as those of the Road Safety Authority, RSA, before taking any action.<\/p> <p>Taking all of this together, there may be a case for examining whether this should be done but before getting to the stage of asking the RSA to devote any resources to it I would need to be convinced that there was at least some chance of this proposal having advantages for the public.  On that matter I would particularly require the initial views of the HSE.  I will ask the HSE to give me those views and see if I can progress this proposal in a constructive way.  It makes much initial sense and if we can get over the data protection issues, I am prepared to pursue it in response to the Senator's comments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051000002#D00200","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1525944600,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his reply and I welcome his positive response.  Data protection is clearly a concern for everybody but I am not sure of the small print when one applies for a licence.  There is an element of data sharing being signed off as the M50 toll company can now access data, as well as the Courts Service.  It is clearly within the gift of the Minister to ensure others have access to data.  If we can do it for the Courts Service, the Health and Safety Authority and others, I am sure it could be extended to the HSE.<\/p> <p>There is the question of who would access the data.

The issue at this stage relates to the HSE.  Ultimately, the public good arising from this comes from lives being saved and transformed.  Let us suppose the measure brings about even one extra organ donor per annum.  That change alone can transform up to five lives and it would be because of the Minister's action.

The CervicalCheck scandal, the HSE and the hepatitis C scandal are all systems failures.  We have a systems failure as to the reason Apple has abandoned the &euro;850 million data centre in Athenry.  That was abandoned because of a failure in our system in Ireland, which allowed so much delay to be imposed on Apple that it eventually decided to go elsewhere.  In Denmark, the exact same data centre was completed while we had not even gone through the planning process.<\/p> <p>Today we learn about people facing a mass eviction by a mysterious landlord.  Some 40 tenants are being kicked out of their accommodation in north Dublin.  Why?  It is because our housing system does not work and because of the regulations around houses that make it unprofitable for people in the building industry to build houses and the enormous bureaucracy around the Government's current building programme.  There needs to be checks and balances but, ultimately, if the system is too bureaucratic, it will fail people.  <\/p> <p>It has failed Vicky Phelan and Emma Mhic Mhath&uacute;na.  Ms Mhic Mhath&uacute;na gave an emotional interview.  Her five sons, one of whom is just a baby, have a mother who is dying of cancer as a result of a failure of the system.  I thank the Leader for organising the debate on the issue of corporate manslaughter.  The system is saying nobody is liable to face prison because of a systems failure.  We are at the very beginning of this appalling tragedy for women.  We should bear in mind that, of the 240 women who got hepatitis C and HIV because of the blood transfusion scandal, of those 1,700 women who had haemophilia, 112 died because of the blood transfusion service.  Nobody went to jail because the system does not hold any individual accountable for his or her personal failings.  They knew the blood products were contaminated and that people would die as a result but they gave them out anyway.  They did the same in France.  The system failed.  We must either change the system or put people in jail.  Those people do not care whether some other person dies as a result of their mismanagement, as we have seen in the HSE.  If the Corporate Manslaughter Bill had been passed in 2013, as proposed by the Law Reform Commission in 2005, or if it had been passed in 2016, we would not be having inquiries.  We would be having court cases and people would be going to jail.  They would be held to account and, while the system would have failed the people, at least those women would be getting justice.  They are the ones who are dying as a result of mismanagement in the HSE.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051000002#G00300","speaker":"1414"},{"type":"speech","time":1525944600,"counter":33,"content":"<p>We just heard about the system.  It is protected under the guise of a thing called the Carltona doctrine which allows public servants hide behind the Ministers.  This morning's interview with Emma Mhic Math&uacute;na was heartbreaking.  Here was a young woman who did everything right, gave up her job to be a stay at home mother, raised her children and breastfed them when they were babies.  She could not be a more perfect woman in my view.  There is the absolute irony of Tony O&rsquo;Brien, the current head of the HSE, walking out of his job with his pension in his pocket to take up a &euro;65,000 a year job with Evofem Biosciences in San Diego.  Its website shows it \"is dedicated to developing a portfolio of innovative therapeutic solutions to meet the evolving sexual and reproductive health needs of millions of women globally\".  What sort of a bloody irony is that?  The man who presided over the CervicalCheck scandal in this country is going to a company that claims this.  According to the Evofem website it is \"science with a soul\" providing \"innovative healthcare solutions\" that \"elevate the lives of women\".  They develop \"woman-controlled, easy-to-use and accessible products.  Because when a woman is in complete control today, she is in greater control of tomorrow.\"  What sort of a company would employ a man who has just presided over this disaster?<\/p> <p>I am sure all the bloody words we say in here are worth nothing to the 200-odd women who today are not sure of their future and to that poor woman who spoke this morning.  It is all hot air because nobody is accountable.  Nobody ever is accountable in this country.  We walk away.  If there is any sign that somebody is going to become accountable we give them their pension and ask them to leave and they sail off into the sunset.  Goddammit this has been going on since the scandals that led to the economic crash.  That was only money.  Now we are talking about lives.<\/p> <p>Somebody in the HSE knew and sat on that information and denied it those women.  If it was my wife, my daughter or my sister, I would be down there with a gun today looking for them.  I cannot begin to imagine the pain and suffering that has been caused.  I meet ordinary women in the street, good friends of mine who have had a clear diagnosis and tests and they are happy but they went through hell worrying anyway.  I said it last week.  I am at the age where I get a bowel screen every couple of years.  I am wondering should I trust that.  For some peculiar reason it seems the women in this country always get caught in these disasters.  That is what they are.  I do not know that a debate will do anything here.  I would love a Minister to come in here and lay out who got the message first.  What is his or her name?  Who did he or she pass that message to?  What was the line of communication that brought that to the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, a few minutes before he walked into the D&aacute;il?  Give us the names of those people and tell us how they are going to be held accountable.  Dammit to hell it is the very least the citizens of this country deserve and maybe if we do that, we will finish up in the situation that no public servant will ever again hide information.<\/p> <p>I apologise to the women of Ireland for adding more bloody hot air to the concerns they have because that is all that is coming out of Leinster House at the moment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051000002#H00100","speaker":"1390"},{"type":"speech","time":1525944600,"counter":34,"content":"<p>I welcome the decisions by Facebook and Google this week to place restrictions on online advertising on their platforms in respect of the upcoming referendum on the eighth amendment.  I also want to raise the issue of campaign regulations in elections and referenda in Ireland more generally.  Reports have emerged over the past few weeks that Irish voters have been targeted by a range of deeply worrying social media campaigns, mainly in the form of dark advertising paid for by overseas actors which feature blatant untruths, biased information and misrepresentations of the issue we will vote on in two weeks.  What most disturbed me was that many of those advertisements were intended to come up during kids' YouTube clips such as cupcake making.  Youth Defence advertisements were coming up in very strange places telling kids to ask questions of their parents that they should not be forced to ask until their parents feel it appropriate to have those conversations.<\/p><p>The move by Facebook and Google is timely and proportionate to the concerns raised affecting the &quot;Yes&quot; and &quot;No&quot; campaigns equally and allows for a level playing field where digital advertising will have an organic and no longer disproportionate reach based on opaque and unaccountable funding sources.  I particularly recognise the role played by our colleague, Senator Higgins, and the media in uncovering these tactics, particularly <i>The Times<\/i>, Ireland, and Channel 4, which showed a segment on the issue last night that I encourage everyone to watch because it highlighted just how underhanded and worrying these techniques are.  We should not have to rely on media investigations and the actions of private technology companies to safeguard the integrity of our democratic system.  We are trying to regulate a 21st century campaign with 20th century campaign law which does not incorporate or address in any way the growth of the Internet and social media as a campaign tool and is not fit for purpose.  The strict regulations that we apply to broadcast and print traditional media must now be replicated in the digital spheres particularly in the light of what we know to be true about the recent US presidential election, the Brexit vote and the growth and proliferation of fake news.  <\/p><p>We need to also consider electoral reform as the referendum process has shown up several significant drawbacks in the system.  We need to create a full-time electoral commission, further empower the Standards in Public Office Commission, create a larger role for the Referendum Commission in respect of fact-checking and responding to the debate, initiate a major update of the registration system to include e-registering and provide greater access to postal voting, arrangements for overseas and emigrant voting and for the removal of cumbersome administrative barriers such as a garda witnessing a simple change of address.  These are not difficult or controversial ideas but they would make a significant impact on the workings and operation of our democratic process.  Can the Leader invite the Minister of State with responsibility for electoral reform to update the House on his proposals in this area?  I would also be happy to consider legislative reform in the terms of a Private Member's Bill and for any Senators to work with me on that.<\/p><p>I echo what the previous two speakers said about the CervicalCheck scandal.  I was not here last week when the statements were being made but I was one of those who had to ring that helpline.  For many years, I have had to have pre-cancerous cells removed.  My last smear was the first in ten years that was clear and I wondered was that smear that I had celebrated wrong.  There are 200 women in a much worse situation than me but I was left to question my own health after ten years of abnormal smears.  I support anything that is said about accountability in this area. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051000002#H00200","speaker":"1404"},{"type":"speech","time":1525944600,"counter":35,"content":"<p>I did not have the opportunity this week to express my sadness at the death of Monica Barnes, former Deputy and Member of this House.

I express my strong welcome for the announcement this week by Google that it would stop hosting all advertisements related to the referendum and hope Facebook will follow suit.  What we were seeing in the widespread buying of advertising by a particular side was an attempt to manipulate the outcome of the referendum.  As others said, we saw extensive use of social media manipulation in the Brexit referendum and the election campaign of President Donald Trump.  There are huge concerns surrounding the use of data by Cambridge Analytica and others.  I commend Senator Alice-Mary Higgins and other members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment for bringing up this issue, inviting representatives of Facebook and Google to appear before the committee and really pushing for change in this area.  I really welcome that change which will see a fairer process in the remaining 15 days of the referendum campaign.  <\/p><p>Like Senator Lynn Ruane, I would like to see more extensive reform beyond the regulation of social media and digital advertising, which clearly is needed.  We need to see the reforms the Senator mentioned, including greater powers for the Referendum Commission and the Standards in Public Office Commission.  We also need more extensive provision for postal voting and a less cumbersome application process to participate in postal voting and for late registration.  There are two areas in which we have really fallen down as legislators in regulation, one of which is regulation of the content of posters which has become a huge issue in the referendum campaign.  We are all being inundated with queries from constituents and others who are concerned about lies and misrepresentations on posters.  Clearly, a body, either the Referendum Commission or a permanent electoral commission, should be empowered to take and address complaints, if necessary.  We also need to impose a spending cap in referendum campaigns.  There is a cap in every other type of election campaign but not for referendum campaigns.  The absence of a cap facilitates the undermining of the democratic process, whereby one side can outspend another.  We must look very carefully at the regulation needed to make our election and referendum processes fairer and more democratic in the future.  <\/p><p>I inform colleagues that we heard very powerful testimony this morning at the meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade and Defence from Dr. Annie Sparrow, a paediatrician who has worked extensively in Syria.

She has been trying to stem the outbreaks of polio in Syria as a result of the catastrophic war that has been ongoing for the past seven years.  I was encouraged and motivated by her presentation to try to renew a cross-party motion on Syria.  The Leader has been very helpful in that regard.  I have also received support from all colleagues, with the unfortunate exception of Sinn F&eacute;in Senators.  I hope that this time we will see support from Sinn F&eacute;in for an all-party motion on Syria condemning the appalling atrocities being committed against civilians.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051000002#H00300","speaker":"1402","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525944600,"counter":37,"content":"<p>I hope Senator Ivana Bacik has made contact with the Sinn F&eacute;in office for foreign affairs on that issue-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051000002#J00200","speaker":"1378"},{"type":"speech","time":1525944600,"counter":38,"content":"<p>Perhaps the Senator might send me the contact details.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051000002#J00300","speaker":"1402"},{"type":"speech","time":1525944600,"counter":39,"content":"<p>-----because I have no doubt that a compromise can be reached, but it needs to be done properly.<\/p> <p>Anybody who listened to \"Morning Ireland\" this morning would have heard Ms Emma Mhic Mhath&uacute;na, a 37 year old mother of five children, say she was dying but did not need to be and that her anger outweighed her fear of dying.  While I hate saying this, the question must be asked as to whether it amounts to corporate manslaughter.  What has happened to women like Emma which did not need to happen is absolutely scandalous, yet nobody is accountable.  I met the man in charge coming out of a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts as I came to the House.  What does it take?  What is it going to take for somebody to be held accountable?  What is it going to take for somebody to put up his or her hands and say, \"This happened on my watch.  It happened under me\"?  I am not going to say any more about it today because I have no doubt whatsoever that there will be another Emma next week.<\/p> <p>I want to look at the process of reconciliation on the island and the way it was turned into a political farce yesterday at Westminster.  Victims have been let down by Mrs. Teresa May in preferring to pander to the worst elements of the Tory Party.  I heard her being interviewed by Mr. Andrew Marr on Sunday when she made the scandalous suggestion everybody should be forced to speak the Irish language, as well as other nonsense that just beggars belief.  The information she gave on legacy cases was inaccurate and is directly contradicted by the PSNI.  The majority of historical investigations are being carried out into the actions of republicans and loyalists.  An immediate release of funding for the legacy inquest plan is required for the commencement of consultation.  Yesterday's actions at Westminster showed that the idea of nationalists taking seats there was more irrelevant than ever.  I hope the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Simon Coveney, as co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement robustly responds to these false claims.  Reconciliation and closure are needed by all those who have suffered as a result of the conflict.  This needs honesty and openness, not political meddling by a dysfunctional government in Britain.  Some families have been waiting for 40 years for an inquest into the deaths of their loved ones.  The funding must be released and the process must begin.  The worst scenario is for people to die and never know the true account of what happened to their loved ones.  There is a lot of nonsense going on.  Just because people are wearing a uniform does not make them exempt in the context of criminal activity.  They should not hide behind this; neither should Mrs. May.  Progress is needed and the Government must stand up on the issue.  Some of the commentary I have heard suggests it has done so, but it really needs to stand up to the British Government and not let the nonsense from Mrs. May, backed up by the Secretary of State, Ms Karen Bradley, go unchallenged.

Sadly, each health issue has stand-alone importance.  I want to speak about the 12,000 people who are living with Parkinson's disease.  There is an excellent branch of the Parkinson's Association of Ireland in my county which is home to 200 sufferers.  It is a hugely difficult disease for the individuals affected and their families.  The Parkinson's Association of Ireland has 19 branches nationwide.  It employs a CEO and an administrator and runs a helpline.  It receives no direct funding from the State, unlike several other support groups for those affected by various degenerative neurological conditions.  A nationwide Parkinson's disease nurse specialist service which has proved to be worthwhile needs to be supported.  The availability of more nurses would reduce the number of inpatient stays in dealing with problems early.  There are five such posts, one of which has been vacant for months.  It is about to be filled by a part-time nurse specialist, but more specialist nurses must be recruited to cover all areas of the country and provide essential services for those with Parkinson's disease who have the same rights as any other group.  It is disgraceful that I even have to raise the matter in the House.  Deep brain stimulation surgery can greatly alleviate the symptoms of the disease for some patients, but it is not available in Ireland.

These results were previously inaccurately reported.  It is a challenging time for them, their families and for the wider community as well.  It is also a challenging time for people working in the health service.  The workload in all of the clinics across the country has increased dramatically.  I refer to general practitioners and everyone involved in the healthcare area.  We should support them.  It is also important that we plan for the future.<\/p> <p>One of the problems, about which we need to do something, is to provide a huge amount of information and that is lacking.  The whole process of the screening programme may, to an extent, have given a false impression that once a person got the result they were guaranteed that it was proof of safety.  It now turns out that it was not.  The big issue in this case was that smears were taken which clearly identified there was cancer but that was not identified.  That is the issue now.  There is also the wider issue that none of these health programmes is 100%.  We need to get a lot more information out there.  I agree with colleagues in that regard.<\/p> <p>There is a need for accountability.  The person who was in charge of CervicalCheck has stepped aside and another person is no longer in the post they held.  They were in charge of the whole CervicalCheck programme.  However, much more needs to be done.  One of the issues in respect of litigation in the medical area is that the only people who are in the courts are the doctors and nurses.  There is no accountability among people in administration who may have delayed the process of getting the claim dealt with.  We need far more accountability.<\/p> <p>Also on litigation, we need to be mindful that last year something like &euro;300 million was paid out in claims.  There was then &euro;300 million less for healthcare.  It does not come directly from the healthcare budget, but it comes from the overall budget.  If we settled every current claim, it would cost over &euro;2 billion.  We need to be mindful that we need to put in adequate resources so we can reduce the level of litigation.  When errors occur, it is important that people are adequately compensated.  It will never put them back into the position they were in prior to the error being made but it is important that is taken into account as well.  We have a major challenge.

Anyone who has a wife or kids would feel it is the big issue at which we have to look.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Tim Lombard:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2466\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2466&amp;amp;pid=TimLombard&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=10\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The confidence is not there.  We have to grasp the nettle and deal with these issues in the short term.<\/p><p>I intended to raise an issue mundane in comparison, namely, the lack of ESB power in my part of the world over the past six to eight months.  We have experienced at least seven power outages affecting large parts of Carrigaline, Minane Bridge and Nohoval, with some almost reaching Kinsale.  Yesterday, the power was out again, as it was last Sunday for three hours.  ESB has a Third World network in parts of the country and that needs to be addressed.  It is an issue that the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment must be aware of in order that he does something to ensure people have continuous electric power.  It is a basic service in this day and age and it is bizarre that there have been seven outages in this part of the world since last November.  This needs to be brought to the attention of the Minister and ESB Networks to ensure we do not continue to experience these outages going forward.  It affects the credibility of our tourism industry and it also has a damaging affect on our agricultural industry and on householders who had no power for three hours on a Sunday of a bank holiday weekend.  The Minister needs to talk to ESB Networks to get something done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051000002#K00500","speaker":"1386","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525944600,"counter":47,"content":"<p>I extend my sympathy and gratitude to Emma Mhic Mhath&uacute;na following her moving interview this morning and for telling her story.  It must not have been easy.  It is a dark day for the country.<\/p> <p>I am perplexed by the Minister for Education and Skills' proposed policy on school place allocation.  He has hit on a new policy of intrinsic discrimination.  Under the proposed legislation, if pupils seek to enrol in school with a Catholic ethos and they are Catholic, from the catchment area and their parents and siblings or both have attended the school, there is no guarantee of a place but that place could be allocated to a pupil who is not Catholic, does not prescribe to the ethos of the school, does not have parents or siblings who attended the school previously and who probably has little or no ties to the area.  Why is it okay and good to discriminate against children who are intrinsically linked to schools in their area?  Will the Leader invite the Minister to come to the House to explain this crazy policy?  Perhaps the newspaper reports are not correct but if they are, they are beyond belief.<\/p> <p>Following the horrific radio interview I mentioned, Ms Catherine Heaney of the National Museum commented on its good working relationship with the Houses of the Oireachtas and she also mentioned the \"very nice space in front of Leinster House\".  Ms Heaney would be better off concentrating on the museum's work.  The beautiful, tactile room we are in now was used for storage prior to us restoring it to its current grandeur.  It would be better if Ms Heaney looked after the affairs of the museum and did not worry about Leinster House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051000002#L00200","speaker":"1411"},{"type":"speech","time":1525944600,"counter":48,"content":"<p>I wish to raise again services at the National Rehabilitation Hospital, NRH, D&uacute;n Laoghaire and the provision of rehabilitation services throughout the country.

Last week, I received a letter from the Taoiseach about it, and while I appreciate his response and the request he has made of the Minister for Health, who is understandably busy this week, to report back to him, some of the same 12 beds that were closed in the hospital during the first week in January 2017 remain closed this week.  The hospital board and management want to reopen them.  We have been informed that the HSE has a funding difficulty in this regard.  Six of the beds have been reopened but six remain closed.  It is a scandal at a time when our hospitals are in crisis and there are substantial waiting lists to avail of services in the NRH.  Patients who are due to transfer to the hospital are blocking beds in other acute hospitals through no fault of their own, which is unsatisfactory.  I have spoken to the Leader previously about this matter and he has pursued it, but it is important to keep it on the agenda.

It is one of the hardest and most heartbreaking interviews I have ever witnessed.  I compliment Ms Audrey Carville on the manner in which she conducted that difficult interview.  It really brings home in the starkest form the reality of what has happened in our health service.  Ms Mhic Mhath&uacute;na went on to describe a dream she had that she was passing away and losing her life but she did not get the opportunity to say goodbye to her children.  It was heartbreaking and I cannot imagine for one minute what that lady and her family are going through.  We owe it to her and many others to get to the bottom of this so that confidence can be restored in our health services.  The quicker we get to that point, the better.<\/p> <p>I rise today to mention another matter that caused me great concern and alarm when I came across statistics from the Central Statistics Office, CSO.  They indicate over 300,000 crimes were committed by people on bail in this country between 2003 and 2016.  That works out at a startling 2,000 crimes per month committed by criminals out on a bail merry-go-round, if I can call it that.  We are all aware of numerous examples of serious crimes committed by people on bail, sometimes tragically ending in a fatality, with innocent people losing their lives.  It is a scandal that needs to be addressed.  We cannot allow the position to continue where innocent people are exposed to burglary or serious crime committed by people out on bail.  We have a duty to protect innocent people and they should be our priority.<\/p> <p>I know there is a commitment within the programme for Government on the electronic tagging of criminals out on bail.  This must be fast-tracked.  We can consider that the cost of keeping a person in prison for 24 hours is approximately &euro;160 compared with the estimated &euro;6 per day cost of electronic tagging.  It is time for it to be introduced so our citizens can get proper protection.  For that reason I ask the Leader to invite the appropriate Minister to the House to advise us on the status of this legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051000002#M00100","speaker":"1396"},{"type":"speech","time":1525944600,"counter":60,"content":"<p>At the outset I thank colleagues who supported the Bill I brought before the House last evening seeking to bring transparency and enhanced accountability to the local government sector in Ireland.

In essence, he raised the need for more investment in services for those with Parkinson's disease.  It is a degenerative neurological disease which is devastating for those affected and their families.  It is important that services are provided, including day care, helpline support and administration.  Senator O'Reilly makes a good case for direct Government funding for the association and I am happy to invite the Minister for Health to the House to discuss the matter further.<\/p><p>I agree with Senator Paul Daly that history and geography should be core subjects in our education system.  They encourage curiosity and enhance our ability to understand our past to know where we are going.  This is essential in the context of the knowledge economy and I agree with the Senator's remarks in that regard.  I am not sure why the Senator raised this matter but I am happy to invite the Minister for Education and Skills to the House to discuss it further.<\/p><p>Senator Colm Burke also raised the issue of litigation and we will have that debate in due course.  Senator Devine raised the matter of the appointment of the next director general of the HSE.  I share her concerns and her view that the appointment process should be open and transparent.  My understanding is that the post will be advertised through <i>publicjobs.ie<\/i>, as with all other public sector appointments.  The Public Appointments Service is independent of Government but we certainly need to look at how we advertise senior posts.  As with the appointment of a new Garda Commissioner, I hope that we can reach beyond our own shores if necessary.  The position of director general of the HSE is a very important one and I am of the view that it should have been advertised before now.  If one takes the example of the GAA, when its director general, Mr. Paraic Duffy, announced his intention to retire, his post was advertised immediately.  It is important that we get it right in the context of the HSE.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051000002#N01100","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1525944600,"counter":85,"content":"<p>Maybe we should scrap the HSE all together and bring it all back into the Department of Health.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051000002#N01200","speaker":"1390"},{"type":"speech","time":1525944600,"counter":86,"content":"<p>The Sl&aacute;intecare report, which is the roadmap for the future of health services in this country, has sections dealing with that issue.

The job is an important one and I accept the points made by Senator Devine about the criteria for the appointment and how it is done.  I am of the view that it must be done in a public and transparent way.  I am sorry that the Minister could not be here today to discuss it.  I did not see the reply the Senator received to the Commencement matter that she raised but we will have that discussion as part of a general debate on health in the coming weeks.<\/p> <p>Senator Lombard raised the issue of the ESB and the lack of power in Carrigaline, Minane Bridge and Kinsale over the bank holiday weekend.  This illustrates the need for investment in and the upgrading of the ESB network.  I know that the ESB is doing work in some parts of Cork at the moment, but it needs to take note of Senator Lombard's remarks also.<\/p> <p>Senator Davitt raised the issue of potential amendments to the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill by the Minister for Education and Skills.  My understanding is that the catchment area condition will not be affected.  If a pupil is living in the catchment area of a school, he or she will not be affected.  The Minister has announced that he is removing the role of religion in school admissions for virtually all primary schools.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=10\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->He will provide that Irish language schools will give priority to Irish-speaking children.

We all agree that that should not be the case, as I do as a school teacher.  Parents should not feel pressured to have their children baptised to gain access to the local school.  That is what we are trying to change.  We are not being discriminatory.

It warrants us posing the question as to why the other six beds are not being opened if money has been allocated and the Minister for Health and the Taoiseach are committed to opening them?  The Senator attended the opening with them.  It beggars belief that the HSE has not done what it was asked to do, but, as I said, I do not have the answer for the Senator that he requires.

It is about talking, sharing and working together to alleviate the sense of loneliness, depression, isolation and vulnerability to ensure better mental health for everyone.<\/p> <p>I commend Senator Robbie Gallagher's research into the bail figures to determine the numbers of those who reoffend.  The numbers are startling and highlight the need to continue to shine a light on the issue of those who are granted bail.  If we believe in restorative justice and rehabilitation, we cannot incarcerate everybody.  There would not be prison places for the 3,000 people in question, some of whom should not be in prison.  The Senator is right - there is a need to address the issue to monitor those who offend repeatedly and send a proper message in that regard.  I am mindful that it was the Senator's party, under the great John O'Donoghue, which promoted the concept of zero tolerance.  I wonder where it went, but it is an issue that needs to be highlighted.

Yesterday we celebrated Europe Day.  On 9 May 1950 Robert Schuman, the then French Foreign Minister, issued a declaration in which it was proposed to place French and German production of coal and steel under one common high authority.  The post-war policy had been to boost French production of coal and steel at the expense of Germany which had lost control of the mines in Saarland and the Ruhr valley.  Putting control of the materials of war in new, safe hands was a radical move.  Robert Schuman knew that it would make it much more difficult for either side to return to war.  The then German Chancellor, Konrad Adenauer, recognised immediately that it was a magnanimous offer, as did the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg and Italy.  The following year the European Coal and Steel Community was created when the Treaty of Paris was signed.  While the immediate, ostensible focus of the declaration was on coal and steel production, the real underlying intention was to create common interests that would hasten European integration.  Robert Schuman was a French politician who was born in Luxembourg in 1886.  His father had fled there from France when part of his native Lorraine was occupied by Germany after the Franco-Prussian War.<\/p><p>We do not have time today to go through every twist and turn of Robert Schuman&rsquo;s colourful life, but he had every reason to put all of his energy into stopping another war.  As an MP between the First and Second World Wars, he worked on the harmonisation of laws in Alsace and Lorraine with French law after that region had become French again.  During the Second World War he was arrested for acts of resistance but was spared from being sent to Dachau.  He was an advocate of Franco-German reconciliation long before it became fashionable.  We can guess that his European spirit had been formed much earlier in his life.  He was educated in Luxembourg, Metz, Berlin, Munich, Bonn and Strasbourg.  We could say he was the original Erasmus student.  Part of his genius was that he understood he could not secure his European vision overnight.  In what must be the most oft-quoted lines in the declaration he said:<\/p><blockquote>Europe will not be made all at once, or according to a single plan.  It will be built through concrete achievements which first create a de facto solidarity.<\/blockquote> <p>Ireland was not a signatory to the Treaty of Paris, nor was it one of the original six that signed the Treaty of Rome in 1957, but we are still part of Robert Schuman&rsquo;s legacy.  He was clear that his declaration &quot;may be the leaven from which may grow a wider and deeper community.&quot;  The wider and deeper community that has emerged is the European Union, of which Ireland is an active member.  Membership has given us barrier-free access to the world&rsquo;s biggest markets.  Support for the agriculture sector has kept rural communities alive and given European consumers the assurance of safe, high quality food at affordable prices.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Helen McEntee:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2394\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2394&amp;amp;pid=HelenMcEntee&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=10\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Membership has paved the way for social progress.  It has amplified the voice of small countries such as Ireland on the global stage.  In short, membership has transformed our country.  Membership gives us a say on the issues small countries such as ours cannot tackle alone, for example, Europe is the world's biggest importer of fuel.  Collectively, we spend &euro;350 billion every year on fuel imports.  The challenge now is to invest heavily in the new technologies that will make us more self sufficient in fuel terms, allow us to cut our energy costs, reduce our carbon footprint and make us more adept at tackling climate change.<\/p><p>Although we have made great strides in gender equality, our EU economies would gain &euro;13 billion per annum if we could eliminate the gender gap completely.  Equally, we could add &euro;415 billion to the EU's gross domestic product, GDP, if we could complete the digital single market, and we have no choice but to do so, if we want to take advantage of the second digital revolution.  Completing the digital single market and the single market in services would reap huge dividends for Ireland too since more than half our exports are in services and more than half of our labour force works in the services sector.  We have a clear and vested interest in bringing to bear our influence on the future of Europe debate.  <\/p><p>While we celebrate Schuman's 1950 vision for Europe every year on 9 May it is arguably more significant this year as we face into an uncertain future with only 27 members following the decision of the UK to leave the European Union.  Of course these conversations need to be held on the future direction of the EU and how we want it to work for us but they happen in the context of the difficult issues we have faced over recent years, the financial crisis, the migration crisis, the recent terror attacks on EU soil that have tested member states, the growth of Euroscepticism in some member states and furthermore, in the aftermath of Brexit.  The upcoming budget cycle as well as political developments in other parts of the EU have underlined the need for these discussions to take place. <\/p><p>Yesterday, we marked Europe Day by hosting a national citizens' dialogue on the future of Europe.  It was the culmination of a process launched in November that took us around the country listening to the needs and concerns of our own citizens across the regions and within voluntary and community organisations.  At each session we asked participants for their views on our prosperity and competitiveness, our future sustainability, what a socially responsible union should look like, how to tackle globalisation and how to work with our European partners to deliver a safe and secure Union.  Our work was complemented by the work of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs which has held its own hearings on the future of Europe.  I was glad that the Chairman of the committee, Deputy Michael Healy-Rae, and many other committee members, including Senator Richmond, participated.  The debate was a stimulating one and now that we are beginning to pull together the feedback from each session, I have no doubt that Ireland's contribution to the broader European debate will be all the better because of it.<\/p><p>Senators will have seen the results of the EMI-Red C poll published earlier this week showing that support here for membership of the EU is higher than ever at 92%.  Among 18 to 24 year olds support for membership is at 97% which is an unbelievable high figure.  What struck me most about the poll was the staggering response to the question about public engagement: 92% of respondents said it was important that Irish people have an input into the future of Europe debate.  This chimes with, and reflects, the response I got at our regional sessions of our citizens' dialogues.  Everywhere I went the feedback was the same.  Everyone appreciated that we had come to listen to what they had to say and they felt this process should not just happen once in a blue moon or after a crisis but should be continuous. <\/p><p>The European Union's Committee of the Regions has just published its report on the future of Europe, following a yearlong listening exercise across 81 regions and 114 cities.  It found that people are enthusiastic about the EU, but feel disconnected.  It wants high levels of transparency and, as we heard ourselves, it wants Europe to be more active in education, the environment, security and tourism.  Those areas were mentioned in citizens' dialogues, particularly education and investment in research and innovation if we are to prepare for the changing world ahead of us.  The Committee of the Regions says the most significant issue mentioned was a demand for more solidarity.  This was echoed at our sessions where the message was one of fairness in the workplace, between communities and inter-generational fairness.  People want to be sure that the younger generations are given the opportunities to progress in developing their careers, families and other areas but also that older people are given the opportunity to retire with peace and dignity. <\/p><p>Another message in the report of the Committee of the Regions that we need to attend to was that people trust their local and regional politicians most, in some instances more than they trust national or EU politicians.  This puts a tremendous responsibility on us to engage with our citizens on European issues.  People will respond when policies, even complex policies, are explained to them or there is engagement on them.  If we have learned one thing from the Brexit debacle, it is that we must connect better with our own citizens and bring them and the European Union closer to one another.<\/p><p>As Robert Schuman said, we build this solidarity through concrete achievements.  This work is never complete but far from futile.  On the contrary, it makes debates like the one we are having here today indispensable and I thank the Cathaoirleach for making time available today for these statements.  I look forward to hearing the Members' contributions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051000002#O02400","speaker":"1337","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525944600,"counter":112,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House and reflecting on the future of the European Union.  Fianna F&aacute;il has long been an advocate of the European Union since its leadership in the accession process of 1973.  Membership of the European Union has led to a social and economic transformation of this country that would have been unimaginable 100 years ago.  It would not be possible for Ireland to negotiate on its own but because of the wisdom and guidance of T.K. Whitaker and the Department of Finance in 1958 in the paper on economic development and the programme that Whitaker put in place coupled with has the ability to trade with Europe and beyond under trade agreements that Europe has put in place on our behalf.<\/p> <p>Like any institution the EU has its faults.  The White Paper produced in March 2017 by the European Commission sets out the possible paths for the European Union.  There are five options including: to carry on as we are; to have nothing but the Single Market; that those who want more do more, a kind of multi-track process, elements of which have been put in place by some doing less more effectively and efficiently; and doing much more together, all of which have their own challenges considering that the daily management of the EU is its own huge challenge.  Brexit is a particular challenge.  It is of little concern the further one goes from Ireland.  One of my Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues met a Cypriot MP who believed that Ireland was leaving as well as Britain which shows how little understanding there is on the periphery of Europe, especially in eastern Europe.<\/p> <p>I know the Minister of State is daily involved in getting across the message of the effects of Brexit and the importance of supports from the European Union by relaxing state aid rules.  The Minister of State outlined the public support for Europe in the recent opinion poll.

They are all done at the last minute as we saw recently with the debate on the Data Protection Bill 2018 which went on until midnight, with a deadline.  I was involved in the organ donation legislation, following an EU directive, which was the first ever Act on organ donation passed by the Oireachtas.  That was done by the Minister for Health in the past month without a debate at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health or in either House. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018051000002#P00200","speaker":"1414"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1525944600,"counter":113,"content":"<p>Additional debate to follow.<\/p>"}]
