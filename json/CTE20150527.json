It is a pleasure to be back here today.  I have provided a short presentation document, copies of which have been distributed to members.<\/p> <p>  The European Fisheries Fund, EFF, which ran from 2007 to 2013 introduced Axis 4, a new approach for the delivery of structural aid in the fisheries sector.  This consisted of programmes which focused on the sustainable development of fisheries areas.  The approach reflected the complexities and speedily changing forces which are affecting fisheries and the areas and communities in which fisheries operations take place. <\/p> <p>  Central to this area-based approach is the objective that the EU be able to provide accompanying measures in conjunction with the conversion of areas affected by the restructuring of the fisheries sector.  I am sure members are aware of the significant change that took place in 2000 or so in terms of moving towards a maximum sustainable yield, MSY, system in fisheries.  That change has had a downward effect on quotas in the past decade or so.  Fisheries are returning to MSY and we hope to see the quotas increase, but there has been a significant impact at local level in the past ten years.<\/p> <p>  The area-based approach under Axis 4 of the EFF means solutions may be adapted to the situations and problems that arise in different parts of the country.  The real difference between Axis 4 and other elements of the EFF lies in the way actions may be implemented and linked together in the fisheries area and by fishing communities within those areas.  In this respect, Axis 4 is similar to the area-based approach to development in rural areas under the Leader programme.<\/p> <p>  The introduction of Axis 4 arose out of the need to tackle the effects of the economic, social and environmental consequences of the depletion of fish stocks.  The purpose is to enable communities in fisheries-dependent areas to create new and sustainable sources of income and thereby improve their quality of life.  The objective is to empower communities by providing them with the resources to devise and adapt solutions to meet their specific needs.<\/p> <p>  The central principles of this approach are driven by the diversity of fisheries areas and situations existing throughout the EU as well as by the principle of subsidiarity.  This means empowering local communities to become the drivers of local development.  All of the assistance provided under Axis 4 is designed to form part of an integrated local approach centred on a development strategy that is adapted to the local situation.  The process is designed to be as decentralised as possible, co-ordinated by a partnership comprised of members from the public, private and community sectors who come together to form a fisheries local action group.  The overall approach may be characterised by three main and interlinked strands, namely, the area, the group or partnership and the integrated local development strategy.  They are the fundamental pillars on which the process is built.<\/p> <p>  Bord Iascaigh Mhara is the implementing authority for European Union structural aid through both the EFF and the forthcoming European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, EMFF.  As such, we are responsible for the overall administration of Axis 4 under the old EFF and of Union Priority 4 under the new EMFF.  The fisheries local development measure is the basis of all grant aid dispersed by FLAGS.  Although the EFF sets out the areas that may be funded through Axis 4, it is a matter for the FLAG - that is, it is a local matter - to determine how the funding will be prioritised.  Each FLAG sets out its objectives in this regard in its fisheries local development measure or plan.  I have brought copies of the development strategies and plans produced for the different regions around the country.  Members will see they are fairly comprehensive documents and, as I said, they are produced at a local rather than a national level.  The fisheries local development measure document sets out the priorities, terms and conditions and selection criteria, as well as the funding application form, in respect operations that will be financed within a priority area.<\/p> <p>  The basis on which funds may be spent is set out in Article 44 of the EFF.<\/p><p>These include strengthening the competitiveness of fishing areas; restructuring and redirecting economic activities, such as promoting eco-tourism, as long as these activities do not result in an increase in fishing effort; diversifying activities through the promotion of multiple employment in the fisheries through the creation of jobs outside the direct fisheries sector; adding value to fisheries products; supporting small fisheries and tourism-related infrastructure and services for the benefit of small coastal communities; protecting the environment in fisheries areas to maintain its attractiveness, regenerating and developing coastal hamlets and villages with fisheries activities and protecting and enhancing the natural and architectural heritage.  The European Fisheries Fund may also finance measures such as the promotion and improvement of professional skills, worker adaptability and access to employment, particularly in favour of women, provided that these measures are an integral part of a sustainable development strategy.  What is allowed, within the parameters of the EFF, as well as any parameters agreed nationally and the priority each has with respect to the rest, forms the basis of the fisheries local development measure. <\/p><p> Since the introduction of the Axis 4 initiative and the establishment of the six FLAGs, each of which has developed its own strategic plan, BIM has engaged with the FLAGs and retains presentation on each of the six committees.  In addition to the six coastal based staff who work directly with FLAGs, a further three BIM staff members are involved in administering the scheme.  Therefore, in each of the FLAGs, the BIM representative will help the group to develop the project proposals put forward and will bring them to fruition.<\/p><p> All of these projects are then brought to be assessed centrally.  I wish to stress that the central assessment is not a selection process; it is merely to ensure that projects are eligible and legally allowed under the programme.  BIM's only role is to advise the FLAG that a project is or is not eligible.  BIM does not indicate or assist with the selection process which is entirely done at a local level.  BIM is completely agnostic other than on eligibility.  <\/p><p> Once projects are deemed eligible for assistance under the scheme, they are put before the FLAG for selection but decisions must be made at local level.  BIM takes responsibility for the administration and payment of projects under the scheme.  We administer the cheques and carry out checks on all the paperwork and so on.  Then we finally issue the payments.  <\/p><p> Over the past two years, 2013 to 2014, the FLAGs have completely engaged in the process and have shown themselves to be responsible and fair in their operation.  The new seafood development programme, which will incorporate the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund and technically ran from 2014 to 2020 but in reality it will emerge in the latter part of this year and will run beyond 2020, will develop and channel support from the EMFF into the FLAGs and the local development initiatives.  <\/p><p> Under the aegis of that seafood development programme, supports for local initiatives involving inshore fisheries and aquaculture will be available.  When BIM was last here, I indicated that we hoped for an allocation of &euro;12 million.  A public consultation was launched by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine recently and that &euro;12 million allocation can be clearly identified in this document.  It is part of a public consultation at the moment but to give the members a full understanding, I stress that the &euro;12 million directly attributed to FLAGs is complemented by other funds for the inshore sector, as well as for funds directed under the CFP, more generally.  It would be remiss to suggest that &euro;12 million is the only money available to FLAGs and the inshore sector.  I can return to this matter and explain it more fully in a moment.  <\/p><p>  As the new seafood development programme will be launched in 2015, it will mean all of the FLAGs must be reconstituted and we will seek applications from interested local groups to run these FLAGs.  It is our intention to extend the number from six to seven groups in order to allow for a better allocation of resources in the Cork-Kerry area.  The current Cork-Kerry FLAG is about twice the size of any other one and, therefore, has become difficult to administer.  It is a very big part of the country.  We hope to have a seventh FLAG by splitting the Cork-Kerry south-west region into two distinct FLAGs.  <\/p><p> In the three years the Irish FLAGs have operated, which includes this year, a total of 320 projects have been submitted which represents an investment just shy of &euro;5 million.  I appreciate that is not a huge number but given that its early days in the evolution of this process, we the programme is now taking root and can develop real change in the years ahead.<\/p><p> I have added some material by way of a little presentation.  It may be worth quickly considering some of the points outlined in the presentation but I shall not dwell on them.  On the first page we reiterated the points that I made in my opening presentation, that is, what the FLAGs are about so that is pretty self-explanatory.  FLAGs are about bringing fishing communities together and strengthening their influence, which is an important aspect of FLAGs.  They are not just about distributing structural aid.  BIM believes, as was said the last time I was here, that the influence should extend to the whole range of fisheries management.  Local communities must have a way to influence fisheries management.<\/p><p> If one turns the page one can see a map of Ireland which demonstrates an important point.  BIM had a long and quite a strong debate with its colleagues in the European Commission.  Brussels holds the view that one should allow groups to emerge.  For example, if a FLAG is wanted in Galway and another FLAG is wanted in Kerry but nobody in the middle fills the gap, then Brussels will believe that nobody wants a FLAG in the middle region.  I refer to the nature of fisheries in Ireland, in particular the fact that of the 2,200 boats on the register, more than 2,000 are under 12 m, that the bedrock of our industry is small coastal communities, which are often very disparate, that at times the people in charge of those boats are correctly out making a living to help feed their families and that those fishermen often do not have the time to take part in these types of communities activities but, in general, their partners can become very involved.  The principle we have taken has been a good one.  We said there shall be a FLAG for every fisherman in Ireland and that nobody should be denied access to one.  We decided to divide the country into six parts and to create six FLAGs which encompasses the entire coastline, with the small exception of urban areas of over 100,000 people.  That means the cities of Dublin and Cork are excluded but that is simply the way the scheme has been set down in the regulations.<\/p><p> On the next two pages we have outlined what happened in the UK and France, which is the way I believe the Commission would have seen things evolve.  Let us take the United Kingdom, for example.  Cornwall has an active FLAG but there is gap along the south coast of England and along the Wash.  The next FLAG does not appear until Lincolnshire.  Scotland followed our model and opted to have a FLAG for every area.  France followed the Commission's model.  One can see a FLAG in Brittany and one Normandy but there is nothing until one is almost at the bottom of the Bay of Biscay.  There are vast tracts of the French coastline where fishermen, because they were not in a position to organise themselves, have found themselves denied access to the structural aid provided by Axis 4.  <\/p><p> Ireland has pursued this model for the next programme and again the Commission queried why we did so.  I remain steadfast in my belief that it can be very difficult for communities and fishermen to come together at the drop of a hat to create FLAGs.  We must work with people to ensure nobody finds themselves outside of the net simply because they were unable to give the matter the time required.<\/p><p> The next few slides deal with what I talked about in my opening remarks.  This is about increasing income for fishermen and their families and creating new opportunities, not just within fisheries but complementary activities which throws up some challenges.  For example, France is like us and had a restriction on the use of fishing vessels.  The boat could either be a fishing boat or a passenger boat but could not be both.<\/p><p>Working with their equivalent of the Marine Survey Office, they have been able to change the rules so that fishermen can now go out early in the morning to tend to their pots, before returning later that morning to bring people sea angling.  They have become multifunctional.  I think that particular project took place in France.  The fisheries local action groups in France worked with the administration to help to change the rules.  I think these sorts of things can be done.  There can be a move from an entirely fisheries-based opportunity to an opportunity that is much more wide-reaching in the sense of tourism and many other activities.  Many members will be familiar with where I am coming from.  We can see opportunities in places like Dunmore East and Cleggan, for example.  In Dingle, with which Deputy Ferris is familiar, there are huge opportunities for fishermen to bring people out visiting the Blasket Islands or engaging in activities like sea angling and scuba diving.  Who knows what other activities they could facilitate?  They would still be able to tend to their pots in the morning or, in summer, when they return late in the evening.<\/p><p> The next two slides deal with the important issue of strengthening the supply chain in fishing communities and the emerging area of blue growth.  I remain utterly convinced that Ireland is not achieving the added value in the seafood sector that it could be achieving.  The last time I appeared before the joint committee, I mentioned that approximately 70% of the fish we eat is cod or salmon.  As we have a relatively small cod quota and we are a relatively small producer of salmon, some 60% of what we eat is imported.  We have a wonderful resource comprising langoustines, Dublin Bay prawns, nephrops, lobsters and crabs, etc. that we are largely exporting without any noticeable added value.  We must try to use a local approach to develop this.  Many of the stocks about which I have spoken, particularly lobsters and crabs, are locally caught in small amounts.  This is an area we need to tackle.  The opportunities that will be presented by the whole area of emerging blue growth also need to be borne in mind.<\/p><p> I would like to show the committee a photograph that was taken yesterday in Dunmore East, which is familiar to me because it is the town I come from.  If I look up the estuary from Dunmore East, in the distance I can see Passage East, Cheekpoint, Ballyhack and Templetown and I am not too far from Kilmore Quay, Wexford and Tramore.  The fisheries local action group in the area has come together in an admirable fashion.  Those involved have put aside their old differences, even in terms of playing hurling.  Fishermen in Dunmore East rarely if ever spoke to fishermen from Kilmore Quay, but now they have created a network of sub-committees within the estuary to deal with specific problems.  They operate their fisheries local action group at an extremely advanced level.  As I have said, they have a whole network of subgroups dealing with specific issues.  They work together collectively.  These groups are not confined to distributing community funds - they actually create a focus for thinking and outreach within their communities and across boundaries that previously existed.  That is part of the essence of what they are all about.  They reach out to various sections of the community.<\/p><p> The final point I would like to make is reflected in the committee's report.  The Chairman and members wrote the report at a time when our old inshore fisheries management initiative had fallen by the wayside and essentially become moribund.  BIM was deeply disappointed that the lobster management plan had gone nowhere.  In the last 12 months, using the fisheries local action groups as a stepping stone and with the backing of the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and the Department, we have been able to create a new network of six regional inshore fisheries forums, which are driven through the fisheries local action groups, in effect.  Each action group is used as a stepping stone because it is a community group with knowledge and has the understanding and support of the local community.  Each new committee that has been created has two members from the fisheries local action group and six members from the fisheries sector.  Each of the six regions now has an inshore fisheries forum.  It, in turn, sends two members to the national inshore forum, which generally meets with the Minister in attendance.  It has met three times this year and the Minister has attended all three meetings.  Decisions have been made at a fisheries level on matters like lobster management.  Consideration is now being given to recreational potting.<\/p><p> I am happy to report to the committee that the situation in relation to inshore fisheries management in Ireland has taken a genuine step forward in the last 12 months.  It has done so on the back of the infrastructure that surrounds the fisheries local action groups.  The notion that each of these groups is entirely the same as the Leader group is no longer true.  Groups of people with a genuine understanding of fisheries areas seem to be coming together, seeing the structural support and the funds that flow through it and displaying an understanding of fisheries management.  For example, the group in Roaring Water Bay is grappling with the imposition of Natura.  One of the problems it is facing is the notion that potting and the ropes from pots could damage the zostera beds.  This group is now able to say it wants to fund research to figure out whether this is really a big problem, or how big a problem it is.  I think that type of integration across different policy areas will be the real value that emerges from the FLAG process.  There will be a move beyond the simple distribution of community funds.  It is actually a much wider thing.  I will not dwell on that.  I think I have said enough.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015052700002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Keatinge","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1432734000,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Keatinge for coming in and explaining this in great detail.

There will be &euro;300,000 per area.  One of the things I have a problem with is the myth that one can develop rural Ireland with peanuts.  I am not blaming Mr. Keatinge - I am blaming those in Europe or whoever - for the idea that this can be done cheaply.  They would not think of providing a similar sum for the development of a street in a city.  I was involved in developing rural Ireland by creating jobs, etc.  I am aware that millions are needed to get a decent project off the ground.<\/p> <p>  It seems to me that there are seven themes here.  Seven goes into 300 approximately 30 times, if one is generous.  That is where I got my figure of &euro;30,000 from.  There will be approximately &euro;30,000 for each fisheries local action group, which extends across the length of a county.  It is interesting that BIM is being asked to work the miracle of the loaves and fishes.  I think those days are over.  I know of nobody who can turn this kind of money into the kind of growth that is needed.  Regardless of the multiplier factor that is put in, it is still not money.  At least &euro;250 million has been made available under the current Leader programme, even if this represents a huge cut on the previous programme.  It is going to be a very small programme.  Everybody involved in Leader is telling me it is a peanut programme.  It is very small this time.  They are correct to say that there have been massive cutbacks.<\/p> <p>  The main point I want to make is that there is a need for someone to go to Europe to get some decent money so that we can have a proper FLAG programme that will make a difference in these areas.  Nobody really thinks that this kind of money, by the time it has been spread over an entire county, will make a significant difference in the communities we represent.  Having been in and done the job - I know what is involved - I am aware that this is totally cosmetic.  This is what often happens in rural schemes.  It is not real and it is not going to do us any good.  Some of those who get a few bob will be happy to go around saying \"I got this and that\".  I do not begrudge them the few bob, but if we are talking about the overall economic development of rural areas, this is a non-player.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015052700002#H01200","speaker":"1044"},{"type":"speech","time":1432734000,"counter":25,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Keatinge for his presentation.  The content and principle of what is in this document is good stuff.<\/p><p>However, in order to activate it, one needs to have the funding required to deliver it.  Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v outlined a breakdown of what was available.  Unfortunately, it is so minuscule that it will not have a discernible effect.  I live only a couple of miles from the coastal community of Fenit where BIM representatives held a meeting with local fishermen and, unfortunately, nobody bought into it.  I will, however, go back and try again, but if we do not have the funding required to get fishermen to buy into it, it will not work.<\/p><p> On the management plans for local areas, there is much that could be done if one had adequate funding.  Every day fishermen are out with 500 to 600 pots fishing for lobster and crayfish.  The wages of some of these fishermen's might be &euro;50 a day, despite working from 4 a.m. until 8 p.m. or 10 p.m.  Depending on price, they might have a good week.  They are, however, hostage to buyers who set the price at any given point to suit their agenda.  I have always argued that if one had the facility to store crabs, crayfish and lobsters and sell them at the optimum price, as happens at Easter and Christmas, one could, in a co-operative way, retain them and get their real value.  Bord Iascaigh Mhara spoke about the lack of added value.  With FLAGs, if funds were available, some of them could be used to create a market, both internationally and nationally.  The processing side has been spoken about.  Most of the fish caught are exported, which is sad.  It was stated we were importing 60% of what we consumed.  That reflects the fact that there is no forward planning.  If there was any understanding by the Government, irrespective of who was in government, of how beneficial this could be and the knock-on effect to sustain and keep the necessary social balance in local communities, it would be money well spent, but the amount provided to be divided along the entire coastline of the Twenty-six Counties will not make a discernible difference.  I would, however, like to see the project working and will co-operate and help in any way I can in a personal capacity.

When one travels from Lauragh to Tarbert, one notes the number of people who have left coastal communities areas because there is no viable income to be earned from farming or fishing because they have been neglected and betrayed by the political class which has abandoned them.  We need to do something to reverse this.  All BIM can do is work with what it has.  The plan which, in principle, offers many opportunities has nothing to offer because the funding required is not available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015052700002#H01300","speaker":"1047","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1432734000,"counter":27,"content":"<p>I thank BIM for its presentation.  I must agree with previous speakers on the value of the FLAGs plan, for which I understand BIM is the implementing authority.  I would like to tease out the extent to which it was involved in the application process for funding under Axis 4 of the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, EMFF, to see whether it had any input in how much could have been availed of by the State.  As mentioned in the presentation, funding was available under Axis 4 from 2007 to 2013.  The FLAGs formed part of it, yet they were only in place in Ireland for the past three years.  That means that nothing was done here between 2007 and 2012.  I am not saying, however, that was Mr. Keatinge's fault.  Obviously, there is a wider policy problem in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in targeting available EU funding.  As Mr. Keatinge is probably aware, the committee was informed by the Commission that in the period 2007 to 2013 some 8,000 jobs were created across the European Union with Axis 4 funding.  In Ireland there were 20 jobs created.  That is a sad indictment of our targeting of these funds in protecting and saving coastal communities.<\/p> <p>  I come from Killybegs which, as Mr. Keatinge will be aware, has been Ireland's largest fishing port, in volume and value, for a number of years.  However, I know more ex-fishermen than fishermen.  That represents the outworking of Ireland's fisheries policy in the past 20 or 30 years.  We saw the late former Taoiseach Albert Reynolds get off an aeroplane and talk about having &euro;8 billion in his back pocket.  Much has always been made of how we availed of funding from the European Union.  In this regard, however, the record is appalling.  That is the historical context.  I do not know what BIM's role in accessing this funding or devising the policy was - perhaps Mr. Keatinge might fill us in - but in terms of who should be getting the finger out and working on this issue, perhaps we are talking to the wrong people.<\/p> <p>  In looking at what has been proposed, Mr. Keatinge has outlined a proposed budget of &euro;12 million for the period 2015 to 2020.  In preparation for this meeting I looked through a guidance document from the European Commission on community-led local development involving so-called \"local actors\", particularly FLAGs.  It states a budget of &euro;3 million per local development unit per is the minimum amount that should be considered.  Given that there are seven FLAGs, one is looking at a figure of &euro;1.8 million for each of them, which means that we are not coming anywhere near the figure mentioned by the Commission and even then the impact might be minimal.  I apologise if I am talking to the wrong people about the policy, but perhaps Mr. Keatinge might enlighten us in that regard.<\/p> <p>  I must agree with previous speakers.  This is throwing peanuts at a mountain to try to deal with a problem.  Unfortunately, I do not see how we can achieve any of what is intended under Axis 4, that is, to help those who have been pushed out of fishing because of quota restrictions by developing alternative industries and retraining.  Unfortunately, at &euro;15,000 per project, there is no way any of this will be achieved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015052700002#J00200","speaker":"1001"},{"type":"speech","time":1432734000,"counter":28,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas le BIM faoin cur i l&aacute;thair.  I will not go over ground that has been covered, but I echo the sentiments expressed.  I take it that none of the funding available can be used to help those still engaged in fishing in dealing with issues such as safety and upgrading.  We recently had a delegation in Brussels who talked about the way the European Fisheries Fund, EFF, would be used.  I wonder, if it cannot be done under the FLAGs measure, whether BIM is looking at applications under the EFF to allow minor upgrades and safety equipment to be bought for smaller fishing boats.  This has been brought up with us as a serious issue.  The fishermen involved are finding it difficult to maintain safety standards without the availability of funding.<\/p> <p>  I am interested in what BIM has stated about boats being used for multiple purposes.  It has been said somebody could go lobster fishing in the morning and engage in sea-angling in the afternoon.  What can be done to promote this option even more?  We need to look at how fishermen can look at different streams of income under the FLAGs.<\/p> <p>  It would be remiss of me not to mention the following issue - I am sure Mr. Maguire expected it to come up - given that there is a FLAG in Galway Bay where there is huge controversy around the fish farm project being developed there.<\/p><p>Is a fisheries local action group a forum in which potential projects such as this, about which there is huge controversy and about which many interests are unhappy, could be discussed, with recommendations being made to the Department, BIM and so on on this type of policy?  It is a policy issue BIM is bringing forward under the aegis of the Department.  From what I can see, most of the stakeholders in the bay are unhappy with the project.  Is the fisheries local action group a good forum in which policy developments on the type of fish farm being promoted in Galway Bay could be discussed, including the need for new seafood markets and the detrimental impact it would have on other industries in the area?  There are serious issues around this matter from which, perhaps, the delegates might be able to tell us at this stage they are pulling back, as was envisaged.  <\/p><p> Earlier a link was drawn between the FLAGs and the RIS, which I found interesting.  I presume the RIS would also take into consideration the views of the inshore angling community, one of the greatest advocates in opposing the development of the proposed aquaculture projects.  How will that engagement work in order that, irrespective of the particular project I mentioned, other projects that might be planned down the line could be discussed at a pre-emptive stage in order that there would not be a huge community battle involving all of the different interests?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015052700002#J00300","speaker":"1122","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1432734000,"counter":30,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Keatinge for his presentation.  Up to now there has been no representation in this area, particularly in terms of the inshore fleet and the 12 m LOA applicable in that regard.  Those involved were left to their own devices and, as correctly pointed out by Mr. Keatinge, were busy every day.  There was, however, no representation.  They were members of producer organisations, but the more powerful players within the industry would have had their say and control of the producer organisations.  Through the inshore fisheries forum and the FLAGs there is now in place a structure through which many of these producers are supported.<\/p> <p>  While the consolidation of the fishing industry in the fishery harbour centres has worked very well for the centres, it has led to decline in other areas, particularly in many coastal villages and small towns such as Union Hall, Baltimore and Kinsale.  Producers now have fend for themselves again.  However, there are opportunities.  This is not just about money.  I acknowledge that the funding to support projects selected by the FLAGs could be greater, but money is not always the sole concern.  Issues such as regulation and engagement with the agencies involved often present a problem.  Reference was made to the Marine Survey Office.  We regularly hear that boats of a particular specification leaving the United Kingdom with a particular load experience no problems, while similar boats leaving Ireland encounter huge problems.  The reverse could be the case; we do not know.  It is a difficult issue with which to grapple.  <\/p> <p>  The multi-functional use of vessels was mentioned.  Vessel use is a hugely untapped resource among inshore fishermen.  Some 2,000 such boats could, for example, be used in the tourism sector, but getting the Department to license them is an impossible task.  In fact, moves in this regard are in the opposite direction.  There is also a difficulty in reclaiming VAT and carbon tax relief on small petrol engines.  While big players can do this, small players cannot.  These are tangible disadvantages which could be addressed by the FLAGs on behalf of small inshore fishermen, many of whom, in terms of funding, also have to deal with the SFPA, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, BIM, the Marine Survey Office, the European Commission, local authorities and Leader companies such as Comhar na Oile&aacute;n.  They then have to go out and do a day's work.  <\/p> <p>  While I acknowledge that the amount of funding in this area is small and will not solve everything, I am not aware of funding having solved all of the problems in any particular area.  I would prefer to see FLAGs coming up with proposals on how each of them could supplement their own industries and help them to grow in a more sustainable manner.  This is the right structure to do it.  The ground up approach needs to be supported.  I agree that without additional funding many problems cannot be addressed.  This is a relatively new initiative which deserves a chance and to be supported.<\/p> <p>  It is worth noting that EMFF funding for Ireland under this CFP is almost twice that provided in the last round.  As such, the financial environment is improving.  Coastal communities are not only supported through the FLAGs, they are also supported through the seafood programme of BIM, the infrastructure programmes of the local authorities and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Leader companies, Comhar na Oile&aacute;n and so on.  While there is a lot of funding available, the red tape and bureaucracy in this regard, in terms of the number of agencies with which people are required to deal, are crippling.  A more supportive environment to allow small fishermen and their communities to diversify and grow is required.  That is where I could see the FLAGs flourishing.  <\/p> <p>  I welcome the proposal to split counties Cork and Kerry.  While there is more that unites the two counties than separates them, in this case geography is a big player.  The proposal must be supported, if only on geographical grounds.  <\/p> <p>  I fully support the FLAGs initiative.  The inshore fisheries forum which previously was a huge focus of the work of the committee and the sub-committee on fisheries will I hope give inshore fishermen a voice.  That is a reasonably good start.  I accept that funding is an issue.  I have never heard anybody say at any committee that the funding available is acceptable.  However, the agency has a very good template with which to work.  It is not only small communities that are affected.  In places such as Killibegs and Castletownbere up to 90% of economic activity is entirely dependent on sea fisheries.  If anything happens with that industry, it will mean wipe-out for places such as Castletownbere, Killibegs, Dunmore East, Rossaveal, Howth and the other harbour centres.  Equally, there are other issues to be dealt with.  The FLAGs have a huge role to play in promoting projects and lobbying and dealing with the agencies involved.  I often hear that fishermen just want to be left alone.  I hope they will have a stronger voice under the FLAGs initiative.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015052700002#K00200","speaker":"995"},{"type":"speech","time":1432734000,"counter":31,"content":"<p>It has been stated that in the three years the programme has been operational a total of 302 projects have been considered by the fisheries local action groups, FLAGs.

Is that correct?  Apart from being an increased amount, does the new EMFF allow for cross-funding from the various different sections of the programme? I am not trying to align the FLAGs with local development companies such as the partnerships and Leader companies, but could they set themselves up so that, apart from the submissions they would make under EMFF, they could apply for funding through other sources, either separately or to co-fund projects they would identify?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015052700002#L00700","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1432734000,"counter":41,"content":"<p>That is the real difference this time around - what I might call integrated community-led local development.  I will address a number of the questions together and perhaps help the members see the complex nature of what we are dealing with.  At a European level, Ireland accessed some &euro;241 million of funds from the EMFF.  That would have been set at an EU level, so we get the amount set down by the council.  BIM would have no part in that negotiation, but I stress that it is set at an EU level.  With regard to where we are in this structural fund compared to the last round, I understand there is an improvement.  That fund depends on one critical thing: the EU element is &euro;147 million or thereabouts, but to ensure we got the full drawdown, the State was required to come in with national co-funding.  The State did not have to come in with the full co-funding.  It could have said it was prepared to put up only a certain amount, which would mean less funds could be drawn down.  The point I am making is that the EU part has been fully backed by the State part and Ireland will access the full &euro;241 million that has been allocated to it.<br\/><br\/>We are dealing with a fund of &euro;250 million.  Unlike the last time, however, the fund now includes not just fisheries and seafood development but also control and enforcement.  Members will see in the public consultation document that control and enforcement have been allocated &euro;46.5 million.  It also incorporates the data collection framework, which funds much of the research and surveys that the Marine Institute does, the work BIM does collecting economic data and so on.  That is funded to the tune of &euro;40.8 million.  Of the &euro;240 million, about &euro;90 million is taken out for control and enforcement and for data collection, leaving something in the region of &euro;160 million for seafood development.<br\/><br\/>One might then say that &euro;12 million is less than 10%.  We should bear in mind the point Deputy Harrington has alluded to.  The &euro;12 million represents that portion of the fund that we are giving over in its totality to local groups to handle.  That must not be confused with the suggestion that they cannot access the remainder of the funds.  For example, the Senator raised the issue of safety.  We will have a big safety programme.<br\/><br\/>As an aside, one of the key things we do on safety in Ireland was evidenced by what I call the life jacket scheme, which was launched in Union Hall 18 months ago after the dreadful tragedies in which people were lost.  We put the new life jackets on everyone going out on a boat, particularly those under 15 metres in length, with a built-in personal locator beacon.  I am not glad to report, but it is worth recording, that some weeks ago a vessel sank off Wicklow.  Three men found themselves in the sea within minutes.  It was rather like that tragedy in Waterford in which three brothers were lost.  They could probably see Brownstown Head and the local airport in Waterford, where the helicopter was located, but nobody knew they were alone in the sea and dying.  The three men who found themselves in the waters off Wicklow last month were all wearing the new life jackets that BIM and the State had provided.  The little personal locator beacons went off and in less than 15 minutes the helicopter was overhead.  What could have been a tragedy ended with families reunited.  There is an important lesson to be taken from this.  The point I am making to the members is that under EU legislation the EMFF will not allow us fund that, because it is a requirement under national legislation and the EMFF states that structural aid may not be used to fund something that is already a legal requirement.  Ireland, though, has taken the view that we should continue to fund that regardless under <i>de minimis<\/i>.  That sort of safety programme will remain in place, along with all the other safety work we do.  That is, the standard safety scheme, under which we deal with life rafts, life jackets, fire-fighting equipment and all that, will remain in place.  That is outside the &euro;12 million.  Those fisherman in FLAG areas can continue to avail of that.<br\/><br\/>We are bringing in a new programme to support education.  For too long, fishermen have not been financially supported in attending the colleges in Greencastle or Castletownbere.  Of course we have the mobile training units that visit these sites, but I believe fundamentally that we should offer financial support to fishermen to undertake training - not just safety training, but the whole range of training.  For example, our fishermen come ashore in the winter looking for alternative work.  They may go to a shipping company looking for a job as a deckhand, but they have no qualification.  We must change that.  We must look at the fishing certificates to ensure that as the year rotates they can move seamlessly from inshore fishing in the summer to working on a guard ship, a supply vessel or something else in the winter.<br\/><br\/>To return to the point I am putting across, the chairman has said the difference this time is that FLAGs can and should be encouraged to promote projects to avail of the rest of the &euro;160 million for fisheries development.  The &euro;12 million is the bit they will fully control.  The other &euro;148 million is there, as are Leader funds.  We have to stop seeing the FLAGs as somehow in competition with Leader.  Far from it: community-led local development should be a partnership and it should be seamless across the agencies.  The one thing we are saying is that the unique situation of coastal communities demands that they have a local action group.  They deserve that.  They deserve their own group, which must not be confused with suggesting there is any distinction between BIM and Leader.  It should be the opposite.  A public consultation is under way.  Of course we are vying with the processing sector, with the bigger fishing boats, within agriculture and so on, right across a whole range of areas of seafood development, and everyone wants their part.  There is &euro;12 million there for FLAGs, and there are many other people vying for funds.  It is a balancing act.  If I take the direct funds the FLAGs will access &euro;12 million.  If I take the inshore management scheme, which is another &euro;6 million, that brings us up to &euro;18 million.  Deputy Ferris talked about onshore storage for products, and we have worked a lot in the past, particularly on lobster storage.  There is a special measure in here that deals directly with support to produce organisations for quayside storage of unwanted catches.  However, that sort of measure can also provide onshore facilities.  It will mean the total package for the inshore seafood areas will far exceed &euro;12 million, but the &euro;12 million will be there to be directly driven by local communities.<\/p><p>That is the empowering aspect and there is no reason it could not increase in future.  <\/p><p> On the area of multitasking, it would be remiss of me to suggest to the committee that it is an easy job.  I have discussed this at length with the Marine Survey Office and the big problem is that if someone heads out to sea in the morning with pots, rope and equipment, then comes back ashore later and encourages tourists to come on board to do whale watching, sea angling or whatever, there are issues of insurance and safety which pose complex problems.  It may be that we are able to find a way forward whereby a single vessel may change role midway through the day or multitask.  That would put new demands on the operator of the vessel.  There are other models; for example, in a community with a number of boats, they could, through a community-led structure, make a decision as a group of fishermen that a particular boat will be dedicated this summer for sea angling and that they will equip it and so on - \"I will help you fish your pots in the morning, and you use my boat during the day for sea angling.\"  That type of group thinking and co-operation could be another way forward.  These are models we will have to explore with the Marine Survey Office.  They are not easy, and it would be wrong of me to suggest that the Marine Survey Office is just blocking this.  It is very happy to co-operate but it is difficult.  There is a range of things we can consider.<\/p><p> I have mentioned safety in particular, and I will ask my colleague Mr. Donal Maguire to say a word about the area of aquaculture.  There can be a very exciting role for aquaculture in the whole area of FLAGs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015052700002#L00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Keatinge","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1432734000,"counter":43,"content":"<p>There is a big role for the possible integration of aquaculture techniques into inshore fisheries.

That is the point I am making.  We have chosen to give a small amount directly to the FLAGs initially.  Once we hand that money over, the FLAGs decide where it goes.  There is a sense of building this slowly but carefully so that we get a good outcome.  That does not mean the rest of the Structural Funds were not available - of course they were.  They continue to be administered through the State and through Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  That is our job.  We are the development agency.<\/p> <p>  We want to move forward by creating a new partnership with the FLAGs.  We do not want to simply say, \"Why not just take the quarter of a billion and hand it all to local communities and, sure, we can close BIM down.\"  I do not think that is the way forward.  The way forward is to develop on one scale at a national level, to ensure balanced, proper development, while also developing at a local level through the FLAGs.  We are getting that balance right in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  The point in my presentation was to consider other countries that have a chosen a different route.  What happens in an area in England or France that is outside the FLAGs - for example, on the south coast of England?  There is no FLAG and the UK does not have an equivalent of BIM.  Of course, they have structural aid, but it is a case of getting the balance right.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the &euro;3 million, if the Deputy takes that as an indicative figure of what a FLAG should get over the course of the coming programming period, that would add up to &euro;21 million.

Some &euro;6 million is specifically allocated to inshore fisheries management, which is the work of the regional inshore forums, or RIFs, so the FLAGs will avail of those funds as well.

That is a sum of &euro;18 million.<\/p><p> Looking at what is going on in processing, training and fisheries generally, the FLAGs can still operate within those funds.

Once a FLAG has made a decision to include eco-tourism as a priority, why not?  If that is something it sees as giving viable alternatives within their area, then we would absolutely encourage that type of thinking.  I am being careful not to suggest that our colleagues in the Marine Survey Office are anything but helpful.  I would stress, however, that it is a case of insurance and safety.  A community could come together and say that, as a co-operative group of inshore fishermen, it wants to purchase and run between them a sea angling vessel.  They will look for funds under our FLAG to have one and also want to run an office in Baltimore or Downings.  People can then come in and book their activities and make plans.  That is the sort of thing we are going to encourage.<\/p> <p>  It is vital on this occasion that, as we approach the first round of funding, and before we get there, we take stock of what we have achieved over the last three or four years in 2013, 2014 and 2015.  How many projects have we funded, what were they about and what did they really add up to?  We also need to help those running the FLAGs to get a suite of projects for the next measure, which will perhaps be a bit better thought through.  We may need to have some bigger demonstration projects focused on job creation.  They should be substantial and form a real stepping stone to the future.  Equally, I believe there is a place for very small projects, including local festivals, artisan operators and small producers.  Those are all terribly important.  A small grant of &euro;20,000 or &euro;30,000 can create sustainable jobs.  I can think of one particular individual, although it would not be appropriate to name him.  We gave him a small grant to buy a portable ice-making machine.  That gentleman now employs five people collecting inshore fisheries products and providing ice locally.  One can create jobs with small grants, but I also think we did not achieve enough big projects under the last programme.  That is one of the things we will have to work on directly with our FLAGs to help create confidence in communities to go for slightly bigger projects this time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015052700002#N01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Keatinge"},{"type":"speech","time":1432734000,"counter":67,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Keating and Mr. Maguire for their presentations, which were opportune given the timelines for the reconstitution of the new FLAGs within the EMFF consultation period.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Keating mentioned the local development companies and Leader, but they are not the same and neither are they competitors.  There are comparisons, however, and there are lessons to be learned from the original establishment of Leader companies and the rural development programme over 20 years ago.  A lot of money was thrown at them initially, but due diligence was not run over every project, which landed some of them in trouble at the time.  FLAGs will initially take smaller steps to try to get themselves correctly formatted.  Everyone has said that the structure and template were good but they needed to improve their ability to fund projects.  In his summary, Mr. Keating said they needed to focus on job creation.  Jobs will be the lifeblood of the communities they are targeting.  We would like to see better funding, but we also want to ensure that they can access and draw down funding from other sources.  Today's discussion has been useful and hopefully it will help people when they consider how they want FLAGs to work in the future, for both policy makers and participants.  For that reason, I hope the crossfire of questions and answers in this engagement has been helpful.  I also wish to thank members of the committee.

I call the meeting into public session.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  We have a quorum, the Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis is now in public session.  Can I ask members and those in the public Gallery to ensure that their mobile devices are switched off?  We begin today's session, and series of sessions and public hearings, with Mr. Tony Grimes, former director general of the Central Bank of Ireland.  In doing so, I would like to welcome everyone to the 29th public hearing of the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis.  Today we continue our hearings with witnesses from the Central Bank of Ireland and the Financial Regulator.  At this morning's session we will hear from Mr. Tony Grimes, former director general at the Central Bank.  Mr. Tony Grimes held senior management positions in the Central Bank in the area of economics, international relations, markets and payments.  He was appointed assistant director general in 2004 and oversaw the financial markets and payments of securities, settlements divisions.  In August 2007, he was appointed to the role of director general at the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland, a position he held until his retirement in 2011.  During his time as director general, he was also appointed acting Governor from 19 July 2008 until 19 September 2008, in the absence of Governor Hurley due to illness.  Mr. Grimes, you are very welcome before the committee this morning.<\/p><p>Before hearing from the witness today, I wish to advise the witness that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect to their evidence to this committee.  If you are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and you continue to do so, you are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of your evidence.  You are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  I would remind members and those present that there are currently criminal proceedings ongoing and further criminal proceedings are scheduled during the lifetime of the inquiry which overlap with the subject matter of the inquiry.  Therefore the utmost caution should be taken not to prejudice those proceedings.  In addition, there are particular obligations of professional secrecy on officers of the Central Bank in respect of confidential information they have come across in the course of their duties.  This stems from European and Irish law including section 33AK of the Central Bank Act 1942.  The banking inquiry also has obligations of professional secrecy in terms of some of the information which has been provided to it by the Central Bank.  These obligations have been taken into account by the committee and will affect the questions asked and the answers which can be lawfully given in today's proceedings.  In particular, it will mean that some information can be dealt with in a summary or aggregate basis only, so that individual institutions will not be identified.  Members of the public are reminded that photography is prohibited in the committee room.  To assist the smooth running of the inquiry, we will display certain documents on the screens here in the committee room.  <\/p>  <p>               For those sitting in the Gallery, these documents will be displayed on the screens to your left and right and members of the public and journalists are reminded that these documents are confidential and they should not publish any of the documents so displayed.<\/p> <p> The witness has been directed to attend this meeting of the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis.  You have been furnished with booklets of core documents.

They were meeting all of their regulatory requirements and so on.  If you took a forward looking view I ... I contend that it still wasn't obvious that there was a serious insolvency issue at that time, because to think that a bank is actually insolvent, you really have to understand the loan book.  If we're ... if we're operating on the commercial property side you have to, you know, evaluate the collateral, you have to evaluate the loan-to-value ratios, you have to evaluate whether the size of any capital losses are likely to eat through what would be the buffers of capital in place, and it's important to bear in mind, I think, that many of the ... of the catastrophic falls in the ... in the value, particularly of commercial property at the time, occurred subsequent to the introduction of ... of the guarantee.

So, I think a lot of the destruction in value occurred subsequent to the introduction of the guarantee, and reflected, I think, in many respects, the meltdown, okay, in the financial markets as a whole.

And good afternoon to members of the joint committee.  I have, as requested, submitted a written statement to the inquiry under two broad categories of themes on which I have been directed to give evidence: regulatory, supervisory and Government; and banking.<br\/><br\/>For the purposes of this statement and in the interest on time, therefore, I propose to focus on particular aspects of my commentary on the regulatory and supervisory themes.  It may also assist the committee if I clarify again that my personal knowledge of, and involvement with, those themes dates from my appointment to the head of banking supervision department in May 2006.  It may further save time if I reiterate that while I make take issue with some of the fine detail of the respective Honohan and Nyberg reports, I accept generally the thrust of the findings contained in them.  As with the commentary I have already provided to the inquiry in writing, the commentary I will now give is necessarily generalised, given the constraints already mentioned by you, Chairman, and, in particular, the strict non-disclosure requirements to which I am subject by virtue of 33AK of the Central Bank Acts. <br\/><br\/>My opening commentary briefly centres on five issues which are as follows: IFSRA's regulatory approach and philosophy; the regulatory and supervisory toolkit; effectiveness of regulation and supervision; any relationship between macroeconomic policy and prudential policy; and prudential policy itself. <br\/><br\/>In terms of regulatory approach and philosophy, the regulatory regime implemented by IFSRA was positioned as principles-based.  The approach to regulation appeared to me to be broadly similar to that previously applied by the Central Bank and did not represent a significant shift in prudential regulation or supervision.  From my perspective, the focus on defining it as principles-based seemed driven by a desire to brand the organisation and its strategy rather than any fundamental change in approach <i>per se<\/i>, beyond the changes associated with consumer protection.  As articulated at the time, principles-based regulation placed an emphasis on seeking to require regulated entities themselves to abide by good governance and on the responsibilities of the boards in management of such institutions to have, and maintain in place, appropriate governance as well as controls and risk management measures in order to appropriately manage their institutions.<br\/><br\/>However, principles-based regulation was not without rules.  The cornerstones of banking regulation in May 2006, the point at which I was transferred to BSD, were the Capital Adequacy Directive, the Central Bank Acts and the building societies Acts.  A key document supporting the regulatory regime was the licensing and supervision standards.  However, it should be noted that these standards were non-statutory and not enforceable as such.  EU legislative initiatives also changed the regulatory landscape.  The Capital Requirements Directive became fully effective in on 1 January 2008.  This was a complex framework which, amongst other things, facilitated the use of banks' internal models for the calculation of regulatory capital and mandated supervisory co-operation through colleges of supervisors, particularly in the context of capital decisions for EU banks and banking groups.  <\/p>  <p>         Since the emergence of the crisis in 2007, and given the scale of changes to the regulatory framework at international, EU and domestic level, it is only reasonable to accept, albeit with the benefit of hindsight, that the pre-existing regulatory regime, both domestically and internationally, was not fully appropriate in terms of the areas covered, the detail prescribed and the regulatory tools available.  However, in my view, revision of the regulatory framework in and of itself is not, and would not, have been a panacea.  In fact, given the nature of the issues we now know to have arisen in Irish banks, I would suggest that the regulatory powers available to IFSRA and the bank before it, were broadly sufficient, aside from those with respect to crisis management and resolution.<\/p> <p> In my view, the issues were the strategic approach, and the willingness or otherwise, as well as the logistical wherewithal, or lack thereof, to use those powers to prescribe detailed rules or to challenge and intervene in a manner which would impact banks' business models.  The strategy was, I believe, influenced by external factors, including international approaches to regulation and supervision, Government policy and its better regulation agenda, the promotion of Ireland as a financial services centre, industry influence and costs.  The effectiveness of the regulatory regime is directly linked to the culture of the supervisory authority and the resources allocated to supervision.  Unlike the regulatory framework, which is set out in legislation and published requirements, these are tangible aspects which are not necessarily visible and can be lost in statistics and in the prose of formal strategy documents and annual reports.<\/p> <p> However, importantly in my view, a more onerous or prescriptive regulatory framework would, in and of itself, not necessarily have delivered a significantly different outcome if, as was the case, the supervisory resources, both in terms of staff numbers and specialist expertise, were not in place to monitor, challenge and enforce where compliance was not delivered.  If there are insufficient people to do the work, the work simply cannot be done.  In that regard, in 2006, BSD had an approved staff complement of only 53.5, with actual numbers averaging around 50, to supervise approximately 80 banks, 50 Irish-licensed and 30 EU branches.  The level of resources, and the available specialist expertise, was not such as to be capable of delivering intrusive supervision, even in a business-as-usual mode of operation.  Added to that, during my tenure in BSD, a business-as-usual scenario never in fact applied.  Initially, there was the additional burden of implementing the CRD, and from August 2007, the crisis mounted with ever-increasing issues and problems heaped upon an already under-resourced and over-stretched department.<\/p> <p> While an additional complement of three staff was agreed in 2007, my request for additional staff in May 2008, in the face of the financial crisis and the demands being placed upon the department, was effectively refused.  A subsequent oral request that staff who had previously worked in BSD be re-assigned to the department was also rejected.  It is difficult to convey the sheer scale of pressures management and staff in BSD were working under, particularly from autumn 2007 onwards.  It was not a question of somehow multi-tasking: it was a question of dealing with an unrelenting onslaught of demands, with staff working unreasonably and unsustainably long days, and ultimately weeks, with no let-up.  Resource constraints were such that IFSRA was unable, although required by the CRD, to conclude on ICAAP assessments for banks by the end of 2007.  Throughout 2008, staff were, on an almost daily basis, being assigned additional responsibilities.  Every new issue or new request was a priority on top of existing priorities, and issues with one institution were dealt with at the expense of issues with others.  It was only immediately following the introduction of the Government guarantee that an increase of 20 in staff complement was agreed, and a separate department dealing with the Government-guaranteed banks was established.  Over the following years, BSD was restructured on a number of occasions, with overall staff numbers for banking supervision increasing to approximately 140 approved in 2010.  From 2010 onwards, supervision was also supported by the newly-established policy enforcement directorates.<\/p> <p> In terms of the use of powers, even where regulations were sanctionable under the administrative sanctions process, in the period 2003 to the end of 2008, no prudential enforcement cases were pursued against credit institutions.  I consider there were a number of factors in this: strategically, the authorities saw the sanctioning process as being primarily a tool in consumer protection; there were concerns regarding market reaction as the crisis mounted; and BSD did not have the resources to mount and pursue such cases.  It was only as the resources issue started to be addressed, from 2009 onwards, that prudential enforcement cases became more routine.<\/p> <p> In assessing the effectiveness of the supervisory regime, it is also important to understand the culture of the organisation, and the different levels of industry engagement.  IFSRA's relationship with banks appeared to me to operate at two levels: at a frontline level with BSD and at a senior executive level.  Senior banking executives had direct contact with senior executives in IFSRA, often without the knowledge of, not to say engagement with, supervisory staff.  Staff were regularly requested by senior IFSRA executives to review decisions or issues based on these discussions, or were told by contacts in banks that the issues had been or would be discussed with our senior executives.  To me, at its most benign, this indicated a disconnect between BSD and senior IFSRA executives.  I believe it also signalled a manifest lack of support for staff, undermining them in their dealings with banks.  <\/p> <p> In terms of any linkage between macro-economic and prudential policy, when working in BSD, I saw no evidence of a strong link in that regard.  Given the demands placed on resources, as a result of the implementation of CRD, at some time prior to my arrival in BSD, a decision was taken that the department would cease to be actively involved in work relating to the financial stability review.  However, this would have been in the knowledge that the relevant economic department within the Bank had access to data regarding individual banks.  The financial stability committee was a formal structure for co-operation between IFSRA and the bank on financial stability-related issues.  However, the main focus of meetings tended to be on drafting of economic articles and publications.<\/p> <p>  In terms of prudential policy, IFSRA took a number of policy measures aimed at strengthening the regulatory framework, including the introduction of liquidity requirements.  In implementing options and discretions, under the CRD, it took a conservative approach to the exercise of discretions in relation to property-related lending.  The proposals on all options and discretions were subject to a public consultation in October 2006.  In addition, the Governor of the Central Bank confirmed that the proposals represented the best that could be achieved in the circumstances.  While these interventions can now be seen to have been insufficient, it is worth noting that IFSRA was the only public authority which took measures to try and cool the property-related lending.<\/p> <p> Further detail on these and other lines of inquiry is provided in my written statement.  In addition, I have not dealt with the specifics of the regulatory framework and supervisory arrangements as I am aware the Central Bank has provided significant detail on these to the inquiry.  Again, thank you for the opportunity to make this opening statement, I hope it is useful in providing additional background and context on the wider issues under consideration by the inquiry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015052700002#GG00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Burke","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1432681200,"counter":940,"content":"<p>Thank you very much, Ms Burke, for your opening statement, and if I can now ask Senator O'Keeffe to lead off the questions this afternoon.

In this particular occasion, in fairness, my director did endorse that decision.

Nonetheless, it didn't preclude the possibility, of course, that the staff could be reassigned.  I certainly didn't believe that I could go through that year without asking for additional staff.

You are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  I would remind members and those present that there are currently criminal proceedings ongoing and further criminal proceedings are scheduled during the lifetime of the inquiry which overlap with the subject matter of the inquiry.  Therefore, the utmost caution should be taken not to prejudice those proceedings.  In addition, there are particular obligations of professional secrecy on officers of the Central Bank in respect of confidential information they have come across in the course of their duties.  This stems from European and Irish law, including section 33AK of the Central Bank Act 1942.  The banking inquiry also has the obligations of professional secrecy in terms of some of the information which has been provided to it by the Central Bank.  These obligations have been taken into account by the committee and will affect the questions asked and the answers which can be lawfully given in today's proceedings.  In particular, it will mean that some information can be dealt with on a summary or aggregate basis, such that individual institutions will not be identifiable.<\/p><p>Members of the public are reminded that photography is prohibited in the committee room.

It provides me with the opportunity to assist the inquiry in its work into what has been the most catastrophic, financial and economic crisis in the history of the state.  The crisis has left many indelible marks, the system of oversight of the Irish banking sector clearly failed.  The lessons learned from these events, as well as those in European banking over the recent years, have and will continue to drive major changes so as to avoid a repeat of what occurred.  Commentators have implied that I personally did nothing to prevent the problems of 2008.  Nothing could be further than the truth.  Four years have passed since the report of the commission of investigation.  Accordingly I very much welcome this opportunity to have my voice heard and communicate the actions I took in seeking to avert the collapse.<\/p>  <p>  When the Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Honohan, spoke to you in January this year, he advised that the people who took corrective action had been vilified in the media.  He was speaking about my situation.   When the commission of investigation report spoke about the lack of professional scepticism in the Financial Regulator, it also identified that there were exceptions at the level of the regulatory authority.  I believe that exception was me.  I can however assure the inquiry that this does not alleviate the sense of deep regret I feel, as a member of the senior management team in a registered authority that was not more intrusive and did not prevent the collapse of the financial system.<\/p>  <p>  Before going into the events leading up to the crisis, it is important to distinguish between the roles of the Financial Regulator and the Central Bank.  Briefly, the Financial Regulator was primarily responsible for supervising the safety and soundness of individual banks and their compliance with prudential requirements.  The Central Bank on the other hand monitors stability of the overall banking system and the threats to the financial system.  The Central Bank's views of market ... of the market inform the Financial Regulator in its supervision of the banks.  The Financial Regulator in turn, contributes to the analysis of the stability of the overall system by communicating what it was observing in individual institutions.<\/p>  <p>  I joined the Financial Regulator in mid-2003 as head of banking supervision.  I reported to Mr. Patrick Neary, who was the prudential director.  In this role I was not a member of the senior management team and only occasionally attended meetings of the authority.  I was required to implement the strategic principles-based approach to regulation adopted by the authority prior to my appointment.  As it would be expected, I acted at all times within the structure and the approach set down by the authority.<\/p>  <p>  However, I believe the records demonstrate that I continually pushed the boundaries seeking to make the regulations of banks more intrusive and assertive.  During this time, I proposed interventions in the property market to address high-risk mortgages.  I proposed the imposition of formal corporate governance requirements on banks, including specific proposals to address the most difficult cases.  I advocated for the establishment of a dedicated unit of specialists to pursue administrative sanctions.  I also took on the role of head of banking supervision at a time when the international approach to the regulation of banks was undergoing the most radical change in decades.  The Basel II accord was published in 2004, it was designed by central banks and regulators from major countries in the world.  It established the key prudential ratios the banks needed to comply with and how these ratios should be calculated.  The approach containing the accord was, in effect, the continuation of the deregulation of the industry which had been happening for more than a decade.  While not fully responsible for the crisis, it provided poor incentives and moved supervision towards a greater recognition of banks' own methods for managing risk and calculating capital.  The system of regulation supervision contained in this accord has proven to be grossly deficient and I will revert to this point.  While I cannot be specific as to the dates, I believe it was around the end of 2004 or early 2005 that I grew increasingly concerned about the way property-based lending was developing in Ireland.  <\/p>  <p>         My concerns were supported by my research of international banking crises and in particular what had happened in Scandinavia in the 1990s.  In mid-2005, I made a written proposal to increase the bank's capital requirements on high loan-to-value mortgages.  This sought to put more capital aside in the event of a downturn and to establish a standard in the market for prudent lending.  However, the proposal was not accepted.  My understanding was that senior management in the Financial Regulator and the Central Bank had considered the matter but did not believe the action was necessary.  Macro-prudential analysis on mortgage growth conducted around this time suggested that the developments could be explained by economic fundamentals.<br\/><br\/>In 2006, Mr. Patrick Neary became the CEO, following the retirement of Dr. Liam O'Reilly, and I was appointed prudential director.  <i>The Irish Times<\/i>quoted in an article as follows: &quot;Shortly after Neary became the regulator's chief executive in 2006, Con Horan, who replaced him as prudential director, knocked on his door and warned that something had to be done to restrain property speculators as house prices reached new highs on spiralling land values and the market was awash with 100 per cent mortgage offers.&quot;  Reflecting these concerns, my first week as prudential director, I presented proposals to the authority for capital measures to address high loan-to-value lending ... mortgage lending.  This was the first time in almost a decade of an exceptional property market that the regulatory intervention was instigated.  Prior to this, moral suasion was the tool used to try to persuade banks to rein in the practices.  Therefore, the taking of direct action represented a significant change and met with internal resistance.  There was concern that such action would jeopardise the stability of the Irish financial system.  There were concerns that such intervention was inconsistent with principles-based supervision.  However, it was approved, after what Governor Honohan has described as long and agonised debate.<br\/><br\/>I wish to point out that I took these actions immediately on my appointment because it was imperative to signal to the banking industry that the approach of property-based lending was changing under the new senior management regime.  The speed and level of consultation in the introduction of the measures led to me being rebuked by the statutory financial services consultative industry panel.  The panel considered the lack of consultation with its members in the preparation of the measures as regrettable and retrogressive.  The chairman of the panel wrote to me reflecting those concerns.  <br\/><br\/>Later in 2006, I followed up these mortgage measures with the introduction of the most stringent capital requirements in Europe for speculative commercial property lending and additional requirements for buy-to-let mortgages.  There was also resistance to these measures.  Clearly the majority view at the time was that the property market was going to have a soft landing as interest rates increased.  There was fear about the message that regulatory intervention would communicate in terms of the property market in Ireland and how it might affect the competitiveness of the banking system.  It is important to point out that a public consultation undertaken on the introduction of the measures did not produce support for these regulatory actions.  The responses received to the consultation were largely critical, with the banks and their representative body expressing the belief that such action was unwarranted and raised the prospect of international investors reacting negatively to the Irish market.  It took a lot of persuasion and a number of board meetings to get agreement on these actions.<br\/><br\/>I would highlight that had the actions been the catalyst for a sharp correction, as many had feared, it would have raised very serious consequences.  However, I did not leave matters there.  In July 2007, revised prudential stress testing guidelines were issued to credit institutions to address loosening underwriting standards.  In effect, my first ten months as prudential director were spent pursuing this agenda of change, culminating in the most stringent regulatory regime in Europe for the key areas of property risk.  Initiating such changes met a lot of internal and external resistance and an absence of public support.  <br\/><br\/>The following slides demonstrate how the market slowed after the measures were introduced.  Okay, I'll be very brief on this.  The first slide deals with residential mortgage lending, and I just really tried to show the sequence of events, that in February 2006 I was appointed prudential director.  I immediately proposed the change and the new rule was introduced on 1 May 2006.  <\/p>  <p>         I think the committee can see that thereafter there's a very clear and consistent decrease in the level of mortgage lending.<\/p> <p> And if I can have the other slide please?  This relates to non-mortgage credit, and again it's from October 2005, and again just appointed prudential director February 2006; I proposed the measures in around September '06 with the capital requirements directive coming in.  The measures came into effect on the 31 December 2006, and again I think you can see in general how the mortgage market, or the non-mortgage credit, went thereafter. <\/p> <p> In all my research and in making my recommendations I was conscious of the views of external contrarians and used their arguments to support the positions I was putting forward.  However, I was also conscious of other views as it would have been entirely wrong and counterproductive to ignore what the domestic mainstream authorities including the ESRI and the Department of Finance were saying.  You must also remember that private sector professionals such as rating agencies, stockbrokers, investment managers and analysts were broadly supportive of the way markets were performing.  The IMF has also acknowledged that it provided few clear warnings about the risks and vulnerabilities associated with the impending crisis.  From its on-site reviews it was supportive of the approach of supervision that was being taken.  In 2006 it proposed that the prudential director should be appointed to the authority so the position would be on a par with the consumer director.  <\/p> <p> Other international bodies such as the OECD were also supportive of the macro-economic analysis of the domestic Irish authorities.  And the ECB, with its financial stability mandate, was not advocating macroprudential action.  It was positive towards the strength of the EU banking sector prior to the crisis.  It is of some comfort to me that the Basel II accord and the capital requirements directive which provided the foundation of the regulatory regime in Ireland have in recent years been acknowledged to be grossly deficient.  In addition to permitting grossly excessive levels of leverage, Basel II encourage pro-cyclicality, failed to provide for systemic risks and allowed banks to operate on extremely low levels of capital, resulting in buffers that were far too low prior to the collapse.  The weakness of the regime has now been identified by many authoritative sources, including parliamentary committees in other jurisdictions.  The process of correcting the deficiencies has been ongoing since 2008, but even now, seven years on, the reforms are not complete.<\/p> <p> To conclude, I wish to repeat that as a member of the senior management team in the Financial Regulator from 2006, I deeply regret and I'm sorry that the system of supervision did not prevent the collapse in the banking system.  I do hope the inquiry will recognise that I took risks to address key problems by introducing stricter regulations in a difficult environment of groupthink.  It was of course my duty as prudential director to do so.  While the ten years as prudential director I saw the introduction of some of the most stringent capital and liquidity rules in Europe, regrettably, however, these measures were too late and were not sufficient to reverse the excesses of the previous decade and save the financial system when the global financial crisis struck.<\/p> <p> Thank you for your attention members.  Can I also add one additional point if I can Chairman?  I do want to correct a point on my earlier statement ... just a brief correction on page 4 ... the third paragraph down under macro-prudential supervision.  There is a reference there to the IFSRA board, that reference ... the IFSRA should be removed it should just be the board.

I think the second point ... the second driver for me was that there were significant challenges with particular institutions in terms of their corporate governance and I wanted to put in measures that would enable administrative sanctions to be taken in the future against those particular ... circumstances.  It was around May 2005,  I made the proposal and administrative sanctions were literally coming on stream very soon after that.  I did go the authority, I think, on two occasions that year with this particular paper.  There was consultations with the industry in between but I think I've set out there my understanding of the ... the view was that the markets ... the institutions were overburdened with regulatory burden at that stage.

My view is probably at that stage, at the earlier stages, before the system became dependent, almost, on the property market, that the interventions, maybe regulatory interventions, from an earlier stage would have curtailed it, and we should have had some targets in our mind as to what was acceptable levels of growth right throughout the period.

They are largely technical in nature.  Our intent was always that an existing regulated financial service provider, authorised to provide credit and already undertaking credit servicing, would not be required to apply for additional authorisation as a credit servicing firm.  These firms have been through the authorisation process and we do not want to impose an additional regulatory burden on them.  We now propose, through amendment No. 10, that such firms be deemed or taken to be authorised as credit servicing firms rather than being excluded from the definition of credit servicing firms.  The amendment will achieve that aim.

A total of 18,000 people fall into this group, approximately 13,000 of whom are with the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC.  The stories I, as an elected representative, hear about their experiences are amazing.  The danger is that the process has opened the door to firms which seek to profit strip from the crisis, having received reductions or write-downs on the size of mortgages.  For example, they may have bought mortgages at 60% of face value and, therefore, see an opportunity to sell houses as soon as possible to realise a profit.  The system has created a commercial opportunity that works against the interests of citizens whom we are here to represent and protect.<\/p><p>I know one individual who is in Leinster House today, who was a couple of days behind in his mortgage repayments and who received a letter from the mortgage provider which was outside the system of regulation for repossession.  That shows that these guys were jumping at the opportunity to repossess.  I know another individual who bought a house and was &euro;2,000 in arrears for four months and whose house was forcibly sold.  When it was sold, he was left with a debt of &euro;80,000.  That is a shocking and disgusting thing for any bank to visit on someone.  <\/p><p>We also know that when citizens try to engage with these unregulated vulture funds, they deal with an opaque system.  There are mortgage holders who receive letters from a company called Acenden in Sweden about particular mortgages.  When they go back to the company, they think they are dealing with, Mars, for example, which knows nothing about Acenden and operates through a PO box number.  When the individual writes to Mars, it takes a long time to obtain the information.  There are no telephone numbers for these companies.  Individuals receive statements with no opening balances, just the details for the year involved.  If they look for information on their 2014 statements half way through 2015, that detail cannot be provided.  They make payments to central accounts that have no reference codes and cannot obtain a digital receipt or information from the firm involved.  We have a Wild West system of deregulation for a significant cohort of individuals.  In the main, their situation is the result of a Government decision.  I spoke to one of them today who told me he would have more rights if he bought a toaster than he has in the case of his mortgage.<\/p><p>We hoped the Government&rsquo;s response to the crisis would be to fulfil and safeguard the rights of citizens as much as possible and we cannot understand why this has not been achieved.  The Minister will recognise the paragraph in my amendment because it is taken from the original document.  It seeks to regulate all players operating in the mortgage system.  There should be no separation or difference between owners and service providers.  It should include those who own the credit, too.  It is a legally complex issue, but, first and foremost, the objective of any Government should be to ensure the people concerned are fully protected.  I, therefore, appeal to the Minister to return to the track he was on initially to ensure full protection.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12015052700002#B00400","speaker":"1080"},{"type":"speech","time":1432743300,"counter":2049,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his amendment and intervention.  The occurrences he describes are totally unacceptable and the purpose of the legislation we are discussing is to ensure they will no longer be in accordance with law and will be prohibited under the terms of the Bill.  The service provider, rather than the owner, interfaces with the customer who has the mortgage.  In the legislation we are controlling the agencies that interact with mortgagees, but if the owner of the asset decides to do this, it will be treated as the provider and subject to the same regulation.<\/p> <p>  My briefing note on the amendment will explain the point more fully.  The amendments are broadly aimed at the regulation of owners of credit.  As I have made clear in previous discussions on this topic, this issue has been given much consideration.  As I outlined on Second Stage, the best protection for consumers will be accorded if credit servicing firms, rather than owners, are regulated.  My purpose is to regulate the activity of credit servicing and I do not propose to regulate ownership, unless the owner is undertaking activity which would result in a prescribed contravention if it were undertaken by a regulated firm.  However, if the owner does not appoint a regulated credit servicing firm to service the credit, the owner must be authorised and regulated.<\/p> <p>  The purpose of the Bill is to ensure consumers retain the protections they had prior to the sale of their loans.  The Bill will require entities dealing with consumers to be authorised by the Central Bank and subject to its codes of conduct.  Dealing with a consumer is credit servicing and the definition of credit servicing is broad.  Owners of loan books who deal directly with consumers, that is, those who are servicing their own loan books, will be regulated.  Otherwise, they can have the loan book serviced by a regulated credit servicing firm.  Either way, the entity dealing with the consumer will be regulated and this is the most appropriate and effective way to protect the consumer. <\/p> <p>  We spoke on Second Stage about the potential for a lacuna to develop if a foreign-based unregulated owner was to use a local credit servicing firm which was not regulated.  It, therefore, became clear in the consultation process that if we were to protect consumers effectively, it was better to regulate the process of credit servicing as that was the customer-facing activity.  In addition, in amendment No. 20 we are imposing a new statutory obligation on owners not to instruct a regulated credit servicing firm to do anything which would be a prescribed contravention if undertaken by a regulated retail credit firm.  There is also an obligation on the credit servicing firm not to implement such an instruction.<\/p><p>This will prevent the owners from doing things we do not want them to do, and it will also ensure there is no way for such an instruction to be implemented.  That is why I am not accepting the Deputy's amendments, but I accept the spirit in which he offers them.  The credit servicing firm will be regulated, because it is the credit servicing firm that interacts with the person who has the mortgage.  If the owner is passive and is working totally through the credit servicing firm, the owner does not enter into the regulatory space.  If, on the other hand, the owner is not passive but acts as his own credit servicing firm, he is treated as a credit servicing firm and falls within this as a regulated entity.  If the owner is a trust that is usually passive but on occasion becomes active and issues instructions to the credit servicing firm that is acting on its behalf, I would point to amendment No. 20, which we will come to later, which prohibits the owning entity from issuing any instruction which is one of the proscribed activities; therefore, we have it blocked out there as well.  What we have done is now fully in line with the intentions the Deputy expressed, and the person with the mortgage is fully protected from the activities of the credit servicing firm and the owner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12015052700002#B00500","speaker":"955","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1432743300,"counter":2051,"content":"<p>Why not regulate all of the mortgage providers at all levels?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12015052700002#C00200","speaker":"1080"},{"type":"speech","time":1432743300,"counter":2052,"content":"<p>It is the activity that is regulated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12015052700002#C00300","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1432743300,"counter":2053,"content":"<p>I understand, but why would we not simply regulate?

He offered to pay 30% of that loan in a negotiated fashion, but the bank refused that negotiated offer and sold the loan to another firm.  That firm was not incorporated on the day the loan was sold, and he understands the loan was sold for 15% of its value, which was 15% less than the money he was offering the bank.  He understands also that the third-party financial institution it was sold to is staffed by people who were originally staff members of the first bank.  I understand there is an opaque system in existence whereby individuals do not know who owns their mortgage at times and they cannot contact or deal with these organisations.<\/p> <p>  The Minister mentioned that there is a clear delineation of interaction between service providers and the owners of the debt, but that is not always the case.  I am dealing with a hundred different mortgage distress situations in my office, and if one telephones Pepper, a service provider, one will get to a certain level with it but then one has to go back to the original owner of the mortgage to ascertain and get clear information.  In the day-to-day aspects of dealing with the banks, it is the citizens' experience that the clean delineation the Minister spoke of is not clear.  He mentioned that the Government is on a trajectory of further regulation, but this Bill is on a trajectory of less regulation, because we had stronger regulation in its previous manifestation.  Given the fact that under this Bill it will remain opaque as to where the mortgage lies, where it is sold to, that location and the behaviour of that bank, surely cleaning up this process would be to the benefit of the Department of Finance and to the benefit of the citizen.  Given the billions of euro we have spent as a result of the lack of regulation, surely regulation should be the default system to which we go as the Legislature.  There is no benefit to our leaving gaps in regulation and leaving cloaked or invisible sectors with regard to the citizen.  Why is default regulation not the step being taken by the Government and why would it seek to allow for that cloaked sector?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12015052700002#C00600","speaker":"1080"},{"type":"speech","time":1432743300,"counter":2056,"content":"<p>The firms that provided mortgages - the banks and the building societies - are traditionally regulated by the Central Bank under protocols and regulations.  In the new circumstances in which loans are sold as portfolios, we want to ensure that the same regulation applies to those as historically applied to the mortgagee and the mortgage offerers with which we are all familiar.<\/p> <p>  The Central Bank's quarterly report in April last stated that there were 758,988 mortgages altogether, which is a lot of mortgages.  It showed that a total of 42,169 accounts were with non-bank lenders, which included both regulated retail credit firms and currently unregulated entities.  I understand the breakdown between regulated and unregulated entities is that two thirds are regulated and one third are unregulated - that is, approximately one third of the 42,000 accounts are unregulated.  The quantum we are talking about, and that we are enacting this legislation to cover, is 14,000 out of 750,000.  With the additional sales since April, that 14,000 may now be 15,000 or 16,000.  That is the nature of what we are doing.  <\/p> <p>  Some owners, as investors, buy the portfolio.  I do not have the examples the Deputy quoted, but loans are not sold individually but as portfolios.  As for individual loans being sold on, I do not understand that.  Once we pass this legislation, the people providing the credit servicing will have to follow the code of conduct on mortgage arrears which the Central Bank has prescribed.  They will also have to follow the clear guidelines on how to communicate.  The offensive way in which some mortgage owners communicated will have to stop, and they will be fully covered.<\/p> <p>  Our original intention, as the Deputy suggested, was to cover the credit servicing firms and also the owners, but there is a cost in regulation.  If unnecessary regulation is applied to people who do not need to be regulated, there is a cost in that and, ultimately, the cost will fall on the borrower.  After Second Stage and after the conversations we had here, we decided there was a more focused way of doing it.<\/p><p>We have decided that the provisions of the Bill would apply to the credit servicing agencies and firms and if the owners were acting in that capacity they would also be covered by the regulation, or if the owners were giving instructions, either day to day or intermittently, to the credit servicing agencies then they would be covered by amendment No. 20 and it would be illegal for them to give such instructions, so every eventuality is covered.  Therefore, the Deputy's amendment is unnecessary and would add extra expense for borrowers if I were to accept it.

I accept the Minister's point that during the course of that credit servicing agreement the owner is not to give instructions either to take or not to take action.  It has given its instructions in the contract when appointing the credit service firm.

One question that I raised on Second Stage was about a situation in which one of the big banks - AIB or Bank of Ireland - sells the loan to a company outside Ireland, which in turn appoints a credit servicing firm to do the work for it in Ireland.  Essentially, the Minister is saying that the owner, who could be in any other country - say, Canada - will not be regulated, because it is not giving instructions.  I maintain that this is a way out.  My main concern, which I highlighted on Second Stage, is about this issue.  I think it is a way for Bank of Ireland and AIB, the banks with the greatest number of mortgages, or Permanent TSB or whoever, to put together bundles of their more difficult loans and sell them off at a discount to a company outside the State, which, in turn, will hire a credit servicing firm to do its bidding.  It may satisfy the conditions of the Minister's new amendment, No. 20, to which he has referred, by saying, \"We are not instructing it.\"  Ultimately, the owner, who is unregulated, will be calling the shots, and when it seeks expressions of interest from different credit servicing firms it will appoint the firm that will do what it wants done.  It would be similar to a passive owner of any company, where the management gets on with the job.  I still believe the owner would have the ultimate power to give instructions because it can remove the credit servicing firm from the equation and appoint a new firm in due course.  I believe, even though it would not appear to interfere, it would be well able to interfere by sacking the firm.  Ultimately, it has the power to hire and fire the credit servicing firm.  That is enough of a threat for any credit servicing firm to do the bidding of the owner without any visible trace of interference by the owner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12015052700002#D01000","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speech","time":1432743300,"counter":2067,"content":"<p>That would be the situation if we were not enacting this Bill, but there are clear guidelines on the role of the owner set out in section 1(f) of the Bill before us, which are being supplemented with amendment No. 20.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12015052700002#D01100","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1432743300,"counter":2068,"content":"<p>Which we are coming to.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12015052700002#D01200","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speech","time":1432743300,"counter":2069,"content":"<p>It is clear from section 1(f) that the owner is constrained in what he may do.  All credit servicing firms will follow the same regulations.  On the issue of owners based outside Ireland, I have a note, which I read.  Relevant Irish financial services law, including the Consumer Protection Code 2012, the code of conduct on mortgage arrears and the Consumer Credit Act 1995, applies to the regulated activities of regulated entities.  The Central Bank codes apply to the lending activities of all regulated entities except credit unions operating in the State including, <i>inter alia<\/i>, a financial service provider that is authorised, registered or licensed in another European Union or EEA member state and that has provided, or is providing, lending activities in the State.  Any agent acting on behalf of a regulated financial service provider - that is, where an activity is outsourced - must comply with the requirements of Irish financial services law, including the code of conduct on mortgage arrears, and a failure to do so may result in the Central Bank imposing penalties on the regulated financial services provider concerned.  The Bill will work by requiring that firms that service credit are authorised by the Central Bank and are therefore subject to regulation by the bank and also have access to the Financial Services Ombudsman's regime.  The Bill will therefore regulate the activity of credit servicing and the credit servicing firms engaged in such activity, irrespective of where the loan book owner is based.  In order that the borrowers retain the protections they had before the loan book was sold, all consumer and SME loans which are sold by regulated financial institutions will be covered by these amendments and retain the protections they have already.<\/p><p>The approach we are taking to regulating servicing firms is taken because it is the credit servicing firm that interacts with customers.  It is the customers who require the protection and it is the protection from the interaction that is required.  But if the owner skips the middleman and decides to be his own servicer, he is regulated then as the credit servicing firm.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12015052700002#D01300","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1432743300,"counter":2070,"content":"<p>I understand all that and I appreciate the Minister's clarification.

We can put that side of the issue to bed.  However, the loan book owner is the real issue.  I understand from what the Minister said that the loan book owner, once it is in the European Union area, is regulated by the European Central Bank, ECB.  My original comment was about a situation in which the loans are sold outside Ireland - say, in Canada, a non-EU country.  Earlier in his reply, the Minister said they would be regulated and he referred to the European Union.  Where the loan book owner is outside the EU and European regulation, is that owner out of the system?  What happens to the owner outside the EU system and where is he or she captured in the system?  The Minister might say it is anti-competitive, and I accept that it would limit the sale process of some of these loans if the regulated institutions in Ireland who are selling off chunks of loan books were confined to selling them to organisations that are already regulated in the European Union.

The reciprocal arrangements would not apply if it was a Canadian-based owner.  Foreign-based owners are part of the reason we changed tack.  Services must be regulated to be allowed interaction with Irish customers, so owners cannot circumvent the regulations.

This implies that the legislation is about regulating those who interface with the customers.  That is a bit like regulating the estate agent rather than the owner of the property.  The person who owns the property ultimately calls the shots.  The loan book owner might not call the shots daily, but on the day it appointed its agent, the credit servicing company, it gave it the riding instructions.

In the general mortgage sphere under the code of conduct, there are many mortgage holders who have had a disastrous experience.  Let me give an example.  A couple who are pensioners from my home town of Navan have a mortgage with one of the banks that are covered but had a disastrous experience over the past three or four years.  Their relationship with the bank has been managed by a call centre, as such.  It is not as if there is an individual managing the relationship.  A member of staff might look at the computer today and read the last paragraph of the file to determine the relationship between the bank and mortgage holder, and then ring the latter with that shallow information.  He or she might then either impart information, which could be wrong, or collect information, which could be wrong, or cause confusion.  In the example in question, the family engaged with the mortgage company for three years and was literally given incorrect information.  It seems as if this was on purpose at times and that at times boxes were being ticked just to move the family along the process to meet the eventual objective of the bank, which was to dispossess the family or repossess the house.  Once the family complained to the Financial Services Ombudsman, the bank began the legal process, which stopped the ombudsman's office from actually being able to deal with the issue.  As the Minister knows, the powers of the ombudsman's office are as weak as possibly could be with regard to upholding the rights of citizens.<\/p> <p>  That is the motivation for a normal bank functioning in Ireland.  We know the motivation of the vulture funds is very different.  These firms want to profit fast.  In other words, they are not in it for the longer term or for a relationship over the years.

Of the 750,000 mortgages in the country, all but 15,000 to 16,000 are already covered by that code of conduct.

I do not propose to accept amendment No. 7.  Amendment No. 3 and the first part of amendment No. 5 are technical in nature and deal with the definition of the term &quot;creditor&quot;.  The amendments are intended to ensure the Bill covers only credit as issued by those in the business of lending and does not cover loans made between family, friends, etc.  Without these amendments, a person who issues credit casually or outside the business would need an authorisation to service this credit.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 7 in the name of Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n is a cognate amendment and has, therefore, been included in this group, although it appears to be related to the regulation of owners, which was discussed when we debated the previous group.  The Deputy's amendment would remove the exclusion in section 1(f) for owners who take certain limited actions in respect of credit owned by them.  As I have made clear in previous discussions on this topic, this issue has been given much consideration.  I outlined on Second Stage that the best protection will be accorded consumers if credit servicing firms, rather than owners, are regulated.<\/p><p>My objective is to regulate the activity of credit servicing.  I do not propose to regulate ownership unless the owner is undertaking credit servicing or an activity that would result in a prescribed contravention if it were undertaken by a regulated firm.  However, if the owner does not appoint a regulated credit servicing firm to service the credit, the owner must be authorised and regulated.  While owners will be able to make certain decisions regarding loan books, such decisions will have to be implemented by a regulated credit service.  Therefore, the owner will be able to make high level decisions without the need to be authorised, provided these decisions do not result in the borrower being deprived of the protection which would apply if the decisions had been taken by a regulated firm. <\/p><p>In addition, the purpose of amendment No. 20, which will be discussed later, is to impose a new statutory obligation on owners not to instruct a regulated credit servicing firm to do anything which would be a prescribed contravention if undertaken by a regulated retail credit firm.  There is also an obligation on the credit servicing firm not to implement such an instruction.  This provision will prevent owners from doing things we do not want them to do and ensure there is no way for such an instruction to be implemented.  As such, I reject amendment No. 7.  <\/p><p>On the definition of the term &quot;prescribed contravention&quot; in amendment No. 5, which term is also referred to in amendment No. 9, this is a technical amendment as there are now two references to &quot;prescribed contravention&quot; in the Bill.  The definition in the 1942 Act remains unchanged. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12015052700002#G00400","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1432743300,"counter":2100,"content":"<p>It is important to focus on what is being done today.  A group of people, some of whom are present in the Gallery, took out mortgages that were subject to regulation.  As a result of a Government decision, however, their mortgages are no longer regulated.  A whole sector of financial services is putting the squeeze on citizens.  Families need a home because without a warm, safe and comfortable home, very little else flows in life, whether it is the education or health of one's children or one's mental well-being.  The prospect of having the family home taken away is one of the biggest threats a human being can suffer in his or her life.<\/p> <p>  While I accept the Minister's point that not all vulture funds will have the same motivation or strategic commercial objectives, some of these companies are seeking repossession at the earliest possible date in order that they can make financial gains.  The Bill does not fully regulate these vulture funds and, by default, allows them to operate in a universe of deregulation.  In addition, regulation for regulated sectors is being watered down and the powers of the Financial Services Ombudsman and Central Bank to enforce the rights of citizens weakened.  Let us take the example of a vulture fund that has purchased a portfolio of vulnerable mortgages for the purpose of pressing ahead with repossessions at the earliest possible date with a view to selling the repossessed properties to realise a profit.<\/p><p>Let us assume that this is a possibility.  One method of pushing a family over the edge is to raise the interest rate, making it impossible for them to hold on to the family home.  The Government could allow for this action to be regulated.  My amendment would delete these aspects and negate this possibility.  I have heard the Minister in the media a number of times speak robustly about the need for the pillar banks and the other operating banks to fall into line in terms of interest rates, given the damage being done to ordinary families trying to get by in life.  He has met the banks to realise this objective, yet a section of financial groups, many of which are operating abroad, are not subject to the political leverage any Minister might bring to the table in the future and could easily raise interest rates, forcing defaults and repossessions.  Instead of seeking minimalist control over vulture funds, I appeal to the Minister to increase the tools of the State apparatus and do no more than the right thing by citizens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12015052700002#G00500","speaker":"1080","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1432743300,"counter":2102,"content":"<p>Let us consider first principles.  The purpose of the Bill is to ensure the protection a home owner had before his or her mortgage was sold is restored fully, no more or no less.  If someone has lost protection through a sale transaction from a regulated to an unregulated entity, this legislation will restore the <i>status quo<\/i>.  There is no weakening of the regulatory provision.  As we have shared, the Bill will apply to approximately 15,000 or 16,000 mortgages out of a total of more than 750,000.<\/p><p>The Deputy raised the issue of interest rates.  The aim of the Bill is to ensure borrowers whose loans are sold to unregulated entities will be given the same protection as when their loans were held by regulated entities.  That is what the Bill does.  That protection will be restored to mortgage holders when it is enacted and signed by the President.  Mortgage holders will have the same protection in terms of interest rates as those who have their loans with regulated banks.  For example, the first protection for a borrower is his or her mortgage contract.  The loan or mortgage contract between two parties specifies the conditions on which an interest rate can change.  The regulation on unfair terms in consumer contracts specifies that interest rates cannot change without a valid reason.  There is no situation where new owners can arbitrarily change interest rates in the interests of profiteering.  That would not be a valid reason.  Furthermore, competition applies to the generality of mortgages.<\/p><p>It is important to remember that the aim of the owner of a loan book is to have a book of performing loans.  Therefore, significant increases in interest rates could hamper this.  I have no evidence of new owners of loan portfolios acquiring ownership for the purposes of possessing property.  That is not what happens.  The purpose is to make profits on their acquisitions.  I have no evidence to date of loan book owners seeking to buy up loans in order to increase interest rates.  Nothing has been brought to my attention directly or by the Central Bank.  They are prevented under law from doing so arbitrarily, outside the contract loan terms or without valid reasons.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12015052700002#H00200","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1432743300,"counter":2103,"content":"<p>The Minister has outlined the purpose of the Bill as he sees it, but I suggest the purpose should be to protect home owners from the predatory practices of vulture funds.

The Minister mentioned that he had no evidence of vulture funds seeking to repossess asap for profit stripping.  I have that evidence.  There are numerous examples of families who are in arrears for a couple of days on unregulated mortgages only and who immediately have firms sending them letters seeking repossession.  If I were involved in a firm and my objective was to work out the mortgage and make it function, that would not be my action.  My action would be to sit down with the family, write a standard financial statement, determine affordability and work out a structure that would allow for the loan's repayment over a period.  However, it is the opposite behaviour that we are seeing among some of these organisations.<\/p> <p>  The Minister mentioned influence over interest rates.  No one seems to know who is involved in some of the vulture funds because they are hidden behind X, Y and Z companies, mortgages are wrapped up in this or that loan book, etc.  The funds are inaccessible to many people who have mortgages with them and even their staff are not fully sure what the line of ownership is.  It is difficult to ascertain what the determining factors will be for the interest rates of such companies and it is impossible for the Minister to replicate the level of influence he has over some of the main banks in the State, as the funds in question operate with a different objective and under a different relationship with the State.  Instead of trying to weaken the Minister's ability to protect the home owner, how about viewing the Bill as an opportunity to strengthen it?  I am seeking to give him more tools in his arsenal to deal with a disaster that could affect a family.  If that disaster does not strike, happy days, but if the Minister was given the strength to deal with it, it would have a chilling effect on the possibility of it happening because the funds would know that, if he became angry, he would implement X, Y and Z.  If, however, he does not have that strength, there will be no chilling effect and, if the worst comes to the worst, we will sit here in a number of years time and view this as a missed opportunity.  It might theoretically be difficult and we empathise, but dozens, if not hundreds, of families could be thrown out onto the road as a result of the inadequacies of the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12015052700002#H00700","speaker":"1080"},{"type":"speech","time":1432743300,"counter":2108,"content":"<p>There is a consumer code on mortgage arrears, CCMA, which is set down by the Central Bank.

A vulture fund does not give a damn about any of those things.  It is not in it for the long term.  It is not in it to develop customer relations; it is in it to make money out of an investment.  It might be true that at a particular point in time it suits a vulture fund to have a revenue stream coming in and therefore it will not push for repossession.  But at other times a vulture fund might say, \"The best way for us to maximise our profit, to get the best return on our investment, is just to move in on these people in every way we can, get the asset off them and make a whack load of cash out of it.\"  That is the nature of these vulture funds and that is why they are called vulture funds.  We need to recognise the difference.  Furthermore, there is this more opaque line of responsibility via these credit financing or these credit service firms and the owners behind them, making it all the more difficult for the mortgage-holder.  If we acknowledge those differences then we should have the most robust protections possible for the mortgage-holder and we should go for the maximum protection and powers for the State in dealing with these entities that have no loyalty to the customer nor to the jurisdiction, no loyalty other than to themselves to make as much money as possible.

The customer should be advised of his or her rights under the code of conduct on mortgage arrears and the Financial Services Ombudsman.<\/p><p>The major issue is that the customer should be notified of all issues relating to proposed changes to his or her credit agreement within 30 days.  Each of the paragraphs stands on its own merit, but the most important paragraph is that the consumer be advised whether the loan was sold at a discount.<\/p><p>We have all dealt with several such cases, for example, a mortgage of &euro;200,000 being sold to a debt management firm and-or a credit servicing firm at a 50% discount and yet the customer is still being pursued for &euro;200,000 by the company who bought the loan for &euro;100,000.  If that company gets &euro;150,000 they have made a mega profit.  In many such situations, the customer would wish to settle at below the book value but at a substantially higher level than what the debt management firm bought his or her loan for, but it may not be willing to do that.  People are entitled to know if their loans have been sold at a discount of 30% or 40%.  I know the Minister will say that these loans were bundled and one cannot state the exact price of each individual loan in the 5,000 mortgages in the portfolio but I think people are entitled to assume that the average discount, by and large, applied across the portfolio.  There must be some measure whereby people with distressed mortgages in substantial arrears can deal with the company which has bought their loans at a discount.<\/p><p>I equate my proposal with NAMA.  NAMA acquired the loans from the major banks at rates ranging from 47% to 53%, but at approximately 50% of the book value.  NAMA considers it has done its job if it collects what it paid for the loans, notwithstanding that the book value of the loans was almost double.  I want the same principle that applied to the NAMA business loans to apply to householders.  The cost to the Exchequer of the write-down of the loan from the bank on transfer to NAMA is between &euro;35 billion to &euro;40 billion.<\/p><p>NAMA is not pursuing the book value of &euro;70 billion but is only going after the &euro;35 billion at which it booked the loans and it is happy with that.  The same principle should apply if one of these vulture funds buys loans at a 50% discount  The customer is entitled to know that is the effective market value of the loan at this point.  The original book value does not apply in the commercial world but it is being forced on home owners.  I am looking for equality of treatment.  One might say the new owner would not do a deal except on those terms but a home owner would be in a much stronger negotiating position if he or she knew what the investor had actually paid for the mortgage.  People are entitled to know what their mortgages are worth and what has been paid for them.  <\/p><p> This follows directly on from the previous amendment of Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n, which sought to allow people to know the ultimate owner of their mortgages.  It is fine dealing with the local estate agent or local debt servicing company but they are only the front-of-house people for those who actually own the loans.  People are entitled to know because they are looking at ultimately being forced to give up their houses and may have to do so even if they are in a position to pay far more than those who took over the mortgages in the first place.  We want to see this matter addressed.  That is the essence of amendment No. 11.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12015052700002#K01300","speaker":"1100","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1432743300,"counter":2136,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Fleming for moving the amendment.  I understand that the aim of Deputy McGrath's amendment is to ensure the consumer is correctly informed and protected and it does so by seeking to impose obligations on credit servicing and other firms in relation to the credit which is sold.  The first set of obligations are around commercial information on the deal to sell the credit, that is the terms on which it was sold and whether the loans were sold at a discount.  The terms of the individual's contract with the lender are not changed by the sale of the loan and therefore it is difficult to see the benefit of making the information known to the borrower.  Even if the overall loan book is sold at a discount, as Deputy Fleming said, the amount owned by an individual borrower is not changed nor are the other terms and conditions.  Furthermore, usually these loans are bundled for sale at an aggregate price and individual loans are not separately priced, making it impossible for customers to be advised on the exact terms or price under which their loan was sold.  Also, when NAMA acquired loans the borrowers were not told what discount applied, for much the same reasons even though it is in the commercial space rather than residential loans.<\/p> <p>  The second set of obligations mentioned in this amendment are around the borrower's rights under the code of conduct on mortgage arrears and access to the Financial Services Ombudsman.  Following the enactment of this legislation, these rights will not be changed by the sale of loan books.  The rights in question are already provided for and when the President signs this law these rights will be maintained.  I do not consider it necessary that the borrowers be given an additional reminder of their rights when these rights and all the rights they had before the loan book was sold remain the same.  This debate and the assurances we are giving today should be communicated to persons whose loans are sold so that they are assured that they retain all rights and that these rights will be protected by the Central Bank under the code of conduct governing mortgage arrears.  I do not think the amendment is necessary and I will not be accepting it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12015052700002#L00200","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1432743300,"counter":2137,"content":"<p>I accept the Minister's point about giving information on the code of conduct on mortgage arrears and that the right to go to the Financial Services Ombudsman is effectively unchanged.  However, the core issue of this amendment is the value of the loan sold at a discount.  The Minister again drew the comparison with NAMA.  The write-downs in respect of the loans transferred from AIB, Bank of Ireland and Anglo Irish Bank to NAMA were widely published.  It was known that some sites were sold without planning permission and that, in such cases, there was a 90% write-down whereas other, performing, loans with only a couple of years to go were bought with very little write-down.  People were able to work out the approximate discount but NAMA is happy if it gets back its booking price.<\/p> <p>  The Minister said he saw little benefit in giving people information as to their value of their mortgage.  People are entitled to know that.  If one of these service providers, on behalf of the owner who may be outside the jurisdiction and may not be regulated because somebody else is hired to do the dirty work locally, goes to court for a mortgage of &euro;200,000 it would be useful for the judge to know that they were trying to evict people who owe &euro;200,000 when only &euro;100,000 was actually paid for that mortgage.  The buyers felt the mortgage was only worth &euro;100,000 because they knew it was distressed, even though it had an outstanding payment of &euro;200,000.  It would be very useful for people to know that they were being put out of their house for amounts far in excess of what the owner of the mortgage paid for it.  This is the inequity in the system and it is essentially why people are still sore.  They are being pursued for the last drop of blood by companies which will make a financial killing by getting them out of the house.  <\/p> <p>  The citizen has to come into this situation.  We are talking about the nuclear situation where people's homes are being repossessed in the courts.  They have gone through the code of conduct and the Financial Services Ombudsman.  It is not irrelevant for people to know, when they are being put out of their house, what the owner of their mortgage actually paid for it.

People know what their obligations are in terms of their repayments and the capital outstanding.  One line of argument is to say that if there are discounts they should apply to individual mortgage holders as well but the problem with that is what one would say to the neighbour who is fully compliant, not in arrears and liable for the full mortgage.  How does one explain the difference?  The arrangement that has been come to with the banks, through the Central Bank in particular, is that mortgages in arrears are treated on a case-by-case basis and restructuring arrangements are available through the lending agencies depending on the circumstances.<\/p> <p>  There is no universal right to a discount but discounts are applied on a case-by-case basis.  The announcements made by the Minister for Justice and Equality to amend the insolvency laws will mean that, at the very end, there is an alternative to a repossession.  A case before the courts will be tracked to a judge who will have, in effect, the same powers as an examiner has at present to adjudicate on the appropriateness of an insolvency arrangement and can decide in favour of the mortgage holder.  It is not that there are no solutions but there are no solutions that are universally applied.  There are solutions that attempt to fit the particular case.  <\/p> <p>  This is not to say that this is not a very fraught area.

That is the Richie Boucher line: there will be no write-offs.  Bear in mind that when those loans were sold by those banks on to the other companies, the write-down and the hole in the balance sheet was fixed by the taxpayer.  There was no problem with the taxpayer coming up with the money to repair the hole in the banks as a result of selling off these loans at a discount.  The taxpayer has no problem with paying it to make that half of the equation good, but God forbid an individual should get a write-down.  It is fine for the banks to write down their loans when they are selling them off at a discount and to ask the taxpayer to pay, but that should not trickle down to the individual.  It is only at the commercial end that debts get written off in this country.  That is what is annoying people.  Only the businesses and the banks are getting their debts written off, but it does not apply to the individual.  I understand what the Minister is saying about the neighbour next door who is fully tax-compliant and fully up to speed with their mortgage, but the taxpayer has picked up the tab where the bank loans were sold off at a discount, resulting in a hole in their balance sheets.

Mr. Boucher is chief executive officer of Bank of Ireland, which has a well known position of no discounts or write-downs.  However, that is not the situation across the banks.  AIB, for example, has given discounts amounting to &euro;480 million in its restructuring of mortgages over the last two years, and other lending agencies have also come into arrangements where there are write-downs.  My position is that this is a very serious issue.  It is particularly serious for families in arrears and it is traumatic for families which, through illness or unemployment, cannot service their mortgages at all and face the risk of their houses being repossessed.  I am saying the range of solutions involves dealing with mortgages on a case-by-case basis and I believe the solutions should involve write-downs.

All we need to do is to put a barcode on each mortgage so that individual mortgages can be ascertained.  It is not rocket science.  What we are looking for is transparency in this process.  Transparency is good for the citizen and for the management of the economy.  For example, on Monday I had a look at the share register of Siteserv shareholders.  Many of them are hidden behind brokerage firms, so one cannot see the names of the individuals who were involved in the share transactions.  I asked KPMG whether in its review it will be able to see exactly who were the shareholders behind those brokerage firms.  It said it would not.  That lack of transparency will make the review that the Government is involved in deficient.  KPMG will not be able to ascertain why there was a transaction spike in the months before the sale of Siteserv.  The problem is that we only seem to realise transparency is important after the problems have occurred.  All this amendment suggests is that we build transparency into the system as soon as possible.  Transparency is not a tool against strategic default.  There are many other ways to prevent families or individuals from defaulting strategically on their mortgages.  Keeping them blind to the fact is not a tool.  This boils down to a hierarchy of priorities.  Do we provide full transparency and give families the ability to understand what is going on with their own houses, or do we allow these firms to profit in these scenarios?

One of the points that the Minister for Finance made was that a lot of mortgages were simply rolled into very deep loan books, which made it impossible to determine individual experiences when trying to outwork a mortgage.  I suggested that a barcode be put on each mortgage, which is done in the United States.  Such an initiative would allow for rolled-up mortgages to be individually identified for the purpose of management.<\/p> <p>  Another point I made was that transparency leads to proper management.  I am reminded of the old saying that one cannot manage if one cannot measure.  Transparency leads to accountability.  Last Monday I was with KPMG, where we looked at the Siteserv share register and all the different entries.  I discovered that most of the share transactions that happened at the peak, before the firm was sold, were in the names of brokerage firms.  Therefore, I could not see who the owners of the shares were.  I presumed that KPMG could do so, given that it is carrying out the review, but KPMG told me that it could not see through the list either.  Therefore, KPMG must review a system that is not transparent and, thus, will be unable to find out the identity of the individuals behind the share transactions.  Obviously that situation puts the Government on the back foot in terms of getting to the bottom of what happened.  As Deputy Fleming mentioned a few minutes ago, the motion would allow for greater transparency, which would put the Government in the driving seat in the future.<\/p> <p>  There is a hierarchy of priorities.

I wish to signal that I may table an amendment on Report Stage.<\/p> <p>  I fundamentally oppose and object to the idea that people's mortgages can be bundled up and sold to vulture funds.  That kind of carry-on produced a global economic crisis.  I would like to see a regulation that precludes companies, firms or vulture funds which are not real companies in the proper sense from engaging in such activity.  They are not interested in the customer, the consumer, the country or developing market relations even on a commercial basis.  They are just vulture funds.  I would prefer if the Central Bank of Ireland did not give these people the right to come in and buy bundles of mortgages.  I am pretty certain that the Government is disposed to allowing this kind of thing in the belief that the global financial system works in this way and there is not much one can do about the situation.  Therefore, at the very least, we should have the highest level of transparency and the greatest level of protection for customers and, potentially, victims of these firms.  It seems entirely reasonable that people should be informed as soon as their mortgage is sold to one of these funds or sold to anybody.  People should be told all of the rights they are entitled to in this situation and the discount that the vulture fund received.  That is the point that Deputy Fleming made.  <\/p> <p>  Let me outline what the Minister for Finance said before the Minister of State arrived.  First, it was a demand made by some of the people who are in this position that they should be allowed, individually, to buy back their mortgages at the same discount as vulture funds.  In some cases, people have even offered to pay more than the vulture funds were willing to pay.  That means people were willing to pay over and above the discounted rate in order to get their mortgages back.  It was in that regard that the Minister invoked the issue of moral hazard as the reason people could not buy their mortgages back.

He made the point, but I do not understand the double standard.  It is unfair that very wealthy people who owed money to a bank, in corporate loans, were facilitated with big write-downs for companies that they bought.  There might have been other companies that had loans and were paying them back fully but did not receive big write-downs.  Siteserv was propped up and benefitted from a massive write-down, and we know of other examples.  What about all the companies that made repayments?  They were disadvantaged.  A moral hazard existed, but that did not seem to matter because we were talking about big corporate loans and, possibly, because we were talking about very wealthy people.  I do not know the reason for such treatment.  It was a case of double standards, because the issue of moral hazard was not invoked.  An attitude was adopted that moral hazard should be avoided at all costs.  The moral hazard excuse is invoked in the case of the poor distressed mortgage holder who wants to get the same discount on his or her mortgage that a vulture fund gets.  I do not understand the double standards and inconsistency in that regard.  At the very least, people deserve transparency, and to know the discount that a vulture fund gets which is the point of the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12015052700002#O01600","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1432743300,"counter":2163,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for providing a few minutes for the switchover.  I have followed some of the debate and I know the Minister has responded to some of the issues raised by the amendments.  Let me add a few of my own thoughts on the matter.<\/p> <p>  First, we must remind ourselves what this Bill is and is not about.  The Bill is not about some of the issues that Deputy Boyd Barrett has raised.  The Bill is about making sure that when we pass this legislation through the Houses of the Oireachtas and it is enacted, every mortgage holder has the same level of protection that they had before the loan was sold to the credit servicing firm.  That is the nub of what the Government wants to do here.<\/p><p>While the Minister, Deputy Noonan, did not use the phrase \"moral hazard\", he was making the point that, in a scenario where one neighbour is breaking his or her back to pay the mortgage in full and on time each month, and struggling to make ends meet, while the person next door might not be in a position to pay the mortgage although he or she is also doing the best, the Government has to take a holistic view.  The Minister has made it clear that we believe the way to deal with mortgage arrears is on a case-by-case basis and by putting in place structures, supports, schemes and systems to enable assistance to be offered.  Colleagues will have seen other such measures from the Government in recent weeks.<\/p><p> It is also important to say that there is a legally binding contract in place, the terms of which are not changing.  If one has taken out a mortgage for X amount, even if the mortgage is sold to somebody else, that amount is still owed.  A borrower and a lender usually enter into a lending agreement, which is a financial contract whose terms do not typically provide a borrower with the right to be informed by the lender of the value the lender attributes to the contract itself.  For those fundamental reasons, I am not in a position to accept the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12015052700002#O01700","speaker":"1106","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1432743300,"counter":2165,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1432743300,"counter":2166,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 12 and 24 are related and may be discussed together, by agreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12015052700002#P00300","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speech","time":1432743300,"counter":2167,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 12:<blockquote><br \/><br \/>In page 5, between lines 34 and 35, to insert the following:&ldquo;(2) Section 33A of the Central Bank Act 1997 is amended by inserting the following<br \/><br \/>subsection after subsection (5)&mdash;<blockquote>&ldquo;(6) The Bank shall also impose a condition that debt management firm<br \/><br \/>and\/or a credit servicing firm shall be subject to the Code of Conduct<br \/><br \/>on Mortgage Arrears 2013, in relation to all mortgages, including a<br \/><br \/>mortgage that was not previously covered under said code.&rdquo;.&rdquo;.<\/blockquote><\/blockquote>The amendment provides for a condition that the debt management or credit servicing firm shall be subject to a code of conduct in respect of all mortgages, including mortgages not previously covered under the said code.

The Minister for Finance has listened carefully to the comments made on Second Stage and the new section addresses the concerns that were raised relating to the relationship between the owner of the credit and credit servicing firm.  We have already discussed the policy decision to regulate the credit servicing firm, which was considered to be the best way to protect the consumer, given that it is the credit servicing firm that is interacting with the consumer.  However, in this amendment, we propose a statutory obligation that will ensure a credit servicing cannot do something or fail to do something which would be a prescribed contravention if performed or not performed by a retail credit firm and which prevents the owner of credit from instructing a regulated credit firm to perform such an action.<\/p><p>Under the terms of the amendment, if the unregulated owner instructs the credit servicing firm to do something which would be a prescribed contravention if undertaken by a retail credit firm, the credit servicing firm cannot implement such a decision.  It is an offence by the unregulated owner to instruct the credit servicing firm to do this.  We consider the obligation necessary to restore borrowers to the situation in which they were before the sale of a loan book when they were protected as they were dealing with the regulated financial service provider and, as such, would have been protected by the codes and the original lender not committing a prescribed contravention.<\/p><p>We are specifying an offence for the unregulated owner, while also ensuring that the breach cannot be implemented by the regulated servicer over which the Central Bank has oversight as a regulated entity.  This will mean a quicker response to possible breaches.  Furthermore, this oversight will allow the Central Bank to investigate cases in which an unregulated owner instructs a credit servicing firm to do something which would be a proscribed contravention if done by a retail credit firm.  Such a breach is actionable by the Central Bank against the credit servicing firm.  The holder of legal title could also be liable for credit servicing without authorisation under section 1(f) of the Bill.  The obligation on the regulated credit servicing firm not to perform the action also means that the borrower has access to the Financial Services Ombudsman.  This amendment was introduced to respond to legitimate issues raised on Second Stage and I hope it will be welcomed by members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12015052700002#Q02300","speaker":"1106","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1432743300,"counter":2218,"content":"<p>I acknowledge the principle of the amendment but we are discussing the actions of an unregulated organisation.

The purpose of this amendment is to deal with unregulated bodies but he has acknowledged that if an unregulated organisation owns the loan book, it will not come within the remit of the Financial Regulator.

That begs the question of how we can supervise vulture funds which are based abroad and operate through the credit servicing firms.  How can we even be made aware the pressures they bring to bear?<\/p> <p>  I have not tabled an amendment in this regard on Committee Stage because I do not know how I would address the issue but I may prepare an amendment on Report Stage.  If the purpose of the Bill is to protect consumers, it should simply keep vulture funds out of the mortgage business.  I do not see what they contribute.  I might have difficulties with private banking but I understand the purpose of a bank.  I would prefer the banks to be in public ownership but I recognise that they have a role to play.  I do not see what useful purpose these vulture funds serve.  They are parasitical entities that speculate and gamble in a way that affects human beings who are trying to put a roof over their heads.  I would love to see a prohibition on mortgages being sold to this kind of entity.  It should only be possible to sell them to proper credit institutions.

Without getting into an ideological debate on banking, a considerable number of people would like to take out mortgages to purchase their own homes.  Home ownership is important for people in this country and many people want to get on the property ladder and to put a roof over their heads.  We need a functional mortgage market.  I do not think too much State intervention in terms of reducing the appetite for competition is ultimately good for the consumer.  The Government's goal in this debate is to ensure that consumers are protected regardless of who owns the loan book and that they are not discriminated against or put at a disadvantage in accessing supports put in place by the State and the Central Bank simply because the loan book is owned by A, B or C.  The bottom line for those of my constituents whom I have encountered is that they do not want to be put at a disadvantage depending on who owns their loans.  As I think is recognised by all, this Bill is trying to achieve that goal.<\/p> <p>  One of the benefits of the amendment is that a regulated credit servicing firm cannot use as a defence the claim that it breached a regulation on the instruction of an owner.  It will not be possible for the firm to argue that the owner told it to break the rules.  The regulations will apply and there will be no escaping from that reality.  The Central Bank views this in the context of breaches of the code by the credit servicing firm.  Evidence of a contravention would be apparent in the treatment of the borrower, which gives the Central Bank an avenue to pursue the credit servicing fund and the otherwise unregulated owner.  It is a belt and braces approach that removes the defence that the firm was instructed by an unregulated entity.  The amendment also provides access to the Financial Services Ombudsman in pursuing a claim of contravention.  We discussed this with the Central Bank and it is satisfied that it can fulfil its obligations under the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12015052700002#R00400","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"speech","time":1432743300,"counter":2221,"content":"<p>I welcome that firms cannot use as a defence the claim that they were ordered to breach the regulations but we are back to my first question about the unregulated owner.  If it is unregulated, it is outside the ambit of the Financial Regulator.  How will the regulator know whether the unregulated entity is behaving properly?  We have had a lengthy debate on providing transparency on transactions so that when an individual's loan is sold on he or she is entitled to know who owns it.  The Minister for Finance's opinion was that if somebody owes money on a mortgage, it simply has to be repaid and there is no benefit in knowing the identity of the creditor.  We might not easily know who was behind a company which purchased a portfolio of mortgages.  We will have a problem with establishing the identity of the new owner, which will therefore be both unknown and unregulated.  People should know who owns their mortgages.  The legislation will bring some improvements in this regard but we have argued all along that the owners of the loans should also be regulated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12015052700002#R00500","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speech","time":1432743300,"counter":2222,"content":"<p>Without sounding circular in my position on this, I do not see what is earth-shattering about the comment by the Minister for Finance that if one takes out a loan of &euro;300,000, by signing on the dotted line one has committed to paying back that loan.  If somebody decides to sell one's loan to somebody else, one still owes the money.  We need to make sure that people in such circumstances are not put at a disadvantage in terms of consumer protection and in terms of access to the various supports and codes that have been put in place in recent years.  When we leave our bubble in Leinster House and talk to our constituents, they just want to know how they are going to pay their mortgages.  That is certainly the case when I talk to my constituents.  They are more interested in the principle of being treated in a fair manner and being able to access all the codes and supports they could access before the loan was sold than they are in who owns their loans.<\/p> <p>  I want to make it clear, as I did during the discussion on a previous amendment, that there will always be a regulated entity and that the buck will always stop with that entity.  All we are doing in this amendment is providing that one cannot use the excuse that one cannot do anything because one was told to do something by an unregulated entity that was outside the ambit of the regulator.  We are making sure there can be no break, breach or lacuna on the basis of which people can be ignored.  I do not see a need for the regulation of owners, in addition to the credit servicing firms, because there is always a regulated owner.  It would also increase costs.  As we all know, these costs are ultimately passed on to borrowers.  On the question of how a breach of this section would be pursued, I remind the committee that it would be a criminal offence by the holder of the legal title.  The Central Bank has an obligation under section 33AK of the Central Bank Act 1942 to report any suspicion of a criminal offence to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, regardless of whether the suspicion relates to a regulated financial services provider or to an unregulated entity.  That is why I believe this amendment is very important.

Section 6 amends the definition of an \"eligible consumer\" in section 57BA of the Central Bank Act 1942 to include a person whose loan is being serviced by a regulated credit servicing firm.  This part of the 1942 Act deals with the Financial Services Ombudsman.  The Deputy's amendment appears to seek to give access to the Financial Services Ombudsman to customers of credit-servicing firms and customers of unregulated buyers of credit agreements.  However, the borrower of a loan being serviced by a regulated credit servicing firm is already able to make a complaint to the Financial Services Ombudsman about the activity of the regulated firm.  If an entity buys a loan book and services the book itself, it is involved in the servicing of credit and will need to be regulated, and will therefore have access to the Financial Services Ombudsman through that route.  Therefore, I believe the amendment is superfluous.  It is not that I am disagreeing with the Deputy.

Our chief executive, Ms Julie Sinnamon, unfortunately is unavailable to attend as she is on a trade mission to South Africa.  She asked me to convey her apologies to the committee.<\/p> <p>  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s vision is that Irish enterprise will be a powerhouse of economic growth and job creation.  Enterprise Ireland works with manufacturing and internationally traded services companies across the country.  Our supports are tailored to reflect companies&rsquo; stages of development from early-stage entrepreneurs and start-ups to middle-sized companies, ensuring they can access the appropriate supports to help them to create and build their businesses and, most importantly, sustain jobs.  In January, Enterprise Ireland reported that its client companies had created 19,705 new jobs in 2014.  These companies continue to see year-on-year jobs growth.  This employment growth demonstrates the real impact that the increase in exports has had on jobs in Ireland.  Enterprise-Ireland-supported companies now directly provide employment for 180,072 people, comprising 156,202 full-time and 23,870 part-time workers.<\/p> <p>  Looking at the overall contribution to the economy, Enterprise Ireland clients support more than 300,000 jobs, directly and indirectly, which represents approximately 16% of the total workforce.  In terms of scale and economic impact, those client companies spend in excess of &euro;22.8 billion annually in the economy.  In 2014, total exports from these companies exceeded &euro;18.6 billion, more than at any time in the history of the State.  This covered a wide range of sectors including food, construction, internationally traded services and life sciences, with a growth rate last year of 9.9%.<\/p> <p>  Priority markets continue to be the UK, the US and Europe.  While those core markets account for the majority of our clients&rsquo; exports - 69% - high-growth markets such as Asia-Pacific and the Gulf countries, as well as South Africa, Russia and Brazil, will be an increasing source of future exports.  It is Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s ambition that these markets will account for over &euro;3 billion by 2016, a 50% increase on the export figures for 2013.<\/p> <p>  Enterprise Ireland clients saw exports to ASEAN markets grow by 17% last year, reaching &euro;296 million.  Singapore and Malaysia are the two most important markets in the region.  Supporting this impressive export growth in 2014, Enterprise Ireland assisted clients secured more than 1,300 new customers and significant contracts.  We also brought 907 international buyers into Ireland to encourage them to source from Irish companies.<\/p> <p>  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s international office network is a vital resource for our clients.  Our network of 33 international offices helps our clients win business.  In August 2013, the Government approved our recruitment of 20 additional staff in high-growth markets.  We have added nine additional staff to the Asia-Pacific region since 2013, including an additional two full-time staff members supporting ASEAN markets from our Singapore office.  These overseas offices provide a range of services, from helping clients gain market knowledge to identifying how to win business and secure customers.  Enterprise Ireland has eight offices in the Asia-Pacific region with 36 full-time staff, six of whom are in our office in Singapore.<\/p> <p>  Enterprise Ireland deploys what we call a hub-spoke and pathfinder network.  We have central offices and also support pathfinders, which are effectively specialist trade consultants, and there are 14 of them based in ASEAN markets.  Our dedicated high-growth markets team, based in Dublin and managed by my colleague Mr. David Byrne, which works in conjunction with our offices in the marketplace, helping local companies in Ireland to prepare for those markets.  While over 90% of Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s activities are one-to-one company work, we have taken wider initiatives over the past year.  More than 1,000 client companies took part in 18 Minister-led trade missions in 2014, with a further 67 international events in major target markets in North America, Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America.  This week, in addition to a trade mission to South Africa led by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, there is a trade mission to the US, led by the Minister for Education and Skills, and an event in the aerospace area.<\/p><p>It did a specific joint trade mission with UK Trade &amp;amp; Investment and Invest NI at the beginning of 2014 to the ASEAN region, to Singapore.  It was the first such mission of its type.  It is very important to say that Enterprise Ireland also has very strong working relationships with other Departments and agencies.  Without them we would not be able to do our job overseas.  We are, in fact, co-located with embassies and consulates or with other agencies wherever possible.  As I have mentioned, in the case of the Asia-Pacific region, we have eight offices, six of which are co-located with an embassy or consulate.<\/p><p> Finally, I would like to convey that Enterprise Ireland is wholly focused on supporting and servicing the needs of our clients.  We have ambitious targets which are yielding results and delivering and sustaining jobs here in Ireland.<\/p><p> I thank the Chairman and would be delighted to take any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015052700002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin Sherry","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1432717200,"counter":2270,"content":"<p>It goes without saying that almost all politicians in the House have nothing but admiration for the work done by Enterprise Ireland and our embassies throughout the world.<\/p> <p>  We had a meeting yesterday with the Minister for European affairs from Great Britain, Mr. David Lidington MP, and will probably hear today, in the Queen's speech, the outlining of the UK position on Europe.  It may not be a directly relevant question but I will ask in any case.  In his briefing to us, Mr. Lidington seemed to imply that Britain was being to some degree strangled by regulations and Commission and treaty obligations from Europe and that it needed to break free and get out of some of the treaties.  Britain is fearful that it cannot compete with the evolution of world blocs and powers.  The ASEAN countries have a market of 960 million where we have 500 million in Europe.  Mr. Lidington seemed to argue that Britain needs greater freedom and flexibility to go into this market and expand.  Does Mr. Sherry think there is any analysis that would back that up?  Is Europe lagging behind because its regulations are so cumbersome they are strangling a country like Britain?  Is the ASEAN market going to surpass the economic might and power of Europe?

Would Enterprise Ireland have all indigenous companies under its remit or only those with an export focus?  Mr. Sherry mentioned that this figure represents approximately 16% of the total workforce.  In recent years, economic commentators would have said that indigenous industry is where the growth in employment must come from.  That seems a small percentage.

I noted that Mr. Sherry mentioned 16% of the total workforce here in Ireland.  Although we know employment is increasing, there are concerns that this increase is not happening at the sort of wages or salaries that allow people to live with dignity.  We have had a lot of debate about zero-hour contracts etc.  My first question, therefore, concerns that 16%.<\/p> <p>  My second question is about the overseas markets.  Recently, I chaired the launch of a report Tr&oacute;caire had commissioned, Where aid meets trade.  We have had various debates about \"aid for trade\", discussion of which seems to be gathering momentum.  If aid is going into a developing country, situations can arise where there has to be a corresponding pay-off for the donor country.  There are serious concerns around human rights, due diligence and tax issues.  I had questions with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade last week, and he certainly seemed supportive that our trade missions would have to involve ethical engagement.<\/p> <p>  Irish companies going into other countries should be aware of the labour laws and social laws in those countries.  Not one Irish company has been convicted of corruption, even though there have been cases, yet they could be charged in this country because of legislation we have.  Such matters particularly concern women in the developing world.  We know they are the worst off when it comes to working conditions.  There are also serious concerns around Qatar and what is happening there.  There are frightening statistics of the number of workers who may suffer injuries and fatalities before a ball is kicked in the World Cup and there are Irish companies working there.  I know the Chairman was there recently and I was asking him whether he had addressed these issues.  He said there was some open and frank discussion.<\/p> <p>  Are there any concerns about the ongoing discussions regarding the transatlantic trade and investment partnership?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015052700002#C00500","speaker":"1005"},{"type":"speech","time":1432717200,"counter":2274,"content":"<p>I welcome the work Enterprise Ireland is doing to increase exports from Ireland and to create jobs and commercial investment.  I note that Enterprise Ireland client companies created 19,705 new jobs in 2014, but the net new job figures were half of this, at 8,476.  This is the highest net gain in the history of the agency.  Enterprise Ireland's end-of-year statement notes that its supported companies now directly and indirectly account for 300,000 jobs in the Irish economy.  As the previous speaker said, this is 16% of the total workforce.  The total direct employment in Enterprise Ireland client companies, full and part-time, stood at 18,072 at the end of 2014.<\/p> <p>  To contextualise the new jobs created by Enterprise Ireland, there are currently 349,500 people on the live register.  This brings us back to the question from earlier about the targets for the next five years.<\/p><p>What are the agency's specific targets in this area for the next five years?  The highest increase in sales and exports in the past ten years was recorded in 2014.<br\/><br\/>The number of net new jobs created is small when we consider the big picture.  It works out at just over 2%.  We need ambitious targets where significant increases in sales and exports deliver significant new job increases. <br\/><br\/>An issue of concern, which was not mentioned by the previous speakers but which has been raised on numerous occasions, is the regional imbalance in job creation.  Has the agency specific plans to tackle that?  The Government's Action Plan for Jobs 2015 refers to funding of &euro;100 million to support and encourage regional stakeholders.  It would be good to know what the job creation target is to match that additional funding by Government for 2015.  It would be helpful if Mr. Sherry could shed light on that for the committee. <b><\/b><br\/><br\/>Some of the ASEAN, Association of Southeast Asian Nations, countries have questionable human and workers' rights legislation in place.  They are wide open to abuse.  Some of us were at the meeting with Ban Ki-moon and he spoke about some of the difficulties in some of the countries.  How does the agency ensure that Irish trade with these countries is focused on enhancing human rights protections?  It is a very delicate area.  Is it partially based on fair trade provisions?  Are there any obligations on companies to export and invest responsibly?  That was one of the questions we asked the representatives of IDA Ireland when they appeared before the committee recently.  <br\/><br\/>We have a weakness in our language skills.  Many of our young people do not speak a foreign language and that is the position for a variety of reasons.  English is widely spoken in many ASEAN countries.  Are there supports available to improve language skills?  What is the agency's relationship with the Department of Education and Skills?  Does it make recommendations, particularly with respect to the universities, on a regular basis?  Concern was expressed that some of the courses provided in one of the universities related to language supports and supports in the area of cultural norms would be closed.  Is Mr. Sherry aware of that?  How does the agency feed into that system?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015052700002#C00600","speaker":"1037","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1432717200,"counter":2276,"content":"<p>I join in the welcome extended to our visitors.

I will start by responding to the question raised by Deputy Eric Byrne on the ease of doing business and business regulations.  First, I would say that Ireland ranks very highly on the table of ease of doing business.  In terms of Ireland as a location from which to operate, it is a very attractive location.  It is one of the compelling factors that the IDA would promote overseas in terms of multinational companies locating here and likewise it is one that Enterprise Ireland would promote because we have responsibility for foreign direct investment into the country in the food area.<\/p> <p>  In terms of doing business with companies in the Asia-Pacific region and the ASEAN region, it is quite a diverse region.  If we compare two locations such as Singapore and Indonesia, they are very different.  The ease of doing business in Singapore and the ease at which companies can operate there ranks very highly.  However, in the likes of Indonesia it is a quite a different situation.  The ease for companies to do business both within the country and for Irish exporters seeking to export to that country would be very different.  In many cases when we  talk to Irish companies about trading with other countries it is not so much a question of any barriers associated with regulations within Ireland, it is the accessibility of the countries they are trying to target to sell their goods or services.  Within Ireland the ease with which companies can do business is important.<\/p><p>The importance of low regulation - I do not mean ineffective regulation but in terms of ease of doing business in the country - is very important because they are operating on the international stage and competing with global players.  The fact that the Irish companies have been competing and winning and we have seen the results on the export side across multiple markets is evidence that at the moment Ireland is an effective location for doing business and we need that to continue.<\/p><p> In response to Senator Walsh, on the export side, Enterprise Ireland as an organisation produces and publishes a three-year plan where we set out our targets very clearly.  There are employment and export targets.  In our most recent plan, completed in 2013, we exceeded all of the targets.  Our plan is to exceed our targets in the current 2014-16 business plan.  We got off to a strong start in 2014 with exports increasing by 9.9% and employment substantially above the initial target set. <\/p><p> In exports to high growth markets, companies are starting from a lower base but as a result we have put more resources into those markets and have set a higher target, to increase from a little over &euro;2 billion to &euro;3 billion within that three-year period.  It is an ambitious target but we believe we can achieve it.  It is one of the reasons why we have put proportionately increased resources into those markets and why we had extensive discussions with Government about the need to deploy more resources in those markets because it does require more feet on the ground.  We work company by company and going into those markets we focus on specific sectors, which we believe provide accessible opportunities to Irish companies and where we believe those companies have the capability and the resilience to go after them.  It is noticeable that in the ASEAN and Asia-Pacific region a longer-term commitment is required to secure and win business than in many other markets.  In respect of the culture of that market it is necessary to develop long-term relationships and that means companies putting feet on the ground in those markets.  As a prelude to companies&rsquo; winning business in those markets they must commit and put boots on the ground.  There are 171 Irish companies present in the ASEAN region.  It is more like a marathon than a spring winning business in those markets.<\/p><p> I was asked about the number of staff and offices.  We cannot have substantial resources in every market, we do not have the resources for that.  We need to be flexible.  We need people to be able to move resources as clients demand.  We have our own resources and we leverage off other resources.  I mentioned pathfinders, which are trade consultants in different markets.  These are people we have identified who have specific expertise in a particular sector, for example, telecommunications and we would link companies we operate and support in that sector with this individual and work across markets.<\/p><p> Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan asked about the workforce, I will ask my colleague, Mr. Byrne to expand on my answer.  In terms of salary levels in Enterprise Ireland clients, in addition to exports an important factor for us is the spend within Ireland and the amount of money Irish companies spend on wages and on goods and services in Ireland.  They need to be competitive and are constantly focused on that.  For us as an organisation, we have increasingly focused on competitiveness and lean practices.  We do substantial work with hundreds of companies in helping them improve their productivity and competitiveness.  That is a very important factor in ensuring that companies have operations that are efficient but can and do pay wages appropriate to the country in which we operate.  Ireland is not a low-cost economy and never will be.  The type of business we assist companies in supporting is to try to develop companies that have strong intellectual property, are investing in research and development, have strong operations and have resources and capabilities in Ireland that are not based solely on cost but on other competitive factors. <\/p><p> The Deputy also asked about corruption and ethical issues.  Enterprise Ireland focuses on  business.  We work very closely with our colleagues in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  We are co-located with them in most locations.  We work closely with our clients in identifying potential customers and assessing their bona fides and the way they operate.  We also, as part of our supports for companies, have what we call a net international programme or excel at selling programme, one module of which is focused on developing capability within companies on cultural understanding of how to operate in business.  Irish companies operating in international markets have their own reputation to protect.  Companies operating perhaps in the Asia region and the Gulf region also do business in the US and Europe and they would be acutely aware that if they do not pursue appropriate business practices and adhere to proper procedures their reputation will be at risk in other locations.  There is a fundamental, compelling business argument for those companies to ensure they operate effectively.  In terms of TTIP, the US is a very important market for Irish companies and we do believe there are substantial opportunities assuming the successful completion of the negotiations.<\/p><p> From the point of view of women in the developing world, Enterprise Ireland has focused on women in business and many other countries are watching Ireland and what we do in this area.  We have focused on this in the start-up area because there was a very low level of participation by females in start-up companies and we focused on increasing that over the past three years.  The percentage of their involvement in high potential start-ups and early stage start-ups that we have supported has gone from single digits to 23%.  We believe that by focusing on a particular area it is possible to achieve results.  Our focus on female entrepreneurship has proved that. <\/p><p> I will ask my colleague, Mr. Byrne, to respond to Deputy Crowe&rsquo;s question about regional balance in jobs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015052700002#D00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin Sherry","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1432717200,"counter":2282,"content":"<p>Deputy Pat Breen took the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1432717200,"counter":2283,"content":"<p>As my colleague Mr. Sherry mentioned earlier, we had an outstanding year in 2014 with new jobs created.

In 2013 Enterprise Ireland established a dedicated client skills unit to collaborate with the Department and with Government agencies about specific skills gaps faced by Irish companies in the short and long term.  The domestic supply of foreign language skills is something that should be acted upon, not just in relation to Europe but also in the markets we are talking about.  Foreign language capability and cultural awareness, as suggested by the committee, are essential for enterprises to compete in an increasingly global market.  Having language capabilities is a major boost to companies in achieving their export goals.  It also offers them opportunities to diversify away from English speaking markets.  While we do prefer the skill-set of language capability to be brought in to the companies, it can be met in the short-term - for the Asian markets - in different ways including recruitment, up-skilling employees, use of professional translators and interpreters and hiring native speaking channel partners or agents.  There is no doubt the development of business, technical and professional language capabilities within companies will enable them to pursue opportunities that may arise in any of those markets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015052700002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan Flood"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1432717200,"counter":2288,"content":"<p>Senator Mullins asked about the greatest challenges facing companies in the ASEAN region and about Enterprise Ireland's plans for trade missions in 2015.  I will ask Mr. Conor Fahy to expand on that.  There are a series of challenges.  We have spoken about cultural challenges, it is different doing business in the region and we understand that.  One important element that Enterprise Ireland brings to that party is that it has the experience of doing business in these regions.  It also connects companies with other companies doing business in the region so they can learn while connected to those networks.  Culturally it is quite different.  Timescale was mentioned - companies doing business in Asia require patience.  From initial contact to placing an order tends to be a longer life-cycle than in other markets such as Europe and the US, so companies have be resilient and patient in that large market.<\/p> <p>  Companies also require an understanding of the way business is done.  The importance of relationships was mentioned earlier.  In these markets companies need to develop the relationship first and the business comes after.  In some other markets a higher priority is not placed on the relationship element.  Companies are also required to put boots on the ground which is important.  Enterprise Ireland encourages people to put sales people on the ground and helps companies with this by access to the Enterprise Ireland offices and to incubation centres.<\/p> <p>  Mr. David Byrne has highlighted that most of the Enterprise Ireland staff overseas are local hires and that is important to us.  Typically one person in each office is someone who is placed from Ireland.  The rest of the teams are local hires.  It is important therefore for Irish companies, when going in to the market place that they do have local capability.  It needs to be a mix of people from the company in Ireland and also locally recruited people who understand the market.  There are substantial opportunities in those markets where growth rates are high.  The Enterprise Ireland message to companies is to look at the success of the companies that have committed to the markets and the business is there to be won.  Irish companies can compete, and win, against the best in the world.  Enterprise Ireland is very confident about that - it is one of the things we are proud of when working overseas - the expertise and capabilities and Irish companies bring.  Another important factor, innate in Irish companies, is their ability to build relationships and their ability to get on with people.  The committee asked about plans for trade missions. There are plans for 22 trade missions in 2015.  I now ask my colleague Mr. Conor Fahy to expand on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015052700002#F00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin Sherry"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1432717200,"counter":2289,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Sherry.  Trade missions are an integral part of the overseas promotional programme.  The outcome for companies is to foster business relationships and prospective customers.  In last year's trade mission programme, companies announced over &euro;200 million in contracts signed.  There is an ambitious programme again for 2015.  Last week I returned from a trade mission to central Europe with Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Gerald Nash.

We regularly review the location of our overseas offices and the way that we operate.  It is important for us that when we operate in an overseas market we are able to respond to the specific needs of clients.  Most of the companies that we work with target the ASEAN region as a region as opposed to targeting individual countries.  They are also focused on specific sectors, such as financial services, telecommunications, and international education.  The food area is the responsibility of our colleagues in Bord Bia.<\/p> <p>  The majority of Enterprise Ireland's client's business in Malaysia is in international education.  We used to have a one-person office in Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia and we also had one person in Singapore.  We decided to consolidate our resources in Singapore with an office of six people, so we expanded our resources there.  In Malaysia, there is one person working full-time in the international education area.  In the other cases, we have aligned our staff in those offices to have specific sector expertise.  With the exception of the manager of the office, all of the staff are locally recruited and have specific domain expertise.  <\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about Indonesia and Thailand.  One member of our team in the Singapore office is an Indonesian national and she, in fact, spends some of her time in Indonesia and provides advice and expertise to clients on the market in Indonesia.  The level of business and client demand for Indonesia and Thailand at the moment does not justify Enterprise Ireland having a full-time office in either of those countries.  We work very closely with the embassies and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, but co-located with them in Singapore.  We work very closely with the teams there.  It is something that we keep under constant review.  In the last couple of years, we have opened new offices and have realigned some of our resources and changed the way that we operate.  We have expanded our pathfinder trade consultant network substantially.  In recent times we have opened new offices in Austin in Texas, Perth, and Abu Dhabi.  That is a constantly changing environment and we have to operate like that in order to respond to the changing needs of our clients.  In the case of the Asia Pacific and ASEAN regions we have deployed more resources there proportionally than the exports currently justify and that is in recognition of the fact that we need to deploy more resources in order to assist companies to build for the future.  <\/p> <p>  There are two tracks for us.  The first is to help companies sustain and build exports in markets where they currently have a footprint, such as in more developed markets, and the other aspect is to build and develop exports in those more developing high growth markets, which is why we set a higher target for those markets.<\/p> <p>  I have mentioned the importance of Malaysia to the education sector abroad.  I have also mentioned the new diaspora.  We have two agendas in terms of the international education area.  The first is that it is obviously a very important business.  There are over 32,000 international students studying full-time in Ireland, so it is a very important part of the third level sector in Ireland.  The people who come to Ireland to be educated are, effectively, the ambassadors of the future for Ireland in the countries they come from and are important commercial links for us.  That is why it is so important, as Deputy Crowe has asked, that we build and continue to build links with those individuals in the marketplace.<\/p> <p>  We work closely with the Irish Exporters Association.  We are part of and have part funded their Asia Trade Forum.  We have close links with the chambers of commerce in those international markets, the strongest of which is the chamber of commerce in Singapore.

They are a very important part of our network in terms of connecting with other companies that want to go abroad because it is as important to learn from failure as it is to learn from success.  Other companies that want to go out into the marketplace can learn a lot from the advice from those companies about what they tried and what did or did not work.  For the companies that we work with, one of the key things is that they are prepared when they go out into the marketplace.

I am very conscious of the 32,000 students who are being attracted to Ireland, particularly at the higher levels of education.  Is there a single Irish authority?  The Saudis would send their children here under the King Abdullah scholarships and the Iranians would send their students to UCD under their state-funded educational schemes.  This presumably is replicated across the board.  I know there are many Libyan students here among others.

Such is the size of that market there it stretches a distance similar to that between New York and California.

Prime Minister Li Keqiang recently visited Ireland and there have been a huge amount of trade missions into China in recent times, with almost every member of the Cabinet having visited there at this stage.  I would like to discuss the Ireland House concept, which operates in New York, Tokyo and so on.  Enterprise Ireland has an office in only one of the five ASEAN countries.  Would it be possible in the context of the resources currently available to Enterprise Ireland for it to link up more frequently with the embassies in the other countries?  It must be difficult for one office to engage with all of the countries.  I acknowledge the resource issue mentioned by Mr. Sherry but everybody has a resource issue, including the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  We would like to see further embassies in other countries.  Could additional resources be allocated to address of that issue in the context of the ASEAN countries?  Vietnam is an emerging economy.  We have had a great deal of success in this region, including in China in terms of our infant milk formula and the Kerry Group research and development in Singapore, which we visited last year.  We now have an embassy in Indonesia.  While this embassy was originally an aid embassy it has now also become a trade embassy.

As mentioned by Mr. Fahy, we recently did a market study visit in Vietnam and we are planning one for Thailand later in the year.  This is done in conjunction with the ambassador.  In the case of Indonesia, the vast majority of our exports to Indonesia are in the food area, which is the responsibility of our colleagues in Bord Bia.  Enterprise Ireland does not have responsibility for the overseas trade promotion of food.  While we are currently encouraging companies to look at Indonesia as a market this does not justify our putting a person there full time.  I mentioned earlier that one of the team in our office in Singapore is an Indonesian national who spends time in the marketplace, which is very important.  We purposely sought to recruit somebody with that expertise.  As in the case of many other markets, we will continue to try to encourage and develop companies' interest in the Indonesian and Vietnamese markets.  One of the things we need to do is to bring companies with us.  We have to encourage their commitment without over-extending them.  Many Irish companies are on a journey within the Asia Pacific region.  Many are at the stage of looking at putting feet on the ground in the region.  Once they get established in the region they than seek to expand beyond one location.<\/p> <p>  As I said earlier, when responding to Deputy Byrne's question in regard to ease of doing business, Indonesia is a market that is up there in terms of difficulty in doing business.  It is a market in reality where there are issues associated with the ease of doing business.  As corruption is a factor in Indonesia companies must be much more prepared and much more resilient when going into that particular market.  It is not as easy a market in which to do business as is Singapore.  That said, there are opportunities and we are exploring them.  In the context of resource allocation, as in the case of other locations where we co-locate with the embassies, it is an obvious choice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015052700002#J00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin Sherry"},{"type":"speech","time":1432717200,"counter":2312,"content":"<p>What are Mr. Sherry's views on the Asia Pacific Irish Business Forum that takes place there every year?

Mr. Christopher Lehane is the official assignee and head of our bankruptcy division.  On my far left is Ms Breda Horgan from our regulation division.  In our submission, we indicated that Mr. Kevin Kirwan from our case management division would be here but, unfortunately, he is ill.  Ms Mary Murphy is the deputy official assignee and is also working with the Courts Service in trying to ensure the messaging for those faced with repossession and other debt difficulties is clear with respect to options.  I hope that between us we will be able to answer as best we can any questions that the committee has.  After my opening remarks, I will ask Mr. Lehane to make some points on the current debate about the bankruptcy term and whether a change from the current three-year term might take place.<\/p> <p>  Our first full year of operation was 2014.  During that year, we were able to show that the new, innovative and complex legislation that the committee helped produce worked in practice.  We saw our first successful debt relief note, or DRN, which is for people with very few assets and income; the first debt settlement arrangement, DSA, which is for unsecured debt; and the first successful personal insolvency arrangement, PIA, which is for those involved with difficulties arising from mortgage debt.  By now, we have over 1,000 such solutions in place.  In comparison with the time taken to establish similar regimes abroad, we did this in record time.<\/p> <p>  Together with the Courts Service, we also oversaw the successful introduction of an electronic case management system, which I believe is groundbreaking in terms of how judges deal with cases before them.  No longer do we have boxes of paperwork in court but instead reliance is placed on electronic documentation.  This project was a significant challenge in itself but certainly necessary for us to operate in an efficient manner.  We have circulated to committee members testimonials from debtors who have availed of our services in the first appendix to our submission.  We have also circulated the most common examples of cases we deal with in the second appendix.  I have previously stated that I would have expected activity levels to be higher than they are, I could not overstate the value of our service to those that have availed of it and the personal relief it has brought to debtors.<\/p> <p>  Representatives of the Insolvency Service of Ireland appeared before the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform just over a year ago.  At that time, we acknowledged that more needed to be done to increase activity levels.  Shortly after our appearance, that committee issued its report on mortgage arrears matters, with the committee making four recommendations in respect of the insolvency service.  We have implemented all four of them.<\/p> <p>  First, the committee recommended that efforts around communicating to debtors be stepped up.  Within a month of our appearance we began consulting with a number of stakeholders and conducted focus group research during the summer that led to the launch of our \"Back on Track\" information campaign last October.  Key elements of the campaign included a new dedicated website for insolvent debtors, simplified information guides, almost two dozen town hall events across the country and associated advertising.  Our new guides were distributed widely to include the offices of all Deputies and Senators, all Money Advice and Budgeting Service offices, citizen information and family resource centres and the full network of libraries around the country.<\/p> <p>  Second, the committee recommended that the costs associated with applying for insolvency and bankruptcy solutions be reduced.  In October, the service waived all application fees and the Courts Service also reduced fees that it applies to applications at that time.  Bankruptcy application costs are now &euro;270, down from almost &euro;1,500 a couple of years ago.  This also compares with almost &euro;1,000 in the UK.<\/p> <p>  Third, the committee recommended that personal insolvency practitioners be readily available to all debtors.  We introduced an initiative last October whereby the service would effectively underwrite costs up to &euro;750 per case to ensure debtors would have access in all cases where a practitioner could help them.  Fourth, the committee recommended a general review of existing - albeit new - legislation.  One of the principal functions of the service under section 9 of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 is to monitor the operation of the arrangements and contribute to the development of policy in the area of personal insolvency.  The committee is aware that one of the commitments in the current statement of Government priorities was to complete a review of the operation of the Insolvency Service of Ireland to ensure it has the powers needed to support families willing to work their way through their debt problems.  The service took an active part in this review.<\/p> <p>  The committee is also aware that the Government announced a number of initiatives in recent weeks.  These go beyond personal insolvency to include areas such as mortgage to rent and general advice to debtors through the MABS network.  Three particular points were announced that should increase activity levels for the ISI and help debtors in difficulty.  First, when a creditor rejects a proposal made by a debtor and the personal insolvency practitioner, the debtor will have the right to seek an independent court review of the proposal.  Subject to meeting certain conditions, the court will have the power to impose the proposed debt solution on all parties if it deems it fair and reasonable.  Whereas three out of four cases were already successful, the perception among the public that a bank veto existed played a significant part in preventing debtors taking the necessary steps to seek the help that we can offer.<\/p> <p>  Second, measures are to be put in place so that court officials can steer borrowers who are involved in repossession proceedings proactively towards the service.  This will ensure that the provision contained within the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2013 that allows for the adjournment of a home repossession case for two months to allow a debtor consult with a personal insolvency practitioner is availed of whenever relevant.  Third, linking into a broader information campaign for those in mortgage arrears, the service is to receive funding to launch a sustained awareness campaign of the solutions available to insolvent debtors.<\/p><p>I expect this to commence in the autumn.<\/p><p> Lastly, I would like to draw members' attention to another significant achievement of the ISI in the past year.  We published a standard debt settlement arrangement protocol in July of last year and a standard personal insolvency arrangement protocol in March of this year.  The two protocols will make it easier for debtors to reach agreement with their creditors.  The protocols will help debtors make more informed decisions and ultimately should lead to better outcomes for debtors in protocol-compliant arrangements because they are more likely to succeed.  It should now be both faster and easier to form and agree proposals as the standard terms are pre-written.  These protocols represent many thousands of hours of work and close collaboration with all key stakeholders.  I am confident, as has been the experience in other countries, that these new protocols will result in raising the acceptance rates still further.<\/p><p> The new debt solutions, which offer alternatives to bankruptcy, are not just positive for debtors but are also in the best interests of creditors.  There is nothing in the personal insolvency legislation that creates bad debts but the legislation does help to solve them.  Ultimately, it is in all of our interests to return an insolvent debtor to solvency, to ensure their wellbeing and participation in normal economic activity and to give them the second chance that they deserve and need.<\/p><p> I do not accept the argument that there can be no writedown of mortgage debt.  Sometimes that will be the correct thing to do, not only in order to keep a family in its home but also because it makes financial sense to the creditor.  I equally do not accept the argument that if you allow one person a writedown when it is genuinely needed, then everyone else will demand one, including those who have at all times been paying their mortgages.  People, in my experience and in the survey work we commissioned, want to pay their debts.  Those who can pay them will pay them and there are a number of safeguards built into our legislation to ensure this is the case.  I also believe that no reasonable person will resent seeing someone who has fallen on hard times benefit from proportionate debt forgiveness.  The ISI has helped almost 2,000 debtors to date.  We need to and want to help more.  I believe the recent announcement made by the Government will help us do just that.<\/p><p> I will now pass to the official assignee, Mr. Chris Lehane, to make some comments on the current review of the bankruptcy term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015052700002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Lorcan O'Connor","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1432731600,"counter":2324,"content":"<p>I thank members for the opportunity to appear here today.  The main point of my address will be to deal with the current review relating to the reduction of the bankruptcy term from three years to one year.  In doing this I will refer members to appendix 3, where we set out our position in greater detail than I will in this paper, which will just be a summary of our position on the reduction from three years to one year and other issues relating to Deputy Penrose's Bill.  I also refer members to appendix 4 where we provide a paper on the impact on family homes when a person is in bankruptcy.  The appendix includes a survey which has some interesting findings on persons in bankruptcy who have issues relating to their family homes.  Because a lot of the detail is in the papers, I am willing to answer questions not just on the summary but any issue arising on appendices 3 and 4.<\/p> <p>  There are a number of arguments in favour of reducing the current bankruptcy term from three years.  The biggest argument would be the effect on the individual.  A reduction would provide an enhanced opportunity for economic rehabilitation and, specifically, a quicker-earned fresh start.  The Bill proposes that the bankruptcy period would go from three years to one year and another proposal is that the payment period in which a bankrupt would be asked to make a contribution to his debts would go down from five to three years.  As well as helping the individual it would help economic revival in that persons who are overburdened with debt will be released back into the economy, to the benefit of society as a whole.<\/p> <p>  A third argument in favour of reducing the period is the fear factor.  By reducing the bankruptcy period we will encourage banks and other creditors to do deals either with debt forgiveness or debt restructuring, given that with the reduction it is anticipated that there will be more people seeking bankruptcy.  A fourth argument would be that it would end bankruptcy tourism, where Irish debtors travel to the UK and US.  In my office I have a register of persons who, having bankrupted themselves abroad, come back to Ireland with the trustees to enforce their foreign bankruptcies.  We do not believe there have been significant numbers of people who have sought bankruptcy abroad but the high profile of some has raised the perception in the media.<\/p> <p>  There are also a number of arguments against reducing the bankruptcy term to one year.  These include the moral hazard issue, whereby the easier one makes bankruptcy the more people there will be who will avail of the solution and the fewer there will be who will seek to pay their debts in full or seek informal or formal debt solutions with their creditors, who are not only banks but credit unions, trade creditors and the Revenue Commissioners.  <\/p> <p>  A second argument against is that the designers of the process had in mind debt settlement agreements and personal insolvency agreements when making the bankruptcy term three years and the income payment term five years.  A third argument against a reduction is that the average bankruptcy term internationally is three years, with only the UK, the US and Canada having a one-year term.  When the Law Reform Commission considered this it recommended a three-year term, having carried out its own international research.  Equally, the European Commission recently came to the view that a three-year term was recommended as an upper limit.<\/p> <p>  Another argument is the question as to whether a reduction in the bankruptcy term would necessarily help people going into bankruptcy to keep their family home.  In my view no such argument can be made.  There is no basis for asserting that the reduction in the bankruptcy term will improve the prospect of a bankrupt person retaining his or her family home.  As none of the benefits a bankrupt person derives from the reduction in the bankruptcy period produces any value for the mortgagee, namely, the bank, its position on adjudication is not affected by the length of the bankruptcy period.  What does matter is whether the bankrupt person can pay his or her mortgage at a level that would be acceptable to the financial institution.  Once that is agreed, when the bankrupt person puts it to me I am in a position to agree that as a reasonable living expense.   When a person goes into bankruptcy it is primarily for him or her to reach an agreement with the bank.  If he or she has reached an agreement it is for me to agree that as a reasonable living expense.  If, as under the Penrose Bill, the payment term is reduced from five years to three years there will still be a three-year period when that person will be subject to the bankruptcy terms.<\/p><p>When the person goes into bankruptcy, the decision on whether they are in a position to pay their mortgage takes place at that moment.  Yet even under the proposal, they will subject to a three-year bankruptcy term.<\/p><p> Another argument in favour of a bankruptcy term is that it might encourage bankruptcy tourism into Ireland.  Many of these cases will be very difficult to investigate with foreign language difficulties, lack of funds in estates, lack of knowledge of processes relating to registration of title of properties outside this jurisdiction and dealing with companies outside the jurisdiction, etc.  Even in the course of administering estates where the person is bankrupt, it can be difficult when I must go and find where they have assets abroad.  Having spoken to our colleagues in the UK about this, I can see that if we were to move and if we became a centre where people from across the EU or beyond were seeking bankrupt themselves, it would cause greater difficulties for my office seeking to administer those estates, particularly with the associated language difficulties.  The last argument against it is that if more time was allowed for the processes that have been made, and the term has been reduced since December 2013, there would be more informal and formal deals.  Members may wish to question me about the survey.  <\/p><p> I will provide a very quick high-level view of the survey's findings.  In respect of family homes and bankruptcy, it found that 70% of people who go into bankruptcy leave their family home.  In analysing that we looked at that 70% to find out how many of that group would be in a position to pay their mortgage if they chose to stay on in the family home.  We found that 15% of them would.  There is a summary in the charts, particularly the two pie charts setting out the simplest high-level view of the findings.  The breakdown is that 15% of people would have had the capacity to stay in their home but chose not to and 55% of those who go into bankruptcy simply do not have the capacity to pay their mortgages.  Even though they may not have the capacity to pay their mortgages, a proposed or enhanced mortgage-to-rent scheme might increase the possibility of their staying in the family home.  Finally, the survey found that 30% of people who go into bankruptcy stay in the family home.  They have the capacity to the extent required by the bank to enable them to stay in the family home.

The ISI sent members a box of information leaflets that were very well written.  They are in my office and I have been giving them to people who contact me.  I attended the sitting of the Circuit Court in Limerick a couple of weeks ago.  A total of 219 cases were being heard by the registrar that day.  The registrar asked every one of the people who attended, many of whom represented themselves, whether they had been in touch with the ISI and the answer was \"No\".  In fairness, there was a group of volunteers.  I do not know the name of the organisation the volunteers were with but the registrar allowed them to set up a table at the side of the courtroom and they had ISI documentation.<\/p> <p>  I do not know how the ISI can follow up.  Based on my experience in Limerick on that occasion, which I am sure is similar to those around the country, many of the people turning up at the Circuit Court have never heard of the ISI for various reasons that the ISI is aware of.  The ISI should try to attend these Circuit Court sitting days and set up its own stand.  I do not know if that is something the ISI would have the capacity to do.  I am sure the Courts Service would facilitate it because I know it facilitated a voluntary organisation in Limerick.  <\/p> <p>  Can the ISI link in with the financial institutions in that regard?  If they are pursuing people for repossession, it is a long process.  Could they not be obliged to inform the ISI of the course of action they are pursuing with a particular debtor?  In other words, the ISI could then have its direct communication with those people to tell them that it knows they are in a spot of financial bother with the financial institution and is here to help them and point out what it can do for them.  The profile of many people who presented in the court on the day was sad in the sense that there were many women with broken marriages and people who had become single as a result of marital breakdown.  There were many sad cases and I mean that respectfully.  So many other things were happening in their lives in the sense that they were before family law courts, were dealing with children and family issues and were trying to get by from day to day, so they were not aware of the ISI's services.  This is something the ISI could follow up on.  <\/p> <p>  In his statement, Mr. O'Connor said that he is trying to generate and promote more awareness of the ISI and it seems to be doing that to a degree but it could push the boat out a bit further.  I have two suggestions.  The ISI could have some kind of protocol with the financial institutions.  Mr. O'Connor will probably tell us that this relates to data protection and confidentiality.  If that is the case, perhaps we can look at this as legislators to get around it.  Second, could the ISI find the wherewithal to attend court days because they happen every month and a half in most counties?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015052700002#F00400","speaker":"1057"},{"type":"speech","time":1432731600,"counter":2329,"content":"<p>The question concerns awareness.

I might ask my colleague, Ms Mary Murphy, to give a bit more detail about what we are hoping to do with the Courts Service over the coming weeks.  The Deputy rightly points out that the information the financial institution makes available to debtors is very important.  At the moment, the documentation that might issue from a particular bank where a person is facing the threat of repossession is very legalistic and can run to dozens of pages of small print.  Therefore, the reference to the help that the ISI can offer is lost in a host of things being referenced in the letter.<\/p> <p>  We have had dealings with the Central Bank and Banking and Payments Federation Ireland, BPFI, to see what can be done to make that message clearer and whether it should be in a flyer rather than a paragraph in a long letter.  I wish to acknowledge that we have had a positive response from both sides and are working with them to see what can be done on this front in weeks rather than months.  <\/p> <p>  We have faced a challenge to ensure that those who need to know about us know about us as opposed to necessarily getting commentary in current affairs programmes or in the broadsheet media and so on.  The fact that there has been movement on the perception of the bank veto will help us make that message clearer to people because we will not necessarily have to defend what is often the first response or criticism to anything we might try to do.  Through this initiative, we are expecting to see a significant increase in our advertising budget and we will do our best to ensure that this is targeted at the right people and that we get value for money.<\/p><p>However, we also recognised that one of the key places to have our information available is at the repossession case hearings.  We had already set up a pilot initiative with the Courts Service and the county registrars earlier this spring but this has grown in momentum as a result of the Government initiative.  I will ask Ms Murphy to comment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015052700002#F00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Lorcan O'Connor","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1432731600,"counter":2334,"content":"<p>I will elaborate.

She received the DRN which has written off her debt and she is now living life to the full.  At the end of that personal story she advised people to get up and talk to MABS and to ISI.

However, when one considers the fact that there are still 100,000 mortgages in arrears and there may well be a large number of additional people who do not have a mortgage but still have financial difficulties, there is certainly a large cohort of people who still need help.  I am grateful to the Deputy for highlighting that case study.  We felt that notwithstanding the legitimate criticism and commentary around the low levels of cases we have dealt with, the feedback we have received from those who have availed is overwhelmingly positive.  It is interesting that in very many cases - as in the case highlighted by the Deputy - when people speak to us they never once mention how much they might have had written off or the numbers in terms of what they owed and what they now owe but rather what it has meant to them in terms of their mental and physical health and so on.  It has been a focus for us in recent times and as part of the back and track campaign to try to publicise those case studies and those messages.  We have had debtors on both national and local radio and national television talking about what it has meant to them.  The case study referred to by the Deputy is available as an audio file on our website.  It is hoped that message will spread to those in need of help to say that there is help and it is now time to engage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015052700002#G02000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Lorcan O'Connor"},{"type":"speech","time":1432731600,"counter":2353,"content":"<p>I am concerned because we get different figures in the House.

By all accounts that equates to about 30,000 families or borrowers as some borrowers may have two mortgages on the same property.  The banks would say that in a large number of those cases there is a lack of engagement and that is the only reason it has got to 720 days of arrears.  Clearly, there is a cohort within that number, probably a large cohort, where engagement is an issue and there is, obviously, the difference between those numbers and the 100,000 or so.  I am not suggesting that those 100,000 need an insolvency solution to fix their problems.  They may well be able to solve their problems far short of that but certainly those people do need to engage.  The primary message should be to engage with one's creditors, those to whom one owes the money in the first instance.  If that does not work or if one is not in a position to do that or one owes money to several different creditors so that it is not feasible, then that is exactly when the personal insolvency practitioner, through the ISI, can come to fore and help the individual.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015052700002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Lorcan O'Connor"},{"type":"speech","time":1432731600,"counter":2355,"content":"<p>The third question is this.

The Central Bank has set out the kind of restructures that one sees within that group of cases.  It is equally worth noting that those informal deals were not being done prior to the personal insolvency legislation being put in place because there was no carrot or stick for either side to get to the table and try to do a deal short of a statutory process whereas that changed once the Bill was enacted and our organisation had opened.

I wish to follow up on a point raised by Deputy Finian McGrath, as Deputies we all have had dozens of individuals contact us in the past 12 to 18 months, particularly since the establishing of the ISI.  I find it extraordinary that after this period - this is not a criticism - I am repeating to individuals that they go and to talk to the ISI, MABS or to get some independent advice as to their predicament because they are not doing that.  That applies to at least 50% of the families or individuals who have contacted me.   I find that surprising at this stage of the post-economic collapse for no reason other than they were unable to get a job and found themselves in awful scenarios, which is very stressful for families and particularly children who are the innocent victims.  I am sure the ISI has come across many such individuals whose situation is way beyond their control.<\/p> <p>  The point made by Mr. Christopher Lehane in appendix 3 was interesting.  It concerned the automatic discharge period so the discussion on the one year changed to the bankruptcy term.  I saw one of the arguments in favour of a reduction as being a negative as it would increase the willingness of individuals to hand back their keys.  I know he has qualified that by saying this might result in an increased number of lending institutions actually engaging with them in a meaningful way and, presumably, either arrive at an arrangements to extend the terms or write down part of the debt.  However, in a later paragraph, 3.3, as an argument against the reduction in the bankruptcy term, he stated that there is no certainty that a reduction in the bankruptcy term will improve the prospects of a bankrupt retaining their family home.  Perhaps I misunderstand, but I would have thought that those two points, one in favour and one against, resulting in the same outcome of the prospect of losing one's family home, and the basis upon which it is the ambition of every Deputy and Senator to keep as many people as possible in their homes, are not necessarily mutually exclusive.  For that reason I was slightly confused as to that approach.  I appreciate it is the job of the ISI to attempt to get the best possible outcome for the families.  I am aware it was mentioned that 70% of people who enter into arrangements lose the family home but he qualified that again by saying that they did not necessarily have to lose the family home but it was a decision that was in the process.   I would like Mr. Lehane's view on that issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015052700002#H01200","speaker":"1014"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1432731600,"counter":2365,"content":"<p>If a person is seeking to try to get the best deal, it is effectively a doomsday situation to a bank if they are, effectively dangling the keys.

The reduction period going to one year, but with a three year income payment period, will not help that person at that moment in time.  The moment in time for a person who is going to lose the family home will be when they go bankrupt.  Then, they will ask me, to allow a set mortgage payment within the bankruptcy.  If that mortgage payment is &euro;4,000, I will not allow it when making my assessment.  They and the bank will have effectively agreed a deal and I must assess that &euro;4,000 mortgage payment.  The person's entitlement to stay in the house will be based on my assessment of the reasonable living expense and an accommodation expense that is reasonable for the family.  If the mortgage payment they are proposing to me is way above what know they can secure in getting a rental of a property in that area, I will not allow it.

It was interesting that among focus groups involving debtors who had either historically dealt with financial difficulties or were currently in financial difficulties, there was a very low knowledge base of what it is we provide.  Even when our service was explained to them, there were certain sensitivities around the word \"insolvency\" and it was not necessarily recognised that it could apply to an individual rather than a company.  People preferred to hear \"ISI\" rather than the word \"insolvency\".   As a result, we moved to using \"ISI\" in our advertising rather than using the word \"insolvency\".<\/p> <p>  It was worthwhile holding those sessions to learn that people were not all using print media or current affairs programmes as their main source of information.  Therefore, it became clear to us that we needed to reach into the community, to groups such as St. Vincent de Paul, local constituency offices of politicians and other organisations.  We also consulted with over 20 representative bodies, from trade unions to other national networks, to ensure we could impart our message through them and by virtue of these efforts, we have reached over half a million people.  We have reached out, for example, through articles in trade union magazines and other such publications.  We did not take the traditional routes, primarily because of budgetary constraints, but also because our feedback was that this was not the way to go.

While we were setting ourselves up, we tried to put in place a number of case studies, in consultation with both creditors and other representative groups, to try to convey the kind of solutions that might be viable for somebody in difficulties.  One of the solutions we had most difficulty with was the issue of split mortgages.  Two years ago, for example, the concept of a split mortgage was far less refined than it is now.  Back then if a person owed &euro;100,000 and could service &euro;50,000, the mortgage would reduce to &euro;50,000 and the balance or a large part of it would be warehoused.  That would have been it and there would have been no clarification on what would happen in regard to the warehoused &euro;50,000 in the future.<\/p> <p>  What we said was that this would not be in compliance with our legislation, because for somebody availing of a personal insolvency arrangement, PIA, - the one involving mortgages - the practitioner must certify the person is solvent again.  If this &euro;50,000 is warehoused, with no clarification as to what happens in the future, how can that certification be made?<\/p><p>It took us some time to work with creditors, the Central Bank and others to identify what could be done to reconcile those issues.<\/p><p> We now have a case study on what happens when, to take the example given earlier, an individual who could service &euro;50,000 of a mortgage worth &euro;100,000 has the remainder warehoused.  What happens to the warehoused amount is clear.  The solutions we have identified involves an incentive to pay it down at an early opportunity.  While the individual's current circumstances may not extend to making payments on the warehoused amount, he or she may get a better job in future and would get a discount by paying it down early.  This is an incentive for the debtor to stay with the process.  There will also be clarity on what happens to the warehoused amount when the individual reaches retirement age or a certain point in the future.  If, for example, the property is large because it needs to accommodate a large family, by the time the individual reaches retirement the children are likely to have moved out and there might be provision to trade down.  The individual would retain what he or she needs to purchase an appropriate dwelling.  In the event that the individual cannot pay off the warehoused amount on retirement, he or she will get a lifelong interest in the property and, in effect, the charge will sit on the property until he or she dies, at which point the family will have first refusal on purchasing it.  Ultimately, the bank gets out but there is clarity for the debtor, who can sign up to the proposal in the knowledge that he or she will be solvent and can retain the roof over his or her head for as long as necessary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015052700002#J01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Lorcan O'Connor","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1432731600,"counter":2379,"content":"<p>Deputy Mac Lochlainn also asked whether it is envisaged that people will be restricted to reasonable living expenses until they repay their mortgages at the age of 70 years.

I am very pleased to be here.  I want to explain to the committee what is happening in Littleton and Derrinlough, where we have two briquette factories.  These produce the traditionally well known Bord na M&oacute;na peat briquettes.  Each year there is a production plan decided for each factory.  This year, however, the closing stock, that is, the amount of briquettes that we have in stock at the end of March each year which is the end of our financial year, is exceptionally high.  In March 2013, closing stock was 1,500 tonnes and in March 2014, it was 44,000 tonnes.  We would normally aim to have in the region of 30,000 tonnes at the end of each year.  This year we have twice that amount.  To put it in perspective, that is roughly the equivalent of 11 weeks' production.  We have never had such a high level of stocks.<\/p> <p>  Why do we need to do what we are doing?  The factories normally stop operations every year in June or July.  This year, because of the very high level of stock to which I referred, the production of briquettes at those factories stopped earlier, at the end of March.  Typically, when the stoppages occur, there is other work, such as maintenance, to be done.  In a typical year, an employee would be on basic rates of pay for approximately five weeks and that is normally managed on a voluntary basis.  In effect, that normally means that rather than earning in the region of &euro;800 or &euro;900 per week, employees would drop back to maybe &euro;550 or &euro;600 a week because they would not be shift-working and they would not be in receipt of an element of pay that is related to the amount of briquettes produced in any particular week.  In a normal year, they would suffer a loss of earnings.<\/p> <p>  This year that stoppage has had to be increased.  The stoppage this year is for eight weeks - three weeks longer than usual - and there will be reduced earnings due to short-time working this year.  Normally, we would not have short-time working, that is, employees working a short week.  Some employees for some weeks will only work some of the days of that week.  That is what is different this year as opposed to other years.  Ms Lynch, who is in charge of the operations at these factories, will be able to go into much greater detail on that.<\/p> <p>  I will give our estimate of the reasons our sales were so negatively impacted last year.  There is a growing problem of unregulated fuel imports from Northern Ireland.  We estimate that 50,000 tonnes or 60,000 tonnes, or 10% to 15%, of the domestic fuel market in Ireland is now being supplied by unregulated imports from Northern Ireland and that is impacting on us.<\/p> <p>  Carbon tax is another factor that has reduced the sales of briquettes.  It appears to us that there may not be a level playing field here.  Bord na M&oacute;na paid over &euro;8.7 million of the total of &euro;17 million that was received in carbon tax.  We are paying 50% of the total tax but we do not have 50% of the market.  We think we may have 30% of the market.<\/p> <p>  Private fuels are a serious source of competition for us.  We believe that a lot of the private fuel sales are not paying the carbon tax - they are subject to it but it is not being paid - and that the VAT on a large proportion of those sales is not being paid either.  There is a question of a level playing field in that regard.  That is increasingly undermining our business.<\/p> <p>  There is also the weather.  We are a weather dependent business on two scores - we need good weather in the summer to harvest the peat and we need a cold winter for the demand for briquettes.  Last year we had a reasonably good harvest but the winter was not as cold as normal.  The winter was reasonably mild and the sales of all domestic fuels dropped and, of course, there was increased competition from home heating oil because its price fell.  Those are the reasons we think the sales of briquettes last year were so disappointing and, therefore, the build-up of stock occurred.<\/p> <p>  As for what we have done, it became apparent to us in December 2014 that there would be a problem and we informed our employees.  The employees themselves would be attuned to this anyway.  They can see the stock levels.  At that stage, we started to draft a contingency plan.  From February of this year onwards, we had a detailed engagement with staff and the union representatives about the impending issues.  We had ongoing meetings with the unions.  At local level, we held five collective meetings where we brought the representatives of both factories together with their union representatives.  We assessed with the staff all the redeployment opportunities and we brought forward a capital work plan.  We increased by 30% the amount we are spending on capital works this year, from &euro;1.4 million to &euro;1.8 million, and that, of course, provides additional employment in the briquette factories during the current period.<\/p> <p>  With all those steps and various mitigation measures, we got very close to the stage where this could have been achieved on a voluntary basis.  If the weather had been kinder over the past few weeks, it may have been possible to redeploy staff on peat production.<\/p><p>We were very close to being able to achieve this on a voluntary basis this summer.  It does not now appear that we will be, because the peat harvest has not started yet, effectively, because we have not had dry enough weather for it, although we hope to be able to start it in the next couple of weeks.  Unfortunately, there probably will be times when we will not be able to provide employment for some people who want to continue in employment.  However, at this stage we think every employee will be able to be employed at some stage of every week, but not for the full week every week.  I am just trying to give the scale of it.  That is not yet definite, because we are still in negotiations with the trade unions on the matter.<\/p><p> Production is scheduled to resume on 10 September, as planned, and by that stage everybody will be back in full-time employment and on shift.  We are actively reviewing new product developments and opportunities because we want to grow new markets for the briquette business and in order to provide long-term sustainable employment and keep both these factories open and secure, we are working hard to develop new sustainable fuels.  We are talking there about a biomass briquette, which is currently in development.  This week we have been invited to attend the Labour Relations Commission on the issue.  We are looking forward to engaging with the trade unions through that process and hopefully we can get agreement there.  If we cannot get agreement on these issues at the Labour Relations Commission, we will, of course, agree to have the matter referred to a full hearing of the Labour Court, if that is what the trade unions want.  <\/p><p> We have very serious plans in Bord na M&oacute;na up to 2030 and beyond.  Mr. Quinn, who is with us, has recently joined us as our new managing director.  He joined at the beginning of this year.  He has brought to the board a very ambitious investment plan for the future of Bord na M&oacute;na and the board has accepted that plan in principle.  We have shown that plan to NewERA and to our Department and the response has been very positive.  Each element of the plan will be subject to further board approval as to commercial viability and sensitivity.  As part of that, there is now an agreement between Mr. Mike Quinn, as managing director of Bord na M&oacute;na, and the chief executive of the ESB to keep the peat-fired power stations open.  We have one peat-fired power station and the ESB has two.  There has been a question mark over their viability in the future.  We now have an agreement in principle to keep all three of them open beyond 2019 and to co-fire them with biomass.  We are also developing a large-scale indigenous biomass industry.<\/p><p> The Chairman and members will be aware that the Government decided there should be a partial merger of Bord na M&oacute;na and Coillte and that as part of that a new company should be established, BioEnergy Ireland.  We are taking a strong lead in the establishment of that and in the development of the biomass industry in Ireland.  That will secure the power stations and peat production into the future.  We also have in progress a transformation programme.  This is a company-wide programme to reduce the costs of production and improve the general efficiency of the company.  It is a major programme.  We are in negotiations with the union and have been for over a year now on that issue.  That matter is also in the Labour Relations Commission, but in a separate set of negotiations.  Those negotiations will continue today - they have started again this morning.  I am happy to report that good progress is being made there.  We believe it will be possible in a matter of weeks or months to reach an agreement with the trade unions on all those matters.  Very difficult decisions have to be taken because we must reduce the price at which we supply peat internally to ourselves and to the ESB.  The price of peat must be reduced by a considerable amount.  We recognise, and always have recognised, that this is a very difficult process to go through, but it is necessary to secure the future of the company.  We now believe the unions are seriously engaged and recognise the necessity of those cost-cutting measures.  Overall, the primary objective of our long-term strategy is to keep Bord na M&oacute;na as a major employer in the midlands through 2030 and beyond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015052700002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Horgan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1432718100,"counter":2412,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Horgan.

I am glad that when Mr. Horgan moved to the last chapter of his presentation, towards 2030, he mentioned other issues that are very pertinent to the development and ongoing viability of Bord na M&oacute;na.  As the chairman rightly said, we know only too well that the future viability of Bord na M&oacute;na is paramount to the economic activities of the midlands region and always has been.  There has been much change since it was initiated, in respect of the power plants and other changes in work practices, development and so forth.  All of that, thankfully, was done by consensus and with the agreement of the workforce and the communities in which they are located.  That is why it is in place today and has a chance of survival into the future.<\/p> <p>  I might break up into three sections the issues Mr. Horgan raised.  Before doing so, I am conscious of his role as chair of Bord na M&oacute;na.  He was appointed by Government, by the former Minister, Deputy Rabbitte.  The Government is representative of the people, so he is, by association, a conduit of the shareholders, namely, the public.  He acts as that conduit in the best interests of the shareholder.  He said when he was appointed and came before this committee in September 2012 that \"The board will be collectively responsible for promoting the success of the company by leading and directing its activities\".  He said it would \"provide strategic guidance and monitor the activities and effectiveness of management\".  I know he was well qualified for the role.  He has an MA in industrial relations from the University of Warwick and was a member of the Labour Court for close on 12 years, first as vice-chair and then as chair for five years.  Is that right, that it was from 1979 to 1984?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015052700002#G00300","speaker":"1101"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1432718100,"counter":2414,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015052700002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Horgan"},{"type":"speech","time":1432718100,"counter":2415,"content":"<p>There was great anticipation of his effectiveness as chair and as that conduit.  With the knowledge and expertise he had, especially in industrial relations, one would have expected that any change, diversification, alteration in work practices or cost-cutting exercise that might ensue would be well-managed, closely monitored by him and the board in dealing with management to ensure smoothness.  One would also have expected morale to be maintained among the workforce and that those amendments would be well-met and well-intentioned and would, in so far as possible, meet with the approval of the workforce.<\/p><p> I want to raise three issues in the first instance.  When I say that the operation of the briquette factories was the primary issue raised by Mr. Horgan, I do not intend to demean or diminish many of the other activities that take place across Bord na M&oacute;na.  The briquettes meet the fuel market.  Peat is supplied to the horticultural sector and to power plants.  Many people are involved in the servicing and maintenance of machinery and equipment.  Everyone is familiar with the workshops and with the apprenticeship model that previously existed.  We are aware that seasonal work supplemented the incomes of many farmers and others in the region.  Mr. Horgan mentioned diversification.  I say all of this to highlight what happened across various areas over many years.  I am particularly conscious that the natural lives of many of the power plants mentioned by Mr. Horgan ended in the 1980s and 1990s.  A huge effort and commitment on the part of all stakeholders was required to ensure that the lifespan of the peat extraction industry was extended and that this activity continued to play a role in power generation.  It continues to do so by virtue of what happens at Edenderry, Shannonbridge and Lanesborough.  We are now at a juncture at which those very plants are finding themselves at a crossroads.  Mr. Horgan's role and that of the board and management is quite precarious.  There is a huge responsibility on them.<\/p><p> I welcome the issues mentioned by Mr. Horgan in relation to biomass.  I would like to see more progress on that.  He mentioned that there may be developments in the coming weeks.  It is essential for the alliance with Coillte in this area to crystallise quickly.  Thereafter, there needs to be an effective means by which the biomass industry can be improved upon so that it can take off and be part of the co-fuelling that was mentioned earlier.  Those who had foresight back in the 1980s and 1990s were aware that there was potential for co-fuelling in the knowledge that peat extraction would come to an end at some stage.  Anyway, I will get back to the briquette factories.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015052700002#G00500","speaker":"1101","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1432718100,"counter":2417,"content":"<p>Perhaps the Deputy might ask some questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015052700002#H00200","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speech","time":1432718100,"counter":2418,"content":"<p>I have three questions.  We have been waiting for three or four weeks to discuss this very important issue.  I might add that this is the Aer Lingus of the midlands.  We are aware that plenty of time and effort is going into that area.  I want to make sure the questions that are being asked during the course of that debate do not arise in this context at any future juncture.<\/p> <p>  I would like to ask Mr. Horgan about a significant issue that relates to briquettes.  I know there are seasonal elements to that sector of the business.  We are all aware this has historically been the case.  We have had good summers in recent years, particularly last year.  The company has suggested that the stockpile which now exists is sufficient to meet the demand the market is placing on it.  That is why there have been closures.  The big thing here is the carbon tax.  When that tax was introduced, the previous Government gave a derogation to Bord na M&oacute;na and the briquette factories.  I do not have to name names.  It was given and it ensured the viability of this sector.  It allowed the sector to compete competitively, especially with the market forces in the North.  It was reinstated and doubled by this Government.  That may be political.  It is a political charge on my part.  As I have said, the company has a responsibility to the shareholders.  What negotiation or consultation takes place at governmental or ministerial level between the company and whoever holds that office at any given time?  What consultation did Mr. Horgan have with the Minister on foot of this as it arose?  Did he fight the implementation?  Did he fight the doubling of it?  Has Mr. Horgan spoken to them since?  Has he highlighted the effect this has had on Bord na M&oacute;na's potential to compete in that marketplace?  That and that alone is the kernel of the question as regards the future of that sector.  That is my first question.  I will try to speed up if I can.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Horgan raised some broader issues when he spoke about moving towards 2030.  He and his management colleagues have sought cuts of up to &euro;24 million per annum in relation to Bord na M&oacute;na activities.  They have said that such cuts are necessary if the company is to be able to continue in existence beyond 2019.  The ESB has said in recent weeks that it is committed to continuing the partnership between its plants and Bord na M&oacute;na plants for the supply of peat, regardless of whether it involves 100% peat fuel or some kind of co-fuel arrangement.  Is it not strange that Mr. Horgan and his colleagues did not seek to meet, engage with and ultimately agree terms, conditions, contracts and the associated costs with the ESB?  If they had reached some indication of what the price might be beyond 2019 and the public service obligation, perhaps they would be in a position to look at the costs and the sorts of reductions that might be necessary thereafter.  I think they have put the cart before the horse.  Mr. Horgan seems confused as he looks at me.  I am saying that he has decided, before meeting ESB or agreeing a contract or a price, that cuts of &euro;24 million are necessary.  He does not yet know what the company's deal with the ESB will be.  He does not know how long that contract will be, how much it will be worth or what effect it will have on the company's costs.  I find that strange.<\/p> <p>  I will conclude by speaking about the mechanisms that were used after that decision was made to seek its implementation.  As I said earlier, Mr. Horgan has much more experience and expertise in the industrial relations area than I have.  He has much more knowledge than I have of the Labour Court, the Labour Relations Commission and all the other mechanisms that are available to resolve issues.  I know, as do the people and communities I represent, that every effort made by the Government and the board over the years to effect change, meet the demands of market change, diversify and alter was done in consultation and consensus with the workforce.  They very seldom went to the Labour Court.  I would have expected that to be the case in this instance and in this period of the company's development, especially with somebody of Mr. Horgan's calibre in the position he is in.  I understand there are nine or ten issues before the Labour Court.  Believe it or not, morale is at an all-time low among the workforce regarding issues of pay and conditions.  I hear a great deal of talk around the country about Dunnes Stores, zero-hour contracts and the difficulty being experienced by workforces in assuring their futures in that company and others.  Many people have been asked or told to reapply for their jobs.  When they have done so, they have found the pay and conditions within Bord na M&oacute;na vastly different from what they were before they reapplied.  Pay cuts of 30% have been applied in some instances.  I find it unbelievable that this has been allowed to evolve.  I ask Mr. Horgan to explain to me, considering the role that he is expected to carry out in the interest of shareholders and as the Government's representative, how it is that almost every question asked of management and staff is ending up in the Labour Court.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015052700002#H00300","speaker":"1101"},{"type":"speech","time":1432718100,"counter":2419,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Cowen.

The answer is \"no, we did not\".  We are required to have regard to Government policy and to comply with it.  Having said that, we let the Minister and the Department know on a continual basis of the effects of carbon tax on our business.  They are continually updated on that.  It is not something we are in a position to take a stance on.  The Government has wider issues to consider with regard to carbon tax than its simple effect on Bord na M&oacute;na.  I assure the committee that the departmental officials and the Minister are continually kept informed of the effect carbon tax has on us.  We work closely with Departments on a continual basis to let them know what the effects of prospective and existing Government policies might be.<\/p> <p>  I was also asked to explain why we are cutting our costs now when we do not know what they will be in 2019.<\/p><p>The answer to that question is that we operate a peat-fired power station.  We know the economics of it.  The two power stations that the ESB operate are broadly similar to our own.  We know what it takes to make our plant competitive and stay in business.  Because we lose the PSO this year, we know what the price of peat has to be from next year going into our power station to make it economic.  In other words, we have a demonstration project.  If we cannot show to the ESB that we can make our project operate commercially, the ESB will not be interested in operating its project on a non-commercial basis.  We have never said that we will ask anyone to operate a power station on a non-commercial basis.  Our job is to make our plant work next year on an economic basis.  When we can demonstrate that to the ESB, then we are in a strong position to say to the ESB that we have done it with ours and therefore the ESB can do it with its project.  We know from our internal analysis what the costs would be; therefore, we know the extent of the cost cutting that has to take place.<\/p><p> The third point raised by Deputy Barry Cowen was about industrial relations practices.  During my time as chairman - it was probably the first time ever - the board asked the management of Bord na M&oacute;na to reach an agreement, a protocol, a broad framework as to how the trade unions and the company would interact.  A protocol was agreed and approved by the trade unions and approved at board level and signed off by the board.  I am not sure if that had ever been done in the history of Bord na M&oacute;na.  The management of the company has been operating in accordance with that protocol ever since.  It is an agreed protocol.  The difficulties that the company and the unions face and the difficulties that face employees are, perhaps, unprecedented, but they have to be tackled.  We cannot just pretend that hard decisions do not have to be taken.  We have honestly and openly put those proposals to our trade unions in accordance with our protocol.  While a number of issues have been through the Labour Court in respect of these changes, I would point out that on every single occasion the Labour Court has found that the company acted in accordance with the protocol agreed and in accordance with good industrial relations practice and has recommended that the employees implement the various changes.  It is not unusual for a company that is going through such a difficult period in readjustment to have difficulties in negotiation and for both parties to use the services provided by the State to help resolve those difficulties.  That is what we have done, and we will continue to do that.  <\/p><p> There was a mention of a 30% cut in pay.  I want to say that no basic pay rates in Bord na M&oacute;na are being cut or proposed to be cut.  Some elements of other allowances and so on are being cut and some people are taking other jobs that are of a lower total remuneration.  That is true.  All of that is being managed carefully through the established procedures and in accordance with the protocol that has been agreed with the trade unions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015052700002#H00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Horgan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1432718100,"counter":2422,"content":"<p>I will allow Deputy Barry Cowen to come in again later, but I now call Deputy Michael Colreavy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015052700002#J00200","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speech","time":1432718100,"counter":2423,"content":"<p>I thank the representatives for appearing before the committee.

I understand that if the weather is bad it can impact peat production.  I also understand that if the weather is good, demand for the product decreases.  There are other opportunities.  Mr. Horgan talked about unregulated fuel imports from Northern Ireland, which seems to imply there is something wrong with this.  What is meant by unregulated fuel imports and what is the impact on Bord na M&oacute;na?  Is there an opportunity for Bord na M&oacute;na to export?I understand the issue of carbon tax.  Mr. Horgan said Bord na M&oacute;na pays 50% of the carbon tax levy on 30% of the market.  That is a startling figure.  What is the basis for that figure, and has it been discussed with anybody?  If I had a business and was paying 50% of a levy when I thought I should be paying 30% I would be asking hard questions.  I am not sure I get the point about private fuels.  People are entitled to private fuel; they always have been and always will be.<\/p><p>Mr. Horgan mentioned that a capital work plan had been introduced.  He stated that this amount had been increased from &euro;1.4 million to &euro;1.8 million in the briquette factories alone.  What is the purpose of the investment plan?  Is it to develop new lines?  Is it to produce more?  Is it to do more with less human input?  What problem is being resolved or what opportunity is being grasped with the increase in capital investment in the briquette factories?<\/p><p>The final issue is one I have been asked to raise at this forum.  I understand that pensioners in the company have recently been informed that there is a shortage in the pension fund and that a levy will be placed on them.<\/p><p>Can Mr. Horgan tell us about the state of health of the pension fund?  How much is going to be levied from the pensioners?  One pensioner to whom I was speaking before the meeting said there appeared to be a lot of management consultants around the place.  What are they doing and how much are they being paid?  If the management consultants were not being paid so much the burden of the levy would not have to be placed on the shoulders of the pensioners.  The same pensioner told me that morale was quite low among workers and pensioners in Bord na M&oacute;na and that it is actually disimproving.  I understand the stresses of industrial relations.  When things are going flyingly well people tend to be happy, while they are unhappy when things are tight.  There used to be a very good process for liaison between management and staff and between management and pensioners, and the welfare of workers and pensioners was always taken into account, but this seems to have dropped off the agenda of the company now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015052700002#J01100","speaker":"1083","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1432718100,"counter":2433,"content":"<p>There are more than 2,000 employees in Bord na M&oacute;na, depending on seasonal factors, and there are 600 pensioners.

Today in Edenderry we are successfully bringing in 330,000 tonnes of biomass, of which 130,000 tonnes are sourced domestically.  The Deputy is absolutely right that there is not enough biomass in the country to supply the power stations or the biomass briquettes we need to produce.  We also need 90,000 tonnes of green waste for our compost in the Kilberry facility.  Given that smokeless coal needs 50,000 tonnes of biomass and that there are some CHP projects on which we are working, in 2020 we will need in the region of 2 million tonnes.  Add to that the two Coillte board factories, which need 800,000 tonnes, we are looking at needing approximately 3 million tonnes in 2020.  However, that should be seen as an opportunity for Bord na M&oacute;na and for this country.  We can develop an international supply chain to deliver that.  The private forestry sector will be bigger than Coillte by 2030 as successive Governments have invested significantly in grants for the private forestry sector, for which we are getting nothing at the moment.  These trees will only come to maturity over the next decade.  We are considering how we can mobilise the private forestry sector and have set ourselves a target whereby 500,000 tonnes of the required 3 million tonnes will come from the domestic private forestry sector.<\/p> <p>  Today we have 650 acres of farmland under willow.  The yields from those 650 acres are surpassing our original expectations and we have a target of 5,000 acres over the next three to four years.  We are working with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Teagasc on that and are confident we will be able to do it.  The vast bulk of supply will come from international sources while the private forestry sector is coming on stream.  The Drax station in the UK, about which Mr. Horgan spoke, imports 6 million tonnes of biomass per annum and supplies it successfully to power stations, supplying 8% of the UK power industry.  It has had a successful conversion on three of its six power stations already.  The scale has been demonstrated internationally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015052700002#L02600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mike Quinn"},{"type":"speech","time":1432718100,"counter":2475,"content":"<p>I welcome the chairman and management of the company and thank them for their presentation.  I want to address three issues but will start with the two principal issues, as I see them, relating to carbon tax and PSO.  Then I want to talk about the relationship between the management of the company and its workforce.  The constituency I represent contains Littleton and Templetuohy, both of which have been very productive and are central to the economic and social life of our area.  Local communities have developed around Bord na M&oacute;na, which is a traditional industry, and relations between the company, the community and its workforce have been very good.<\/p> <p>  According to the presentation the carbon tax is a major influencer of the downturn in the activity of Bord na M&oacute;na.  The public service obligation requirement on the ESB and the financial contribution it makes are also an issue.  These are the two key issues.   Carbon tax was introduced at the insistence of the Green Party during the course of the last Government.  I supported that Government and when the carbon tax was brought in I was approached by the unions and management in Littleton, including the manager at the time, Mr. Ray Yates.<\/p><p>There is a man who is about to retire from the company and who has given fantastic service.  I worked with him over the years as a public representative and he is a big loss to the company.  He enjoyed the confidence of his workforce and is what I would call a proper manager.  I want to put that on the record.  When that issue came up, I raised it directly with the then Minister for Finance, Brian Lenihan, before going to the Taoiseach of the time, Brian Cowen, who was intimately aware of the consequences of the imposition of carbon tax on briquettes.  It was agreed in that budget that there would be a derogation, and that there would be no carbon tax on briquette products.  We moved on then and the current Government has twice slapped a carbon tax on these products, which has made them uncompetitive and is creating a serious problem.<\/p><p> The second issue concerns the public service obligation levy, PSO.  It is not a coincidence that the reduction in the PSO equates to &euro;24 million, while the savings Bord na M&oacute;na is expecting from staff are also approximately &euro;24 million.  What I cannot understand is, the ESB is a very strong company, financially.<\/p><p> We have recently heard - I welcome this publicly because I think it is a good move - the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, announce to much fanfare that the Government was going to invest heavily in initiatives to maximise employment and revitalise local economies in rural areas.  This announcement came after much pressure from rural Deputies like myself, particularly from the Minister's own rural backbench Deputies.  Bord na M&oacute;na is a typical example of a rural-based company.  It is the only opportunity for employment in the areas in which it functions.  Mr. Horgan is appointed by the Government and has a direct link to his line Minister.  I am surprised to hear him say that he has not really got anywhere with carbon tax, apart from the normal submissions he would make to the Minister.  There is a budget coming up again and every lobby group in the country will be making submissions to the Minister.  Mr. Horgan should go through his line Minister to inform the Government of the consequences of its action.  The opportunity exists for him to do so now in advance of this budget, and he should avail of it and put his case very strongly.  He will not just be representing his board, he will be representing the views of the workforce.  Two issues I feel have to be addressed are the PSO and biomass.<\/p><p> We are told biomass briquettes are the way forward and Bord na M&oacute;na has its biomass project.  Will the biomass be available for the production of briquettes or will it be directed to the peat power plants?  Has Bord na M&oacute;na got a five-year plan for the Littleton briquette factory?  I come from a place called Thurles, and over the years we have suffered in that we have lost all our manufacturing industry in that area.  One time we had four sugar factories, but Thurles lost out and eventually all four closed.  We have two briquette factories now, Derrinlough and Littleton, and there is a concern that there is a hidden agenda.  The two may become one and eventually, the one may not exist.  I would like an assurance today on the future of Littleton briquette factory.<\/p><p> Mr. Horgan used what I would consider to be labour commission lingo on how Bord na M&oacute;na is managing the transition and savage cuts that are taking place.  He says a framework and a protocol have been put in place and that the company is carefully managing this exercise.  I am not one to exaggerate and am normally quite calm and measured in what I say.  Although I do not go seeking to meet with the workforce in Littleton, they have come to me.  I have received letters addressed to myself and copied to the chief executive, Ms Lynch and others within the company.  I have no intention of putting that correspondence into the public domain but I hope Bord na M&oacute;na has a mechanism within the company to deal with it adequately.  Some of the content of those letters and messages is frightening and I sincerely hope that not even an element of it is true or accurate.<\/p><p> I would describe Bord na M&oacute;na's situation as being in crisis.  In a time of crisis, resolute action and a plan are needed.  Having met practically all of the membership of the Bord na M&oacute;na workforce in the Littleton-Templetuohy area, either collectively or individually, some of them in my office without the knowledge of their colleagues, there is disillusionment, frustration, anger and huge resentment building up against the management.  People feel the management's method of implementing cuts and cost saving measures is harsh and inhuman - this is why I am talking about this lingo of \"framework\" and \"protocols\".  What we are looking for here is basic decency in terms of how the management deals with people who are working with Bord na M&oacute;na for 25 years.  The workforce of Bord na M&oacute;na has been dedicated, committed and loyal to the company.  We never had this kind of difficulty with industrial disputes; I have never seen such a reaction in my 28 years in politics from the company's workforce.  The management needs to face up to the reality that it, starting with the chairman, has lost the confidence of its workforce.  It needs to address this as a matter of urgency.  <\/p><p> Part of the reason this confidence has been lost is that the workforce does not trust management to have a plan that is achievable, has proper objectives and can deliver sustainable jobs and safeguard the future in these plants.<\/p><p> There is a perception among the workforce that management has squandered money in many of its investments.  Its core business has always been the peat plants.  It has taken its eye off the ball.  The buzzword is diversification and I understand as a commercial person and a businessman why people have to diversify.  However, management must hold sight of what its core business is.  It is still making &euro;50 million profit out of its core business at a time when it has squandered millions on waste management, made bad investments and lost out heavily, spent a fortune on wind farms for which I am not sure what the dividend will be.  From my understanding, Bord na M&oacute;na has also spent tens of millions on consultancy fees and reports, the end product of which nobody seems to know.  Showing its lack of political astuteness, it spent a fortune bidding for Irish Water franchise, lost out on it and dug a big hole in its balance sheet in preparing for it.  I would have thought somebody in the Government or in Bord na M&oacute;na would have realised halfway through that process that the company was not going to get it and that it should desist from it.  That is the perception among the company's workforce at the moment.  The management has lost touch in respect of the kind of expenditure it has in seeking diversification projects that have been expensive.  <\/p><p> I have no problem supporting a management with a difficult job to do and I will support the management of the company.  However, it needs to communicate its message a lot better.  I do not believe that communicating through the Labour Relations Commission is the way to do it.  Why do we have to step away from the old procedures that always worked within Bord na M&oacute;na?  The company now has ten issues at the LRC, of which Mr. Horgan is a former chairman.<\/p><p>I am sure Mr. Horgan, when he was chairman of the Labour Court, did not like having his door opened every other day to deal with spurious claims and issues that should have been resolved locally.  One would expect many issues to be resolved long before they reach the Labour Court.  The majority of the issues arising in Bord na M&oacute;na should have been dealt with by the company's management.  I apologise to the Chairman for taking such a long time but we have reached a crossroads in respect of the future direction of Bord na M&oacute;na.  We need some satisfactory answers and the company needs a solid plan for the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015052700002#L02700","speaker":"962","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1432718100,"counter":2478,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for giving me the opportunity to ask questions.  I will focus on the final slide in the presentation which has the title, Towards 2030.  I propose to address specifically the area of transformation and the work of the organisation in the period until 2030.<\/p> <p>  When Mr. Horgan appeared before the joint committee in September 2012, he stated he was proud to be the chairman of the board of a company that had a management team of exceptional individuals who had the capacity to lead the company to continued success in the years ahead.  Why, in an organisation with a senior management team of exceptional individuals who have a capacity to lead the company, is it necessary to pay such high consultancy costs?  I understand &euro;14 million was wasted on consultancy fees last year.  Precisely how much has been spent on consultants since Mr. Horgan's appointment as chairman three years ago?<\/p> <p>  Bord na M&oacute;na staff are facing lay-offs and being bullied into accepting new contracts.  They are being told that if they do not surrender their current contracts and sign new contracts, they will be left with nothing.  The new contracts provide for salary reductions of up to 30%.  Are senior managers in the company also facing reductions in salary of 30%? <\/p> <p>  At our meeting in September 2012, Mr. Horgan also stated that one of the key roles of a chairman is to organise discussion and ensure board members are informed.  Why has he prevented the managing director from meeting the four directors elected by employees, especially given the challenges facing the company and the key role these directors have in facilitating solutions to these challenges?  Why has Mr. Horgan imposed such restrictions on the elected directors engaging with employees, thereby preventing the necessary feedback to the board?<\/p> <p>  At the meeting on 20 September 2012 at which Mr. Horgan described his key role as being one of organising discussion and ensuring board members were informed, he was also asked about staff morale in Bord na M&oacute;na.  Like Deputy Lowry, I have been contacted by a number of Bord na M&oacute;na employees living in Lanesboro, Rochfortbridge and further afield.  If what they tell me is correct, it is nothing short of disgraceful that such events are occurring in a semi-State company.  When asked about staff morale in 2012, Mr. Horgan stated he was aware of issues but did not necessarily agree with them.  I am informed that up to 300 cases of alleged bullying are in process.  If that is not a serious indication of morale in Bord na M&oacute;na, I do not know what is. <\/p> <p>  I was asked a question about a specific investigation involving an employee that involves serious deficiencies, including lack of due procedure and courtesy.  As previous speakers noted, these types of cases were not the norm in Bord na M&oacute;na.  People whose families worked in the company for generations speak of family members who always had great pride in the company.  However, speaking to workers nowadays, it is clear that pride is the furthest thing from their minds when they think of the company.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015052700002#N00200","speaker":"1065"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1432718100,"counter":2479,"content":"<p>Deputy Troy alleged that &euro;14 million was wasted on consultant costs in a particular year.

All board members are treated equally and it has never been alleged to me by any board member that he or she was not treated equally.

Our intention and strong belief, because we have put a great deal of research and development into this, is that those briquettes will be successful and we will begin over the next 24 months to convert the briquette factories to a biomass briquette.

As I and other Deputies have said, the issue at hand for many members of staff is that they are being asked to reapply for their jobs and the pay and conditions in the contract associated with that job are very different from those they had the day before they applied.

It is right that the board is responsible and takes ownership of the overall framework within which negotiations take place but I as chairman do not get involved in the detailed nitty gritty of negotiation.  That is a matter for the company negotiators.  It would be entirely inappropriate for me as chairman to ask whether they can offer a bit here or there.  I do not do that and will not do it.<\/p> <p>  I do not agree that the company has operated outside the agreed protocol.  This is a fully unionised company.  The trade unions represent the employees fully and we have people who engage full time with the trade unions on all these issues.  I know the negotiations are done in a proper way with the trade unions.  The issue is put forward to them.  Of course sometimes a company proposes something and is prepared to concede on aspects of it and that is what bargaining is about.  One listens to what the other side says and withdraws some of the harsher measures and trades them for others because that is the way negotiations operate.  I am not going to comment on whether there was a proposal to reduce anyone&rsquo;s pay by 30%.  If there was it may have been part of a negotiating proposal.

If someone has a fixed income coming in every week or every month, he or she depends on it, and a reduction would have a big impact.

If we include something that is resolved at local level at first instance, as most disputes are, then maybe 1% of issues go to the Labour Court.  When does an issue become a dispute?  If I have a disagreement with my manager, and I talk to him about it and we resolve it, that is a dispute that has been resolved locally.  If we include that in the proportion, then I would say maybe 1% of disputes get raised to the highest level.<\/p> <p>  If we include the proportion of issues that are discussed nationally with the trade unions and then go further, I do not know, but it is probably something like 20%.  However, I would not have that kind of intimate knowledge of how those things are resolved.  Lots of things get resolved in the corridor, presumably, between the union official, the negotiators and the HR department.  Most things are done in that sort of way, although there is also a formal process.<\/p> <p>  If the Deputy's question is related to the proposals the company made as part of the transformation process, in some areas, some of those have been entirely.  For example, the financial shared services issue has been resolved and that is operating with, as far as I am aware, no outstanding issues on that side.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the transformation process on the peat production side, as I understand it, the unions have adopted the position, which we are quite happy to go along with, that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.  There is a large number of issues - up to 20 or 30, depending on how one defines them.  We have been through the first round of discussion with the unions and our proposals have been put to the unions on all of those on the basis that nothing would be agreed until everything is agreed.  The unions then asked us for time to consider those and asked that they would employ consultants - which we paid for, of course - to have a look at and help them with the proposals.  Those consultants took some time and produced a report for the trade unions.  On the basis of that and other information, the unions then asked us for a further extension of the time they had agreed in order to prepare an alternative plan.  We said we were happy to listen to their alternative plan.<\/p> <p>  This morning, at this very moment, the trade unions are presenting their alternative plan to us in the Labour Relations Commission, as agreed.  We will look at all of those alternative proposals to see whether they can be accommodated.  If they can be accommodated, we will be happy to do that.  However, the unions have agreed with us that the bottom line is the savings must be made.  They are proposing alternative ways of arriving at the savings and we have said to them we will be happy to accept their alternatives, provided they are real savings and will add up to what we want to do.<\/p> <p>  That is the proper strategy for the company to have adopted.  I fully accept that other Deputies would say another approach ought to have been adopted.  The proposal we have adopted is in accordance with the protocol and with good industrial relations practice.  In so far as the detail is concerned, I am happy that it is correct but I have not been, and will not be, involved in the nitty-gritty of it.  On the broad picture, I think we are doing what we intended to do.  I want to emphasise that every step taken in the Labour Relations Commission has been agreed at the Labour Relations Commission, except that the unions have asked us on two occasions to extend a deadline they had agreed to, and we agreed to extend the deadline twice in the interests of hearing their point of view.<\/p> <p>  I have no problem in defending the company's position in regard to that strategy.  I think it is the right one for us to have adopted and if other Deputies think that another strategy should have been adopted that the unions did not agree to, they are free to put that forward, but it is not one that has been agreed.  I want to emphasise this point.  We have moved at every stage throughout this negotiation with the agreement of the trade unions as to the stages that we would go through.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015052700002#R02200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Horgan"},{"type":"speech","time":1432718100,"counter":2550,"content":"<p>I had a question about forced redundancies and people having to reapply for jobs, and the kind of impression that exists in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015052700002#R02300","speaker":"1099"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1432718100,"counter":2551,"content":"<p>Again, proposals have been made.

The people there have been told this.  Some have decided to leave the company, others have been re-employed in other jobs and some people have taken jobs at lower salaries - that is true.  We cannot give a guarantee that once a person has a particular job, they will maintain it forever, nor can we say that if we have another job that warrants a lower rate of pay, we will give an employee the higher rate of pay just because he or she happens to have it.
